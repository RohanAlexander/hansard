I shall communicate with the honourable gentleman later this morning. the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture been direeted to a decision by thc Tjnited States Department of Agriculture to request American farmers to reduce the autumn planting of next year's wheat crop by 8 pcr cent.? What action does he propose to take in respect of Australia ? report to that efTect, but I have no official knowledge of the matter. I am taking steps to obtain official confirmation of the report, which indicates that the American Secretary for Agriculture has stated that, if America grows an excess crop of wheat, problems of storage and surplus and, subsequently, of price may confront American farmers. I aay without hesitation to Australian farmers that, as Australia is practically the only producer in the world of wheat that is sold for sterling, and as there is an avid demand for sterling wheat, due to a shortage of dollars, they need have no fear that there will not be a ready sale at a satisfactory price of the biggest wheat crop they are capable of growing this year. for Commerce and Agriculture whether he will keep uppermost in his mind, during negotiations in connection with the future of wheat marketing, the need for a continuance of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Eund, which now operates under wheat tax legislation passed by this Parliament? policy is that theTc shall be an extension of wheat stabilization, if the wheat growers, desire it, oh terms negotiated by the Australian and State governments and the wheat-growers' organizations.

I assure the honourable member that the point he has raised will not only be in mymind during the negotiations, but also be discussed freely with the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. absence of the Prime Minister, I address to the Treasurer a question about a breach of official secrecy in connection with the announcement of the appointment of the new Governor General. I ask this question,' as I asked a similar question last Tuesday, because importance is attached to the tracking down of persons guilty of breaches of official secrecy. Did Her Majesty the Queen fix the night of Tuesday, the 2nd September, in London and the morning of Wednesday, the 3rd September, in Australia as the times for the announcement of the appointment of the new Governor General? Was the appointment announced in Australia on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 2nd September? Had the Prime Minister made a confidential statement to Cabinet that morning, and was the fact that he made such a statement reported on Tuesday afternoon? Could the disclosure of the appointment of Sir William Slim have been made by any one in possession of the information otherwise than in a breach of his official duty and in betrayal should be tabled or not. At the moment, of the trust of Her Majesty? nature and the length of the question asked by the honourable gentleman, it is obvious that he should place it on the notice-paper. I ask him, in doing so, to render assistance in obtaining a satisfactory answer by stating whether the previous Government was able to ascertain where the leak occurred with regard to the appointment of the present Governor General. 144 1 to the Minister acting for the Minister for Labour and National Service by referring to a matter raised earlier in the week by the honourable member for Lang. It deals with the proposed closure of the immigrant workers' hostel at the former military camp at Wallgrove, which is in my electorate. Is the Minister in a position to state whether the Government plans to use this establisliment for other purposes at an early date? the immigrant centre at Wallgrove has been closed, mainly because of difficulties in connection w.ith transport. The occupants of the centre have been transferred to St. Mary's and Villawood. Although the Department of the Army is acquainted with the fact that the centre is no longer used as an immigrant hostel, it is too early to say what plans the Army has for future use of the centre. ter acting for the Minister for Immigration make available to the House a copy of the agreement recently signed by the Minister for Immigration and the West German Government at Bonn, to which the honourable gentleman referred in the House last week? If he is not able to do so, will he undertake that immediately he receives information in connection with this matter he will make it available to the House? has just come to hand, and I have not yet had an opportunity to study it in detail. I am not quite aware of the convention in such matters, and I am not sure whether agreements of the kind I see no objection to doing so. However. I shall have the matter investigated and shall acquaint the honourable gentleman of the result. for the Minister for Immigration whether it is a fact .that one in every eighteen persons now admitted to mental institutions in New South Wales is a new Australian?

I speak subject to correction in this matter. I immediately had the matter investigated, and I ascertained that the ratio of new Australians admitted to mental institutions in Australia is not greater than the comparable ratio among the indigenous population. In fact, the figures indicate that the ratio among new Australians is somewhat smaller than the ratio among the remainder of the population. That Ls natural, because in our screening abroad of intending immigrants we concentrate on the health, including mental health, of the people who are to be admitted to the country. A further discovery that I made, or, at least, a reasonable inference which I drew from the facts that I obtained, was that the majority of the hew Australians who have been admitted to mental institutions are people who came to this country under the displaced persons scheme, which was instituted by the previous Government and continued by this Government, but which has now ceased to operate. It is not unnatural that people who were rescued from the tragic conditions that these people came from should perhaps suffer from mental instability to a greater degree than do people who had not undergone the dreadful experience to which they had been subjected. I assure the honourable member that we are watching the position very carefully. LONG BA YBIFLE EANGE. the Army reconsider a previous decision meeting of a little time ago. As is in relation to the removal of the generally known, provision is contained Long Bay rifle range to a site in the ANZUS treaty for collaboration farther out in the country?

At the moment I have no first-hand information about it, although I know that recently the Canberra fire brigade purchased a 120-ft. ladder. However, I do not think that its use would be necessary in .fighting fires in hostels. As far as I am aware, proper fire-fighting provision has been made at the hostels and hotels in Canberra, but I shall further examine the position. for External Affairs inform me whether it is true that the United Kingdom is most resentful of the fact that it has been excluded from the ANZUS pact and that it considers that it should be at least entitled to be represented by observers at all future discussions between representatives of New Zealand, the United States of America and Australia in matters relating to the Pacific region? If that be so, does the Australian Government propose to sponsor a movement with the object of having the United Kingdom represented, either fully or as an observer, at all future discussions between the three signatories to the pact?",13,Immigration

I am not aware of any resentment on the part of Great Britain. It is perfectly clear that both New Zealand and Australia and, for that matter, the United States of America also, will keep the United Kingdom completely informed of all activities in respect of the implementation of the length on more than one occasion, however, the three signatories to the treaty generally believe that, for the time being, the membership should remain on it3 original basis until we have had sufficient experience of the working of the treaty to enable us to know more about it. What the future holds after that in respect of the treaty is a matter that the future itself will determine.. Supply aware that there are in Australia very great surpluses of canned foodstuffs, and that food processors are finding considerable difficulty in securing satisfactory but, if he wants me to confirm them, 1 and adequate markets? Has the Minister considered purchasing additional supplies of tinned foodstuffs for the armed services in order to maintain primary production ? that there is more canned food in Australia than is usual, but I do not know how correct it is. With reference to the honourable member's suggestion that canned food surpluses should be ta.ken over by the armed forces^ I remind him that the Department of Supply, acting on behalf of the various services, makes its purchases of food in advance of needs. It would be very difficult, therefore, because of existing commitments and arrangements, to buy extra foodstuffs. However, I shall examine the matter and ascertain whether there is a serious surplus of canned foodstuffs,' and secondly, whether anything can be done on the lines suggested by the honourable member. now a surplus of certain kinds of steel in tliis country, fencing materials urgently required by primary producers are still scarce. Will the Minister for Supply investigate, this matter with a view to ensuring that the production of fencing materials.shall be increased? within the jurisdiction of the Minister for National Development to whose notice I shall direct the honourable member's question and from whom I shall obtain a reply as soon as possible. Mr W. M . BOURKE -Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say whether it is true that the number of operational farms in Australia declined by more than 10,000 from 253,536, in 1939 to 24.3,626, in 1950-51? When the Minister said yesterday that there are 40,000 fewer farm workers in Australia to-day than there were twenty years ago did he include self-employed farmers, or was he referring only to employees in rural industries? with the statistics contained in the first part of the honourable member's question, shall be glad to do so. Speaking from memory but with confidence, I should say that the figures cited by me yesterday did include self-employed farmers. ter for Supply a question about the alleged Korean war veteran who is out of work. I realize that the Minister has already given information to the House on this subject but, in view of the reception given to his statements by certain honourable members, I should like to know whethnr he has any further information that he can give to the House, and whether there is any way in which this matter may be finally settled. information at the moment, but there will be no difficulty at all in ascertaining whether the allegation that a former Korean soldier is out of work is true ov not.

If the persons in question were found guilty of an offence of that na ure If should say, speaking off-hand, that the Government would most certainly take appropriate action. Whether it would take action merely because somebody has expressed the opinion that they had been guilty of such an offence, is another matter which I should like to investigate more closely before I commit myself.

Is the proposal supported? Eight honourable members having risen in support of the proposal, [10.59] -In recent weeks there has been a spate of daily press publicity indicating that the Government intends to dispose of the Commonwealth shipping line. I have a file of such reports from which it is evident that the Government has that intention firmly in mind. Having regard to the manner in which Government interests in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited were sold with little or no publicity, the Government's intention to dispose of them not even having been disclosed to the right honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Hughes), who was one of the directors and originators of the company, in this instance the press is no doubt serving a very useful purpose. The people are now witnessing the spectacle of another attempt on the part of the Government to sacrifice the people's property to private interests. How far the Government is prepared to go to serve private interests is illustrated by its action in hawking the Commonwealth shipping line to attract the highest bid, if, indeed, a high bid can be attracted from any source. As the number of sources from which any bid, let alone a high bid, can be extracted, are very few, the sale if it is made will be a bargain sale for the benefit of the buyers.

The only effective protection against unduly high freights and fares at present in existence can thus be instantly removed, and those who must be protected, and they include all sections of the people, would be exposed to exploitation. Australia needs a Commonwealth shipping line to keep the predatory instincts and methods of the shipping barons in check. It needs it to meet the requirements which inevitably arise when the country is called upon to defend itself, and it is imperative that it should have for its o\vn immediate use and protection a shipping industry capable of building vessels which will not only meet the needs of commerce, but also be able to supply our forces in any emergency. The Labour party is not prepared to accept the principle that Australia's shipping should be left wholly to private business interests, particularly to a section of the business community that has never failed to use its powers of exploitation to keep freights and fares at the highest possible level that the public could pay. Much has been made of the losses said to have been incurred in the operations of the Commonwealth shipping line. The line is stated to have lost the sum of approximately £6,500,000 between 194S and 1952. The fact is that while that book-keeping loss has been featured and given a good deal of , publicity in the press, the saving in freight, which cannot be accurately estimated, probably amounts to between £40,000,000 and £50,000,000. If this line should be sold, freights would increase and add to the already excessive cost of goods. Let us ask ourBelves who would benefit from the sale of Commonwealth ships. Certainly not the people, because they would then be completely at the mercy of the shipping combine, which would be free from the restraints imposed by the existence of a Commonwealth-owned and operated shipping line. Certainly not those employed in the industry, because they would become less certain of continuous employment. Certainly not those whose business requires them to use the ships for travelling and the carriage of merchandise, because they would be exploited by Mr Drakeford. having to pay unduly heavy fares and freights. Such persons are protected from impositions of this kind while the Commonwealth shipping line remains in operation. The interests that would benefit from the sale of the Commonwealth ships are the big shipping concerns that would eventually buy the line. The Commonwealth ships have been hawked everywhere, as can be perceived by a perusal of the daily press. surely does not believe everything that -he reads in the press! tlie press raises a continuous cry, of the kind that we have recently heard, about the Commonwealth ships, it is obvious that information as to the Government's intention has leaked out from Cabinet from time to time. Those who will benefit from the sale of Commonwealth ships will be confined to the small section of selfish people who, while subscribing to ancl advocating the principle that competition is the life of trade, are busily devoting all their energies to preventing real competition from finding its way into the Australian shipping industry. The sale of valuable government assets took place on previous occasions at a sacrifice, and despite that sacrifice the Government did not receive payment in full. That must not happen again. As far as we can help to prevent that from happening, we shall do so. The matter of the continuation of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers was inquired into by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts as long ago as 1926. In its very interesting interim report, the committee statedIn view, however, of emphatic evidence placed before thc committee tliat, owing to the uncertainty which exists concerning the continuance of the Australian Coiiimomvenlth Line ot Steamers which is similar to the position to-dayits business has been adversely affected, the Committee has deemed it desirable tu submit to Parliament, prior to the approaching recess, this Interim Keport. To arrive at a decision, apart from the question of Government Policy, as to whether the CommonweaUh Government Line should be continued, tliere must be considered what benefits have accrued to the country by the establishment of the Line, and whether such benefits",17,Shipping
42,Mr Beam,The honourable member,18,Shipping
43,Mr Dbakefobd,"No, but whenhave outweighed any fimuicial loss incurred as a result of its trading operations. The evidence so far placed before the Committee indicates that not only has the Commonwea.tli Line been directly responsible for actual reductions in freights, but that the presence of the Line has exerted a material restraining influence against proposed increases. I consider that to be a very important factor. The interim report continuedWhilst it is difficult, in fact, almost impossible, owing to the many factors to be considered, to indicate in figures the actual gain to Australia by such action, it appears to the Committee, from the evidence already heard, that the shippers and primary producers of Australia have derived much benefit from the establishment of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Thc Cominittee, therefore, recommends that, in the interests of Australia, the Line be continued. That interim report was furnished on the 10th August, 1926, when the Joint Committee on Public Accounts was presided over by Sir Granville Eyrie, M . P. The committee was not predominantly Labour. It was composed of six members of the United Australia party-as the Liberal party was then called-the e members of the Australian Country party, and four members of the Labour party. A later report that was produced under a different chairman-as Sir Granville Eyrie had been nicely placed away by being appointed H i g h Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdomi n 1927 -modifie d that decision. The personnel on the committee was altered also, by the appointment of Mr G. H . Francis, M.P. appointment. present Minister for the Army( Mr Francis). Senator Walter Kingsmill was appointed as chairman. effect was then evidently obtained, as the report of the 6th May, 1927, contained the following paragraph:Having regard to all the circumstances, therefore, tbe Committee is of the opinion that the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers should not be retained as a direct Governmental activity. Liberal as well as Labour members had subscribed to the interim report. A minority report that was signed by the three Labour members of the committee at that time, which accompanied the report of the 6th May, 1927, contained this passageWe consider it to be of paramount importance to Australia that the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers should be retained for the following reasons: The Line has been, and still ia. a controlling factor in regulating freight rates on exports from Australia to the United Kingdom and imports to Australia from the Tjnited Kingdom. That was the very valuable purpose that the line v/as f u l f ill in g at that time. The main report-no t the interim report -containe d the following paragraph:. In submitting this recommendation, however, the Committee recogni/.es that this line of steamers is an asset belonging to Australia Honourable members should not forget that observationand the Committee has carefully considered how the Line sliould be disposed of in a manner which would preserve to Australia the good effects it has exercised in the preservation of rearonah'e freights and fares between Australia and the United Kingdom. The following passage should, be brought to the attention of .the public:The influence for good or evil of world shipping upon the prosperity and the commercial development of nations is too evident a fact to need lengthy discussion, more particularly in these latter days when the agglomerative tendencies which have made themselves felt in this particular branch of commerce havo resulted in the formation of huge shipping combines of world-wide activities whose underlying motives are often far from being altruistic and occasionally fail to be even patriotic. was a good The committee realized that the shipping combine had to be very closely watched. He was not the I hope that the Government w ill show its interest in the public welfare by watching the combine closely now and refusing to The desired sell out to it . When the Government shipping line is wiped out, the ship-building industry w ill languish and inevitably disappear, for shipping interests have never been famous for their patriotism, when patriotism has conflicted with their commercial interests, and have always placed their orders for ships in the cheapest markets. The only responsible authority that can be depended on to keep the industry at a reasonable level so that it may be readily expanded for defence purposes is the Government. If the proposed transaction",18,Shipping
44,Mr Mcbkide,That,19,Shipping
45,Mr Drakefokd,"takes, place and the Government finds a way in which the interests that appear to be pressing for the disposal of the line of ships can be satisfied, a way can and will be found eventually to restore to the people, without imposing upon them the penalty of a huge financial sacrifice, the invaluable asset that will have been taken from them. The Government's proposal should awaken the conscience of any elector who has mistakenly voted for it in the past. In the absence of any clear statement to the contrary by the Government, it can be assumed reasonably that this great national asset has been put up for sale. If , finally, a sale takes place and the facts are fully exposed to public inspection and understanding, this Government will go down in disgrace, not only as one that failed to keep its promises, but also as one that sacrificed the interests of the people to the point of plundering the public purse. Territories) [11.12] -The bonorable ford) has submitted for discussion ""a definite matter importance"". When an honorahle member takes that course of action and, with the support of his colleagues, interrupts the business of the country for a period of two hours, one is entitled to ask whether the subject that has been raised is really one of urgent public importance. I must say that I noticed an absence of any note of urgency in the honourable member's speech. It was rather a gentle and chiding complaint which went on and on and expressed concern and anxiety, but which certainly at no stage revealed the least note of urgency or any suggestion that this matter could not wait until to-morrow, next week, or, perhaps, next month. The honourable member seemed to be making a plea for the survival of an institution of which he personally was rather fond, something which he and his colleagues had created and which they had hoped, at the time of creation, might be useful. Although the honourable gentleman did not find it within his capacity to make out a case that the Government line of ships was still useful or was serving any particular purpose, he argued, because the Labour party had hoped that it would be useful, that we should not destroy it or disturb it in any way. The honourable member's speech revealed very clearly the hasic difference in outlook between the Government and the Opposition. The honourable member has made his gentle complaints and his chiding plea for the survival of the shipping line because he is a socialist. He wants governments to o w everything and to manage everything. Eveni f State institutions do not operate very efficiently, and even if they spoil something in the process, he still thinks that the Government should continue to own everything and run everything no matter whether it serves a good or a bad purposeWhether or not the ships provide a good service, whether or not they serve the best interests of the taxpayer and of commerce, is of much less importance to him than that the Government should own and run ships. To honourable members opposite, socialism is an end in itself. The Government ownership and operation of transport is an end in itself and even if it will do no good for the Government to run ships of urgent public the socialists still think that it should own and run them. Being a socialist, the honourable member for Maribyrnong complaiued and was fearful that any one should ask whether or not it was really necessary for the Government to use uip public funds in order to meet losses which must be borne by the taxpayer in order to operate a shipping line. The honourable member did not entertain for a moment the possibility that the same ends might be served more efficiently and cheaply and in the better interests of the country by other means. This Government is not a socialist government and it is quite obvious that we do not believe that socialism is an end in itself. We do not believe that the Government should own everything, control everything and run everything. We have a faith, as a non-socialist government, that the people, given a fair chance to use their energy and initiative, can carry on production and trading activities rather better than. can a government instrumentality. We believe that there is a limit to what a. government should try to do and",19,Shipping
46,Mr Hasluck (Curtin,Minister for,20,Shipping
47,Member For Maribyrnong ( Mr Drake,"that there is no call to-day for the Governnient to engage in activities which, subject to the law and the requirements, of society, can be carried out quite well by private enterprise. In other words, we are not socialists. That is the whole difference between honourable members opposite and the Government in this matter. On the one hand there is a complete faith in socialism and a belief that socialism is an end in itself; on our side there is a faith that there are some things that private enterprise can do better than governments. It is quite natural that the Government should explore the possibilities of being quit of the Commonwealth shipping line. We make no secret of that. It might be easy for a socialist government, like the late Labour Government, to find pride in the fact that it is running a socialist activity, even if it is running it badly. But when a government that is not bound down by socialist theory find's that it has a shipping line, which has lost £6,000,000 in the last three years, do honourable members expect it to say, "" We must hang on to that"" ? Because we are not socialists, wt look at the facts of the matter and ask ourselves, "" Is this the way in which the Australian coast can be adequately served with shipping? Must we go on losing £6,000,000 every three years for a socialist theory ?"" We are not bound by the theory. Why should we subscribe to it? Quite rightly and properly this Government started to explore the. possibilities in order to see whether there was any better way of running the coastal shipping services than running a. socialist, line that I have stated:-the maintenance of at a loss, not ensuring a very good service and causing both the taxpayer and commerce, to pay the penalty of the application of a theory. The people of Australia know where we stand. At the last general election we stated that we had no faith in socialism. The people of Australia voted for us knowing that we were a non-socialist government. SoI say that this Government makes no secret of the fact that it is exploring the possibility of being quit of the Commonwealth shipping line. But I want to make it abundantly clear to all honourable members and to the country that while this Government is exploring the possibility of effecting the sale of Commonwealth ships, it has also set before itself from the start certain principles which it regards as fundamental and which it insists must be safeguarded in any sale of those ships. The first principle is this: The Government recognizes that there exists at the present time a need to modernize the ships trading on the Australian coast, to increase the size of .the'fleet, and to make coastal transport more efficient. We seek to ensure that in any sale which may take place, the ships sold shall be retained on the coast, adequate services will be maintained on the coast, and public interest will be served through active competition. Secondly, we recognize that we have a responsibility, as a Government, for ensuring that services shall be provided for remote parts of the Australian continent, such as the Northern Territory, and shall be maintained to those parts of Australia, such as Tasmania, which depend on shipping as the main form of transport. Thirdly, we recognize, and affirm, the need to maintain in Australia an efficient shipbuilding industry. That, too, is basic to our exploration of this subject. This Government has placed orders with Australian shipbuilding yards for twenty cargo vessels. That is an indication of the importance which we place on the Australian shipbuilding industry. The fourth point is that this Government recognizes that it is a part of the responsibility of a government to ensure that the conditions of operation of privately-owned ships shall conform ,to the requirements of public interest. Subject to those four principles adequate services, the serving, of the remote parts of the Commonwealth, the maintenance of an efficient shipbuilding industry and the maintenance of proper conditions in Australian coastal shipping -the Australian Government is exploring the possibility of selling Commonwealth ships, and we make no secret about it, or about the efficiency with which we are trying to carry out that purpose. [Quorum formed.'] The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), who directed attention to the state of the House, has emphasized the point that I made at the commencement of my brief remarks, namely, that there is no urgency about this matter. Members of the Opposition are so disinterested that they do not attend in the House to listen to the debate. Opposition mernbers interjecting, must proceed without interjections. I will not warn honourable members again that silence must be maintained. by saying this: The Government is exploring the possibility of selling the Commonwealth-owned ships. present time, no offers are before the Government for the purchase of the vessels. We shall continue to explore the possibility, and, in doing so, we shall try to safeguard in every respect those four principles that I have stated, and which, we consider, are in the best interests of the Australian public. We see no merit in socialistic activity as such, and the real difference that divides the Opposition from ourselves on this occasion is simply that honourable members opposite are socialists, and we are not. Opposition) [11.24] -The Government spokesman in this debate is the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck). He has not really dealt with the problem under consideration. He has not answered the question that is being asked throughout Australia : Is the Government endeavouring to sell the Commonwealth-owned ships? The Minister has simply told the House that no offer has been received, but the Government has not failed to inform the people that it would like to sell the ships. The Minister has merely indicated that if the Government is offered any sort of a price for the ships, it will probably sell that great asset of the Australian people. It is useless for the Government to nominate a spokesman and then to say that the matter can be determined simply by the use of the term "" socialism "". < The platform of the Labour party is clear on this matter. party's policy and practice have been to use the ownership of the community in certain cases to prevent exploitation of the people, for defence purposes in time of emergency or to keep private monopoly in Australia controlled. The question that is becoming more pressing every day is whether the people of Australia believe that some of the nation's greatest industries should be controlled by private monopoly. That means control by groups or combinations which do not compete with each other and which have the complete right to charge what they like and to restrict competition as they may desire. The Government will not avoid the question by using general phrases. It must come to the point. What was the situation in the AiisAt the tra.lian shipping industry when World War II . began ? Our mercantile fleet was completely inadequate for our population and its needs. That was recognized by the Menzies government of the day. The shipbuilding industry of Australia, which was vital to defence and to interstate and overseas trade, had been allowed to languish. Great dockyards like those at Sydney and Cockatoo Island were allowed to become virtual ruins. ruin. Australia is dependent on sea transport. It must have a large and efficient mercantile marine fleet available always for overseas and interstate trade. That was the policy of the Chifley Government. It did not seek to exclude private enterprise from that field. It is well known that no attempt was made to do so. On the contrary, the people were served efficiently because there-wa3 a dual shipping service composed of government and privately owned ships. The Chifley Government found, however, that private enterprise would not meet the needs of distant States, including Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce) has informed the The Labour House that sufficient ships of the combine could not be provided to l if t sugar and the Commonwealth ships had to do the work. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) has estimated that the Commonwealth shipping line, by its effect",20,Shipping

A combine of shipping interests vvould have been determined, quite correctly from its point of view, to extract the highest degree of profit from freights. This shipping line has made an enormous contribution to the trade and commerce of Australia. I do not kuow the attitude that will now be adopted by Government who represent constituencies in Tasmania, and central and northern Queensland, but I know that not long ago they joined with a deputation, led by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), which asked the Government not to dispose of the Commonwealth ships. I understand that the reply they received at that time was not unfavorable. If Australia is to develop as a nation, ing in Amalgamated Wireless (Australif its commerce is to expand and, above all, if its defence is to be secured, we must have a large mercantile fleet. Not all of it need be government-owned, but a government line of steamers must remain an important auxiliary of it. When major Japanese war criminals were being tried for plotting a war of aggression, documents were produced which clearly indicated the policy of Japan after the war. Even while the Japanese leaders were preparing a campaign of aggression against Pearl Harbour and Malaya, the fixed policy of the Japanese Government was to expand to the south after the war and that policy was approved by the Privy Council of Japan and by the Emperor. It was emphasized that, in order to implement such a policy, a synthetic oil industry would have to be established in Japan, and the mercantile fleet greatly enlarged. That is exactly the policy of the Japanese Government now. During the war, our mercantile fleet suffered heavy losses from Japanese submarines, and our sailors made great sacrifices. It is now apparent that tbe Commonwealth shipping line is on the auction block. Any one may make an offer for it, but I sincerely hope that no one will. If the line were sold, it would be the duty of the Australian people, under a different government, to rearm themI believe the selves with a similar asset. When we look the facts in the face, and have regard to the situation in the Pacific, it becomes clear that government control of a shipping line is of tremendous importance, not for the sake of establishing a government monopoly, but for the defence of Australia, and for the preservation and expansion of our trade. During the last twelve months, under the management of supporters Mr C. M. Dewey, who was appointed by the Chifley Governnient, the Commonwealth shipping line has shown a profit of £700.000. The full figures are not yet available, but it is clear that efficiency has been maintained. The Government is to be condemned for selling the assets of the people. The Glen Davis project has already gone,, and Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited is to go. The Government's holdasia) Limited, a firm vitally associated with the electronic industry, and, therefore, with the defence of the country, were thrown onto the market. The people are not in favour of governments entering all industries, but governments must enter certain key industries in order to protect the national interests. Because the honourable member for Maribyrnong is well aware of that, he has brought this matter before the House for discussion in order to learn, if possible, the intentions of the Government. For my part, I could not glean anything from the extraordinary speech of the Minister for Territories. I do not now know the intentions of the Government. It appears, however, that the private, shipping companies are not interested in buying the Commonwealth line. I hope that they will, continue to be uninterested, and that the people will retain this valuable asset. for Supply) [11.34] -It is not surprising that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) did not glean anything from the speech of the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck). He was so busy lashing himself into a fury with his own tail",22,Shipping
55,Mr Beale (Parramatta,"Ministe rthat he was in no condition to pay attention towhat was being said. Surely, this must be the most curious motion ever submitted in the House. It is based on the supposition that the Government is about to sell the Commonwealth shipping line, but as the Minister has explained, there has been no offer for the ships at, as they say, a bargain price. If I may mix my metaphors, that case can be likened to Hamlet without a Prince, a funeral without a corpse orI am sure one or two honourable gentlemen opposite will appreciate thisa wake without whisky, because there is no such proposal. Therefore, the case falls to the ground. I suppose honourable gentlemen opposite really mean that, despite every argument to the contrary that can be advanced, the Commonwealth shipping line should not be sold in any circumstances. They are taking the socialist view that the ships must be run by the Government. They are saying, in effect, "" It does not matter whether the ships could be run more efficiently by private enterprise; it does not matter whether the Government could get a walloping big price for them; it does not matter whether, by the sale of the ships, onr shipbuilding industry could he made more 1 secure; it does not matter whether the ships could be. sold on terms favorable to the. country; and it does not matter whether the millions of pounds that would be obtained for them, if they were sold, could be applied much more usefully in other sections of our economy for the expansion and development of Australia. None of those things matter. Because the Commonwealth owns a shipping line^ and because the Labour party established a socialist shipping line, at all costs that line must continue under government control "". That attitude explains why a Labour administration is financially disastrous: to the country. Let me cite to the House some figures that relate to this shipping line. It lost £1,723,000 in 194'7, £2,263,000 in. 1948,. and £2,037,000 in 1949. The total loss from 1947 to 1949 was £6,023,000. That is the record of the Commonwealth sh'^mng line under Labour administration. Opposition members interjecting, Mr Beale. jections do not cease, I shall take action, The action will be prompt and decisive. business administration that we have had under Labour governments. The reason why those losses were incurred is that Labour governments approach the administration of business undertakingsand the Commonwealth shipping line is a business undertaking-in a doctrinaire spirit. They say that, at all costs, we must continue to operate the ships as a socialist enterprise, even though the taxpayers may be ruined in the process. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) produced a pitiful and pathetic alibi. He came to the table and read a speech that I do not think he himself believed. Certainly he did not deliver it in a convincing manner. The alibi is that the loss of £6,000,000 does not matter, because we have saved on freight charges. I describe that as the most arrant piece of rubbish that has been uttered in this House during this week-and during the last few days we have listened, to. a lot of rubbish uttered by honourable gentlemen opposite. The alibi that, although we are losing money on the Commonwealth shipping line, we. are savingupon freight charges, will not stand a minute's examination. The Opposition says, in effect, that, we should use a big steam hammer to crack a tiny peanut. It says that we should run the Commonwealth shipping line at a loss of £6,000,000 in order to keep freight rates down. Any child knows that if the Commonwealth wants to control interstate freight rates on the Australian coast, it has at its disposal many means of doing so other than that. The Government has approached this matter from the viewpoint of the best interests of the Australian economy. If the Commonwealth ships could be better employed in other hands, we do not see why necessarily they should be kept in the hands of the Government. The Minister for Territories has said quite clearly that the ships will not be sold unless the outports are safeguarded, services at least as good as the present services are maintained, and the stability of our shipbuilding' industry is guaranteed. As",23,Shipping
56,Mr Speakee,Order! If inter^,24,Shipping
57,Mr Beale,"That is the kind of1 understood the Leader of the Opposition, the basis of the Opposition's case is that, because of defence needs, our shipbuilding industry must be protected. The Government parties agree, and have always agreed, with that proposition. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), honourable members who represent electorates near Brisbane and honourable members from South Australia know that, in a comparable period, this Government has given more orders to the Australian shipbuilding industry than has any previous government. We shall ensure the security of our shipbuilding industry. What is more, we shall ensure that if these ships are disposed of, they will be disposed of only at a fair price. The Micawbers of the Opposition, when in government, sit down and survey their assets. They find that some of them are income-producing assets and thatsome, of necessity, are not. They find that some income-producing assets are not producing as much income as they might do. They find themselves in need of money, as all people do, whether they be Micawbers or not. Their approach to the problem is, ""We have this asset, and we must not part with it. To be sure, if we parted with it we could use the millions of pounds that we got for it to better advantage in national developand of very little use for its purpose. ment "". Heaven only knows, Australia needs millions of pounds for national development. They say, "" We could use that money to great advantage and we could let a private company run the ships, but we shall not do so because we are socialists "". That is the clear point of division between us. The Opposition wants to retain the Commonwealth shipping line, irrespective of its virtues, beoffice in 1949 introduced the Shipping cause it is a government shipping line. The Government says that the acid test is to ask, not "" Who runs it "" , but "" How is it run, and what services does it render to the Commonwealth of Australia ? "" The Opposition's case has been brought forward in a paltry manner. It is based upon the false assumption that the sale of the Commonwealth shipping line at a bucket-shop price is imminent. I say that it is the silliest case that has been presented to this House for a long time. Although two Ministers have spoken in this debate, we have not heard a single denial of the allegation that the Government intends to sell the Commonwealth shipping line. We have read the press reports, and we know there is no doubf that the Commonwealth shipping line is on the skids. Neither Ministerwho has spoken has dealt with the essential point, which is that the Commonwealth shipping line was established as a defence measure, as a result of the bitter war experiences, not only of the present Government parties, but also of the Labour party. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has pointed out, at the outbreak of the last war our shipping services were in a shocking state. We had only enough coastal ships to serve the ordinary needs of our coastal trade. We had no reserves for defence purposes. We had no overseas shipping. Our shipbuilding industry, which should have been able .to build the ships that we needed, was in a deplorable condition. Only the Cockatoo Island Dockyard was working. Of 225 ships in our mercantile fleet, which totalled slightly -less than 500,000 tons, 82 were more than twenty years old, and another 50 were more than sixteen years old. Half of the fleet was obsolete Most of the ships on the coastal run were too large for our war-time purposes and. indeed, too large for ordinary purposes. They were of unsuitable types. We were in a very bad way as far as dockyards were concerned. The Australian Labour party said that never again should the provision of an adequate mercantjle fleet be left to the risks of commercial chance. The Labour Government which was in Act, the whole basis of which was to provide proper shipping facilities and an adequate shipping reserve for defence purposes. That Government went about the task in a methodical way. First, it introduced the licensing of all ships in order to ensure that only suitable ships were licensed. Persons who wished to build ships were required first to obtain a licence, thus ensuring that our ships would be modern and up to date. The second purpose of the Shipping Act was",24,Shipping
58,Mr Joshua (Ballarat) [11.43],"to establish the Australian shipbuilding and had its life been prolonged it would industry, which was specially encouraged have ensured that private shipping firms so that it might be a reserve for our warcould have obtained those ships at reasontime needs. The third purpose of the able prices. There has been no unfair act was to establish the Commonwealth interference by any Labour government line of ships, and thus provide a market with private enterprise. for the ships built by the Australian shipbuilding industry. If the Commonwealth shipping line the Australian Labour shipping line is sold, there will be no party did something absolutely necessary proper market for the ships built by our for the defence of Australia. It seems shipbuilding yards, which will be obliged regrettable that whilst this important to depend on the orders they receive from matter is being debated, the Minister for thing about private enterprise, orders for for the Army( Mr Francis) are absent ships will go to shipbuilders overseas. When the Shipping Act was passed, ashamed of themselves. the Labour Government realized that there was scope for both private shipping overseas balance of payments it is lines and the Commonwealth shipping possible to ascertain the amount which line to operate. In view of the suggeswe pay to shipping companies of other tion that the Commonwealth shipping countries for freight on goods shipped line is to be sold, we should address ourto and from this country. The figures selves to the question whether that scope are astounding. In 1951-52 we paid still exists. 1 shall cite ngures which £139,500,000 for freight on goods imindicate that shipping tonnages have inported into this oountry, whereas the creased since 1948.

The Government is waiting for a satisfactory price to be offered for the present Oommonwealth line of steamers, vvhich will eventually be sold in the same manner as was the other line of steamers. That previous line was constructed during the regime of the right honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Deakin Limited, of Brisbane, the Walsh Hughes), and was then given away, in effect, to the Inchcape-Morgan group by a subsequent non-Labour government. At a banquet which was tendered to LordI nchcape and Mr J.

The board's shipbuilding programme gave a fillip to the technical education of apprentices. Enrolments at technical colleges for diploma courses in naval architecture increased greatly. A lectureship in naval architecture was established in Queensland. The Minister for the Navy( Mr McMahon) who is at the table, should take particular note of that fact. The reopening, during the war, of idle shipyards was an organizational achievement of the Labour Government. Among the shipyards reopened were those of Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, and Evans Island Dockyard, at Newcastle, which had been almost ruined by an anti-Labour government; the works of the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company Proprietary Limited and Morts Dock and Engineering Company Limited, in Sydney; the BrokenH ill Proprietary Limited dock at Whyalla and, later the dockyard of Poole and Steele Limited, in Sydney. The gigantic Captain Cook Graving Dock at Garden Island was also built, after it had been found essential for defence purposes to link Garden Island, in Sydney Harbour, with the shore. The dock is one of the greatest engineering achievements in the southern hemisphere. What will now happen to those big establishments? Are they to go to the wall simply because a few Cabinet In 1941 we were Ministers wish to sell our Commonwealth, line of steamers to private enterprise?

I invite honourable members to consider the feasibility of that claim. Did the Leader of the Opposition base his assertion on common sense and fact, or did he pluck the figures out of the ether? Information that I have obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician shows that the total cargo tonnage carried on the Australian coast during the relevant period when the losses were made was 8,000,000 tons. At an average freight rate of about £4 a ton, freight charges on the Australian coast totalled about £40,000,000 have been saved out of £32,000,000? That is something that I do not pretend to understand. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition was plucking his arguments from the ether and is not prepared to deal in facts or in logic. I come now to the matter of intimidation. We in this country do not believe in intimidation. The Leader of the Opposition said that if these ships were sold, a future Labour government would get them back, or words to that effect. He used the threat that though the Australian people had carried out their legitimate business according to the. law, they would be penalized and punished by a future socialist administration, which vvould pursue its doctrinaire path of destruction of private enterprise and the spirit of energy and initiative in this country. heard the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) say that some one was lying.

If , by some misfortune, the present Government went out of office, could we expect such profits to continue? The simple fact which must be emphasized in the interests of the people is that socialist governments have always run govern-ment-owned ships at a loss. Members of the Opposition, apparently, fail to realize that such losses, which amount to millions of pounds, must ultimately be paid by the taxpayers. To my astonishment, those honourable members appear to believe that the taxpayers get off scot-free in respect of such losses.

107,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [12.25],"few years. In that respect there is nothing dangerous in the measure, nor is there anything in it to which the Opposition objects. But the insincerity of the Government in relation to prices control is sharply challenged by Opposition members, and the consideration of this measure gives to them an opportunity to express some conclusions that they have arrived at and to state some of their very firmly held convictions in relation to the prices structure. Despite the fact that the area over which prices control is exercised is being reduced, and that prices control in general is no longer favoured by the people, though its retention is most fervently desired by them when they are In danger of exploitation, we believe that greater interest should be taken in the subject by the Government. Government supporters, after having loudly proclaimed from the hustings that they were opposed to all controls, including one which the Government has just safely defended in the High Court, bave displayed such patent insincerity in regard to this matter that I feel impelled to direct attention to it. In relation to prices control there are certain constants in the country which are still awaiting the complete rehabilitation that comes so slowly after a war. We contend that the prices structure has not been examined closely by the Government, which sought to absolve itself of responsibility for prices control by passing the buck to the States. It is well known that State departments which administer prices, whether they be in the charge of Labour or Liberal Ministers, are not efficiently organized, except constitutionally, to deal with this matter. When a commodity is produced or manufactured in one State and sold in another the prices authorities are utterly unable effectively to control its farms are sold, not at reasonable prices, price. As the result of decisions beyond the control of the States higher costs are so weighting the price structure that effective control of prices has become very difficult. We cannot agree that a good job has the grower is below his cost of production. been done by the States when we examine Is it not within the wit of governments the control exercised in respect of comto solve this problem so that the modities that are vitally important to the market gardener and those whose actipeople, not because the States do not want vities are not controlled by orderly to exercise effective control, but because marketing organizations shall not be Mr Eaylen. they cannot do so. If a commodity is manufactured in South Australia and retailed at its highest price level in New South Wales, the proper estimation of transport and other costs is almost impossible. The State Ministers administering prices control are sighing for the day when stability will return and they will be relieved of the burden of administering a control which the Commonwealth did not have the courage to continue for a few years longer. Consider the position in respect of goods that are sold interstate. When goods are manufactured or produced in the more populous States and sold in the other States the task of following through the costs incurred while the goods are in transit from the manufacturer or the producer to the consumer is so beset with pitfalls, so tortuous and so bent about with evasions and misstatements, that it is difficult for the prices authorities to fix a fair price for them. The consumers of such goods who need protection are not obtaining it under the present system of control. The position in relation to commodities manufactured or produced and sold on the local market is quite different. No difficulty should be experienced in establishing a. fair price for them. Throughout the States, but particularly in Victoria, the extraordinary fluctuations that occur in the prices of vegetables are unduly harassing housewives. The prices authorities seem to have no method by which they can fix the prices of vegetables from day to day on a level standard. Prices are whipped round by the vagaries of the weather, byfloods,by acts of God, by the manipulations of forestallers and by the glutting of the markets. On one day the products of the but at acceptable prices; on the .next day they soar to the high heaven. But all the time the producers are plaintively complaining that the returns that they receive do not justify their continuance in ths industry. Too frequently the return to forced to accept unprofitable prices at a time wben 'tbe consumer is forced to pay exorbitant prices for bis requirements? Commodity prices are one of the -chief worries of the average Australian housewife to-day. Why has the politicoeconomic law of supply and demand -been so subverted? Tbis problem should -be examined with a view to ascertaining whether it is not possible to give greater (protection to the housewife. The present -system of prices control does not appear to be able to cope with the activities of the middlemen, many of whom are on the way to becoming millionaires. Invariably vegetable prices are fixed on the basis of first quality. What happen? in the suburbs? In my own experience in Sydney, the owners of cafes, hotels, boarding houses and similar businesses buy bulk supplies through friends in the markets. adequate prices are fixed in advance. The top quality vegetables taken from the markets in wholesale lots are quickly absorbed, and the seconds are carted to the snburbs where they are sold at the price fixed for first-quality vegetables. Nobody objects to the payment of the top prices fixed for commodities if he is able to obtain commodities of first-class quality, but all of us object to the payment of top prices for seconds. able member is straying rather widely from the subject-matter of this bill, which does not deal with price fixing. but the bill is designed to allocate funds from Commonwealth revenue to the States. say something about the persons who will be drastically affected by this measure. Otherwise I do not know how I can continue my story. UnlessI am able to refer to the matters that I am mentioning, my address will be considerably narrowed and all that I shall be able to say is that this bill will make certain funds from the Commonwealth revenue available for the use of the Statesi n their efforts to control prices. next honourable member, may I explain State price fixing has completely failed. The fact that this measure is designed to provide money for price fixing gives me the rigbt to say that the attempts of the States to fix prices have failed. This Government, when it assumed office, should have assumed responsibility for the control of prices throughout Australia. decided the matter of prices control. poisoned by the propaganda of the non-Labour parties. They wanted the Government to retain prices control and make the system work. Quite recently the High Court decided that certain controls that have been imposed by the Commonwealth are valid. Therefore, the Government cannot argue that it does not believe in controls. Indeed, the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) was the most vociferous member of the Parliament in defending cerThe forestallers see that tain controls, particularly capital issues control. The speech in which he defended capital issues control is a most glowing piece of English, and the Government of which he is a member is determined to retain capital issues control. issues control is not dealt with in the bill. a passing reference to certain financial controls. If I am not to be allowed to speak about the difficulties under which the people of this counti'y are labouring because of irregular prices control, and if I am. to be restricted to the fact that this bill arranges for the channelling of I agree, Mr Speaker, money from the Australian to the State governments, I must conclude my speech by saying that the bill is approved in I hope to be allowed to general by the Labour party because it is fair to pay the servants who are working for us. However, I regret that the Australian Government has not the courage to measure up to the responsibility, that it was expected to assume in 1949, of protecting the Australian community from the exploiter, the forestaller and the racketeer. that the terms of the bill are very clear, and that honourable members are limited in debate to a discussion of the purpose for which leave was granted to introduce",31,Speaker Hon.

114,Mr Speaker,"Before I call thethe bill. That purpose is not to institute prices control or price fixing. As a matter of fact those matters are completely outside the scope of the Constitution. As lionorable members were reminded a moment ago, prices control was dealt with by a decision of the Australian people. Therefore, if I allow one honourable member to discuss price fixing I must allow other honourable members to answer him. We must confine ourselves to the subject matter of the bill. -This measure is obviously meant to deal with one of the matters inherited by this Government from the previous Chifley Government. Excepting for the agreement with the States, there is no reason why the Australian Government should reimburse the States for the moneys that they expend on prices control. Prices control is a function of the States, and there is no reason why the Commonwealth should pay for the machinery used by the States in organizing their price fixing activities. Prices for increased rates, taxes and insurance. control is a matter for State governments alone, and yet, due to the inheritance of a decision made by the Chifley Government, we have the extraordinary spectacle of this Government paying for the machinery provided and used by State governments. I believe that the machinery for dealing with prices control and rent control in some of the States is more costly than it need be. That applies io New South Wales, and has particular regard to the machinery that that State has established for the control of rents, and for which this Government is paying. measure of rent control for the time being because of the shortage of houses. It is the one control that is really effeclist of a court for determination. The tive, and there is still a need for it. I do machinery is so cumbersome and costly not want to say what should be done to gradually relax this control, but I wish to complain about the machinery used in New South Wales, although I believe that it is similar to the organization in Victoria ancl other States. In those States a rent controller has been appointed, and there are a series of magistrates and courts whose duty is to deal with rent matters. The cost of that organization is tremendous. Rents could be controlled very simply if the State Government would announce the formula upon which it desires to determine rents, and allow the people themselves to work out their own arrangements within the framework of that formula. If the formula is clear enough disputes will be rare, and there will be no need for the maintenance of huge rent control departments such as may be found in Sydney and in other cities. Rent fixation should be very simple, and a fair rent could be decided quite easily between interested parties if the Government would provide a formula for them to work on. There is no need whatever for the maintenance of a complex system of controllers and courts. member's experience? is factual. It is a matter of my own knowledge. Recently New South Wales amended its rent control legislation to allow rents to be increased above 1939 levels in order to reimburse landlords If a landlord wants to have his property fair-rented he has to make application to the rent control authority, and then that authority, having checked his application, sends it to the tenant with a statement that as a result of the increased costs of the owner the rent has been increased by so much. Then the rent controller asks the question, "" W ill you object ? "". That bald question, of course, invites the tenant to object. The average person who receives a form like that sits down and reads it through and then says, "" Of course I object"". Of course every I realize the necessity of a person objects to paying more than he can get away with, and when an objection is made the whole matter is referred to the courts. The matter then waits in the at present that people have to wait from six to eight months before their application for very small increases of rent can be heard. All this delay-the cost to the community of the work involved, and the cost to the State Government-ha s to be paid for by this Government. But the whole procedure is completely unnecessary. Houses or flats built at present are free of initial rent control, and the parties",33,Speaker Hon. Archie Oameron

In my opinion there is no need for the maintenance of rent control on new buildings, for commercial, residential, industrial, or any other purpose at all, because the economy can find its own level on the new basis. I agree that there must be a measure of rent control on old buildings, but the machinery can be simplified to the point where the matter of adjustment can be left to mutual arrangement between parties if the Government would announce the formula upon which it desires rents to be fixed. If that were done the parties would have the right to approach the court for an interpretation of the formula to meet their special circumstances. In that way the cost of rent control, would be reduced without any loss of efficiency. Sitting suspended jrom 12.1/5 to 2.15 p.m. sion of the sitting, I had pointed out that the present system of rent control that is exercised by the States is very wasteful. I do not want it to be construed from my remarks that I am opposed to some form of rent control. In my opinion, rent control is still necessary, because of the contioned in the bill. This Parliament has ditions that exist in the community. already pointed out to the honourable member for Bennelong that the subject of rent oontrol is outside the scope of the bill. Speaker, I submit that I should be permitted to refer to the machinery that is in operation in the States, because, the Commonwealth is called upon to bear the cost of maintaining that machinery. I consider that there should be a considerable relaxation of rent control, in order to bring it into unison with the existing economic conditions. That woulcl result in a considerable reduction of expenditure. As I have already mentioned, there is no need for the rents of new buildings to be controlled. I believe that this aspect of rent control destroys the incentive of people to erect new buildings. The sacred right of contract that has been denied to the people during the period of control should be returned to them. Many people do not understand the formula that is applied under the present system. I can speak with some authority about the effect of the application of the formula in New South Wales, and I believe that a similar system is used in other States. A rent controller permit the honourable member for Bennelong to continue on his present line. The organization that has been established by a State to control rents is not a matter for which this Parliament is responsible. All that we are considering is a grant to reimburse the States for certain expenditure, incurred by them during the financial year which commenced on the lst July, 1952. I cannot allow the honourable member to address himself to the wider field of prices control, which was placed outside the scope of our authority by the people of this country. not discussing that aspect of the matter. I am discussing only the type of machinery that is established in the States, which the Commonwealth is required to bear the cost of maintaining. nery of a Commonwealth nature is menno control over machinery of the States. Thc Parliament is considering voting money for a. certain purpose. It is surely proper for us to discuss the manner in which that money shall be expended. liament cannot exercise retrospective control over expenditure by the States during a period that has ended. the honourable member for Bennelong should be permitted to discuss what the States have done with the money? correctly, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) was permitted to refer to controls. on two occasions. delve into the merits or demerits of the principle of rent control. I desire merely to discuss how the money proposed",34,Speaker Hon. Archie Oameron

128,Mr Cramer,"I have no desire to to be appropriated should be expended, not only by New South ""Wales but also by other States. of the bill is very narrow. It is to make provision for the grant of financial assistance to the States in connection with the administration of the control of prices and rents, which is a matter that is outside the scope of this Parliament. We can either grant or refuse to grant money to the States. It is not customary in this Parliament to lay down conditions, and there is no attempt on the part of rhe Crown to do so. grant to the States is greater or smaller according to the efficiency of their machinery. I suggest that the States couM effect a worthwhile saving to the Commonwealth, which, in any event, should not be required to bear any of the costs. wasteful system of rent control could be simplified to involve less expenditure. I do not consider that the system that is at present in operation in New SouthW ales protects the interests of the people. May I proceed to discuss the formula, Mr Speaker? ont to the honourable member for Bennelong that clause 4 provides that the nioney appropriated under the bill shall be paid out after receipt of a statement, certified by the Auditor-General of the State, setting out the amount that has been expended by the State in administering the control of prices and rents during the financial year that commenced on the lst July, i952. Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) stated in his second reading speech It is estimated that the grants would amount to £1,087,000 this year, compared with members. £937,000 in 1951-52. Obviously, the provision is for expenditure up to the 30th June, 1953. The right honourable gentleman stressed that my view on this question. If the Parliahe did not want the .States to be ment wants to lay down conditions, that hampered by financial considerations. I is a matter that should be attended to submit that it is obvious from the general when the bill is considered in committee. tenor of his remarks that he intended If honourable members wish to amend tbe tliat the debate should bear a relation bill in order to give effect to. the opinions to the amount to be granted by the that they have been trying to express, Commonwealth. sorry, but the administration of pricescontrol is outside the ambit of thia Parliament's power. a Standing Order which says that Mr .Speaker shall be heard in silence. It . is disregarded occasionally. An attempt, was recently made to extend the power of the Parliament to prices control, but the proposal was rejected by the people.. The Parliament has the power to makepayments to the States. I have yet to learn that it is the function of the Parliament to lay down very many conditions in connection with such payments. I point out that I am not bound by anything that may be said in a second reading speech. I am bound only by the Standing Orders and the customa and procedure of this House. you called me to order on two occasion* during my speech, Mr Speaker, I came to realize that you were perfectly correct. This bill deals with the reimbursement of the States for a certain purpose and with nothing else. I support your ruling 1 entirely. order, Mr Speaker. I suggest that, if discussion of this bill is to be limited to the question whether the States shall be paid an amount of £130,000,000, the power of this Parliament to discuss the purpose for which the money is to be provided will be limited. The Constitution provides that the Parliament may lay down conditions, and I submit respectfully ' that members should be permitted to discuss the method of expending money.

In order that I may object to the proposed grant, if I wish to do so, I must be able to discuss my reasons for doing so. to the honourable member stating reasons but, unless the House overrules me, 1 -shall not allow a discussion of prices and rent controls. That is definite, firm, -and final. Speaker, that I may discuss the machinery. I have no intention to -discuss prices control. -outside the scope of the bill. -further to say. [2.29],I realize from the rulings that you have given, Mr Speaker, that dis-eussion of this bill will be restricted. In fact, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports{ Mr Crean), who intended to speak, now considers that, in view of your rulings, he will not be able to discuss the matter as he would like to discuss it. I should like to know whether the money that .we are asked to grant to the States will be expended in accordance with the -specified purpose. The proposed grant, as I understand the bill, is for expenditure during the current year. The bill provides that the Treasurer of each State must present an account at the end of the year to show that the money has been expended in .connection with the administration of prices and rent controls. If the Commonwealth Treasurer should be dissatisfied with that account, he may refuse to accept it. In the meantime, he may make advances to the States during the year for the purpose of enabling them control. I point out that this situation has arisen from the fact that the people ruled, at a referendum, that the Australian Government should not continue to exercise prices control. The State governments at the time of the referendum campaign assured the people that they could deal effectively with prices control and, in fact, do a much better job than the Commonwealth had done. When the States took over the machinery of prices Control after the referendum, the Commonwealth Government agreed to pay the eost of administering the system. 1 should like to know whether the State? are continuing to administer prices control as it should be administered or whether we are being asked now to provide money for a system that is not operating effectively. Everybody realizes that political of the Opposition favour the use of a greater measure of prices control, whereas many supporters of the Government would abolish it. going to allow the honourable gentleman to develop a debate on prices control. That is definite. only a passing reference to the subject. Government supporters would do away with prices control if they could do so. In that event, bills such as the measure that we are now considering would not be necessary. The continuance of price? control necessitates the expenditure of money by the Government. I want to be satisfied that the expenditure on prices control is fully justified. We are entitled to ask that the money that we grant to the States be expended in a way that will",36,Speaker Hon.

150,Mr Thompson,"I am makingbe beneficial to tbe people and in accordance witb our wishes. I do not wish to discuss rent control, and I know that I am not permitted to deal with the individual items of prices control. However, I believe that I am justified in referring to tbe cost of prices control, because the Commonwealth is expected to underwrite that cost. Are we not entitled to say that we expect the officials of the States co carry out their work efficiently? able member is developing a situation that I shall not tolerate. I have said definitely, finally, and conclusively, that 1 shall not permit a debate to take place on prices control or rent control during che consideration of this bill. The power to control prices and rents rests with the States. The Commonwealth has agreed to expend certain money in order to reimburse the States for the cost of administering those controls. Whether the Parliament wishes to grant that money or not is a matter entirely for the Parliament co decide. However, I sball not permit a discussion of the question whether the State governments expend the money wisely or unwisely. That is not our business. confine my remarks to the provisions of the bill. Clause4 (2) statesThe .Treasurer may disallow any item nf expenditure set out in a statement furnished to liim in pursuance of the last preceding sub aection. W ill the Treasurer satisfy himself that the items of expenditure submitted to him on behalf of the States are accurate and, in fact, set out tbe amounts that bave been expended on the administration of prices control? Sir Auditor-General certifies to the accuracy of the items. the audit certificates are submitted to the Treasury by the State officers, not by the Commonwealth Auditor-General. Sir ARTHURFADDEN T h a t is so. try to evade your ruling, Mr Speaker. However, honourable members appear to bc circumscribed in debating this matter by virtue of the fact that they are not able to express their opinions on how the money should be spent. I realize that the States have to administer prices control, but, when the Australian Government bas to supply money for any purpose, it should have some control over tbe spending of it . When the House was dealing with a previous bill, certain honourable member argued strongly that the States fehould be responsible for the collection of the money that they spent. Here is an instance where the States are to spend money which the Commonwealth hae collected, yet honourable members are not permitted to discuss tbe manner in wbich the States spend that money. In tbe circumstances, I do not desire to oppose the bill. I agree that the States should exercise control of prices and rents. I agree that it is in the interests of the people of Australia that the States should be provided with money for this purpose. ButT ask the Treasurer to ensure that the States administer prices control in a proper and effective manner. Question resolved in the affirmative.
