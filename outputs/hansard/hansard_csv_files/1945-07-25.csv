HOUR OF MEETING. That the House, at its rising, adjourn to to-morrow, at 10.30 a.m. the first intimation of this kind that the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has given since assuming the high office which he now holds. Members of the Opposition were duration of the present sessional period, the Prime Minister would have been able to work out a programtme which would not impose on members the same continuing burden that was found necessary in order to dispose of the major legislative proposals of the Government. been complaining about Parliament not sitting for sufficiently long periods. It is now getting what it was wanting. considers that the Parliament can function as effectively as it should under present conditions, I must hasten to disagree with him.

The programme submitted to us made necessary closft examination by the limited number of members on this side of the House of the important issues involved.

8,Mr Holt,"I am glad to be remindedof knowing that many of the suggestions which it has raised in the course of the debates have been embodied in Government policy, as announced subsequently from the other side of the chamber. I do not raise this matter from a party point of view, and I regret that the Minister for the Navy( Mr Matin) has found it necessary to deal with it from that aspect. I am anxious, as are all other honourable members, to ensure that the Parliament shall function as a democratic institution. A great deal of time of honourable members is taken up in dealing with their correspondence, in interviewing Ministers, and in disposing of other duties relating to their constituencies, and they will not be able to spend the whole of their time in the chamber if the sittings extend from 10.30 a.m. to about 11 p.m. employment. full employment, that the Prime Minister is offering for the post-war new era, he will need to recast his ideas about a 40-hour week. Honorahle members interjecting, opposite are showing a little more spirit than usual, and that is a welcome sign. The notice-paper contains only one major item of legislation, as far as we can see at present. I understand that there will be a discussion on the issues arising from the Unitedi Nations Conference on International Organization, and possibly the Treasurer intends to introduce his budget proposals in the course of the present sittings. If that is to be done, the Parliament is not being treated fairly. It should be possible to dispose of the legislation now on the notice-paper with Parliament working on a normal number of days, and for a normal number of hours on each day, thus enabling honourable members to have a reasonable recess in order to prepare material for the forthcoming budget debate. The Government has given no indication of its future legislative programme. We merely have the curt announcement in the terms of the motion of the Prime Minister that there is to be a continuance of the abnormal practice of meeting at 10.30 a.m. on three days of a four-day sitting week. The right honourable gentleman owes it to the House to give some indication of what the Government has in mind. Minister and Treasurer) [2.36] -in replyI thought that I was doing a good turn to some honourable members by arranging for the House to meet at 10.30 a.m. to-morrow. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) and other honourable members were kind enough earlier in the sessional period to agree to the postponement of private members' business to a more appropriate occasion. Such an occasion will arise to-morrow. Apart from that, it is likely that, with the consent of Mr Speaker, the suspension of the sitting at the luncheon hour to-morrow will be more lengthy than is usually the case. The proposal to meet at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow was designed specifically, not to hasten the passage of legislation but rather to give to honourable members an opportunity to discuss the private motions that appear on the notice-paper, a very important one being that of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), and, in addition, to afford an opportunity for the discussion of grievances tomorrow night. I hope that the passage of legislation will be sufficiently rapid to warrant a week's adjournment at a later stage. budget shall be brought down during the present sessional period? ant legislation also is to 'be introduced. When it reaches the second-reading stage, the House will be given time to consider it. Question resolved in the affirmative.

I shall miake inquiries, because I believe that it is necessary, in these difficult days, to preserve our democracy uot only against the enemies outside, but also against the enemies inside. At a later stage I shall inform the House of the result of my investigations. All that I can say now, in conclusion, is that so many queer people are joining the political parties which constitute the Opposition in this Parliament that many honourable gentlemen opposite will not have so much reason to feel so lonely in future. Private Hospitals Association in Brisbane, Mr Trewen, stated this week that, the closing of the McDonald Private Hospital, because of staff shortage, was "" only the start,"" and the Queensland Minister for Health, Mr Foley, said that the State Government was helpless to remedy the situation, pending action by the mailpower authorities. shortages of nursing and domestic staffs, not only in the McDonald Private Hospital, but also in hospitals throughout Australia, including the tubercular sanatorium at Kenmore, will the Minister for Labour and National Service indicate what action the Government proposes to take in order to ensure that adequate staffs shall be provided for these essential institutions? that during the last two or three years, great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining nursing and domestic staffs for hospitals and asylums. The Department of Labour and National Service has been endeavouring to obtain the release from the Services of nurses and other women for this work, but volunteers do not come forward readily, because of the unsatisfactory conditions and inadequate salaries and wages. In an endeavour to make it a little easier to get staff, we have approached the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and the hearing of the claim will commence next Monday. We hope that as the result of this case, better conditions will be provided for employees of hospitals and asylums, and that, consequently, more women will be prepared to join their staffs. CALL-UP OF YOUTHS-DIRECTIO N OF -TROPICA L SERVICE. accepted that Army recruits must receive twelve months' training before they can be used as reinforcements in operational areas, but youths are still being called up for military service on attaining the age of 18 years, and will not be utilized as front-line soldiers for at least twelve months.

However, all the circumstances will be taken into consideration before a decision is made by the Government. the Army make arrangements for a large contingent of front-line war veterans to be returned to Australia by ship immediately? In order that due recognition shall be accorded to these battle-scarred warriors, will he ensure that, on their arrival, they shall march through the streets of the first capital city they reach ? to add to what I said yesterday, namely, that a substantial batch of war veterans, with at least five years' .service, will be discharged' and that the men will arrive in Australia within the next fortnight.

In dealing with this matter, the Cabinet and the Advisory War Council considered that the position had been fully covered for the time being by the decision announced on the 1st June. However, as I have said previously, I hope that further releases can be made. The circumstances which the honourable member has mentioned will be considered as conditions vary from time to time. of the Minister for the Army, I placed before the Minister acting on his behalf the case of men who had seen service in tropical areas, and had returned to Tasmania. Some who were placed in B class are now under draft to leave Tasmania again, whereas there are in TasmaniaA class men who have never left that State. I ask the Minister whether it is reasonable that B class men, who have seen service in the tropics, should be sent away again while A class men, who have never left Australia, should be allowed to remain here? ber will give me some further particulars names, numbers, &c, to the department. papers, and give the honourable member's representations sympathetic consideration. It does seem to me that if men have been in forward areas, and are now B class, they should not be sent to forward areas again, but others should take their places. I shall have the matter examined. Several ministerial announcements have been made recently controverting the allegation that discharged servicemen are being directed by man-power to certain positions. I hold in my hand, a paper indicating that two men discharged from the Air Force, who had previously held positions with private trading banks, have been asked to report to Compton Parkinsons, in Sydney, for employment. I ask whether this indicates a change of policy on the part of the authorities. been no change of policy, although policy is at present in a state of transition because of the decision to release large numbers from the Army and the Air Force. If there is any dispute, it is in relation to air force trainees. But the answer I gave last week to a question on this subject was correct, namely, that all men who have been released-excep t those released on occupational grounds, to go to special jobs in which cases they will be retained in the work for which they were released-wil l be permitted, if they choose, to return to their former occupations. If occupational releases refuse to do the work for which they were released they may be returned to the Army. All other persons discharged from the forces will have the right to be reinstated in their former occupations. In some instances their reinstatementwill be deferred because of the need for their engaging in more important work than what they were doing before their enlistment. They will be asked to do this more important work, and I understand that in many instances where men have been so requested they have agreed, recognizing that they will be allowed to go back to their own jobs later. As I have said, the only point not definitely settled, and it will be settled next week, is that relating to young Air Force trainees. They may be required to undertake essential work after discharge. It was suggested that if they did not engage in essential work they should be sent back to the Army, but decision on the point has been deferred. The War Commitments Committee will deal with it in a few days time, and in the meantime a definite instruction has been given that",18,Discharged Men To Employment Release Of Long Service Personnel

Minister for Post-war Reconstruction received either directly or through the Prime Minister a telegram from the Premier of South Australia protesting against the decision of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to reduce by one half the quantity of wheat for stock and poultry feed in that State from the end of this month, although the supply of wheat for feed in Victoria will be doubled?

43,Mr Lazzarini,"In reviewing thePEAS. representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture aware that there is a shortage of pea-seed in Western Australia and that merchants in that State attribute the shortage to the lack of activity by the Vegetable Seeds Committee? Is it a fact that New Zealand has ample supplies of pea-seed, and, if so, will the MinGreenfeast ister take action to have supplies imported from that dominion? stand that the honourable member has made inquiries from the department on this matter, and the department has advised me in detail of the vegetable-seed position in Western Australia. The Vegetable Seeds Committee placed orders in New Zealand in June, 1944, for delivery from the 1944-45 crop. New Zealand experienced' a disastrous year because' of floods, one seed merchant advising that he had thrown out many thousands of sacks. He also advises that he can make only a 50 per cent, delivery of peas of the Greenfeast variety. The Vegetable Seeds Committee has an agent in New Zealand who is constantly making inquiries for seed, and any suitable lines are purchased and shipped as soon as shipping is available. The committee is prepared to purchase any satisfactory line that is offering. If West Australian firms will advise as to any source of supply the possibilities will be investigated immediately. Lasit year the committee arranged for a substantial production in Australia, and if this had not been done the position would have been hopeless. The committee has allocated the available """"d to seed merchants on a pro rata basis, there being a small allocation for Western Australia which has been held in Sydney for some time on account of shipping difficulties. It is unlikely that there wages have been pegged ? will be sufficient Greenfeast or Massey pea seed to meet all demands before the next harvest. There is, however, seed of special canning varieties which has been reserved for the services, buit sufficient of cost of building houses in the various this can be released to meet all civilian requirements. The seed produced in Australia has proved to be of excellent quality, and there is no doubt that in the future we can produce all pea seed required.

This point is of great importance to everybody conalready cerned in this unfortunate acquisition of £200,000 for damage by enemy action, fire, land. In justification of what I said demolitions, occupation, &c.

This indicates clearly that the CommonFund to pay for the damage in Darwin wealth Government, whilst taking away and in other places which was not caused fro m the freeholder the safeguard which by enemy action.

I do not know how Against this sum the Commonwealth is committed to an expenditure of about That is a very bad misstatement of the Interior whether the Government proposes to use the War Damage Insurance the cost to the Commonwealth w ill be as far as I know, to use it for the acquisition of land. Parliament should have a voice in this matter before any firm decision is reached. Another interesting, statement by the Minister relating to the actual extent of damage in Darwin was as follows:In the town of Darwin proper 491 sections are held under freehold tenure, and 74 sections under leasehold tenure. Of these, 219 sections were unimproved at the 19th February, 1942, the date of tlie Japanese air raid on Darwin, and 214 sections had buildings standing on them at the 22nd April, 1944, indicating that 132 sections which were improved at the 19th February, 1942, carried no improvements at the 22nd April, 1944. [ do not believe that the Minister will' claim that the disappearance of buildings from 132 sections was due entirely to Japanese action, although that is. what he stated, in effect, in the passage which F have just quoted. He went on to sayIn the area suburban to Darwin Go sections are held under freehold tenure, and 121 sections under leasehold tenure. Of these, 97 sections were unimproved at the 19th February, 1942, and 59 sections had buildings standing on them at the 22nd April, 1944, indicating that 30 sections which were improved at the Iflbh February, 1942, carried no improvements at tlie 22nd April, 1944. One of the 'figures stated in that paragraph must be wrong because the totals do not agree-5 9 and 30 do not add up to 97. However, it seems that at least 162 buildings have disappeared from that area. The Minister spoke of compensation totalling about £200,000 for damage by enemy action, fire, demolitions, occupation, Arc. The amount arrived at by dividing £200,000 by 162 represents a substantial average amount of compensation for. a building. I do not claim that this figure is wrong, but, if it was right, the amount of .damage done per building in Darwin was much greater than Parliament has hitherto been led to believe. killed in Darwin. We were told that there were only 19 deaths. so. In any case, those figures do not add up correctly. I know, Mr Speaker, that you would not permit a general discussion on the future town management of Darwin, because that issue does not arise under the bill. Therefore, I shall refer to other matters, including amendments which ought to be made to the bill. I have already given notice of my intention to move that the bill be postponed until after the visit to Darwin of the two ministers concerned. That is not an unreasonable request. If it be rejected, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) will, I understand, move that the bill ibe referred to the Public Works Committee. The Government, on its own showing, proposes to expend this large sum without authority, because the contemplated expenditure is eight times greater than the amount which may be expended on a public work without reference to the Public Works Committee. There is no point in the Government acquiring this freehold property in Darwin unless it intends to embark on a large programme of expenditure. If the cost of acquiring the land will be £650,000, that amount is 26 times greater than the sum specified in the Public Works Committee Act, and therefore the matter should be referred to the committee before the land-owners are dispossessed. I should like a definition in the bill as to the date of the proposed acquisition. The operation of section 29 of the Lands Acquisition Act is to be suspended, and the interests of the land-holders will not be safeguarded. After all, these men have certain property rights. I believe in the rights of private property, and I favour the freehold tenure of land. I do not believe in the leasehold system, except under limited conditions. A person who owns the freehold of his land will usually take a much greater interest in his property than if it is held under lease which gives him only tenant rights. Therefore, I oppose the leasehold system, particularly as applied to town areas. If the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lazzarini) meant what he seems to have It is like the number of said about unearned increment in his second-reading speech, he must have contemplated the application to Darwin of the system of rating on unimproved land values. If he means that, why did he not say so? My fourth request is that a special committee should be set up so that persons dispossessed of their land might be compensated. The unfortunate' land-owners may reside in any of the six States, and certainly the",25,Lazzarini
76,Mr Rankin,,27,Lazzarini
77,Mr Archie Cameron,"That ismajority of them would be resident outside the Northern Territory. should be given an opportunity to present their case to a special tribunal, without being obligated, to appeal to the Supreme Court or some other legal body. [Extension of time granted.] The general problem of the replanning of Darwin was referred to the predecessor of the Minister for the Interior by the Northern Territory Development League, in a two-page letter dated the 29th May. Every member of this Parliament has received a copy of that letter, and its contents should be considered before the Government embarks upon this lavish scheme. I have received a letter from a former Public Servant in the territory, who has lived there until recently and knows the territory from one end to the other. In the course of his letter he state*The re-planning of Darwin-presumabl y a very expensive process, just as Canberra's beginning was-is going to increase the already heavy burden being borne by the taxpayer, and it is not right that the' development of the hinterland should automatically bring about -the development of ports and capital. But just at present the tax-payer's voice is lost by the clamour of the tax-gatherers and the tax-eaters. If the Minister proposes to expend £7,000,000 on a new township at Darwin, the tax-eater will certainly come into the "" show"". I am bound to have these apprehensions, because no Minister has clarified the position. If this vast expenditure is to be incurred, I am reminded of a man who builds for himself a lavish dining-room and allows native servants to cook his meals in a camp oven on the verandah. The usual practice in a newly developed area is to live under primitive conditions for a while, but in this instance it seems that the Government proposes to reverse the normal procedure. Apparently irrigation works, roads, railways and airways are to take second place to the development of Darwin. I desire a reply to the following seven points:-(1 ) I submit that the bill should follow and not precede an investigation, by the Public Works Committee. (2) Why cannot the Minister postpone this measure until he and the Minister forPost-war Reconstruction have visited thej^ Has this matter been considered by the Territory? (3) Why should not the date>?Government? Certain committees have of acquisition of the land be clearly They stated in the bill? (4) Why not'appoint a special tribunal, so that peaceful settlement of claims by land-owners may be reached? (5) The Government should state whether all land is to be resumed, and not only the freehold property. I have already referred to the freehold land situated in the town of Darwin and the suburban areas, but no statement was made in the Minister's second-reading speech as to whether other landholders will remain in possession of their properties or not. This bill deals only with freehold land. (6) The Government should offer freeholders the first chance of a lease under the new system in the event of the passage of this measure. (7) All reports regarding the future of Darwin should be tabled iu this House. Never has a bill been brought before us involving so much money and with so little information proffered to Parliament. This is a proposal of a very radical kind. I have before me the Mclnnes report of 1937, and the report of the Payne Commission which was presented in 1939. The latter report, read in conjunction with parts of the Mclnnes report, shows that the Administration had passed certain ordinances to deal with the management of Darwin, but had not appointed the officers for which the ordinances provided. An explanation with regard to this matter should be furnished by the present Minister for the Interior. In this bill the Government appears to be putting the cart before the horse. We should have a fairly clear idea of the proposals for the development of the Northern Territory before we consider this measure. I do not know what the Government's intentions may be with regard to airways. In the Post-war period, certain naval, military, and air force installations will be required at Darwin, but, although these matters are of paramount importance, no indication is given in this bill of whether they have been considered. The Navy, the Army, and the Air Force should have as much of this land as may be required for the proper carrying out of the functions with which they will be entrusted in future. met and considered a number of matters in connection with the future of Darwin, but the Government has not paid the Parliament the courtesy of telling it what those committees are, when they sat, or what they reported. This is a most extraordinary way for the Government to act in depriving landholders in Darwin of their freehold rights, although they have been developing their properties over a long period of years. In many instances they have developed them despite many obstacles put in their way through the haphazard administration of the Northern Territory. This is referred to in rather cutting terms in both the Payne and the Mclnnes reports. I conclude by moving;That all words after "" That"" be left out, with a view to insert in. lieu thereof the following words:-""the second reading of the bill be deferred until the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction have accepted the invitation of the Northern Territory Development League to visit Darwin and hear the views of residents of the Northern Territory on this ibill"". motion. There are two approaches to the matter now before the House. It may be discussed from the point of view of a real estate ' agents' conference, or in its national aspect. The Government has attempted to create a national atmosphere in connection with the acquisition of land in Darwin, because this is a -Commonwealth responsibility. iSince the establishment of the National Capital in Canberra, land in the Australian Capital Territory has been held under the leasehold system. Various governments have been in office during that period, and not one of them has found any serious fault with the prevailing system of land tenure. Darwin is also in Commonwealth territory, and, by bringing the system of land tenure in the Northern Territory into line with that of Canberra, the Government has adopted a logical and sound policy. There are many other reasons why we should consider the future of Darwin from an Australian point of view. Prior to the war, persons travelling on the overseas air route noticed clean and well-kept cities in the Netherlands East Indies, but, when they arrived at Australia's "" front door "", they were confronted with something which looked like the "" dry r o t "" scene in White Cargo. Much work has been done with Commonwealth money in Darwin during the war, and the Government is well justified in carrying on where the soldier is likely to leave off. A great deal of money has been poured into the Northern Territory for the purpose of cleaningup Darwin and adjacent areas. When the troops first went there, malaria and dengue fever were prevalent. When I visited Darwin some time ago I was told by medical officers that splendid work had been done by the hygiene squads and* the malaria control units of the Army. Only three cases of dengue fever had occurred in the preceding six months, and these had been flown there from operational areas. As soon as malaria broke out, tie malaria squads cleaned up the breeding grounds. Planting operations in Darwin have helped to beautify th« town, which now presents an attractive appearance. This bill is the first instalment of a plan to polish up and make tidy the front door of Australia, demonstrating to the world that towns need not have a decayed' appearance merely because they are in the tropics. Mr D. H . Lawrence, a very shrewd and wise observer, wrote a book in which he said that our seaside towns, particularly the northern ports, look like odd bits of furniture that had fallen off the pantechnicon of civilization. Darwin, unfortunately, deserves to the limit the strictures that he passed, on the ugliness of our towns. Since this job has to be tackled, it can be made a great post-war project. Logically, the first task is to place land tenure on a satisfactory basis. By all acknowledgments, leasehold is the correct tenure for Darwin. [ disagree with the statement of the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that this bill begins at the wrong end; that we should first say what we are going to do. In all the classic acquisitions of history, the first step has been to obtain possession of the land, and then to do something with it. plan should precede the acquisition of the land.",27,Lazzarini
78,Mr Rankin,I formally second the,29,Lazzarini
79,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [3.57],,29,Lazzarini
80,Mr Francis,"The formulation of »honourable member. Having obtained possession of the land, the planning will he quite easy; in fact, it will follow almost automatically when the system of leasehold tenure has been applied. Darwin has been made more healthy by reason of its occupation by the troops, who have done a tremendous amount of cleaning up and have been the means of a much greater proportion of the war expenditure being diverted to the Northern Territory than would have been the case otherwise. It is logical for the Government to say now that, having progressed to such a stage, it intends to make of Darwin the city we have dreamt of making it, and a credit to the Commonwealth. Obviously, the development of air traffic after the war will make extremely important the consideration of the part that Darwin is likely to play in the future. This part will also be affected by possible future military operations. If considerable expenditure is to be incurred in connection with the development of the Northern Territory, it would be absurd if steps were not taken to ensure the progress of Darwin. The first step to be taken is the acquisition of the land in the town area. The planning will follow. The story of two soldiers who have lived in Darwin for four years has been related in Salt, the education magazine of the services. These men have planned a post-war set-up for the town on the most modern lines, with cool buildings, treelined boulevardes, and all other amenities, including the rehabilitation of the whole area, as well as the development of waterways, particularly the beaches. Their scheme, which has been exhaustively discussed in Salt, contains much matter which honourable members who are interested would do well to read. There is a definite desire on the part of the residents of the southern portion of the continent that the Northern Territory shall progress. Any Australian who has been abroad and has returned to this country by air must be animated by the desire to have at Australia's front door, as we are fond of describing Darwin, a greater spirit of progress and cleanliness than is evidenced by a staggered line of joss houses, with a tired dog leaning against a pub wall. Entering Australia. I disagree with the after having seen the spick and span Dutch aerodromes and cities, an Australian who is proud of his country, finds that vision of Darwin like a "" slap on the face"". The Government is acting expeditiously, and is doing the right thing by making leasehold tenure in the Northern Territory a first requirement, proceeding therefrom to an organized plan, by means of which we shall have in the north the city we have dreamed about for so long hut have not previously bothered to implement. I am proud of the fact that the first task of the new Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) will be to do something for the Northern Territory, particularly Darwin. We could not leave the matter in any better Australian hands than his. He will ensure that the task will be performed well and truly. bill, and the second-reading speech of the Minister, are notable not for the information they have given to the House but for what has been withheld. The Minister could not have givon less information, had he tried. The Parliament should not be treated in such a way. There are no details of future proposals, but merely a statement about the purchase of certain land. If land is to be purchased, the House should be given the reason. The Government should not purchase land merely for the sake of doing so. A clear' indication should be given of what the Government intends to do with the land that is to be acquired. The Minister merely saidThis short measure is designed to authorise the acquisition by the Commonwealth of freehold land in the town of Darwin and its environs. A full description of the area affected is contained in the schedule to the bill. It is proposed to acquire the land by either agreement or compulsory process, . . . The House should be fully informed of all the Government's proposals, in order that it may satisfy itself that the Government is justified in purchasing this land. I protest at the manner in which the affairs of the Parliament are being conducted. Probably, the Government, will refuse to accept any amendments that may be submitted in committee.

By that clause, the normal procedure is to be suspended, because it providesThe value of any land acquired in pursuance ture of more than £25,000.

How are the owners of land in Darwin to know the basis on which the value of their land will be calculated? The circumstances in Darwin are most peculiar. In December, 1941, most of the residents left the town because of the threat of attack by the enemy. In February, 1942, the military authorities required the evacuation of all who had remained. Those persons are now scattered throughout Australia. Many of them are to-day living on their capital. Their houses tages are greater than are suffered by any other section of the community. member object to the re-building of Darwin? ment that is being meted out to those who own land in Darwin.

In 1913, this Parliament passed the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act. That act was amended in 1927, and again in 1936. Broadly speaking, this act authorizes Parliament to order an investigation of any pro-posed work involving an expendito Parliament itself, so that Parliament is made aware of the details of the proposals and the amount to be expended.

If satisfactory assurances could be given on these points the bill would have an easier passage through Parliament^ mend the Government upon its prompt action in taking steps to acquire land in Darwin so that that place may be converted into a model town. I congratulate the Minister for the Interior( Mr of great benefit during the present war in Johnson) upon having launched a scheme which will usher in a new era of progress in the history of Darwin, which was the only Australian town to suffer destruction as the result of enemy action. We know that great damage was also done at Broome, but Darwin alone was completely devastated. Honourable members will recall the news of the first Japanese raid, and later information was given to them in private of the extent of the damage. I think it is time that the facts were released to the public. It would be a warning to us never again to allow ourselves to be caught in such a defenceless state. The only good thing arising out of the whole sorry episode is that, in the place of the old Darwin, a model city is to be built. In peace-time, there is often much squabbling as to whether slum areas in our cities could he reclaimed. So far as Darwin is concerned, that problem has been solved for us by the enemy. What used to be described as the back-door of Australia has now become the front door. As Winwood Reade said in his book, Martyrdom of Man, progress comes out of disaster. We should be thankful that we who lived in other parts of Australia did not have to go through the horrors of aerial bombing, and we should not begrudge the cost of building a new city at Darwin. No doubt mistakes will be made, but we shall have to proceed by trial and error. I desire to pay tribute to tbe young servicemen who, while serving in the Darwin area, drew up plans for the reconstruction of the city. I hope that the Government will consider setting up a construction authority on the lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority, in tbe United States of America. As the Northern Territory is administered directly by the Commonwealth, no constitutional difficulties would arise. In any case, I can see no reason why such an authority should not act in other parts of Australia under the Commonwealth's defence powers. The Tennessee Valley scheme was inaugurated under the federal government's defence powers, and was part of the New Deal programme for the relief of unemployment. Actually, it has proved to be the supply of power and munitions. If we were to set up such an authority in Darwin it should be possible later, as we acquired administrative experience, to extend the idea to other settlements such as Jervis Bay, Port Stephens, Twofold Bay, and places on the coast of Western Australia. The Minister for the Interior should be particularly interested in such a proposal. We thought at one time that Western Australia was the Achilles heel of Australia, the place at which the enemy would strike, and for that reason large military forces were sent there. Yesterday the press published a report which admitted that, at one period, Perth expected to be bombed by the enemy. Therefore, the launching of this proposal may represent the dawn of a new era of progress in Australia. If the establishment of an authority charged with the administration of these reforms should create any constitutional difficulties, the Commonwealth and the States should resolve all doubt by undertaking the work as a joint effort. That scheme would also give effect to the Government's policy of full employment. The development of Darwin as an airport and a seaport should proceed in conjunction with the development of the hinterland. One plan, which seems to be practicable, is the construction of a railway from Bourke to Darwin, connecting with the terminals of the railways in the hinterland of New South Wales and Queensland. That work would be a vital factor in the future development of those States, the Northern Territory and particularly the Barkly Tableland-the fertile area to which Mr Nelson T. Johnson, former United States Minister to Australia referred so favourably. According to expert opinion, the cost of that railway would be more than offset by the saving of livestock during drought. I hope that the Government will launch this scheme",32,Lazzarini

100,Mr Abbott (New England) [4.33]. For The Standardization Of Railway Gauges,"the Army has discovered, certain areas of the Northern Territory are suitable for irrigation. Each of the three main rivers of the Territory is approximately 300 miles long, and has a large catchment area. For example, the Roper River has approximately 19,000,000 acres, an area which is 2,000 square miles larger than Tasmania. Its basin receives an annual rainfall of more than 25 inches, and its tributaries, the Waterhouse and the ""Wilton, have an average rainfall of 40 inches. The Administrator pointed out that large areas of river flats in the Northern Territory could be irrigated. To the north of Australia lie rich potential markets in the Netherlands East Indies, and if the irrigable areas were developed, fruit and vegetables could be grown there and marketed in the East Cndies, in the same way as fresh fruit is sent from .South Africa, via the east coast shipping route, and sold to the teeming millions of India, through the markets of Bombay and Karachi. Tremendous development is possible in the northern areas of Australia, but it will not be achieved until local autonomy is given to that part of the country. Mr tion with the rest of Australia and by V. O. Thompson advpcated that the area to be known as Northern should consist of all the territory north of a line drawn from a point just north of Bowen in Queensland, to Port Hedland in Western Australia. Having in mind the potentialities of the Northern Territory, I regret that the bill does not go a good deal further, and that a comprehensive plan has not been formulated along the lines that I have mentioned. The 130,000 residents of Queensland should be given an opportunity to state whether they desire to be detached from the State of Queensland and absorbed in Northern Australia. If the proposed northern area were given local autonomy, I am confident that it would develop rapidly, just as Victoria and Queensland developed after they were detached from New South Wales and given local autonomy. Naturally, the Parliament of the Commonwealth would have to be prepared to face a big capital expenditure in developing Northern Australia. Progress has not been satisfactory Mr Abbott. to date because of the lack of communications. Australia has four reasons for attempting in future to develop this Territory to the greatest possible extent! The first is to ensure our defence. This door a catchment area of to Australia must not be left wide open in future. Fifty or 100 years hence, Australia may again he threatened with invasion from the north, and it would be a great safeguard if the northern areas were fairly well populated so as to absorb the first impact of the attack. The second point is that the northern area is capable of great pastoral development and has vast mineral resources. In addition, people could make a good living on the irrigable areas. The third point is that it would bring wealth to the country by increasing production there. The fourth point is that it would be a great area for settling the people who, we hope, will migrate here from overseas. Justice must he done to the people of Darwin by compensating them adequately for the acquisition of their property. I shall support the bill in the hope that, in future, the Government will bring down legislation for the development of that area by establishing railway communicaadopting a policy for exploiting the Australia latent wealth of the Northern Territory. It was refreshing to hear the speech of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), after listening to another honourable member opposite who spoke earlier. The honourable member for New England realizes that the bill has a definite purpose-the planning of DarNorthern win for the future. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) was thinking of the pre-war Darwin. Darwin, to-day, is entirely different from the town we knew before it was occupied by the armed forces. Prewar Darwin was dirty. No other word could adequately describe it. It musl have been offensive to people who arrived in Australia by the Empire Air Service. I can imagine what they thought when their first view of Australia was Darwin, when I recall how Cavanagh-street and other dirty corners of that carelessly controlled town looked before the war Realizing the great importance of this",34,Lazzarini
101,Mr Chambers (Adelaide) [4.46],"Australian port, the Government desires to plan the development of Darwin on attractive modern lines. The Commonwealth now has a great interest in Darwin and the surrounding territory. It has expended more than £1,000,000 on the construction of a bitumen road between Alice Springs and Darwin. Before the war, few people ever considered travelling overland from Alice Springs to Darwin because they thought that the country was almost impassable by motor car. But to-day, convoys set out daily for Darwin from Alice Springs. During the war the Government has expended millions of pounds on the construction of aerodromes, bridges and other assets. The honourable member for Moreton said that he hoped that the Government would make provision for aerodromes to be constructed in and around Darwin in the post-war period. I was amazed, that any member of this Parliament should make such a statement. Aerodromes comparable with any in other parts of Australia have been built in the Northern Territory between Alice Springs and Darwin. The honourable member spoke of heavily loaded aeroplanes. The heaviest aircraft that have visited Australia have landed on the Royal Australian Air Force aerodrome at Darwin, which is one of the best in Australia. The Commonwealth Government has a very great interest in Darwin. Realizing how close we were to disaster through lack of properly organized defence when Japan struck at Darwin, we must appreciate the vital need to provide for the adequate defence of this front door to Australia and to encourage settlement in that area. The figures mentioned by the honourable member for New England were illuminating. They proved that, over many years, the population of the area scarcely increased because of the lack of development. It is the intention of this Government, as it should be the intention of every future government, to ensure that Darwin is developed according to' a proper plan. In order to do this, it is necessary to acquire land, and it is important that the. land-owners should be adequately compensated for the improvements which they have made, [f that be done, I do not believe that anybody will complain about this bill. I am certain that most honourable members visualize a greater and more importantDarwin with a vastly increased population. Improvements which have already been made in that area by the Commonwealth Government should be maintained. I am sure that the future importance of Darwin will encourage closer settlement, thus obviating the recurrence of the danger that faced us when Japan struck in that area earlier in the war. 1 believe that this bill heralds the growth of a modern Darwin of which we shall be proud, when its harbour and aerodromes will ibe busy with traffic from the outside world. I am pleased that the recently appointed Minister for the Inferior( Mr Johnson) understands Australia and Australian sentiment. I believe that he will be a great asset to the Government, and we are fortunate that he is in charge of this bill. This bill to authorize the acquisition by the Commonwealth of approximately 90 square miles of land in the township area of Darwin is badly conceived. I congratulate the new Minister for the In terior ( Mr Johnson) upon his recent elevation to the Ministry. ""We are fortunate to have as Minister for the Interior a man who understands conditions in the Northern Territory and the problems of its residents. I am confident that he will be sympathetic to the claims of Darwin residents', but he will be obliged to administer his department according to the policy of the Government, which, in this instance, is designed to destroy the rights of many people who have lived in Darwin for a long time. These people had' sufficient vision to realize that some day Darwin would be a great town and that land values would rise. They took up land and many of them have spent a great part of their lives there under unsatisfactory conditions. Now the Government proposes to take over their land. The bill is drafted purely to protect the interests of the Government and to implementits policy without consideration for the welfare of the pioneers of tie area. Unfortunately, the Government has the numerical strength required to pass the bill through this House. Certain additional provisions should be",35,Lazzarini
102,Mr Rankin (Bendigo) [4.55],"included in it. The people whose land is to be acquired have practically no representation in this Parliament, and, as far as I know, the Government has not consulted them regarding the lines on which the town should be rebuilt. This action is being taken at an inconvenient time for these people, because their representative in this House is not able to push their claims, having unfortunately been a prisoner of war for three years. In these circumstances, the Government should have conferred with the people who are vitally concerned in the matter. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) said that the Government had a great interest in Darwin. I agree with him. But the people who were responsible for its development up to the present also have a great interest in the town. The Government has already resumed large areas of land in the Darwin district. Erom information in my possession, and from the reports of people who have visited the town, I believe that the Commonwealth has almost sufficient land for aerodromes, public buildings, and public utilities. The Government says that it is essential, in the interests of town-planning, to take over the land referred to in this bill, even if it does so without considering the interests of the land-owners. However, the Townplanning Association of New South Wales, which was consulted on this matter on a previous occasion and which reported to the Commonwealth Government, says that the acquisition of this land is not essential. It claims that, under the building regulations, the Government has all the power that it requires to resume such properties as may be needed for the construction of roads and other utilities and the developconsideration would be given to the appliment of a properly planned town. Although Mr Mclnnes has made a good and comprehensive report, this matter should not be left in the hands of one man. The planning of our great national capital was the subject of a world-wide competition, which was open to all architects and town-planners. The successful competitor was an American. I believe that Darwin will he another great city. There is talk of expending -The honourable member may not cite £7,000,000 on its development. I imagine instances of that kind extensively. Mr Rankin. that the Government has no intention of expending this amount at the present time, because, obviously, it would be stupid even to consider doing so. One man should not be allowed to direct the planning of the future great city which will stand at the northern gateway to Australia. His plan may be reasonable, but it may not be the best. The Government should withdraw this bill, and consult the Northern Territory Developmental League, all organized 'bodies interested in Darwin, and the owners of the freehold of the land affected, who went there in the belief that they would eventually benefit from their own courage and foresight in pioneering the area. I do not expect the present Minister to be a pocket Mussolini, and I do not fear that he will do what the Department of the Interior did in connection with the resumption of land required for the Essendon aerodrome. One resident in my district had bought four blocks of land, for which he had paid £252, and, although he had paid rates and taxes on the land for years, he was offered the magnificent sum of £18 for his property. He did not even receive from the department courteous replies to his letters. In another instance, Mrs. C. S. Paynter, of Echuca, had bought land at Black Rock on the 4th December, 1933, for £300, and had paid rates and taxes on it, but had derived no income from it..

103,Mr Speaker (Hon. J. S. Rosevear).,"such cases, but I have given two typical instances of the treatment received by land-owners from two separate government departments. This treatment does not encourage men to believe that they will get a f a i r deal from government departments, or from officials who apparently have no sympathy for those who believe that the fact that they have assisted in the pioneering of the Darwin area justifies them in expecting a reasonable reward. The building regulations operating in Darwin are adequate, because no person may erect a building which is not approved by the Chief Medical Officer and the Administrator. I see no justification for the acquisition of this land by the Government and for the proposed alteration of the system of land tenure in the area.

I congratulate him on his appointment, and wish him luck in his administration. But I regret that this is only a piecemeal proposal. It is worthwhile noting that there are two issues in the bill. The first, with which everybody agrees, is the replanning of Darwin. The second is the conversion from freehold to leasehold tenure of land owned by persons who had lived there for 40 or 50 years. Surely persons who have spent that length of time in the Territory are entitled to some voice as to the conditions under which they are to live in the future! If the Minister were proposing to deal not only with Darwin but also with the Northern Territory as a whole, one might agree to leasehold tenure being a part of the general plan. But when the proposal does not embrace action in regard to the development of Darwin's back country, the people should have a voice as to whether, after their evacuation, they shall return to freehold or leasehold tenure. That is particularly true because the residents of the Northern Territory are at present disfranchised, their representative being a prisoner of war. In default of Mr a municipality at least 24 years before Blain's presence in this Parliament to put their point of view, this matter of leasehold tenure might well ibe left in abeyance. If that were done, I should not oppose the bill. I have seen many false starts made in connection with the development of the Northern Territory. As Treasurer, I was responsible for finding the money for continuing the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. We also introduced the legislation under which every ten years the big leases are reviewed with the idea of their being subdivided for the use of smaller holders. In the late twenties, we appointed a North Australia Commission which was to be an executive body to carry out proposals for the development of the area, but unfortunately it had just presented its proposals to Parliament, when the depression came, and nothing could he done. The population of the Northern Territory has grown very slowly. Indeed, at times, it has declined, as the following figures show:1901 .. 4,096 1911 .. 3,310 1921 .. 3,857 1936 ... .. 5,454 Thus, during a period of 35 years, the population of the Territory increased by only 1,350, despite the fact that considerable sums of money had heen expended on developmental undertakings. I maintain that if the value of property in Darwin has increased, those men who held out there through all t£e years should be entitled to benefit. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) said that property-owners were entitled, to know under what conditions they would return to Darwin. I suggest that residents, who were disturbed by the war, are entitled to return under at least as good conditions as they enjoyed when they left. Indeed, the conditions laid down now may be a factor in deciding whether they return or not. Fifty years ago, when I first came to Sydney, land in the suburb of Neutral Bay was held under 99 years lease from the Ashley-Cooper family. Aa a result, the suburb stagnated for many years, while the contiguous suburb of Mosman, which was farther away from the city, developed by leaps and bounds because it was freehold. It was declared Neutral Bay was, and Neutral Bay has never caught up with it, although freehold tenure was granted there many years ago. I agree that the leasehold system is satisfactory for pastoral purposes, but a man likes to own the freehold of the land upon which he builds his home, so that he may leave it to his family. This is a strong instinct in the hearts of all British people. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will give heed to the suggestion of the honourable member for Barker that before action is taken to acquire land the residents of Darwin should be given a hearing. Surely that is not too much to ask on behalf of people who are virtually disfranchised, and who have suffered the ravages of war as have the people of no other part of Australia. Residents of",41,Lazzarini
133,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [5.27],"other parts of Australia have benefited from the provision of amenities, in the form of roads, &c., constructed as a part of the nation's war effort, but it has never been suggested that they should not be entitled to whatever increment accrues to their property as a result. The people of Darwin, alone of all people in Australia, are to have applied to them the doctrine that they shall not benefit from war expenditure. During the war, the Stuart Highway and the Barkly Highway have been constructed, giving access to Darwin. However, in his last report, the Administrator of the Northeru down by the development of air services Territory sharply reminds us that the maintenance of these two great highways is, apparently, to be a responsibility of the Northern Territory. The taxes paid by residents of Darwin, and of the Northern Territory generally, will be devoted to this purpose. Surely, therefore, they should be entitledto any beneCrown, but I do not agree that the Gofit accruing from increased property values. The area of the Northern Territory is 523,000 square miles, but only in Darwin itself is there any freehold. Only 40 per cent, of the Territory, or 226,000 square miles, has been taken up. Of the balance, 67,000 square miles is an aborigines' reserve, 77,000 square miles is unoccupied, and 150,000 square miles is desert land. In the circumstances, this rush to grah the 90 square miles of freehold land in thetown of Darwin savours somewhat of using a steam hammer to crack a walnut, especially in view of the report of Mr Mclnnes that, for town-planning purposes, it would be necessary to acquire only five separate blocks. The Government should, bring down,a proposal for the development of the whole of the Northern Territory, a proposal in which the development of Darwin wouldi find its proper place. When we started expending money in the 1920 s on the extension of the railway ? from Katherine to Birdum, and Oodnadatta toAlice Springs, we believed that the Northern Territory was too big to beadministered from one place. We divided it into twoparts, one of which was administered from Darwin and the other from Alice Springs. I hope that, after the war, railways will be constructed to connect the pastoral lands of the Northern Territory with Queensland in Sir Earle Page. the east and with Wyndham in the west. In this way, we may hope to create a seventh State in the north. This would have the advantage, among others, of allowing us to increase the number of members of this Parliament, and, perhaps, to reduce the size of the enormous area represented by the Minister for theInterior, whoseelectorate, I believe, is the largest in the world. With propei development, it should be possible to run sheep in parts, of the Northern Territory, instead of cattle only. Already, the isolation of the Territory is being broken and the building of roads. If the Government proceeds with an effective scheme of development, and expends £10j000,000 or even £20,000,000, which will have the effect of increasing land values, I should not object to a proposal that the increment should go to the vernment should seize what increment has already accrued, seeing that it ha."" done nothing to develop the area. The people who have lived in Darwin for years are entitled to any benefits whicb might come to them as the result of their life's work, there. It is wrong that the freehold should be taken from them ai, this time, and in thisway. I am entirely in favour of town planning for Darwin, which must eventually become a' grea i airport as well as a naval base. Th'V town must be developed, so that peoplf who arrive there on their way to visit other parts of Australia will gain a good impression. In the meantime, the residents of Darwin should be consulted in order to learn their wishes regarding land tenure. It may be that they would prefer leasehold tenure, and, if so, I am quite easy about the matter. All sort? of proposals for post-war reconstruction will be put forward for all sorts of places. I believe that charity should begin ar home, and I hope that some of the postwar expenditure will take place in developing the Australian Capital Territory, as well as in the development of Darwin and the Northern Territory, so that both Territories may be shining examples to the rest of Australia. [5.44] I support the amendment of the 1 honourable member for Barker( Mr",42,Lazzarini
134,Mr Mcdonald (Corangamite),"Archie Cameron), mainly because the people who are most concerned, namely, the residents of Darwin, have not been consulted regarding the Government's proposal, although opinions have been obtained from high Army officers, members of the War Damage Commission, the Surveyor-General and all sorts of other people. I believe that had the present Minister for the Interior( Mr Hirings Committee offered to pay for it. Johnson) been in office when this proposal was first mooted, a different scheme would have been drawn up, because he understands the people of the outback, having been associated with them for so many years. Regarding assets, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) explained that under the regulations the War Damage Com,mission may pay only the prescribed amount of compensation, and I agree with that statement. But if that payment is the total amount that these people will receive, a grave injustice will be done to them. This is a special case which calls for additional compensation. A considerable portion of the money collected by the War Damage Commission will never be required to compensate the owners of property damaged or destroyed by enemy action; and the Government should accord generous treatment to those who desire to return to the Northern Territory, and erect residences similar to those which were destroyed. During the war, building fiosts have increased by from 50 to 75 per cent., and the amounts for which these people insured their homes will not defray the cost of rebuilding or replacing them. Many country people of a careful disposition have, during the last five years, increased their insurances on houses and buildings. They know that the cost of replacing those structures would substantially exceed the amount for which they were previously insured. The properties to be acquired in Darwin will be valued; and many owners of land and buildings throughout Australia have complained, with good cause, regarding valuations made by the Central Hirings Committee. Probably every honourable member can recall instances in his own electorate where he considered that an owner had been most unjustly treated. In one case, several acres of a property -the best portion-were acquired, and a dehydrating factory was erected on the land. Onions have been treated therean almost noxious trade-and the value of the remainder of the property has been affected. Although the factory has been in operation for two or three years, the owner of the land has not received any compensation for the area which was compulsorily acquired. He was entirely dissatisfied with the price that the Central The Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) has experienced in his own electorate dissatisfaction caused by the valuations placed on acquired property. All honourable members consider that those valuations were unfair. In Victoria at.present protests are being voiced because land belonging to servicemen has been compulsorily acquired by a Housing Commission. If this bill be passed in its present form, the Government will meet endless trouble. Before proceeding with this legislation, the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) should personally view the whole situation in Darwin. Possibly, the Minister for the Interior had no part in preparing this bill, and in his own interests, and because of the magnitude of the task which he has undertaken, he should agree to postpone the passing of this legislation until he obtains first-hand information about the situation. I am satisfied that the information which he would glean would be worthwhile, and every honourable member would be prepared to listen to his opinion of the .position, and probably agree with it. For that reason, the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barker should be accepted.

"" I am justified in saying that this bill, which provides for the acquisition of certain lands at Darwin, has had a fairly good reception. The criticisms that have been levelled at it relate more to what has happened under war-time regulations than to what is likely to happen under the bill.

""We cannot carry out our plans, either in the Northern Territory or elsewhere, with the 100 per cent, support of the people. However, most obstacles can be overcome, no matter how great they may be. On the subject of prices, I point out that these can be fixed by collaboration between the Department of the Interior, the War Damage Commission, and the Central Hirings Committee, always keeping in mind the fact that owners may appeal against decisions to the Supreme Court of the Territory and that I have already undertaken to consider appointing an independent tribunal where circumstances justify such action. I remind the honourable member for Barker and others who have criticized the bill that they are not alone in their sympathy for the pioneers of the outback country. I lived amongst those people for many years, and therefore I am conversant with their problem® and the disabilities from which they suffer. The development of this northern area will be a great advertisement for Australia. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) has told us that, when he entered Australia through Darwin, all he saw was a little old tin "" Chinatown "". That was a bad advertisement for this country. Under the bill, with properly supervised town-planning we can make a garden city of this town in its setting of a beautiful harbour and attractive surroundings, so that it will be a great advertisement for Australia. Criticism has been levelled at clause 4, which provides that the values of the land acquired will be assessed according to the values' prevailing at the date of acquisition. The calculated cost of acquisition is, as was stated in the ' second-reading speech, merely an estimate made by tbe Central Hirings Committee which may be varied according to circumstances. Action will be taken as soon as possible after the enactment of this bill to acquire the land under the Lands Acquisition Act. It has been stated that the cost of acquisition may involve the Commonwealth Government in expenditure amounting to £7,000,000. That statement did Dot originate from any Government source, as far as I have been able to ascertain. Naturally, a great deal of expenditure will be involved in the development of Darwin, but it is not possible at this juncture to forecast the amount of that expenditure. I have been asked when I will visit Darwin in company with the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman). I ami unable to speak for my colleague, but I shall take the first opportunity available to visit the area accompanied by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, in order to discuss problems and disabilities with the people on the spot. During the short time in which I have been Minister for the InteriorI have received a number of inquiries from persons who are anxious to return to the Territory. Neither the Government nor the Opposition should suggest any delay in implementing this measure. I urge that the bill be passed, and I give an assurance that even at this late period a genuine effort will be made further to develop the Northern Territory and increase its population, as a result of the expenditure proposed to be undertaken in Darwin and adjacent areas.

[8.24J -Before the committee is asked to vote money, it is usual for a Minister to state what amount is proposed to be expended, and for what purpose it is required, hut we have not been told how much of the total expenditure is to he incurred at Darwin. I compliment the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) upon his maiden speech as a Minister, but, like most of his colleagues, he is singularly uncommunicative on matters on which members of the Opposition desire to be informed. Only this afternoon I submitted seven points, and I asked that information on them be supplied in the Minister's reply to the debate on the motion for the second reading of the bill, but no attempt has heen made to answer my questions. The nearest approach to dealing with any of them was the Minister's statement that at some time convenient to him he proposes to visit the Territory. The committee is at least entitled to some enlightenment as to the amount which the Government expects to McDonald, A. M . expend in the reconstruction of Darwin, Page, Sir Earle and for what purposes the money to be Rankin, G. J. provided by this bill is to be used. We Spender, P.

J. have looked askance at any government proposal which afforded so little information as has been furnished in connection with this proposed large expenditure of public money. Will the Minister give an indication of the amount which it is estimated will be required under this bill ? committee (Consideration of for the Interior and Minister assisting the Minister for Works and Housing) [8.27] -Neithe r the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) nor the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) appears to have studied clause 5 of the bill. The Minister who introduced the measure estimated that the cost to the Government would be about £500,000, and in referring to the matter to-night I stated that that sum could be regarded as only an estimate. Clause5 sets out the purposes for which the money is to he voted. It is seldom possible to give a precise estimate of the cost of undertakings of this kind, particularly a proposal such as the acquisition of lands in and around Darwin. Therefore, I claim that the case in support of the bill has been properly presented to honourable members. [8.28] I claim that the proposal has not been presented to us as it should have 'been. In the course of his second-reading speech, the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lazzarini) saidI t is not possible at this stage to give a firm estimate of the cost of the proposed acquisition, but the following tentative figures, prepared by the Central Hirings Committee,, wil l give some indication of the post involved: -Unimprove d value of 'and, £.150.000; value of improvements, £500.000: total, £650,000.

This is only the first step on a very long journey. The Government desires to acquire lands for a certain purpose, but honourable members have not been told what that purpose is. Nor do we know what the ultimate cost will be. We have been treated with scant consideration. Take the point just made by the Minister, which is only a repetition of the statement of his colleague when introducing the measure-that the amount mentioned is only an estimate of the Central Hirings Committee. That body is not responsible to this Parliament. We do not know who composes the committee, or what it does. All that honourable members know is that, in consequence of its operations, there is one great "" shindy"" from one end of the Commonwealth to the other in regard to the purchase and hiring of land and. buildings. Every honourable member has received complaints in regard to its operations. Therefore, the statement that the Central Hirings Committee has pr&pared the figures makes us more suspicious. The Minister, in replying to the second-reading debate, said that there was no ministerial authority for the statement that the expenditure ar. Darwin would total £7,000,000. I am glad to hear that. But he did not say whether the expenditure might he £5,000,000 or £10,000,000, nor did he give the slightest hint as to ihe probable amount. I have a strong suspicion that the present Ministry is entangled in a great chain of committees in connection with matters affecting the Northern Territory, and has not the foggiest notion as to what is their cost, either singly or combined. Therefore, the committee ought to have more information on this matter than so far has been given to it. I have already said that so much money is involved that the proper course would be for the Government to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee, in order that it might be properly investigated. Supposedly under the pressure of necessity, the Government has entered into too many commitments of this description. There is no urgency for the acquisition of this land. That will not accelerate by one second the return of any resident to the Darwin area. All that is required to achieve that object 13 to remove the military control which prevents residents from returning at the present time. Whilst the new Minister is to be congratulated on his maiden speech in his present capacity, it is rather unfortunate that the first measure of which he bas had charge should contain provisions that are quite at variance with those that we are accustomed to consider. Only yesterday, we discussed a measure providing for drought relief, which contained an upper limit to the amount which the Government can allocate to that purpose. This bill, as its title states, is to authorize the acquisition by the Commonwealth, for certain purposes, of land, &c, in the Darwin area. No indication has been given of how far the Government can or will go, and no control by the Parliament of the expenditure to be incurred will be possible. amount proposed to be expended will have to be appropriated. the amount should be given in this bill. The Minister who has just interjected said, in his second-reading speech, that the cost would be about £650,000, oi which £200,000 would be met by the War Damage Commission. He went on to sayThus it would appear that the net cost to the Commonwealth of the acquisition may not exceed £500,000. If the Minister is confident of that, let him fix £600,000, or any other sum he likes to name, as an upper limit. It is the prerogative of the Parliament to vote sums for specified purposes. In fact, it is one of the duties of the Parliament to control the public purse. Any money voted for the acquisition of land in the Northern Territory, for drought relief, or for any other purpose, ought to be named in the legislation governing the matter. I cannot-recall an instance of a maximum sum not being specified. Eor all we know, the cost in this instance could be £10.000,000, without the Parliament being able to exercise any control at the present juncture.

Clause3 provides that the lands in question may be acquired by agreement or compulsory process. How would it be possible to name specifically the amount that may be fixed by an agreement that has not yet been made? No doubt the Government will approach the property owners, many of whom will agree to the compensation to be paid. But protracted negotiations may be involved, and until they have been completed the Government will not know the total amount of compensation. Clause4 providesThe value of any land acquired in pursuance of this Act by compulsory process shall, did not state how much money it was notwithstanding the provisions of section twenty-nine of the Act, be assessed according to the value of the land on the date of acquisition, without reference to any increase in value arising from the proposal to carry out any purpose specified in section three of this Act. That is the usual provision -in connection with resumptions of land. It is obvious that a property-owner should not derive benefit from public works that have I'uhanced the value of his land. The Government itself should reap the benefit arising from its own expenditure. How, I ask, can the Minister say just how much will have to be paid out in compensation'? In the first instance, values are fixed by a local valuator, but if the owner is not satisfied he may take the matter to court. The case might even go as far as the High Court, so that the issue would not be settled for a year, or perhaps two. Honourable members opposite are obdurate in their determination to prevent the passage of the bill. Their reason is not apparent now, but it may become apparent later. They need have no fear that the money will not be expended wisely. The administration of the scheme will be in the hands of the Minister for the Interior, who was formerly Chairman of the War Expenditure 'Committee. We know how, in that capacity, he was always anxious to ensure the wise expenditure of public moneys. When it became known that he had embarked upon a particular inquiry, some, of those engaged in war industries hastened to disgorge their ill-gotten gains. Mr Chairman walling now ? hear the charge that honourable members on this side of the House' are stonewalling a bill. This afternoon, it seemed as if the bill would pass its third reading quite soon, but for some unexplained reason honourable members opposite then began to display an extraordinary interest in the measure, with the result that the debate was dragged on beyond the dinner suspension. The honourable member .for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) and others complained that the Minister proposed to appropriate. On this point, the Minister who introduced the bill saidI t is not possible at this stage to give a firm estimate of the cost of the proposed acquisition, but the following tentative figures already been read three times. will be necessary to read it a dozen times before honourable members opposite will be able to understand it. I ask the honourable member not to read the statement again. you will allow me to read the figures only. The Minister said that the unimproved value of the land to be acquired was £150,000, and the value of the improvements £500,000, making a total of £650,000. The Minister then saidAgainst this sum the Commonwealth is already committed to an expenditure in the vicinity of £200,000 for damage by enemy action, fire, demolitions, occupation, &c. Thusi t would appear that the net cost to the Commonwealth of the acquisition may not exceed £500,000. Honourable members opposite have repeatedly told us that they are interested in the proper planning of Darwin. So, too, are honourable members on this side of the House.

I can deal with only two or three of them in the limited time at my disposal, but I have no doubt that other honourable members will deal with the others. The Minister submitted a very ingenious argument designed to show that there is a subsidy hidden in the air mail contracts. Honourable members may recall that somebodyI trust not the Minister himselfdiscovered the name of some writer Lissitzynin, and quoted him. aviation circles. he has been known to the Minister? very heavily on him for the doctrines he put forward. The centre of the Minister's argument wasThe truth is that air mail payments are fixed at a rate which bears no relation to the service rendered. There is the whole essence of his case. If he is wrong on that, all of his argument, Lissitzynin thrown in , disappears. He is bound to establish to us that air few years from the middle of 1936 until the end of 1944, the progress made in civil aviation by that one enterprise alone was nothing short of phenomenal. Any government which had established civil airlines and could produce a record like that over the same period would be publishing it from every hoarding as a demonstration of the enormous skill with was 7,293,000 lb.

I shall deal with the facts of that matter. In 1940, when the air-mail rates were being fixed, there was correspondence between the company which I am discussing at the moment Australian National Airways Limited-and the Department of Civil Aviation. It was conducted by the Director-<General of Civil Aviation at that time, MrA . B . Corbett, and the representatives of the company. On the 9th March, 1940, Mr Corbett wrote to the companyIn general terms your Company would be paid for services rendered in carrying mails I wonder how long on an agreed basis . . . On the 30th March the company wrote The Minister relied My board feels that it cannot but reiterate that in its opinion the only logical and equitable basis upon which computations can be made is value for services rendered. The company was putting the very principle upon which the Minister now seeks to rely in order to refute its claims.

173,Back To Mr Corbett,"In reply the post office expresses the similar view tliat the basis for computation should be on the cost of services rendered. The view of the post office is that the revenue earned by airmails cannot logically determine the payment for carriage of airmails. It w ill be noted that tbey used the word "" c o s t b u t the context shows that they mean "" value "". On the 10th A p r i l , the My board is pleased to note that the department now apparently accepts the basis of value for services rendered as being the correct basis for computation for the lb. mile rate. There we had the three relevant partiesthe Department of Civil Aviation, the Post Office, and the company-agreein g that the basis should be the one which the Minister now contends for, and it was upon the basis so fixed that the poundage rates were worked out. Not only were they worked out then w it h the concurrence of the Government, but also they have ever since remained under the control of the Government. All I need to add to that is that, with growing business, that rate has been twice voluntarily reduced by the company itself. Airmails are now being carried at the rate of 4s. 3d. per lb. On the average there are 42 air-mail letters to 1 lb. The Government eharges the ordinary age of 2£d., plus a surcharge That 2£d. covers the whole of the normal costs of the Post Office. All the other costs of collection, carriage by air, and delivery at the other end are borne by the air-mail contractor. honourable members will see that 42 letters to the lb. will mean 10s. 6d. revenue to the lb. What becomes of the 10s. 6d.? The Government that the air-mail companies get too much. But, of the 10s. 6d., the Post Office retains Is -largely, luck-the 4s. 3d., and the Department Aviation receives 5s. 3d. for tion purposes of its own. The rate3 charged by Australian are, in fact, the lowest rates charged by any air-mail contractors in the world. They are certainly lower than the rates charged in the United States of America. That is a very remarkable thing when we recall that, in the United America, which is, I suppose, as advanced in civil aviation as any country in the Mr Menzies. world, the cost of petrol and oil per mile for a Douglas DC3, to take an ordinary standard type of aircraft, is 6.86d. Australian, whereas the cost to Australian National Airways Limitedi n Australia is 21.9d. Notwithstanding that the outlay on that very important item in Australia is three times as great as in the United States, the air-mail rate in Australia is lower than the rate in America. On top of that, the Australian companies pay in taxation, petrol duty, sales tax, primage, &c, substantially more than £1,000,000 a year to the Treasury. So that honourable members may see how that works out, I point out that, in the last three completed years, the airlines received £1,723,000 and the Government received £3,103,000, the Government thus making a profit on the air-mail transaction of 1 £1,380,000 over the period. The Minister felt the pressure of that because he knew these facts, and so he producedi n his speech, much to my astonishment, and. indeed', to my disappointment, the quibbling statement that the Government has not received anything back from the airline companies because the Government revenue is received from the Post Office, not from the airlines. W it h great stamprespect to the honourable gentleman, that of 3d. is just twaddle. What is the position? The ordinary stampage of 2^d. pays the handling costs of the Posit Office, whilst the 3d. surcharge not only pays for the cost of the air-mail IfI put the 2£d. on one side, transport and handling but also provides a handsome subvention to the Department of Civil Aviation. In 1943, that department, expended on revenue purposes the says now, apparently, sum of £940,000, and it received from the air-mail surcharge a total of £1,058,000. In 1944 it expended a little I should think, for more than £1,250,000, and received air-mail contractor receives £1,680,000 from the air-mail surcharge. of CivilI n other words, at present the budget of administrathe Department of Civil Aviation is paid for by the air-mail surcharge, w it h a airline operators profit over and above that of the better part of £500,000. Is there any other way in which it can be said that there is a subsidy to the airlines in Australia? If honourable members w i ll look at the records which are available, they w ill see that, in States of the last two years, the direct subsidy to airlines of all sorts in Australia has fallen to £37,000 in each year.

176,Mr Menzies,"I think he wa*I again start at July, 1936. I have selected Tasmania, because there we have the most direct competition with shipping. There, if anywhere, we should find this stranglehold by the two shipping companies vitally interested in the Tasmanian trade manifesting itself. There, if anywhere, we should find them damping, down their business, because, I understand, that was their sinister design in becoming shareholders in Australian National Airways Limited. Yet in the first twelve months the total number of Bass Strait passengers was 6,650, and in the last period of twelve months 63,906. If there has been any strangling in that regard, I hope all' of us will have as mild a form of strangling applied to us when our time comes. myself and all sensible Australians.' The point, in any event, is a fantastic one. If any shipping company in the world failed to get into the field of aviation when it could, it would deserve to be driven out of business All people who are concerned with transport must have a fairly flexible mind in adopting modern methods of transport if they are ultimately to survive in a competitive world. Let me now turn to the other aspect of the matter, which was presented for the creation of sympathy towards the "" small pioneering enterprises "". I remind honourable members' that they were named by th^ Minister. Here we have, on his authority, the names of the small pioneering enterprises mopped up by Australian National Airways LimitedTasmanian Aerial Services Proprietary Limited. Holyman Airways Proprietary Limited. Adelaide Airways Proprietary Limited. Airlines of Australia Limited. New England. Airways Limited. Rockhampton Aerial Services Limited. Northern Queensland Airways Proprietary Limited. Tasmanian Aerial Services Proprietary the country. It is very easy nowadays Limited had become Holymian Airways to say of any proposal of the GovernProprietary Limited and was operating ment that it has some vital relation to under that name, so there were not two defence. The more honourable members of them, but only one of them. I am think about this proposal, the less will referring back to 1936. ""West Australian they be able to discover in what way it Airways Limited had been purchased by is related to defence. The service of the Adelaide Airways Limited. New Engsmall airline companies during the war land Airways Limited had become Airhas, in fact, been freely acknowledged by lines of Australia Limited, and the latter company had purchased Rockhampton Aerial Services Limited, and subsequently, after the formation of Australian National Airways Limited, but before becoming a member of it, had purchased Northern Queensland Airways Proprietary Limited. 'So the eightpioneering enterprises mopped up by this great monopoly turti out to be only three enterprises at the time Australian National Airways Limited was brought into existence. These enterprises between them were operating in various areas in Australia. One group was operating from Sydney northwards, one in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, and another on the South Australia-Western Australia route. If we were to have a proper link-up, particularly for air-mail services, the need sticks ouit a mile for the companies to get together and pool their resources, reduce overlapping, and be able to offer a first-class service to the people. As one little final fact I should like to mention that a suggestion has been made at various times that we should beware of the insidious influence of foreign capital in this industry. So the Minister will be relieved to be told by me that Airlines of Australia Limited, one of the small enterprises to which he referred, had as its majority shareholders in 1936 an American corporation, which held 70 per cent, of the stock. And one of the minor offencesI trust-of Australian National Airways Limited, was that it bought out the American holder, and so converted the 70 per cent, from an American to an Australian holding. I say no more about that, but leave the Minister and his supporters to ponder over it. I turn now to another point which the Minister made in the course of his attempted justification of this legislation; that is the point based' on the defence of",57,Australian National Airways Pty Ltd
177,Mr Lemmon,Speak for yourself.,58,Australian National Airways Pty Ltd
178,Mr Menzies,"I am speaking for the Minister in the course of his speech. It was civil aeroplanes, owned by these private companies, which proved to be of supreme value when the Pacific war broke out. If it can be believed that government ownership of the main-trunk Fervices, and private ownership of the feeder, subsidiary and developmental lines of Australia, ultimately will produce a greater volume of civil aircraft than would be the case if private ownership were left to do the whole work of development, then to that extent there will lie so many more aircraft and we shall be so'much better furnished than we otherwise would be. But it is impossible for any sensible person to believe that a hotch-potch system such as is. envisaged in this bill, with the Government owning the profitable trunk routes and private enterprise being left-n o doubt in some subsidized fashion-to carry on the developmental work, will ever produce any such result as that to which I have referred. A little while ago, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Eraser; whom I venture to describe with infinite submission as the rising hope of the stern, unbending socialists-wa s put up, quite obviously, to do a broadcast; and he did one. I am sure that it was excellently expressed. I am equally sure that it was hopelessly inaccurate. Obviously, he was speaking to the Government brief that the defence issue was most important. I quote his wordsFor national. survival, we must develop the countryside,, the inland, the isolated areas. industry in Australia had performed a That can only be done by publicly operated airways. A system operating for private profit concentrates on the already thickly populated routes. The bouquet of that is not to be missed. For the first time, I suspect the honourable member of humour; because, under this very bill with which we are now dealing, the development of the countryside, the inland, the isolated areas, is to be left to privately operated airways, whilst the publicly operated airways are. to concentrate on the already thickly populated routes! I do not know whether I. may take it, after that complete bouleversement, that national survival has been temporarily forgotten. The Minister, in his speech, got on to slightly Mr Mensfics. different ground, as well he might, by suggesting that puhlic ownership of interstate airlines will facilitate the Australian aircraft manufacturing programme. There is a good deal of nonsense talked on that subject, and it is about time the nature of the nonsense was pointed out. The total number of aircraft of all types, for all routes, required in Australia for the volume of traffic in sight and within measurable distance, probably would not exceed about 66, of which not more than 30 would be on the main trunk routes. The annual replacements of a fleet of that size, naturally, would be quite small. If civil aviation in Australia is to develop as we want it to develop, then we should not exclude ourselvesfrom obtaining the latest and best aircraft used elsewhere in the world. All of these considerations show that the defence argument is a myth. Confirmation of that can be obtained, of course, from the fact that in the United States of America, for example-whic h has some interest in defence and security-ther e has been a complete plumping for privately operated airlines. Great Britain has indicated the same policy, in its recent White Paper. To sum up, the truth is that there can be no defence advantage to any country like Australia, except from the most efficient civil aviation system that can be devised. In another part of his speech, my friend the Minister-afte r admitting, as I have mentioned, that the civil aviation magnificent service during 'the war; those are his words-wen t on to emphasize that, especially during the war, the Government has been compelled to provide, at great cost, facilities of all kinds afl over the continent, in the form of airfields, hangars, workshops, radio equipment, meteorological services, and so on. Let me assume that that expenditure has some substantial relation to civil aviation. We all know that it has not, because probably 85 per cent, of it has a primary, if not a sole, relationship to military aviation. But assuming that it has some substantial relation to civil aviation, what ground does that afford for nationalization? Everybody knows that in Australia for many decades, governments, through apGovernment's provision of aerodromes propriate instrumentalities-board s and and services. The first is that, on the aerothe like-hav e provided wharfs, port dromes which are used for the services accommodation, navigational aids, and that are now being taken over by the so on, which private enterprise uses, payGovernment-that is, the interstate airing appropriate dues for their use. I lines-practicall y the whole of the have not the slightest doubt that that hangars, workshops, passenger accommois exactly what ought to be done in condation and the like, have been provided nexion with airfields. If flying comby private companies, to say nothing of panies are to use such airfields, they must the fact that the installation and testing pay proper dues for their use, as shipof radio aids was, as many honourable ping companies do for the wharfage members will recall, really pioneered by facilities that they enjoy. In the same the airline companies, in co-operation way, all governments in Australia, either with Amalgamated Wireless (Australthemselves or through local-governing asia) Limited. bodies or special boards, provide the roads on which motor transport runs. I stressed it earlier in this speechSo far, that has not been used as an is that the air mail surcharges earned argument for the nationalization of all through the airline companies more than road traffic; because common sense has provide for the whole of the expenditure indicated that the Government which from revenue, for all purposes, by provides such facilities may charge people for their use-by registration fees the 'Civil aviation Department.

The effect of the Government's proposals-and this is my second major reason for saying that they will stifle development-is that the Government will run the inter-capital trunk lines which are now payable lines, while all the feeder or subsidiary services are to be left in private hands. That set-up is not only not favorable to development, it, is definitely hostile to development. of traffic must be looked to in a balanced organization to provide profits to ' counteract the losses on developmental routes. Every transport enterprise, whether a railway system or any other, accepts losses on the swings in the hope that they wiW be made up on the roundabout, or the paying lines. Here, however, the Government is taking over the main routes, leaving the unprofitable business to the private companies. The effect of this will be that the unprofitable lines will cease to be operated, or Parliament will be asked to vote money to subsidize developmental work. Some analogy has been sought to be established with the railways, but nothing than to seek to justify the Government's the history of government in Australia. At least, it can be said of the railways that they pioneered an immense amount of back country development. The whole essence of government railway policy was that railways were pushed out into unsettled or sparsely settled country, which was thus opened up for population, so that the lines, from being non-paying, were eventually able to earn their proper share of revenue. In the present case, however, the whole process is to be reversed. The pioneering has not been done by the Government, but by private enterprise, and the Government is coming in only when the pioneering is finished, and the enterprise is profitable. It proposes to seize only Mr Menzies. that portion of the enterprise which isprofitable, namely, the main trunk routes, leaving the other routes to be carried on by private enterprise as best it may. No one can consider these facts without coming to the conclusion that the Government, without analysis, without reasoning, without any true technical support, has introduced a bill simply to give effect to its party constitution. This is essentially a bill inspired by academic motives. Nationalization is the Government's policy; therefore, let the airlines be nationalized. Has there been any examination of the facts? No. Has technical advice been received supporting the conclusion reached by the Government?' No. Nationalization is in the party conThe main routes stitution ; therefore, it is to be proceeded with. The most authoritative ""committee ever established in Australia to consider the future of civil aviation was the interdepartmental committee set up under the chairmanship of the then Director of Civil Aviation. [Extension of time granted.] It made a report which has been in the hands of the Government for a long time. It is quite true that, in the first instance, a report of such a kind is treated as a confidential document between the advisers of the Government and the Government itself; but in this instance, the Government has introduced legislation on this important matter, and I believe that Parliament is entitled to know what the experts, whose salaries the could be more ridiculous public pays, have to say on the subject. Although the Government has had proposals by reference to the report in its hands for many railways months, it has persistently refused to table it for the guidance of honourable members or interested persons outside Parliament. It is true that the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Forde),. with his usual dash, proceeded one afternoon to quote in this House from the report. When my alert colleague, the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) drew attention to the Standing Orders, and said that the document, having been quoted from by a Minister, should be tabled, the Deputy Prime Minister had to be given four separate hints in a hoarse whisper as to what answer he should give, namely, that he was to refuse to table the report on the grounds that it was a confidental document. It was the first time in my parliamentary experience that a senior Minister had quoted freely from a document, and then claimed that the document was confidential. However, the report has not .been tabled, and honourable members have to act without it, but there is a very widespread and reasonable belief that it has not been tabled because it gives no support to the proposals which the Government has put before us in this bill. Therefore, the choice is either a dull adherence to academic socialist theory for its own sake or a realistic approach to the actual and rapidly changing needs of the people in the world of modern transport and communication.

A t times he has accused me of being a socialist; but he would be the first to admit that I can define socialism, and really know what it means. Why, an anti-Labour government in Victoria established the State Electricity Commission in 1919. Later, the Leader of the Opposition became first a supporter of, and then a Minister in, an anti-Labour government in Victoria. Did that Go% vernment admit that, when it set up the State Electricity Commission to supply electricity throughout Victoria, it was socialization? It was not socialization; it was nationalization an entirely different matter. The Leader of the Opposition said also that nothing had happened in the history of civil aviation in Australia to justify the nationalization of interstate airlines. nationalized all industries, would that be socialization? The Leader of the Opposition proceeded to describe the expansion of air transport in Australia as if it were something unique. In point of fact, because of the development of aircraft production, there has been a huge expansion of air traffic in every country. In Canada, where airlines are nationalized, the expansion of revenue miles flown is comparable with the expansion in Australia. So that, in itself, does not provide any justification for not nationalizing the interstate airlines here. This campaign of misrepresentation has been supported almost everywhere by the metropolitan press. We expected that, because the press itself constitutes a near-monopoly in this country. In fact, the tactics of tactics of the private airline operators. The press is endeavouring to obtain complete control of all the channels of news, including control of the ether itself, by buying up broadcasting stations breach of his throughout the country. propose to nationalize them, too? gentleman will not be a member of the next Parliament, he will not be interested in what the Government does. It was notsurprising that the press of this country should support the misrepresentations that are being made by private airline operators. The Leader of the Opposition is displaying boundless energy these days in persuading the party which he leads to adopt a new name, and to turn from its unfortunate and less successful ways of the past into paths of seeming righteousness. I am surprised that that political party, renamed Liberal, should lend itself to the support of a monopoly such as that which is growing up in the conduct of airline enterprises in Australia. I suspect that his zeal in organizing this new party, and in taking up this matter in this House, is not unconnected with his awareness of the fact, that an election will be held next year. I am surprised that the right honourable gentleman has seen fit to associate himself with the misrepresentations that the Government I have mentioned. His support of private airline operators in Australia comes very strangely after the clear statement made by the Minister for Air that it is on record that, in 1943, the right honorahle gentleman stated in his policy speech that he had little fault to find with government control of great public utilities. In other words, he believes in government control of great public utilities like the railways and the supply of electricity in Victoria. But when it comes to tlie control of the airlinesservices of this country, which are undoubtedly a great public utility, he immediately condemns the Government's proposals as socialization.

Several Royal Australian Air Force accidents have been investigated, and, in particular, the causes to go back to the shareholders in the of the crash of the Stimson air liner were determined by a combination of structural and metallurgical work. This focussed attention on the need for intensive investigation into the fatigue strength and consequent life of aircraft structures. Private enterprise cannot conduct their services unless they have at their disposal all the technical information and advice that is available from this important research organization. Its activities also .include work on the life of cylinder materials, in order to facilitate the manubeneficiaries, as far as the profits of the facture and reclamation of cylinders by chromium plating. Mr Deputy Speaker, to the fact that a lady in the public gallery is taking notes. Is that permissible? Riordan) notes in this chamber, except the press gallery, would be indulging in a practice which has been regarded in the past as discourteous. If the person indicated by the honourable member is taking notes, I ask her to cease doing so. that the airlines of this country constitute present monopoly. I am quite certain a monopoly. Monopolies arise in various ways. Sometimes they are brought about by the amalgamation or absorption of small independent undertakings, and I cannot follow the argument of the Leader of the Opposition when he said that, instead of tbere being seven independent airline operators, there are, in fact, only three. Then he proceeded to describe the very process by which the small independent companies were amalgamated and finally became one monopolistic concern. Another method by which monopolies arise is by the interlocking of directorates and the setting up of dummy companies between the original shareholders and the final monopolistic undertaking. That has happened in the setting up of the airlines monopoly which is operating in Australia at present. that a public enterprise of the kind proThe Minister for Air, in his statement to posed to be established under this bill the House, showed that the majority of the shares in Australian National Airways Limited are held in fact by shipping companies. To discover the shareholders who finally dlraw the dividends, we have companies themselves. To say that a monopoly concern of this kind can be conducted more efficiently than a government enterprise is to ignore all the experience of other countries with regard to such enterprises. It has been pointed out by many students of industrial organization that there is very little difference between a large modern industrial company and a public enterprise itself. Of the thousands of shareholders of these shipping companies who are the ultimate monopoly are concerned , how many of 1 them know who are the directors of Australian National Airways Limited, or how many of them take any interest in the operation or management of the company? They leave that to experts, and that is exactly what the Government pro-Any person taking shorthand lines Commission to undertake this task consist of experts who will be capable of operating the interstate airlines with the utmost efficiency. They will manage this public enterprise as efficiently as those who are operating the that much of the opposition to this measure arises because the Government is determined that, wherever a monoply is necessary from the point of view of efficiency, it will be a government monopoly rather than one conducted by private enterprise for the profit of private individuals.. On all occasions, when the Government takes a progressive step, as it has done by this bill, and makes an attack on vested interests, we are sure to hear objection from members of the Opposition, who have an entirely different political philosophy from that of members of the Labour party. They believe in private enterprise monopolists, and, of course, they will always oppose measures of this kind. The Leader of the Opposition said",64,Australian National Airways Pty Ltd

205,Mr Spender.,Who are they?,65,Australian National Airways Pty Ltd
206,Mr Dedman,"The commission willcould not be conducted so efficiently as the airline services are conducted to-day. In Canada, where these services are provided by public enterprise as opposed to private enterprise, they are conducted just as efficiently asin Australia at present under private control. An act of Parliament creating the transCanadian airline service was passed in 1937. and during the six years in which it has operated the service has proved a valuable and dependable public utility. Handicapped as it has been, and still is, by the demands of war on personnel and equipment, it has endeavoured to maintain the high standard of essential industry, and Jay a sound foundation for the future development, of aviation in Canada. Honourable members opposite always contend that a government is unable to run such enterprises at a profit. by the Leader of the Opposition is The results of operations in Canada show quite clearly that national airlines are run at a profit. In 1942, the operating revenues amounted to $7,337,000 whilst operating expenses amounted to ing $214,000 for income charges and interest on capital invested, the operations showed a net surplus of approximately $500,000. the fares charged in one country with those charged in another country, but the results of the operations of a public enterprise in Canada with those obtained by private enterprise in the same field in Australia. As I said earlier, the increase of revenue-miles flown in Canada is comparable with the increase of revenue miles flown in Australia. Honourable members opposite contend that the Government's proposals amount to confiscation. In exercising its powers under the Constitution, this Government will acquire whatever property it needs in order to carry on this enterprise, and it will pay fair compensation to the owners of such property. Therefore, the issue of confiscation does not arise at all. Those who oppose the Government's proposals have misrepresented the position in this respect, in order to lead the peonle to believe that the Government is afting unfairly towards those who already own property in the industry. HBO] The Minister for Air pointed out that this measure is related to the defence of the Commonwealth. That purpose is set out in the preamble to the measure. The Government wishes to provide for the maintenance and development of the defence forces of the Commonwealth in relation to the development of Australia by air; and the establishment of plant and equipment necessary for that purpose is assured^ The Leader of the Opposition endeavoured to show that that argument was groundless. Tie said that the total number of aircraft which would be needed in this country for some years to come would be only 66, and that the number of replacement machines which would be required annually would be very small indeed. That may be true. I do not know whether the figure cited correct; but it is obvious that a position might arise whereby the production of that number of aircraft, however small, plus the production of aircraft required $6,000,000, and, after allowfor military purposes might be sufficient to build up in this country a very efficient aircraft production industry. The Government has that objective in mind. I believe that the Government, by taking over control of interstate airlines, will provide a substantial inducement for the production of aircraft which, together with production required for defence purposes, will provide the nucleus of an aircraft production industry. In that way it will keep the industry going in ihe years following the war. The maintenance of such a nucleus will enable us to expand the industry in years to come should such expansion be necessary to the future defence of Australia. Criticism has been levelled against the Government's proposals on the ground that efficiency of management and service to the public suffers because public enterprises are too careless, and in this respect do not compare with private enterprise. My experience of the running of airlines by private enterprise in Australia has not been happy. The service rendered by existing companies, and the attention they pay to the needs of clients, could be very greatly improved. Time and time again, although the operating company knew that I could easily be contacted",65,Australian National Airways Pty Ltd

A very great improvement could be effected in that respect, and I believe that such an improvement will be effected when the airlines are taken over by the Government. That is another reason why I wholeheartedly support the bill. The measure is directly related to the Government's policy of providing full employment. Honourable members will recall that the White Paper on full employment sets out that employment depends upon expenditure of various forms on capital goods and consumption goods by the public at large and by governments. The paper pointed out that one of the strategic forms of expenditure is that undertaken by governments, and that should other forms of expenditure fall off at any time, with a consequent threat of unemployment, expenditure by governments could arrest that tendency and obviate unemployment. Civil aviation is one avenue in which public expenditure could be incurred in such a contingency in our economy. Expenditure on the development of more airlines and up-to-date aerodromes could be undertaken in relation to a policy of providing full employGippsland wants water supply scheme? ment. That is another reason why I believe that the control of airlines in this country should be transferred to the Government. The Leader of the Opposition, as I have said, supported some of the misrepresentations that have been made in the press during recent months with regard to the Government's proposals. The press has misrepresented the degree of competition in interstate airlines. That is amply borne out by the actual development of this industry in recent years, as revealed by the Minister for Air. The main reason for the introduction of this bill can be stated briefly, and it will . SUPERANNUATION BILL 1945. be approved by the people. It is that when an industry develops to the stage amendments. Mr Dedman. at which naturally a monopoly can gjvia more efficient service than can be given by a number of independent companiet On those it should pass from private ownership to control by the Government. Thati * when it should be nationalized'. reason. Anyway, it is the main reason why this bill finds in me a strong supporter. The Leader of the Opposition tried to belittle the arguments of the Minister for Civil Aviation. In advanc ing his own arguments, he indulged in what I regard as misrepresentation of at least two matters. If the case in opposition to this bill cannot be better put and is not stronger than that presented by the right honourable gentleman, I have no fear about the outcome. In any case, there is no fear, because the Government and its supporters are unanimous in their desire that this measure be passed and implemented as soon as possible. They believe that it will help in the development of this country, help to bring about decentralization, and help to establish the nucleus of an industry that will assist in our defence should a need ever arise. For those reasons this bill should 'be strongly supported by many honourable members opposing it now merely for political purposes. It is too much to ask them to set aside political prejudice and do what is best for the country; but I appeal to them to reconsider their attitude. The honourable member for nationalized, but, when it comes to the airlines utility, equally important in the development of Australia, he, for some reason beyond my comprehension, is opposed to its being nationalized. He is not consistent, and I am afraid that it is useless to appeal to him for support. Fortunately, we do not need it. We have the numbers and the stronger arguments.

Was any arrangement as to purchase price made before purchase was effected? 4. Are there arrangements in existence for the importation of utility chassis? 5.

Does he propose to make a statement on this deal in all its aspects? 9. When will prices to retail traders be fixed? 10. W ill prices be subsidized? and Customs has supplied the following answers:1 and 2. The United Kingdom authorities indicated about May, 1944, the possibility of 8,000 u t i l it y vehicles and 10,000 passengercar chassis becoming available. Subsequently, the United Kingdom authorities advised that the man-power and materials position in the United Kingdom precluded the production of cars at that stage and also that only 2,500 utility type vehicles were available for export to Australia. The Commonwealth Government negotiated for these 2,500 utility type vehicles, of which 1,200 were fully assembled vehicles, including the cabs and bodies, and 1,300 were unassembled chassis only. The 1,200 f u l ly assembled u t i l i ty vehicles comprise-Austin, 10 h.p., 200; Morris, 10 h.p., 350; Hillman, 10 h.p., 250; and Standard, 12 h.p., 400. The majority of these have already arrived in Australia and the remainder are expected shortly. The unassembled vehicle chassis consist of 12-h.p. models and 1,300 were originally allocated to Australia. Of these, approximately 120 units have either already arrived in Australia or are due very shortly. As regards the remaining 1,180 unassembled chassis, the Commonwealth Government has indicated to the overseas authorities that it has no objection to importation proceeding through normal commercial channels. 3. The vehicles were obtained out of British Ministry of Supply contracts on a cost-plus basis. The final cost figures are not yet available. Endeavours were made to obtain details of purchase price immediately the negotiations commenced and over subsequent months. Price indications have been ohtaincd from the British Ministry of Supply through the High Commissioner's office, hut these are subject to adjustment on completion of the costinsr. At the time of commencement of the negotiations there was an urgent need for this type of vehicle. As the production lines were being changed over, it .was necessary to indicate at once whether Australia was prepared to accept these vehicles. 4. Other than the above there are no arrangements in existence for the importation by the Commonwealth Government from the United Kingdom of u t i l it y chassis for civilian sale. It is understood that arrangements are being made for commercial importation from the United Kingdom of utility-type chassis. Certain utility-type chassis of. greater carrying capacity and horse-power are, however, coining forward from Canada under Government to Government arrangements. 5. See answer to 1 and 2. Approximately 130 utility-type chassis have arrived from Canada recently. 6. No contract has been entered into by the Commonwealth with local manufacturers and/or distributors for the production of bodies for utility-type chassis. 7. See answer to 6. 8.
