Honourable members interjecting,' son) I do not know why it is that, on every Eriday morning there is the same trouble. It is almost impossible for an honourable member to speak with any reasonable freedom from interruption. I appeal to honourable members to refrain from interjecting. Each interjection brings a chorus in reply and so much disorder that it is almost impossible for me to hear the debate. I shall name the next honourable member who interjects after I call for order.

That would mean that 80,000,000 bushels had been sold at a price averaging over 9s. a bushel, but we have been informed that 210,000 tons, or 7,840,000 bushels, have been sold to Germany at a price of 7s. 9d. per bushel f.o.b. for the major portion of it, and 7s. 6d. f.o.b. for the balance.

I understand that the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) intends to speak upon the question of wool. We heard a very interesting address in another part of this building this morning upon this subject. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the wool question to dogmatize upon it, but the Prime Minister told us yesterday that all sections of the community are interested in it, and I realize that if wool has no value Australia must suffer a stringency which is liable to affect every individual in the community. I suggest to the Government the advisability of appointing a Committee of members of this House and the Senate who are interested in the various branches of the wool industry, as workers, growers, fellmongers, or manufacturers. They might be able to suggest some means of getting over the present difficulty. I agree with the Prime Minister that if we have 3,000,000 bales of wool in Great Britain belonging to Bawra, it would be better to hold it up for some time, particularly, as I under* stand, that the people who own it have already received from the sale of their wool prior to this accumulation sufficient money to enable them to do this. If it is true, as has been stated in some quarters, that in various parts of Australia wool is being burnt and hides are being destroyed, the persons acting in this way ought to be prosecuted, because the man who burns wool is guilty of arson just as much as is a man who sets fire to a house. able member take away the wool if it were given to him for nothing? will give their wool to the honourable member to get Tid of it. . are not burning anything of any value. get the views of honourable members upon this matter.",24,Setup

But while the Australian wool-grower is more concerned with the price that he will get for the present clip and the clip now growing than with any prospective profits from the realization of this old wool, we cannot expect the Imperial Government to take up the same attitude. In the first place, the Imperial Government paid.us, in cash, long ago, 15^d. per lb. for this old wool, although a great deal of it remains unsold. And they are also being subjected, not unnaturally, to pressure on the part of people in Britain who desire cheap wool and cheap clothing. These people are urging that, as the Imperial Government owns one-half of this hold-over wool, it should sell it instead of holding it off the culminated in the deputation of which I market. We have to face the facts, and that is not am unreasonable attitude for these people in the Old Country to take up. Government has paid 15£d. for this, wool, the publio may demand that it shall be sold for 9d., or even 8d., per lb. by the resale of our wool was so great that it has left us with a half share in 1,700,000 bales costing us nothing; but that profit was very largely made by means of high prices charged to the British and allied manufacturers. vernment has squared itself. The carry over wool owes it nothing ? half share of the wool belongs to them, and that being so, every arrangement made in regard to it must be a matter for negotiation with the Imperial Government. Negotiations have been carried on for some considerable time by some of the ablest men of the Empire, including Sir Arthur Goldfinch and those acting with him at the other end of the world, and Sir John Higgins and those acting with him at this end. These men have come to a perfectly fair arrangement. .They are prepared, at the same time to meet the owners of the free wool in a reasonable way But we .cannot expect the Imperial Government to put its carry-over, wool entirely on one side, leaving the market solely to the owners of the new clip. They have, however, made what seems to those concerned a very fair arrangement, namely, that for every six bales of Australian and New Zealand wool sold', they should be allowed to sell two, in other words, one bale out of three. come in? Do they not get a "" cut?"" the owner of the whole of this wool; it is a matter of transferring-of converting what might be called a syndicate ownership into a realization . company"". Honourable members will see that the crux of the whole question, the centre around which everything revolves, is to persuade the owners of Bawra wool not to rush it on the market,' and let the market go to -well , the end of everything. With that in view suggestions have been made which was one, which wadtedjon the Prime Minister the day before yesterday, and in the statement we had from the Prime Minister yesterday. I wish to emphasise the importance of this particular aspect. The directors of Bawra object very strongly to their wool , being subject to these reasonable limits, when at the same time free wool of the new clip is sold in Australia and! London below those limits. All those of experience in the business will admit the reasonableness of that objection. The directors of Bawra say that if they cannot sell their wool-if buyers go away, and subsequently, perhaps in the same room, a fresh set of catalogues is distributed, and a fresh lot of wool placed before the buyers and sold at 10 to 20 per cent, lower price than the Bawra limit, they, the directors of Bawra, regard the position as unreasonable, and they claim the freedom to sell their wool on the same terms as do the owners of the new clip essential qualities ? alike, of course, but broadly speaking they are the same; there is no special depreciation in the wool held over, and any difference in quality does not affect the issue.

There remains, however, a quantity of wool in London known as free wool of the new clip, which, though not very large, is quite enough to depress the market.

Our desire is to prevent the wool market from collapsing, by giving confidence to buyers and manufacturers, so that they may not feel that in buying now they may be paying very , much more than they will have to pay two or three months hence. To my mind, the only effective method of restricting export is to ask every man. who wishes to ship his wool for sale in London to give .a guarantee that he will not allow that particular parcel to be sold under the limit fixed from time to time by Bawra. If it were said to me, "" Mr Jowett, you must guarantee not to allow this parcelof wool that you are shipping to be sold below Bawra prices for two months,"" the restriction would bo useless, because it takes six weeks to get wool to London, and two months would elapse between its shipment from Australia and its sale there, which would make the restriction inoperative. be sold "" to arrive "" ? poses it could not. chasers as to what would happen after would be to postpone all buying of wool for two months.

Prime Minister's statement was perfectly clear, but, unfortunately, there were persons who misunderstood it. He did not ask for the prohibition of export, but for the restriction of it. He wished to make it clear that no wool exported for sale in outside markets should be sold under the prices fixed by Bawra.

If at any moment the Government decided that the arrangement would not work, then the restriction could be removed, but, in any case, the guarantee should not expire, so far as a particular parcel of wool is concerned, at the end of the two months. The impression left on the minds of a good many people is that, after the expiration of two months, the man who had shipped his wool in the meantime would be free to sell it as he liked. Bawra; it is that the owners of the particular parcel of wool should guarantee that at no time will it be sold under the limit fixed by Bawra. a policy towards the secondary woollen industry ? the position of feilmongered woollias ever been discussed by Bawra. But, in my opinion, the restriction on export should not apply to bona fide feilmongered wool. I have received from a very old friend, Mr Arthur G-lover, who is a large fellmonger in Melbourne, the following telegram, which I desire to place on recordUnderstand legislation proposed to impose restrictions on sale of feilmongered wool. Fellmongers mostly turn over, their capital six times or more per yoar. Any restriction on selling whioh prevents prompt realization of feilmongered wools will prevent carrying on of fellmongering industry which is already on verge of ruin and needs all possible consideration at present time to enable it to survive. Skin wool forms only about 5 per cent, of -Australia's wool production.. This percentage cannot affect results Bawra scheme. Suggest sheep-skins and feilmongered -wools be exempt, or, as alternative, that low reserves be fixed for skin wools to enable quick sale. Respectfully suggest that trade should be consulted, and opinions of experts be heard before the whole business is thrown into melting pot, ancl perhaps ruined. Revival of industry and general employment with improved market for sheep-skins, -to advantage of growers, most favorable, provided the industry left unmolested, and exempt from embarrassing restriction. I think the request made by Mr Glover, ho doubt in behalf of a great many other fellmongers, is reasonable. Erom a wool grower's point of view, it would be quite possible to make arrangements to exempt feilmongered wool from the restriction on export. That would apply also to wool tops. The position of the fellmongering industry at present is most serious owing to the excessive ocean freights and the low prices which wools are bringing. There is an enormous amount of unemployment in the industry, and everything possible should be done to place it upon a sound financial basis as soon as possible. For that reason, whatever restrictions are placed on the exportation of growers' wools should not apply to feilmongered wool. member say whether any communication has been sent by Bawra to South Africa That is not the suggestion of and t£e Argentine, pointing out that if those countries do not co-operate and the bottom falls out of the market they will suffer with Australia? that has been done. If such'action has been taken it has probably been by the London directorate of Bawra or by important financial authorities in London. At any rate, that point will not be overlooked, and I am grateful to the honourable member for his suggestion. In conclusion, I desire to' impress upon the House the enormous importance of this question being handled in a statesmanlike and constructive fashion WhilstI court the fullest possible inquiry and the most exhaustive deliberations, it is necessary, if we are to save the wool industry and the financial interests of Australia from'a grave disaster, to consider this matter in a sympathetic spirit and act immediately: It is gratifying tp note the conversion of certain honourable members opposite to Government interference in industry. The present situation affords another example of the utter incapacity of private enterprise to manage a business. The banks cannot agree amongst themselves, neither can the wool brokers and pastoralists.

It is nothing new; it hae been coming for a long time, and those who are connected with the woollen industry, either inside or outside of it I am outside-hav e known perfectly well that some such collapse was inevitable. claiming another Is. per hundred sheep. men who are outside the industry, I am making that claim, and I am prepared to give good reasons to justify it. Those men are more concerned than are the pastoralist, because, if there is to be a, collapse the working class will suffer first. A gentleman who delivered an interesting lecture this morning said that the big man has accumulated sufficient fat to keep him going for some time; but the working man has not. A collapse of the wool industry will mean the immediate depreciation of land values. The position which that industry occupies in Australia is shown by the fact that in the year 1918-19 the value of the wool produced was £42,764,000, whereas the wheat production was worth only £19,344,000, and minerals £26,000,000, including £6,700,000. for coke and coal. Of course, many of the industries in which coke and coal are largely used are supported by the pastoral industry. A t any rate, the value of the pastoral industry is nearly as great as that of mining and wheat-farming combined, With a depreciation in land values will come a fall in the values of town property, railway revenue will decrease, country banks and their head offices 'in the cities will feel the pinch. There will be a shortness of money followed by a calling in of mortgages, and inevitably there must ensue financial chaos and unemployment. We of the working class who are on the outside of the pastoral industry will be the first to suffer if it collapses. TheLeader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) suggested this morning that before Parliament daces the seal of its approval upon any scheme it should satisfy itself that the scheme is sound and equitable, and will not impose hardships upon any section of the community. We have before us the Bawra scheme, and also the scheme which the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) briefly indicated yesterday between glimpses at his watch to assure'himself that he was not missing his train and boat. Between the two schemes are a number of large Unpastoral interests which will have nothing to do with either. interests in Victoria that refuse to have anything to do with the Bawra scheme. There are pastoralists who adopt the same attitude. that some banks in London have received consignments of wool from pastoralists in Australia, and they state that they have no authority from their clients to place that wool in the scheme. has been criticized by Mr A. G. Rymill, manager of the Canowie Pastoral Company, a large financial and pastoral body. Apparently, the views he has expressed have the support of his directors, and I wonder how many financial and pastoral interests do not subscribe to the scheme that has been submitted by Bawra. Mr Rymill says that he is not sure that it would not be best to dump the whole of the accumulated wool into the ocean or to burn it. A t any rate, he suggests the advisability of throwing the 2,700, Q00 bales upon the market and allowing that wool and the new clip to take their chances. He suggests that the best way out of the difficulty is to let the whole thing go smash until a demand is created because of the cheapness of the wool, which will buoy up the market once more. Rymill proposes to pay the wages which the honourable member's friends will require. ing out this gentleman's view-point.* There are so many contradictory and conflicting statements as to the position of wool that the Government cannot, on the representations of any one section of the community, adopt resolutions which may prove to be on wrong lines.

It has been suggested that a Committee of honourable members should institute an inquiry. The House should take no action until that Committee has reported. Australian Workers Union are exceptionally interested in this matter. Their award having expired in December last, they have already submitted claims to the pastoralists, whicb will be heard in the Arbitration Court very shortly; but if the whole wool market goes smash there will be no sheep for the members of the Australian Workers Union to shear. If wool falls to a price of 2d. per lb., it will not pay to shear the sheep; the pastoralist will simply turn them into his paddocks. The banks of Australia have recently got cold feet, and have issued notices that overdrafts must be reduced. It is but another example of the unfitness of private enterprise to manage any national matter, and finance is essentially a national matter. shall always be faced by similar crises until the policy advocated by the Labour party, that this Parliament should control the finances of the country, is adopted by the people generally. financial institutions are not prepared to further subsidize the small pastoralists and graziers. In no unmistakable terms they are saying, "" We want our money."" In the western portion of New South Wales the small graziers have just passed through five years, and in some cases six years, of drought, suffering losses not covered by two years of good prices for their wool. Therefore, they are still in the hands of the banks. being forced to sell their stock, in order to pay off their overdrafts ? be sold up. I have advocated the extension of the moratorium, in order to protect the interests of the small men. I . know it is impossible for the Commonwealth Government to do this, but, acting in conjunction with the State Government, they could establish a system which would protect these men from the banking and other financial institutions. The Commonwealth Bank, which has been the mainstay of this continent for the past six years, and which will inevitably continue to be a great stay to the country, must also play its part in an endeavour to prevent a 'financial collapse. Australia i not banks rupt because its indebtedness has been increased by £300,000,000. Its assets are surely quite sufficient to tide it over a The members of the temporary period of depression. Some people estimate that this period will cover at least two years, but others who are in a position to express a reliable opinion hold that it -will not last so long. However, I am satisfied that, if we use the whole of the resources at our disposal, we can get over this depression quite comfortably without any collapse, chaos, or unemployment, with its resultant starvation. I would have been pleased if this discussion had been held over until Wednesday next, when fuller information might have been available in connection with the best means of. handling our wool. It is a most serious matter, and honourable members We must approach it with the utmost care, and with the fullest assurance that any step they take will neither damage an important industry nor bring . future disaster to the Commonwealth. HowApparently our ever, for the moment, I shall not discuss this question, but will address myself to the remarks of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) as to the financial situation. The right honourable gentleman endeavoured to throw upon this Chamber the responsibility for expenditure incurred during Tecent years. It was absurd, and, in a sense, improper, for him to attempt to do so. The responsibility rests solely upon the Ministry. keep them in power. who are behind the scenes are fully alive to the position and to our commitments. I have urged the Treasurer time after time to take the people into his confidence and let them know exactly what our commitments are. Only the other day I asked him to bring in excess Estimates which would afford, not only the House, but also the people outside, an opportunity of fully realizing our financial responsibilities. In October last, I pointed out that, in addition to the total indebtedness of £800,000,000, States and Commonwealth, we were committed to an",33,Chapman Would The Rent Financial Year I T Is Estimated That

Of course the figures are not the same to-day, because by a most extraordinary piece of finance, for which the Government take great credit, but which I consider to be a most reprehensible transaction, by an arrangement made by Senator Millen in Great Britain, our debt to the Imperial Government has been funded. I could quite understand the funding of the loan moneys we borrowed from that Government, but no credit is due to our Ministers for having funded a debt amounting which was owing to the British Government for money advanced by them for the upkeep of our soldiers. The Imperial Chancellor had made request after request to us for the payment of this debt. The Imperial Government was obliged to find enormous sums of money in order to finance the war and assist other nations, and particularly to repay money borrowed from the United States of America. But when we were asked to pay what we owed, the Commonwealth' Government pleaded bankruptcy. They admitted that they owed -the money, but pleaded their inability to repay it , and compromised by giving a bill for the amount repayable in thirty years and bearing interest. honourable member have done with that but to endeavour, if possible, to prevent floating debt of £40,000,000 in London? ing out the position into which we have claimed throughout the country by the drifted. in regard to that fund. perial Government to spend money on that -we had to produce more and-more our behalf, and promised to repay it. portion of the Empire.

Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. I propose to deal, not only with the wool situation, but with the general financial outlook as disclosed yesterday in the speech made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). I have no desire to make this a party matter, because I recognise that there are phases of the wool situation to nearly £40,000,000 which must not only excite the interest, but demand the careful attention of, honourable members generally. The whole problem has ""to be solved with due regard to the best interests of the people of Australia. In approaching its consideration, we have to ask ourselves whether the advice given by the Government, and by those who claim to be the leading statesmen of this country, has been wise or not. I agree with the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) that we must tackle the problem from the point of view of constructive statesmanship; but in doing so we have to consider something more than the wool situation, which, after all, is but the effect of deeply underlying causes. We must consider the real causes of the trouble, and take steps, if possible, to eliminate them. We have not only to their recurrence.

As to the attitude of the Imperial Government with regard to the carry-over wool, the honourable member for Grampians has shown very clearly that that wool owes nothing either to the Australian wool-growers or to the British Government. Many wool-growers have told me that they are perfectly satisfied with the flat rate of Is. 3£d. per lb., which they have already received in cash, and we kuow that"" the British Government have more than cleared their expenses out of the sales that have already been made. The primary products necessary to enable Britain to carry on her manufactures are largely drawn from Australia. She depends upon Australia more than upon any other country' for her supplies of wool, and also purchases by far the greater part of our production of wheat. circumstances the' people of Britain are undoubtedly interested in the maintenance of Australian industries, and surely it would not be asking too much of Britain to call upon the Imperial Government to refrain for a time from putting this carry over wool on the market. The British Government do not ordinarily carry on the business of a wool broker. It was due to the exigencies of the war that they entered upon such a business, and it would not be too much to ask them to hold this carry-over wool for a time. ber think the Labour party in the British House of Commons would agree to that? whether it would or not, but if the British Government desired to take .such action, the Labour party in the House of Commons could not prevent them from doing RO.

I propose to show how vast savings might be effected in this country, and how any further taxation to finance the nation until we have a return to normal times may be avoided. At the present time, 5,000,000 people are taxed to provide for the annual interest bill of £25,000,000 on our internal debt. That interest payment, which has to be met over and above all the other expenditures of the State and Federal Governments, to-morrow, of repudiation, and without ing the nation to take a penny piece from any individual. The loans, amounting to £260,000,000, in respect of which this interest bill of £25',000,000 ner annum is payable, were floated within the Commonwealth, and the Government issued bonds in respect of them. I do not wish for a moment to belittle in any way the security behind those bonds-it is certainly the finest in the world-but I invite honourable members to consider for a moment of what that security consists. Whab tangible security has the holder of a war bond of. say, £1,000? None! He, undoubtedly, has by way of security the resources of the Commonwealth-the productive capacity of Australia in future years, but what tangible' asset has he? He has nothing other than his faith in the established' Government of the country, Mr Lazzarini. and the ability of the Government to tax the people, and the wealth of the country, in order to be able to pay the interest as it accrues, and eventually to pay off the principal. Supposing the honourable member for Eden-Monaro holds a £1,000,000 war bond-thoug h I do not think he is quite so wealthy-du e in 1.925, and he insists, as in a mortgage, on cash instead of a renewal, if the Government say that they cannot pay know a war bond is not an ordinary mortgage? I am trying to prove is that the honourable member would have no tangible assets as security. Is he, under the circumstances, going to take a strip of the It depends east-west railway, or some of the post offices, or a portion of the Federal Territory? -I know there are honourable members who will laugh at what I am about to say; but I challenge any one either here or outside to question its economic and financial soundness. I know that honourable members opposite do not wish to close up the private or Associated Banks, but if the Labour party get into power, that is what we shall do.. If we wish to extend the Commonwealth Bank's influence we must first amend the constitution of the Bank, and insert a provision similar to one in the constitution of the Bank of England. It is a provision made could be wiped off by bankers for the security of bankers, without the suggestion and it is to the effect that no financial requirinstitution may draw on the securities of the bank except by deposit receipts. If other banking institutions of Britain get cheques, drafts, or bills of exchange against the Bank of England, all they can do is to place them in that bank, and take a credit deposit for the amount they represent. Hence the bank, in ordinary times, is secure, and is able to stabilize the whole of the banking institutions of Britain, for the simple reason that its resources can never be drawn on. If a similar provision were made in the case of the Commonwealth Bank, the Government could take back at once the war bonds, and place them to the credit of the owners in the Commonwealth Bank, leaving the bonds in the bank vaults. I claim that the same. securities as uphold the Commonwealth Bank can uphold the war",36,Chapman Would The Rent Financial Year I T Is Estimated That

Honourable members opposite, in their reception of these views, regentleman, no matter what may become mind me, as I have said once before here, of Oliver Goldsmith's phrase about vacant laughs and empty heads. However, as to the interest, if the bond-holders are preparedoto put their money into the Commonwealth Bank for a fixed period, they will be paid the Bank's interest; if they are. not prepared to do that, they will take out their credits and throw them -into productive enterprises. £250,000,000 released, in this way would forward our progress and prosperity, by fifty, years. I shall support the scheme of the honourable member for Grampians for the reason that, in my opinion, there is no possibility of tbe Government going any further. That scheme, however, is only playing with the question-dealin g with effects instead of causes-and will lead us nowhere. It would temporarily get over the present difficulty, but at the expense of a lot of* wasted energy. hurdle at a time but the honourable member was not here when I was making some remarks. which greatly amused the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and, therefore, hie cannot connect my argument. I know that such arguments as mine do not appeal to the commercial or capitalistic interests of the country. That is because the Associated Banks, with their head office in London, as the Prime Minister practically admitted in other words, are the whole corner-stone on which the present system is built. Hence what I suggest would be the last thing which the Government or their supporters would do. I know, at any rate, that the members of the Country party, who severely criticise the Government, but always support it, would hot approve of such a policy. I do not eare what the Prime Minister clamouring for. trade with Germany. or his Government may say with regard [324] to increasing the military and naval expenditure. Any increased expenditure will depend upon the way in which the finances' of this country are managed, because, without the necessary resources,' such expenditure cannot be met. The Prime Minister did not say so in so many words, but, by the whole tenor of his speech, conveyed the impression that we are on the verge of a financial collapse. But, according to the right nhonorable of every other human institution, we must still pay our tribute to Mars, and, if necessary, increase it in order to keep the spirit of militarism alive. Under present circumstances I cannot support any increase of the naval and military expenditure. It is useless for' the Prime Minister and his supporters to talk as they do-to open their mouths and talk so big. If our A sum of nnancial affairs are not managed in a rational and proper way, and a thorough re-adjustment made quickly, we shall not be able to meet increased naval and military expenditure, or any other. The honourable member for Grampians, when the honourable . member' for Darling( Mr Blakeley) was speaking, interjected something about wool in payment for shearing. I do not know whether the Government advocates that wool shall be made a medium of exchange, but whatever they do mean, the present problem must be handled and solved. Men who depend on their work for their livelihood must not. haVe their employment curtailed; the small wool-grower and all in the industry' must be protected. Some reference has been made to the export of wool to Germany, and it was intimated that we wouldi get no money for the wool, as it is certaim we shall not. The great trouble is thaf"" of the exchanges. I saw the other day that, owing to the exchanges,, it is possible to buy in Germany for £1 goods that are worth nearly £27 in Britain. If that is so, our wool and other products going to Germany, France, or elsewhere, are not reaching the people of those countries. The conditions are not of any good to the people or tlje producers of commodities, but simply bolster up the agents and middlemen of the different nations. In the case I havp just mentioned, there is a profit of 2,700 per cent., and that is the reason, possibly, that so many are now",37,Chapman Would The Rent Financial Year I T Is Estimated That

When the Prime Minister suggested, some twelve months ago, that the proper course was to withdraw the Bawra wool for a time, until the wool market had reassumed its normal condition, so that the current clip might be operated easily, that suggestion was received with disfavour. The British Government would naturally say, in reply to any proposal to hold over the Bawra The prewool for a period of two years or so, "" That is all very well for you, who want to sell your current clip; but where do we ""We are interested, not come in ?"" Naturally, it would not agree to the proposition.

I do not want this House to hurriedly accept the proposal now before us, a caref u l examination of which may show it to be in the best interests of the large landowners, and not in the interests of the small man. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), when speaking this morning, said that a sufficient return might be obtained from the wool which remained unsold in England, and one-half of which belongs to the sheep farmers here, to tide our wool-growers over a given period with a payment of only 9d. per. l b .

Buti f we have a ""few years of these depressed prices their finances w ill be exhausted.' What, then, will become of the small man? The honourable member admitted this<morning that the Bawra Company, while^talking about fixing a minimum price, reserved to themselves the right to increase the price from time to time. That is to say, they are to be at liberty to put up the price whenever they like. The honourable member asked that the machinery of Government should be used to assist that combine, that an export duty should be imposed on any wool, sought to be disposed of outside of the combine for less than the price fixed by it. That, then, is the position. I do not want to see the price of our wool come .down, and I certainly do not want the whole business to be placed in the hands of some outside body of men over which the Parliament has no control. W h y should a body of men over which the Parliament has no control be given authority to fix the price, and to deal with the whole of the wool production of Australia ?

We bave, therefore, to do our best to prevent anything of the kind.' But I object to any body of men outside the control of this Parliament being given power to fix the price of wool and to the machinery of the Government being employed to prevent any one coming into competition w i th them. ment of the position that, so f a r , it has not been denied.

I favour collective bargaining, and I am urging that in this case it should be done through the Government of the country. what the miners unions do now? position as it occurs to me. There is no escape from it. The Prime Minister, in concluding his speech yesterday, said that he was not convinced that the remedy suggested by Sir John Higgins would cure the disease; he was-not satisfied that the proposed scheme would prove satisfactory. I am stressing that point. I am endeavouring to show the direction in which we are drifting. We are drifting once more towards the state of things that arose during the war. demned in the press, and by many citizens, because during the war we, as a Parliament, lost control of the public purse, and also because we did not take control of different commodities in order to prevent profiteering. It is now -solemnly proposed that we should vest in a body of men completely.outside the control of this Parliament, power to deal as tbey please with the whole wool situation. It was suggested this morning that a Committee of members of this Parliament should be appointed to investigate the question. I have been awaiting an opportunity to submit . an amendment, which will allow the House to decide whether or not such a Committee should be appointed. The amendment provides for the addition of the following words to the motion, "" That the paper be printed."":and that a Committee be appointed from this House and the Senate to investigate the present position of the wool-growing industry with a view of recommending the best method of dealing with the disposal of wool. That, surely, is a question with which the Parliament should deal. Sir with it. ing to deal with it without having all the facts befpre us. Many honourable members consider that such a Committee as I propose should be appointed. [325] ; market be by the time that the Committee had completed its inquiries? the appointment of a Committee that would occupy much time in making an investigation. We have in this Parliament men who are thoroughly conversant with the wool business; representatives of the wool interests could be chosen from both sides of the House. member's proposalto appoint a Committee to investigate the present position of the wool industry would mean a delay of six months. consisting of two members of this House, two members of another place, arid two outside business men could inquire and report within a week or a fortnight. be asked to report within a week. object to that. The Committee could make inquiries and bring in a report that would materially help us in coming to a decision. The present 'situation is very unsatisfactory. The Prime Minister himself confessed before leaving for England yesterday that he was not satisfied with the negotiations. He made a hurried statement and admitted that he was not satisfied in his own mind as to what was the best course to pursue. He desired that we should discuss the whole question, and that the disposal of the carry-over wool should be held over for a couple of months in order that he might, if possible, do something on reaching the Old Country. A Committee such as I suggest could complete its investigations within a week, and submit a report to the House, on which we could come to a decision. The Prime Minister could then be duly advised. I do not want this House to be forced into accepting the proposal before it : asked the House to discuss the whole that a Committee of members of this Parliament who are thoroughly conversant with the wool business should be appointed to inquire and report.

258,Mr Charlton,"That is why I saythat Committees consisting of members of this Parliament do better work than committees consisting of so-called business' men from outside. My experience of the reports of Commissions consisting of outside business men is that they are about the poorest that are put before us. Such Commissions also occupy more time in conducting their inquiries than do Committees or Commissions consisting of members of this Parliament. Surely we should not be expected to accept this proposal on the mere statement that the wool-growers are favorable to it. Surely we should not be asked to empower a body of men over whom this Parliament has no control to utilize the Customs Department to keep up the price of wool, and probably in the long run to ruin the Bmall growers. Why should we force the small man to put his property on the market, or to mortgage it, as probably many would have to do? already threatened to foreclose on some of them, and are forcing some to put their stock on the market. immediate decision. of members of this Parliament could investigate the position, and report within a week. without having before us the fullest information, we may, in our endeavour to protect the wool industry, do something that will, not be in the best interests of the whole of the people. We should do all in our power to prevent the collapse of any of our industries, and it is because of the seriousness of the situation that I speak in this way. absence of complete information, we may land ourselves in a very difficult position. We may be told, later on, that we were unmindful of our duty when we handed over this power to some outside body over which we had no control. No reasonable objection can be raised against my proposal. Why should we be asked to rush 'in and deal with this question off-hand? I invite honourable members to carefullv read the speech made by the Prime Minister. He went away still undecided as to what should be done, and he told us that be had recommended a certain -course, with which the representatives, of the wool-growers were not prepared to agree. The House ought to be in possession of all the available information, and consider the question in all its bearings, in an effort to arrive at a conclusion which will prove of great help to the wool industry of Australia. If we permit the wool industry to go down, it will he only a matter of time when all the other industries will follow. We know that on the other side of the world the bottom is falling out of all the markets, and it is on these markets that we depend for the disposal of our surplus. We have to protect the interests of this country during the crucial period before us, and that can only be done by our being placed in the possession of the fullest information within the shortest possible time. I have no desire for any delay of months, but would prefer to deal with the matter within a week. I object to power being given to any body outside this House to regulate the prices of commodities in the future. The war is now over, and we should deal with a matter of the kind ourselves, taking the fullest responsibility for our acts. We ought to have sufficient intelligence to devise means to save the country without handing over, holus. bolus, such a power to. a committee of men, who are interested, and out of the control of this Chamber. I desire to If we deal with this matter move an amendment. able gentleman will not do that now. Treasurer like me to do? I do not wish to sit down, and thus lose my opportunity to speak further. If we act in the if he moves an amendment now, may commit some honourable members on a pre-conceived view, before the whole case has beeu put. the moment is that the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) leave the field open.
