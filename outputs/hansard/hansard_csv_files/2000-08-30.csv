I want to acknowledge and praise each of the 300 Australian police personnel who, since that ballot, has served on the United Nations peacekeeping forces in East Timor. I particularly want to take time to mention the 50 Australian Federal Police officers who made up the first Australian contribution to UNAMET. These officers were sent to East Timor to advise members of the Indonesian police in the course of their duties and to escort ballot boxes after the vote. Unfortunately, the events surrounding the ballot meant that the role which the AFP fulfilled was very different from the advice and escort role envisaged on their deployment. The 50 AFP officers who were on the front line of this violence, intimidation and gunfire were unarmed. These officers were present for the worse of the violence and bloodshed. The experience of these officers is best told through the words of one of the members of the first contingent, Wayne Sievers. In an open letter to the Prime Minister on 8 March 2000, Mr Sievers described his experience as follows: In the lead-up to the independence vote we were unarmed in a situation where 20,000 Indonesian police and military orchestrated genocidal violence by tens of thousands of militia. We were forced to deal with atrocities. ... Our houses were burnt down with the loss of all of our property. We were trapped and under siege expecting the worse at any moment and more than half of us have suffered various diseases. Our only weapon was moral persuasion and the threat of international exposure for the butchers of East Timor. It is fair to say that the members of the AFP played a much more prominent role than the ADF during this mission. During the siege of the UN compound in Dili most of us made the decision that we would stay, no matter what, and share the fate of the thousands of women and children sheltering with us. ... To go prematurely would have seen the massacre of innocents on a scale never before seen in East Timor. Fourteen days after the ballot, the violence reached such a level that all AFP officers had to be evacuated from East Timor. Yet the AFP’s commitment to playing a vital role in establishing peace in East Timor was not diminished. Civilian police returned to East Timor, along with defence personnel, as part of the UN peacekeeping force. We now have an ongoing commitment of 80 officers who serve in East Timor. My main interest today is to acknowledge and praise the incredibly special actions of the men and women of the AFP and state police forces who have served in East Timor. However, I cannot let the opportunity pass to criticise the government for the way which the AFP has been essentially overlooked and disregarded in terms of financial and public recognition. The blame for this must rest squarely on the shoulders of the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Prime Minister. In December last year, I, along with at least 50 other federal parliamentarians, was approached by AFP officers who had returned from East Timor only to find that they had not received the allowances owed to them; they were not granted taxation concessions which were given to defence officers; and they were continually sidelined and forgotten with regard to public acknowledgment and praise. Just three days ago, I received an open letter from David Hall, another AFP officer who was a member of that first contingent. AllI can say to",134,Customs Tariff Proposals No 6

(Time expired) Petrie Electorate: Redcliffe Community Heated Indoor Pool Australian Students Prize Petrie Electorate: Schools Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.43 a.m.)-Recently, a group of concerned citizens in Redcliffe, in the north of my electorate, have been meeting to raise funds and stimulate interest in a community heated indoor pool project, or CHIP, as it is affectionately known. The group have identified strong demand from older residents with mobility and other problems who need to have access to a heated water rehabilitation facility. There are not any suitable facilities in the Redcliffe area for people who would either benefit from water exercises or have trouble entering a pool. The existing facilities either do not have adequate heating or access is restricted to just a few hours a day. Water rehabilitation can have excellent benefits for old people who experience movement problems or ongoing pain caused by arthritis, injury and other ailments linked to the ageing process. But it also has great benefits for young people who need non-jarring rehabilitation for sports injuries. The CHIP Action Group was formed in March following a public meeting to raise funds for the construction of a facility. Since March, the group has received strong support from Quota and the Redcliffe City Council and is looking at ways to attract funding for the pool. I am happy to lend my support in those areas. Community support for this project has been tremendous so far and I hope the support will translate into further success for the group. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate three students in my electorate. Last weekend, three of Petrie’s finest students received the Australian Students Prize in recognition of their academic excellence and achievement at their secondary schools, and I would like to mention them. Tania Brcich and Justyna Ostrowski of McDowall and Michael Holt from Caseldine have worked extremely hard, and I was delighted to present them with their awards on behalf of the federal government. Education is one of the greatest gifts that we can give our children and it is important that everyone is given the opportunity to realise their full potential in a school environment. I would like to congratulate two schools in the Petrie electorate, Grace Lutheran College and Southern Cross Catholic School. Grace Lutheran College recently celebrated the opening of an arts building comprising two classrooms, three art studios, a gallery, a foyer, a computer laboratory and a darkroom, while Southern Cross opened its newly constructed preschool. I was invited to open both facilities on behalf of the federal government, and it was pleasing to see first-hand the results of federal funding going into our schools. This government is committed to ensuring that every student receives quality education and it is pleasing to see this policy working on a local level. What is not so pleasing is what I saw when I went to the Craigslea State High School’s 25th anniversary where I saw politics taken to a school fete. The candidate running against me for the next federal election was there in a Labor Party tent with the local councillor taking up petitions. I do not think politics should be brought into the school fete arena, and I will write to the minister for education in Queensland about the matter. I think it is highly unusual, and I feel very strongly about these people making a political statement.

I am hoping to go to the game and it will be the first time. I have been since 1985 when we thumped Hawthorn. Essendon go into this grand final on the weekend against Melbourne, a very good young side coached by an ex-Essendon boy, Neale Daniher, in a situation where Essendon is the warm favourite, after a record of 21 out of 22 wins in the season, as well as two major wins in the finals. Essendon looks set to win the premiership, their 16th, which makes them equal to Carlton as the record holder for the number of premiershipsto the member for Port Adelaide. One day we may see Port Adelaide in the grand final in the AFL, in real football, but I think it will be in a few years to come. Kevin Sheedy, the Essendon coach for nearly 20 years, has done a magnificent job with this young team. He is setting us up, I hope, for a situation of overwhelming dominance over the next few years in the AFL. Of course, last year the dreaded enemy, Carlton, defeated us by one point in the preliminary final and stopped us celebrating this weekend back-to-back premierships. Nonetheless, revenge was sought, and gained, last Saturday, and I was there to see it. Now we have a situation where it is Melbourne versus Essendon in this grand final. Sheedy’s boys-James Hird, Justin Blumfield, Mark Mercuri and Joe Misiti-are very good players who have the opportunity to set up a situation not seen at Essendon since the mid-1980s when the then Baby Bombers, as they were called, stamped their authority on the AFL. This team can do the same. Certainly, it is a credit to Sheedy and his coaching techniques. Essendon, in terms of its recruitment processes and the whole training staff, is putting together a side which is the envy of all in the AFL. It has been interesting this year, as the member for Port Adelaide interjected before, to see what happened to Port Adelaide. There was another side from Adelaide called ‘Adelaide’, wasn’t there? reached the finals, as I understand it. In fact, there was only one interstate team in the finals this year, the Brisbane Lions, which is against what has been happening in recent years. new millennium. So good luck to Essendon on the weekend. I am sure it is going to be a very good game. Melbourne is certainly a side for the future, but I am very pleased to be able to say, ‘Go Bombers!’ (Time expired) Vietnam Veterans Remembrance Day Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (9.49 a.m.)-On Sunday, 20 August, I attended the Vietnam Veterans Remembrance Day celebrations in Adelaide, the march and then the memorial service at the Cross of Sacrifice. There were Vietnam veterans from both Australia and South Vietnam. While the Battle of Long Tan, 18 August, does not hold quite the same status in this country as ANZAC Day, when we remember all veterans, I think the Australian people do owe the Vietnam veterans a great debt. I undertook to Mr David Lean, a Vietnam veteran and chairman of the organising committee, to use his words today in the Main Committee to pay tribute to Vietnam veterans.

In many cases we faced the trials of non-acceptance by former friends, the rejection of neighbours or different clubs and associations because of our time spent in Vietnam. We felt rejected and confused. We found it hard after the adrenaline packed days of Vietnam to settle down to a former 9-5 career. However, the fighting spirit that has long been known since the earliest of Australia’s settlers and pioneers, rose to the surface. As a nation, we have always had a heart to survive. Since the earliest settlers and convicts arrived, we have fought to tame this land in which we live. Through droughts, bushfires and many other traumas, this land of Australia has been tamed by, to use the words of Winston Churchill, “blood, sweat and tears”. The early Australians fought hard so that we can enjoy the privileges of hard work today. They had to endure times when they were knocked down for a spell, but they were not knocked out. They not only fought the land, they sent the cream of our men to the first and second world wars so that other nations could live in that same freedom and democracy. We, as a nation, earned a good reputation in sending our best, well trained fighting men; and these men were well and ably supported by our women. Korea, Borneo, Malaya, Vietnam, Somalia, the Gulf and now Timor, have all received the best that we could give. Whether the men were regular army or nashos, we still sent our best. Australia is coming of age in the eyes of the world. United Nations handed the care of Timor over to us, we play a very prominent role in South East Asia, while other nations are seeking our expertise and aid for their problems. David Lean went on to say: One Veteran can, and does, support his mate now through sickness, at times sits with him while he dies, works for him until a pension is accepted, guides his hands because of blindness or pushes him in a chair because of war injuries. And he reminded them that they never lost a battle that they were engaged in in Vietnam. (Time expired) Barrack, Mr Peter, OAM Ms HOARE (Charlton) (9.52 a.m.)-Last Friday evening I attended a dinner to recognise the retiring secretary of Newcastle Trades Hall Council, Mr Peter Barrack, OAM. The dinner was held at the Newcastle Workers Club and was attended by hundreds of trade unionists, business people, members of parliament, past and present, and Peter’s family and friends. As was said on the night, everyone in that auditorium had their lives touched and affected by Peter Barrack in some way. Tributes were paid to Peter by Greg Combet, the secretary of the ACTU, by former trade union comrades and employer adversaries. A wonderful tribute was also read out by Peter’s daughter, Peta-Maree, detailing the values which were instilled in her by having Peter Barrack as her dad. Peter announced his decision to retire after 21 years as the public face of trade unionists in the Hunter region. He started his political and activist career in the 1960s as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War and as a champion for workers’ rights. Peter’s career has spanned some of the major industrial disputes witnessed in our local region. Some of these campaigns included a Trades Hall Council ban enforced by picketers at Wallsend Hospital when it was threatened with closure in 1997; support for striking Hunter Valley miners, which included a mass rally of 700 people at the Newcastle Workers Club which sent a strong message to Rio Tinto that the trade union movement was prepared to escalate the dispute to support the miners; and an open community meeting for more than 300 people who agreed to set up an open alliance to build support for the MUA during the dispute with Patrick’s in 1998. With Peter at the helm, Trades Hall Council was involved in the battle to save jobs lost due to the decline in steel making throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, culminating in the decision by BHP to end steel making in May 1999. Most recently, the Trades Hall Council has been 19742 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 involved in the fight for workers entitlements at the National Textiles factory and at the Scone meat works. Peter Barrack was awarded an OAM in 1994. He is a survivor of prostate cancer. Peter is a great guy, a great trade unionist, an advocate for workers rights and residents rights and a champion for the environment. We will all miss him. I wish him well for a happy and healthy retirement. I would like to end my remarks by extending a warm welcome to Peter’s successor, Gary Kennedy. Gary was state president of the Communication, Electrical and Plumbing Union. I am sure that, as a staunch advocate of workers rights, Gary will perform his duties with the same commitment and passion as we had from Peter Barrack. National Servicemen’s Association: Blue Mountains Sub-Branch first annual general meeting of the Blue Mountains sub-branch of the National Servicemen’s Association. The Blue Mountains sub-branch covers the Blue Mountains, Nepean and Hawkesbury areas. In the one year that it has been in existence the Blue Mountains subbranch has seen its membership grow from 46 to 70. Its strong and active membership is indicative of the sense of need and belonging and the camaraderie felt by those men who undertook national service in any of the periods since 1951. Some actually experienced service in overseas conflicts; others gave their time and energies to be prepared but were not actually called to overseas service. The National Servicemen’s Association is a strong advocate for the concerns of Australian and British ‘nashos’, and is actively involved in presenting their case for due recognition. At a local level they work at addressing the welfare and social needs of their members as well as being actively involved in a number of community events and showing their support for worthwhile local causes. In its first year alone, the Blue Mountains sub-branch has recorded a long list of events in which it has been involved. The success of the organisation is due in no small part to the commitment and hard work of its committee, particularly president Harry Witherow, vice presidents, George Batley and Neville Harris and secretary-treasurer, Pat Pelling. Others who have given strong support have been Charles and Pat Psaila, Alan Shying and Norma Batley, Wilma Witherow and Chaplain John Wiseman. My sincere congratulations especially to Harry Witherow for his vision, leadership and energy. The Blue Mountains sub-branch of the National Servicemen’s Association is filling an important role for their members. The growing list of members, the active community involvement and the convivial and cheerful meetings, as well as their strong service to the local community, point to a very bright future for the Blue Mountains branch. New members are warmly welcomed and the meetings alternate between Springwood and Katoomba. My congratulations on an excellent first year to the Blue Mountains sub-branch of the National Servicemen’s Association and my best wishes for the future as you continue to serve your members and to contribute to the local community. for members’ statements has concluded.

For this reason, on behalf of the shadow minister I will be moving a second reading amendment. The amendment ‘...condemns the government for its lack of support for the Australian coastal shipping industry thereby (1) neglecting Australia’s national interest; (2) risking our maritime safety and marine environment; and (3) disregarding the importance of a stable, efficient and effective Australian Merchant Marine given the political instability in our region.’ This amendment will highlight our serious concerns for the future of the Australian merchant fleet. The whole process of maritime and shipping reform under the coalition government has stalled. Instead, the government has left the Australian shipping industry to rot on the vine. Since the election of the coalition government, all assistance provided to the industry has been stripped away. Labor was working with the shipping industry to encourage and deliver reforms that were effective. When they were elected in 1996, the government announced legislation to terminate many of the agreed measures to assist reform of the shipping industry and to ensure that we retained a modern, efficient shipping industry. Measures that were terminated by the coalition government included the pay-as-you-earn rebate scheme, the capital grant and accelerated depreciation provisions. These were all programs that were part of a sensible, cooperative and effective reform agenda. The measures arose from an approach to reform that included the fiscal support in return for the achievement of industry reforms that would achieve world’s best shipping practices in safety, in staffing arrangements and in technical skill development and utilisation. With the withdrawal of these financial support measures came the establishment of the Shipping Reform Group by the then transport minister, John Sharp. This started a process that has never come to fruition. It was the start of a process that did not deliver reform for Australian shipping. The portfolio was transferred to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and, during that time, anything constructive with respect to the maritime industry ceased. The management of the industry-one that is critical to Australia-was handed to a minister hell-bent on bludgeoning change. The failure of that ideologically-driven exercise is already on the record. The images of Rottweilers and balaclavas have scarred the history of reform in the maritime industry. This is a clear point of difference between Labor and coalition governments. Labor works with industry parties and encourages participation and ownership of outcomes. Reform cannot be bludgeoned. In answer to questions at Senate estimate hearings in May this year, we found some of the details and costs of Minister Reith’s alleged reform. Up to 31 May 2000, the total funding provided to the Patrick group of companies was $102,192,291 for 821 redundancies. The P&O group received $62,975,723 for 552 redundancies. In total, $178 million was spent to shed labour from the stevedoring industry. While these amounts were paid through MifCo and recouped through an industry level, there were also millions of taxpayers dollars spent. I would suggest that the only beneficiaries of Minister Reith’s reforms were the shareholders of Lang Corporation. The Reith reform model came at great cost to the shipping and stevedoring industry. While there were meagre increases in crane rates in the latest waterline results, this has not been a consistent trend. Labor believes that more efficiencies would have been gained through the consultative approach involving the industry. Since the failure of the minister for workplace relations, the responsibility for maritime matters has appropriately been returned to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. But, unfortunately, nothing has happened since. Any reform or support for Australian shipping has ceased. In December 1998, soon after he got the portfolio, Minister John Anderson established the Shipping Reform Working Group. The aim of the working group was to build on the recommendations of the Shipping Reform Group to improve the",140,Representatives Main Committee
311,Mr Kerr (Denison) (9.58 A.m.),"The opposition supports the Trade Practices19744 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 competitiveness of Australian shipping. Speaking at a conference in March 1999, Minister John Anderson said he: ... looked forward to receiving the Working Group’s views at the end of the month on how government can best facilitate the continuing efficiencies within Australian shipping and the provision of competitive services to shippers. He also said: I cannot tell you today whether the government will embrace any of the fiscal incentives proposed in the Manser Report or any modified form of those incentives or the proposal for a Second Register. Well, the minister could not tell us then, and he has not told us since. He received the working group report in March last year, and his response to it still has not been forthcoming. In the Senate estimates and other processes, Labor has pursued this response. As recently as May this year, in response to an estimates question, we were advised that the report was ‘confidential advice to the government’ and that ‘the report is under consideration by the government’. On this side of the House we know why all the jargon and the bureaucracy is still being used to bury the report. We know that the minister did not like what he was told in that report. What Minister John Anderson wanted from the working group was a proposal to abolish cabotage. He was looking for a decision to take his stealthy process of ‘winding back cabotage’ one step further. But what he was told was that cabotage should not be abolished. This minister has always seen the coastal shipping industry as dispensable. He has always seen Australia as a buyer of shipping services, not a supplier. In June this year, the minister took a swipe at the Maritime Union in a press release. In that release the minister denied that the increase in the use of single voyage permits was due to government action. He said: The facts clearly indicate that the increase in the number of permits is due to shipping companies withdrawing services due to the highly uncompetitive cost of Australian shipping, including crew costs. The facts that the minister ignores in this statement are the reasons why other nations can reduce costs. Those reasons are principally because of the assistance that governments of other countries provide to their shipping industries in the form of tax assistance and other industry assistance measures. The other way in which such costs are delivered is for shipowners to operate under a flag of convenience of a country that has much lower safety standards. The environment and risk to our shipping industry created by this government’s coastal shipping policy is that Australian shipowners will consider reflagging their Australian vessels to open registries, employ foreign nationals, and re-enter the coasting trade using single voyage permits and CVPs. Examples of this already exist. The employers and operators of ships in those circumstances receive tax breaks or holidays from their flagged country and pay no tax to Australia in the process. I ask members of this House to consider the same scenario in any other part of the Australian domestic transport industry. Is this the scenario that the government has in store for truck, rail or aviation operations? If that sounds ridiculous, I ask members to consider why the operation of cabotage for Australian domestic shipping cargo is so resented by this government. This government is full of inconsistencies. The bill before us extends the use of part X of the Trade Practices Act. PartX of the Trade Practices Act regulates market conduct of international liner cargo shipping companies that collaborate as conferences to coordinate joint services, share capacity and agree on freight rates. In another transport sector, the interstate trucking industry, the government is refusing to consider using legislation to fix the problems in that industry. The problems in that industry go to the existence of exploitative and unsafe industry practices caused by uncompetitive and Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19745 unsustainable freight rates. As the owner truck drivers of Australia are forced out of business by the policies and inaction of this transport minister, so too are Australian shipping operators. The federal government has ignored the defence, security and safety implications of abandoning a national fleet and, with it, an Australian merchant marine. I need not remind the House that Australia is almost totally dependent upon sea transport for the carriage of its imports and exports. In terms of tonnes per kilometre, Australia has the fifth largest maritime transport task in the world. Shipping is a major domestic interstate transport mode, with 48,388 kilotonnes of coastal freight in the year 1998-99. Major General Cosgrove, in his capacity as Commander of INTERFET, recognised the valuable contribution. In a letter to John Coombs, National Secretary of the MUA, Major General Cosgrove stated: I would like to take this opportunity to thank you personally for the kind efforts of many of the Maritime Union of Australia employees who recently supported the INTERFET Force deployment in East Timor. Many civilian ships have carried valuable people, equipment and supplies to the deployed forces, without which our logistic build up would have been severely hampered. That statement was made on 15 October last year. The Australian Merchant Navy has historically played an important role through its service in two world wars, at cruel cost, with one seafarer in every eight dying, and with many more disappearing unrecorded in the ships of many nations. Former Labor transport minister, the Hon. Peter Morris, is involved in establishing the first ever global inquiry into the effectiveness of international shipping safety standards, laws and practices. He acknowledges the need for this inquiry because elements within the merchant shipping industry are prepared to continually flout international safety rules to cut costs. The Australian community must be continually vigilant to ensure that the shipping industry does not compromise safety for profit. The Australian Labor Party believes that the policies of this government are doing just that. For that reason, in supporting the bill before the House, we must express our grave concerns about the policy directions of the government on shipping. PartX sets out the conditions for granting limited but assured exemptions from section 45 and parts of section 47 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to allow liner shipping companies to collaborate as conferences. The conferences are not exempt from section 46 of the Trade Practices Act that prohibits the use of market power. The bill implements the recommendations of the 1999 Productivity Commission’s review of part X to retain and amend that part. The bill also implements additional government amendments to bring it more into line with national competition policy. The amendments to part X proposed through this bill are: exemptions limited to shipping liner activities covering loading and operations at cargo terminals are clarified to include inland terminals used for assembling export cargo for delivery to a port, or delivering cargo to importers; the existing practice of allowing shipping conferences to negotiate collectively with stevedores to be confirmed; the provision prohibiting discrimination between shippers is repealed on recommendation from the Productivity Commission on their view that it could be harmful if it discourages price discrimination; a national interest test is included in the assessment of conduct by parties to an outwards liner shipping agreement that might unreasonably hinder Australian flag shipping; to empower the minister and the ACCC to accept court enforceable undertakings from shipping lines aimed at ensuring a net public benefit; to extend the protection afforded to exporters under part X to importers; to give increased powers to the minister and the ACCC to deal with conduct likely to result in an unreasonable increase in freight rates and/or an unreasonable decrease in services; to ensure that conferences will not be permitted to unreasonably restrict the entry of new parties; and to amend the objects of part X to cover the inclusion in the part of inwards liner cargo shipping services and Australian flag shipping. 19746 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 Labor has also been advised of additional government amendments to the bill to remove any ambiguity about the requirement that liner shipping companies must have a conference agreement registered under part X before part X exemptions relating to the agreement on freight rates come into effect. The Australian Government Solicitor has advised of the possibility for ambiguity in this area in sections 10.17A and 10.18A. I foreshadow also that the shadow minister has indicated that Labor does not oppose the additional requirements. The National Farmers Federation and the ACCC have called for the removal of part X and Treasury has argued that the exemptions represent an unnecessary anomaly in Australia’s competition policy. However, the Productivity Commission agreed with the submissions of shipping companies, peak cargo owners associations and the Department of Transport and Regional Services. The latter groups argued that the part X exemptions benefited exporters by ensuring that regular shipping services were available from Australia. Of course, reliable and regular shipping services are crucial to Australia’s export opportunities. To a limited extent, this bill assists Australian shipping. The objects of part X have always had that principle enshrined and that is welcomed by the opposition. We say to John Anderson-we urge him to listen-that if he does not provide some support and clearer policy directions to the Australian shipping industry, then soon there will not be an Australian shipping industry to discuss. That will be our loss as a community. Labor supports the bill. I move the amendment in the terms proposed by the shadow minister, Martin Ferguson: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its lack of support for the Australian coastal shipping industry thereby: (1) neglecting Australia’s national interests; (2) risking our maritime safety and marine environment; and (3) disregarding the importance of a stable, efficient and effective Australian Merchant Marine given the political instability in our region. cops a lot of stick. Unfortunately, it is usually the negatives that attract people’s attention, but there are many more positives than negatives. Of course, the negatives draw the crabs and create the overall perception that the NCP creates problems-usually for country people. The Trade Practices Amendment (International Liner Cargo Shipping) Bill 2000 is a clear example of how the NCP principles, when applied, can confer a benefit. The ACCC and the minister both gain increased powers under this bill to impact on activities associated with exporting and importing goods via container. The bill concerns liner shipping: shipping with non-bulk cargo that follows scheduled services. It usually involves containers, which is a rapidly growing area of trade. The benefits of more competitive shipping rates in this area will flow on to many areas of the Australian economy. The minister quoted the value of cargo carried by liner services at $85 billion a year. The intent of this bill is to amend part X of the Trade Practices Act 1974, which controls the ability of shipping companies engaged in liner activity to collaborate in the provision of their services. They can share space, set agreed rates and coordinate their activities. The changes cover the activities of these companies between freight terminals regardless of whether the terminals are at the port or some other location-for example, inland. The companies are able to offer door-to-door services but they cannot be covered under these changes to the act. For example, they will not be able to collude on overland freight rates.",141,Representatives Main Committee

313,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (10.14 A.m.),"National competition policy oftenWednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19747 In his second reading speech, the minister divided the consequences of the bill into six parts. The question of terminals-what is a terminal and the ramifications of that part of the legislation-was discussed in the first part. The minister said: In some port approaches such as Sydney and Melbourne where there can be considerable traffic congestion, shipping lines are developing a practice of placing containers on rail wagons and sending them to some inland facility before delivery to an importer takes place. A reverse operation in respect of exports can also occur. To my mind, that raises the question: what is a terminal? I would like more information from the minister about the process that determines what is acceptable in respect of those provisions. For example, shipping companies importing through Darwin, following the creation of the new Alice Springs to Darwin railway line, might try to argue that Melbourne or Sydney was the terminal for their imported products. That would probably be a great step backwards because competition between freight operators on the Darwin to Sydney route is hectic. Once the line is finished, sea freight companies will want to maximise their position and their opportunity to control the overland component. The second issue raised by the minister was the use of part X, as amended, to cover stevedoring arrangements. The minister says that, by allowing shipping companies to collude in their negotiations with stevedores, we can help drive down the cost of stevedoring activities. We all know-despite the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Denison-that bad waterfront practice in Australia had a tremendous negative impact and a retrograde effect on this country for many years. That began in the years when wheat and sugar were loaded in bags by extensive manual labour. Industrial muscle on the waterfront caused massive problems and increased costs for exporters and importers. Fortunately, the coalition government confronted this problem and has achieved a very positive outcome. I shall quote Chris Corrigan, whom opposition members probably believe to be the devil. In an article in the Financial Review on 5 October last year, he outlined some of the benefits that have flowed from the coalition government’s efforts to reform the waterfront. He stated: Since the new Patrick enterprise agreements came into effect in September last year, we have seen employee performances at Patrick terminals which were unthinkable two years ago. At Australia’s largest container terminal, East Swanson Dock in Melbourne, cranes are moving containers at a rate faster than was ever thought possible-more than 30 lifts per hour 30 per cent of the time. The monthly average at East Swanson Dock is now close to the Government’s benchmark of 25 moves per hour, with Port Botany not far behind. In fact, at the much-publicised Port Botany, a crane team recently set a new Australian record of 291 moves in a single shift. And of course all this was achieved with half the number of people employed and with half the number of man hours, permanent or casual, compared with two years ago. That is a very good example of the outcomes of that effort. I would like to underline that with an update, given that it was last year when Mr Corrigan made those comments in the Financial Review. The Waterline report, which was prepared by the Bureau of Transport Economics and came out in June 2000, stated that the five-port average crane rate for Australia was 20.4 containers per hour in the March quarter 2000, compared with 19.1 for the December quarter 1999, and was the highest achieved since the series commenced. Both the five-port elapsed labour rate of 25.4 containers per hour and the net ship rate of 31.8 containers per hour exceeded the previous quarter’s figures. Berth availability was 94 per cent in the March quarter, up from 88 per cent in the previous quarter, and was at the highest level since the series commenced. In 1999 the overall tonnage of cargo moved under coastal permits increased by 25 per cent compared with 1998. 19748 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 I will dwell on that report’s figures for ports around the country. In Brisbane the average crane rate was 21.2 containers per hour in the March quarter, up from 19.7 in the December quarter; in Sydney, 18.6 containers per hour in the March quarter, up from 16.6 in the December quarter; in Melbourne, 21.2 containers per hour in the March quarter, up from 20.3 in the December quarter; in Adelaide, 23.1 containers per hour in the March quarter, down marginally from 23.2 in the December quarter; and in Fremantle, 20.9 containers per hour. That shows the improved performance which has resulted from waterfront reform. So, when the government sets about dealing with issues on the waterfront, it has a very good track record and a very good position from which to make amendments. I am certain that, had we stuck with the Labor Party’s vision, there would be no prospect of any change at all. In that same article, Chris Corrigan said: Before the dispute, management was little more than a caretaker of assets which were effectively being run by the maritime union for the benefit of no-one but itself and at vast cost to the nation. It was the policy of the Australian Labor Party to keep that going. That is the kind of thing I mean. Let us imagine trying to run this bill today under the auspices of the Maritime Union of Australia. These companies would not be given any flexibility whatsoever. We would not be in a position to advance the nation’s interests. The member for Denison, speaking on behalf of the opposition transport spokesman, used highfalutin words about having wanted to drive down the costs of shipping when Australia’s freight task was much bigger than ever. The opposition did not give a stuff about that when it was in power. It did nothing but hold talkfest upon talkfest. It had union guys from the Maritime Union of Australia running its policy. Why have an ALP government in the shipping area when you can have an MUA government? That was the ALP’s policy, and that is what we would get. The opposition has said it wants to work closely with the unions. But it wants to work for the unions, rather than continue in the nation’s interests. The third provision in this bill covered by the minister was the extension of part X powers to importers as well as exporters. This is a significant area because, although some in parliament oppose anything that would make the importation process easier, we have to recognise that imports are a fact of life. At the same time as we make our exports more competitive through measures such as the GST, which removes a large burden from exporters, we must ensure that we are not hiding behind false barriers that artificially inflate the cost of imports. These types of measures may involve the imposition of inflated costs for handling imported goods, or witch-hunts after diseases on imported products where no such disease really exists. Other examples include the union idea that we should tax goods coming in from countries where standards of living are lower than ours. Whatever the false barrier we set up, all we are doing is trying to hide from the realities of cheaper alternatives available elsewhere, and supporting inefficient industries in Australia at the expense of our efficient ones. I might diverge there to give an example of the pork industry. At the last election the pork industry was in tremendous difficulty and the blame was being laid on pork imports. I think you will recall that the Prime Minister went to Wondi where there were a lot of pork producers. Their complaint, and the call that was coming particularly from One Nation, which was, incredibly, at its peak at that time following the state election, was for the government to crack down and stop overseas imports. Instead, the government put its money into encouraging an export capacity within Australia and now the pork industry is absolutely zooming ahead.",144,Representatives Main Committee
314,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Using international liner cargo ships, of course.Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19749 call for a crackdown on import capabilities. What we did was exactly the opposite. The outcome is better and more efficient trade for Australia and more advantage for our primary producers, a proportion of whom are in my electorate. The fact that we are now going to apply this to importation as well as to our exports means that we move more into the area concerning overseas jurisdictions and their ability to impact upon the industry. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry had this to say: In addition, the amendments covering inwards liner shipping will contain provisions for the minister to issue exemption orders covering those sections in part X that could lead to conflicts of jurisdiction ... The exemption orders will be disallowable instruments so that they will be subject to scrutiny by parliament. Next on the minister’s list was increased powers for the ACCC and for the minister himself. This is all about deciding where the benefit to Australia begins and ends in contractual arrangements that may well be intricate and difficult to fathom. Companies are wont to maximise their position and, with the extension of these laws to importers as well as exporters, a large part of relevant law that impacts on these provisions will move offshore, as discussed a minute ago. Nevertheless, according to the minister: The increased powers will only be used in ‘exceptional circumstances’, such as where the operation of all agreement results in an unreasonable reduction in shipping services and/or an unreasonable increase in liner shipping freight rates, and where the public benefit from the conference agreement may be lost. In these circumstances the minister will have the power to suspend, in whole or in part, such an agreement. It is pretty obvious when the provision of services is beginning to suffer because of a particular arrangement. If the number of services reduces significantly or rates rise dramatically there is no way our goodwill in extending these advantages to importers, for example, is being respected. On those occasions it will be essential for the minister to act. In that regard the ACCC has shown itself to be a powerful tool. Professor Fels is gaining a solid reputation as a hard-hitting protector of the consumer and the Australian marketplace. It was not so long ago that we saw industrial activities on the waterfront that were transparently unfair. We had grossly inflated manning levels and absurd and restrictive practices, such as the union controlled cleaning of the holds of vessels. That went on repeatedly and often there was one cleaning after another. We had jobs on the waterfront being handed down in families like peerages. We had slackers, as the member for Werriwa would call them, sponging off the rest of society, while waterfront charges and delays went right through the roof. An editorial in the Financial Review of 4 October 1990 states: According to the Productivity Commission, Australia’s container waterfront performance before the wharf dispute was well below that of overseas ports. It was easy to understand why. For years Patrick had had to deal with the MUA’s labour monopoly and its left-wing ideological hostility toward sensible workplace arrangements, at the expense of the country’s economic health and living standards. outrageous?

322,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Order!19750 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 ministers at the time did not do anything about it. We had 13 years of Labor ministers doing nothing. Everyone in the country could see the problem-everyone in the country except the Labor Party. They fiddled about the edges while the waterfront burned. When it comes to this legislation, it will be important that ministers act when they are called upon. The fact that at last the waterfront is so much more transparent and efficient should help, but the obligation will be on ministers to be active defenders of Australian consumers. A preview of an area of potential dispute was given by the minister in the fifth point of his second reading speech. For years, we saw the deadly impact of closed shop practices on the waterfront. It was no ticket, no start. It was jobs for the boys. No young Australian could go down to the docks and ask for a job. The pay for the favoured few who wormed their way into these sinecures was massive and the amount of work they did was minimal. The same outcomes apply among shipping companies. If they are able to form themselves into fat, lazy sinecures, our country will suffer. If there are to be so-called conferences of shipping to control liner cargo in and out of Australia, they need to be open in their outlook, if not in their structure. While so-called closed conferences are to be allowed-that is, ones where the existing members must give approval before a new partner is allowed in-the ACCC will have the role of watchdog. A newcomer will have the capacity, if refused admission to the boys’ club, to call in the ACCC. According to the minister, if such an investigation reveals that refusal to admit the new member is unreasonable, the minister will be empowered to either suspend the operation of the agreement in question or accept undertakings from parties to the agreement that would make suspension unnecessary. Finally, there is the role of the Productivity Commission. This bill arose because the Commonwealth chose to conduct a Productivity Commission inquiry into the effect of part X. That inquiry began on 12 March last year and was concluded on 15 September. Just before Christmas, the government announced that it would implement the changes recommended by the Productivity Commission and, in addition, a number of other changes were implemented in line with national competition policy. The Productivity Commission recommended, for example, that a national interest test be included in any assessment under part X of whether an Australian flagged service was being adversely affected by the activities of these conference lines. In closing, I would like to quote again from the editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 4 October 1999, which started off by saying: Last week’s news that Australia’s stevedoring industry has notched up a record productivity performance suggests that reform on our docks is working. But there remains unfinished business before Australia achieves a genuinely competitive and productive waterfront that does not add to the cost disadvantages of distance facing Australian exporters. This bill does assist in the continuing reform of Australia’s trade relationships when it comes to the export and importation of cargo by sea. I support the bill and commend it to members. (International Liner Cargo Shipping) Bill 2000, I would like to start by quoting Dr Peters, the head of the maritime section of the World Bank. During his speech to a conference in Melbourne in 1995, he made the following observation: The world’s ocean transport industry faces an unprecedented crisis... The international fleet has become critically over-aged and suffers from a deteriorating safety record. It is now just a question as to when the bubble will burst. At that point, a large portion of the international merchant fleet will be unfit for transport. The implications for world trade will be devastating.",147,Representatives Main Committee

324,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (10.33 A.m.),"In addressing the Trade Practices AmendmentWednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19751 Dr Peters told us that the average age of the world’s fleet was then about 17 years; that it was increasing in age at the rate of about eight months every year; and that some 75 per cent of the world’s tanker fleet was over 15 years of age. That situation is worse today. Although we can hold our heads high for supporting adequate safety, appropriate guidelines and salary for crew and regulation of shipping over the past 40 years, this has not always been the case. Just over 70 years ago, another coalition government led by Stanley Melbourne Bruce tried to destroy trade unions in general, and the maritime unions in particular. The strikebreaking company was called P&C Stevedores, the year was 1929. Not much seems to have changed in conservative party ranks in the ensuing years. It goes without saying that an island nation such as Australia must have a competitive and well-regulated shipping industry. Australia depends on shipping services to import goods from our international trading partners, as well as export of our quality products. A crucially important component of Australia’s international shipping industry is liner shipping. As the minister indicated in his second reading speech, liner shipping, which is mainly concerned with transporting non-bulk cargo, usually in the form of containers, was valued at $85 billion of Australia’s annual international trade. This is a vital sector of our economic health and, therefore, requires regulations specific to its requirements. This bill contains amendments to part X of the Trade Practices Act concerning the regulations imposed on liner shipping companies which choose to form conferences. These conferences are then granted exemptions from the Trade Practices Act in order to negotiate with exporters on standards of service and freight rates. Following on from the recommendations of the Productivity Commission about part X and its relationship with the national competition policy, the bill aims to make eight main changes to the Trade Practices Act. First, the exemptions granted to liner shipping conferences under part X will be limited to strictly maritime functions such as ocean transport, as well as loading and discharge operations at cargo terminals. The definition of ‘cargo terminals’ is to be broadened to include inland terminals where exporters and importers may prepare cargo prior to its delivery to port facilities. Second, the bill aims to clarify the legal position regarding the existing practice of shipping conferences negotiating collectively with stevedores. Third, the provisions relating to price discrimination between shippers is to be repealed. According to the Productivity Commission, the regulations serve no useful purpose and might discourage efficient price discrimination. Fourth, a national interest test will be applied to outward liner shipping agreements which may hinder Australian flag shipping. Fifth, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, as well as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, will be empowered to accept court enforceable undertakings given by shipping lines, aimed at ensuring a net public benefit. Sixth, the protection given to exporters under part X is to be extended, as far as is practicable, to importers. This includes the negotiation and registration of inward shipping agreements. Seventh, the minister and the ACCC are to be granted greater powers to deal with conduct likely to result in unreasonable increases in freight rates or decreases in services. Such powers are to be used only in exceptional circumstances and be fully appealable to the Australian Competition Tribunal. Last, shipping conferences will not be permitted to unreasonably restrict the entry of new parties into the Australian marketplace. Taken at the surface level, this bill merely makes a few amendments to the Trade Practices Act in order to make it broadly compatible with international law concerning shipping. The prerogatives and recommendations of the Productivity Commission have also been noted and incorporated into the legislation. That is certainly the view of this legislation from a superficial viewpoint, but below the surface one can detect an undercurrent of dark shadows 19752 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 and ambiguous meanings concerning the coalition government’s attitude to Australia’s shipping industry. Behind the scenes of everything this government attempts to do, in almost every sphere of public policy, is the familiar, old and tired rhetoric of competition at all costs. The more the Australian Labor Party attempts to warn the Howard government of the true consequences of its grand folly, the more it attempts to incompetently apply its ideology to increasingly unsuitable areas. I am particularly concerned with the application of sections pertaining to allowing international vessels entrance to the Australian market under the guise of ‘open competition.’ No matter how inappropriate the industry structure or its specific circumstances, the icy winds of the free market must almost always take precedence over everything else. That is the mentality which permeates this legislation behind its seemingly innocuous façade of insignificant amendment. The point I am trying to raise is that whilst vibrant competition is necessary for the continued growth and development of the Australian economy, this government does not know where practicality ends and dogma begins. It appears to be attacking the maritime industry in this country with a high-pressure blast of gratuitous free market policies which do little to help the Australian shipping industry internationally. Indeed, some of the provisions contained in this latest batch of half-baked and illogical legislation are a guaranteed recipe for disaster. The amendments to part X of the act are particularly concerning. Australia’s shipping industry possesses unique circumstances which separate it from other transport and manufacturing industries. Much as the government wants to ignore the reality, shipping companies and their seafaring employees cannot be put into the same basket as, for example, domestic haulage companies and their driving personnel. Security and certainty are valued very highly in the maritime industry, but the government seems to want to introduce insecurity and uncertainty into the system. The point is that the shipping industry has undergone considerable reform over the past two decades. That reform was commenced by the Labor government and it resulted in significant increases in productivity whilst maintaining appropriate protection for the rights and safety of seafarers. The Labor Party welcomes and supports genuine reform of the shipping industry. However, we do not support the erosion of seafarers’ working conditions under the guise of reform. In proposing this bill, the government claims to be seeking to build upon previous governments’ successful reforms in the shipping industry. However, it proposes to do so in a way that erodes workers’ conditions and dismantles an effective regulatory regime, leaving a vacuum in its place. Many of my perceptions of the industry have been formed by a recent visit to the MV Global Mariner. The Global Mariner is basically a floating museum dedicated to informing the public and the maritime community about the poor state of some flags of convenience ships and the treatment of many abused crews. For that reason, honourable members should consider some facts and the history of the maritime industry in Australia. In a confidential 1999 report for the Shipping Reform Working Group-a report which the government refuses to release publicly-the key determinants of Australia’s relative competitiveness were examined. The report found that Australia is at a cost disadvantage with other major trading fleets. That disadvantage is $2 million relative to comparable OECD flag ships and $3.5 million compared with similar open registered ships. The report concluded that one of the reasons for this cost disadvantage is that Australian ships employ Australian nationals, who are the most qualified seafarers in the world and who, despite this government’s best efforts, are paid more than Third World nationals. Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19753 Other countries in a similar position to Australia provide substantial assistance to their shipping industries. For example, in 1996 the USA provided $330 million of assistance in addition to an annual outlay of $165 million. Norway provides $68 million and France provides $1,066 million. Contrast this with the Australian shipping fleet, which has not received any financial assistance since 1996. If anything, this government’s approach is to further withdraw from its responsibilities: to deregulate, leave a void and to wash it hands of any involvement with the industry. In recent times, there has been considerable movement towards reform within the maritime industry. I do not think anyone here would suggest that reform has not taken place. The issue arises as to whether reforms are actually aimed at improving the living conditions of people engaged in the industry or at reducing life opportunities. I am particularly concerned that, if the bill is passed in its present form, this parliament could be rightly accused of facilitating the reduction in life opportunities for Australians. These are very serious propositions to advance-not matters to be taken lightly-and they go beyond the normal cut and thrust of political debate. Throughout the 1980s there were a number of attempts to implement recommendations contained in the report of the Committee on the Revitalisation of Australian Shipping, which was chaired by Sir John Crawford. There have been a number of reports and recommendations relating to shipping industry reform, and the principal objective of the reform strategy has been to decrease the cost of sea transport by reducing the operating costs of Australian ships. Negotiations and consultations on these issues are continuing-and so they should. In September 1994 a maritime industry restructuring agreement was signed that resulted in a number of enterprise agreements being entered into reflecting goals achieved during the restructuring process. As a result of this reform process, crew numbers fell from an average 30.9 in 1985-86 to 18 per ship in 1995-96, resulting in a substantial decrease in crewing costs-quite a substantial saving for shipping companies and shipping operators. These are the processes by which reform ought to take place: through negotiation and agreement. The Howard government has continued to pursue reform of the shipping industry, allegedly on the basis of moving towards a more internationally competitive position. On 13 August 1996, the Shipping Reform Group-SRG-was established by the former minister for transport, Mr John Sharp. I note that that reform group was established essentially for the commercial shipping interests in this country. It was dominated by the owners of ships. It did not involve any direct representation from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, nor did it contain any government representation per se. It comprised a CEO of Perkins Shipping and representatives of Mobil Oil, BHP, the Australian Shipowners Association, the National Bulk Commodities Group, Howard Smith Ltd and ALOR Pty Ltd. It was essentially a body made up of the shipping interests and owners of ships. The purpose of the group was supposed to be ‘to provide a mechanism for consultation within the industry on winding back and eventually removing the cabotage restrictions on domestic shipping and on the establishment of a second register for Australian shipping’. The SRG delivered its report to the government on 25 March 1997. It made four key recommendations in relation to what it regarded as labour reform. They included a move to company employment, a reduction in seafarers’ leave entitlements, the abolition of separate seafarer workers’ compensation schemes and the provision of anticipated redundancies. In proposing the move to company employment, the SRG recommended that the seafarers’ engagement system should be terminated after company employment became widespread. Minister Reith formally announced, on 18 December 1997, that the government would be 19754 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 actively pursuing company employment in the Australian shipping industry. That was implemented throughout 1998 and, as we see here, today. Although seafarers are no longer employed through an engagement system, the terms and conditions of employment are currently still prescribed by the Navigation Act 1912. We support reasonable reform of the industry which incorporates genuine consultation with all stakeholders and recognises the unique nature of the industry. I repeat: reform must take place with genuine consultation. This has not occurred in relation to the proposals contained within this legislation. In fact, the government majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, in stating that the process of consultation from the formation of the SRG has been imperfect, clearly identified that yet another parliamentary committee was stating just how inadequate these processes have been. There have been three ‘ships of shame’ reports. The first, chaired by Peter Morris, is widely regarded as a benchmark report in relation to the workings of the international shipping industry and, in particular, the appalling working conditions of some seafarers from non-traditional maritime nations. At the end of 1998 a further report, Ship safe, was delivered to the parliament by a committee chaired by Paul Neville. He was a government member and the majority of the committee comprised government representatives. The committee recognised that a ship is not just a means of transport and a workplace but also a social system. This accurately acknowledges that a ship is not like other workplaces. It is unique and, fundamentally, it is dangerous. The working environment doubles as the accommodation and recreation area. Seafarers are isolated in terms of their working environment and are separated from their families. They spend extended periods of time in confined spaces in their workplaces away from their homes. Further, the Ships of shame report found that on flags of convenience ships there is much greater potential for emotional, physical and sexual abuse of workers. Conflicts become potentially more dangerous than would usually be the case because the parties are forced to remain on the ship together, sometimes for weeks or months. These are not normal working conditions. They differ from those of virtually all other civilian employees in Australia. The 1998 committee, among its conclusions in the Ship safe report, stated: The committee urges the Commonwealth to take what steps it can to enhance the well being of seafarers. In all the focus areas before the committee in this inquiry, crew welfare appears to have progressed the least in the 1990s, and much remains in need of improvement. The need to protect seafarers was noted in that report: The abuse and neglect of crew members is of concern for two reasons. As a violation of human rights, it warrants international attention and condemnation. It also constitutes a significant risk factor for ship safety. Seafarers also face physical dangers greater than those faced by virtually any other industry. Seafaring is the second most dangerous occupation in the world. The Director-General of the ILO, when speaking at the ILO Convention in October 1996, stated: ... the dangers to which shipowners and governments are exposedand I should stress here ‘and governments’are financial or political in nature, but seafarers are exposed to physical risks which threaten their very lives. It has, for example, been emphasised that since 1994 180 ships of more than 500 tonnes have been lost at sea, causing the death of 1,200 seafarers and many passengers. In the first six months of 1996, twice as many human lives were lost at sea than in the whole of 1995. The findings of the Ship safe committee were consistent with the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee chaired by Peter Morris. Yet what is the response from the coalition government to the advice Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19755 of their own committee and the advice of the Senate committee? It is to continue its attempt to remove any participation by this country in a maritime industry, to lay open our coast to foreign crews-often on substandard ships-and to strip away existing protections and force seafarers to rely upon the Workplace Relations Act. The principal consequence of deregulation will be to force seafarers to negotiate as individuals. This is inappropriate, given the characteristics of the industry that I have described above. The government claims that the industry has changed and that protection is no longer necessary. As I have noted, the physical risks faced by seafarers have certainly not diminished. Unfortunately, operators who are willing to break the law and cut corners remain, even if it means putting the health of workers at risk or even potential for loss of life. Not only are seafarers subjected to dangerous working conditions but also those conditions are not improving, as has been asserted by the government. The 1998 Ship safe report noted: Whereas clear improvements have been noted in other focus areas, the committee is concerned that crew welfare is not being adequately addressed. It may even be deteriorating. The parliamentary committee that compiled the Ships of shame report heard evidence of the extent of maltreatment of foreign seafarers. This extended to such factors as: the denial of food and the provision of inadequate food; bashing of crew members by ships’ officers; maintenance of two pay books, one for the official record of International Transport Workers Federation pay levels and the other for the real, lower level of pay, or non-payment, of wages and overtime; inadequate accommodation and washing facilities; sexual molestation and rape; deprivation of access to appropriate medical care; and crew members being considered as dispensable. The 1998 report found: ... crews from non-traditional maritime nations are those which work in inadequate conditions, are poorly paid and whose living quarters are substandard. In conclusion, I remain to be convinced that these amendments will not open the door to flag of convenience ships that will undercut the rate of our nationally flagged vessels by exploitation, unsafe practices and tax avoidance. As we have seen, inquiry after inquiry has illustrated the appalling state of the industry. We also have evidence that other First World nations recognise the fact and are prepared to assist their industry compete with unfair practices. Instead of the Australian government tinkering around the edges of international shipping, they should openly commit to the development of a strong and viable Australian fleet to operate both nationally and internationally. Only in this way can Australia ensure the retention of a fundamental infrastructure vital to our island nation. In wrapping up this debate there are several points I will make. Firstly, I thank those who have contributed to the debate. I have some summing-up points to make and I will then turn to some of the issues raised by speakers, particularly those opposite, in relation to the importance of shipping and shipping reform in Australia, and on the questions of safety and of ships’ standards. The Trade Practices Amendment (International Liner Cargo Shipping) Bill 2000 amends part X of the Trade Practices Act 1974, which regulates the market conduct of international liner shipping companies that collaborate as conferences to coordinate joint services, share capacity and agree on freight rates. The government’s decision to amend part X was announced just before Christmas 1999. It followed its consideration of the Productivity Commission’s review of part X, which recommended-perhaps to the surprise of some-the retention of the legislation. There were a number of reasons, but plainly it reflected in part the view that, indeed, competitive pressures in the shipping industry were producing good results for shippers and that these arrangements did not inhibit that competition.",148,Representatives Main Committee
325,Mr Anderson (Gwydir,"Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (10.50 a.m.)19756 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 This bill introduces a series of measures to increase the protection that part X gives to Australian exporters and importers. The major changes are: firstly, extending part X to give importers similar countervailing powers to those available to exporters; and, secondly, providing additional powers to the transport minister and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to deal with ‘exceptional circumstances’ such as those that may result in an unreasonable increase in freight rates or an unreasonable decrease in services. Thirdly, the bill makes a series of other amendments which will improve the operation of part X. For example, it will reduce the part X exemptions for the current door-to-door basis to a terminal-to-terminal basis. This means that only activities covering ocean transport and operations at cargo terminals, including inland terminals, will be covered by the exemptions. It will confirm that the existing practice of shipping conferences negotiating collectively with stevedores is permitted under part X. It will provide for more effective and flexible enforcement of undertakings along the lines of section 87C of the Trade Practices Act. And it will ensure that decisions made by the transport minister or the ACCC under part X which affect the interests of shippers and/or shipping lines will be reviewable by the Australian Competition Tribunal. These amendments to part X represent a continuation of the process of regularly reviewing the mechanisms for controlling the conduct of liner shipping conferences, with the aim of ensuring that the arrangements result in overall benefits to the users of their services in Australia. On that note, I will come first to the issues raised about Australia’s economic interests before I come to those pertaining to safety and ship standards. At the outset, I want to indicate very clearly that the intellectual threshold in addressing Australia’s interests in the area of shipping is this: we need to clearly identify that we are not a shipping nation in the way that some nations are; we are a nation that ships. We are a shipper nation, not a shipping nation. It is a very important and very interesting distinction that needs to be clearly understood and that plainly, with respect, is not understood or not accepted, or not publicly acknowledged, by the Australian Labor Party and by the union movement. The issue at stake is that our focus ought to be, as an export nation, on obtaining the most competitive freight rates possible. A huge number of our export industries and the jobs that depend upon them are involved in highly competitive global markets. We are a long way from many of those markets. Shipping costs, rather than owning ships, is the priority for economic development and wealth in this country when it comes to constructing our policy approach in the area of shipping. what I said was I would address firstly the economic arguments and I would then come to safety and the matter of the standard of ships-so I will come to it. In short, access to competitive shipping is crucial to retaining export markets. It removes an obstacle to increasing value adding commodity processing in Australia, for example. That is a priority for government, and a lot of jobs now and in the future will depend upon it. In that sense, I do want to assure members present that the government will continue to reform Australian shipping. Consultations in that regard will continue to take place. Despite the undoubted reforms that have been put in place, the average cost of operating an Australian ship, as against OECD averages, has continued to rise. In fact, in very broad terms, it was around a $2 million disadvantage; it is now around $3 million to $3½ million.",153,Representatives Main Committee

328,Mr Wilkie,"That is because we have got fully qualified officersWednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19757 really do need to ensure you are a little better informed in relation to this debate. Let me say againMr Wilkie interjectingthat needs to show a greater understanding of where Australia’s real interests lie. is that industries in Australia should have access to competitively priced shipping services to carry Australia’s international coastal shipping. We have instituted a number of reforms that have made a substantial difference, not least of which is tax reform-tax reform that was opposed by the ALP. It resulted in a $30 million saving in the cost of fuel for the Australian shipping industry-a major saving that was actually opposed by those opposite. One would have thought they would have recognised that it would be of value to the Australian shipping industry and to the people employed in it. To come to the issue of substandard shipping, let me say that the government through AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, manages a very rigorous port state control program to ensure that vessels entering Australian ports meet very high standards of safety and environmental protection, including vessels operating on SVPs, single voyage permits. Through AMSA’s administration of the port state control regime, the government sends a very strong message that ships of shame will simply not be tolerated in our ports. Not only is AMSA managing a rigorous port state control inspection program; it is in fact exceeding its target in this area. One might have thought this might be of interest to those who purport to be the great champions of the Australian workers. We inspected 59 per cent of eligible foreign flag ships visiting Australian ports against the target inspection rate of 50 per cent. An eligible foreign flag ship is one that has not been inspected by AMSA in the previous 12 months. So they get a pretty rigorous going over on a pretty regular basis. Quite frankly, it is gratuitous, cheap, inaccurate and politically driven to make the observation or to try and make the claim that Australia welcomes substandard shipping in our ports. the figures. AMSA have inspected 59 per cent of eligible foreign flag vessels visiting Australian ports against their own target of 50 per cent last year. That is a very strong record.

(2) Section 45 does not apply to the making of freight rate charges in a freight rate agreement if: (a) the freight rates(including base freight rates, surcharges, rebates and allowances) specified in the freight rate agreement are for inwards liner cargo shipping services provided under a single registered inwards conference agreement after whichever is the later of the following times: (i) the end of 30 days after the last-mentioned agreement is finally registered; (ii) the commencement of Part2 of Schedule1 to the Trade Practices Amendment(International Liner Cargo Shipping) Act 2000; and (b) the parties to the freight rate agreement are the same as the parties to the registered inwards conference agreement.

(3) The exemptions provided by subsections(1) and(2) do not apply in relation to subsections 47(6) and(7). These amendments clarify the requirement that shipping conferences must register their agreements before the conditional exemptions from the competition rules of the Trade Practices Act to agree on freight rates come into effect. The enforcement provisions covering those conditions depend on the registration requirements in part X. The issue concerns the interpretation of sections 10.17A and 10.18A of part X. These sections were added to part X in 1991 to make it clear that shipping conferences do not have to include freight rate details in agreements submitted for registration or to notify the Registrar of Liner Shipping of changes to those rates. The second reading speech and explanatory memorandum tabled with the 1991 amendments clearly indicated that the part X exemptions were never intended to require the filing of freight rates when registering conference agreements. Such a requirement would be very costly to administer and would serve no useful purpose. The Australian Government Solicitor has now advised that there is at least a possibility that sections 10.17A and 10.18A allow shipping conferences to agree on freight rates without having a registered conference agreement, which plainly would not be satisfactory. The government amendments to the bill will remove any possible ambiguity about the requirement that liner shipping must have a 19760 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 conference agreement registered under part X before the part X exemptions relating to agreements on freight rates come into effect. amendments and that the shadow minister, Mr Martin Ferguson, proposes no objection in relation to them. On that basis we will facilitate the adoption of them. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with amendments. Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 June, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time. Martin Ferguson, I rise to support the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Amendment Bill 2000. This is a very important bill which goes to the issue of protecting our seas and coastal environment from pollution. It is important because the biggest threat to our coastline is pollution, particularly oil pollution. Not only that; the potential costs of clean-up from oil pollution are extremely high. The bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 to increase protection of the sea from pollution by imposing further regulatory constraints on bad ship operators. It will broaden existing arrangements that require ships to maintain insurance cover in respect of clean-up costs for maritime oil pollution. This bill will also make clearer the liability of shipowners in relation to clean-up costs and clarify the role of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, to recover costs associated with oil pollution. The civil liability act implements in Australia the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. That convention provides that the owner of an oil tanker is strictly liable for pollution damage in the territory or exclusive economic zone of a party to the convention. It also provides that the owner must maintain insurance to specified limits to cover pollution damage. Labor believes that the civil liability act as it stands is deficient because it applies only to ships carrying more than 2,000 tonnes of oil in bulk as cargo. It does not extend to empty oil tankers or to vessels carrying less than 2,000 tonnes of cargo oil. Also, it does not apply in relation to pollution by bunker fuel or to vessels registered in other states. Extending the requirement for insurance to cover damage from bunker fuel pollution is very important because bunker fuel can cause severe environmental damage. Labor supports this bill because it partially addresses these deficiencies by requiring insurance to be held by all ships of 400 or more gross tonnes, whether or not registered in a convention country, which carry oil as cargo or bunker, leaving or entering an Australian port. We still have a problem with the question as to why shipowners are not required to demonstrate they have insurance upon entering Australian waters. This issue is addressed in our second reading amendment, which says that by conducting the checks only as part of port control functions, there is a risk that ships passing through Australian waters will not have insurance. Our amendment condemns the government for failing to ensure that all ships entering Australian waters have oil pollution insurance, leaving checking functions to port based authorities, thereby not taking adequate steps to safeguard Australia’s marine environment.",155,Representatives Main Committee
336,Mr Kerr (Denison) (11.06 A.m.),I understand the opposition has had notice of these,158,Representatives Main Committee
337,Mr Kerr (Denison) (11.07 A.m.),"On behalf of the shadow minister for transport, MrWednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19761 The 400-tonne threshold has been considered because ships of 400 tonnes and above are required to meet existing international standards, in particular those relating to certification for safety and pollution prevention standards. This threshold will minimise the impact on the shipping industry. Larger vessels also represent the greatest risk of serious pollution. Also, the size of vessel is subject to the existing enforcement regime and the monitoring and enforcement requirements can be met within existing resources. The implementation of this bill, such as the checking of documentation to demonstrate insurance is held, will be the responsibility of the Australian Customs Service and AMSA surveyors. I did note in the previous debate the minister’s assurances about the competence and reliability of AMSA. I understand that later speakers will be drawing attention to some of the less glorious instances where AMSA perhaps has failed to meet the standards that the minister asserts. I hope that, when those matters are put on the record, he will take urgent steps to ensure that any deficiencies so identified are actually followed up. That is the responsibility of the minister. There has existed an ambiguity about AMSA’s powers to recover costs incurred where there has been a threat of, but not an actual, discharge or disposal from a ship, and AMSA has taken action to combat that threat. An example is where a ship has gone aground. The bill removes ambiguity by enabling AMSA to recover costs in these circumstances. The bill is important when one considers that AMSA receives about 300 oil spill sighting reports each year. Of these, 22 incidents each year are considered serious enough to warrant some kind of response. To date, all ships involved in major spills in Australian waters have had insurance coverage and the costs of oil spill response have been reimbursed to AMSA and state or territory response agencies. There are, however, no guarantees that all ships visiting Australian waters will have the necessary insurance coverage. A recent incident in New Zealand involving an uninsured ship has reinforced those concerns. This bill is consistent with the landmark 1992 House of Representatives Ships of shame report that uncovered a litany of rorts, environmental disasters and criminal practices plaguing the international shipping industry. The report revealed massive problems with ships that were docking in Australian ports. It had a profound impact on people’s perceptions of the shipping industry and led to an increased level of scrutiny. It is well worth noting the reaction of the House of Representatives standing committee on transport when the report was tabled. The report detailed the: ... sickening state of affairs associated with the operation of substandard ships that was revealed as the inquiry proceeded. The committee learned of inadequate safety equipment, false ships’ papers, the sexual abuse of young sailors, beatings and crews being forced to sign dummy pay books. Former Labor Transport Minister Peter Morris said: We saw a situation where seafarers were dying by the hundreds at sea; ships were sinking after loading and going out of port; and a general situation where it was very clear that ships were going to sea that should not be at sea. And we saw that the loss of life at sea was just unacceptable and that there was an exploitation and abuse of people working on lots of ships. The Ships of shame report is important to this debate because the issue of sea oil pollution is directly linked with the outrageous practices that became widespread in the shipping drive for profits by shipping owners who seized every opportunity to cut costs in the burgeoning postwar trade. Flags of convenience ships are registered in host countries that want the registration revenue but turn a blind eye to issues of seaworthiness, health and safety, and proper wages. Ships are registered in countries like Panama or Liberia, even though their owners may be Americans, Europeans or even Australians. The captains may be abusive drunks, the ships rust buckets and the crews suffering cruel and inhumane conditions 19762 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 with low pay or no pay. These ships of shame survive because they are cheap and when things do go wrong, the owners are impossible to track down. Australia has seen many of them. In one notorious 18-month period in the 1980s, for example, six bulk carriers were lost off the Western Australian coast and more than 50 sailors died. The Ships of shame report highlighted two distinct problems: the seaworthiness of the ships entering Australia and the treatment of crews on those ships. More than eight years on, these issues are still with us, mainly because of this government’s obsession with axing cabotage and encouraging more foreign flag ships to our waters. Cabotage is the system whereby jobs on Australian coast routes are reserved for Australian seafarers and where the work of coastal shipping is reserved for Australian ships. Cabotage applies to shipping around the Australian coast and does not exist in the international trade where ships are allowed the right of free passage through a country’s territorial waters. In recent years it has become obvious that this government has an ideological hatred towards cabotage, encouraging the use of single voyage permits to undermine cabotage with a view to destroying it. In 1995-96, there were 421 single voyage permits and no continuing voyage permits. In the period from 1998 to 1999 the figures rose to 704 single voyage permits and 41 continuing voyage permits. This represents an increase of over 40 per cent in the number of single voyage permits issued during the period. The continuing voyage permits increased from zero to 41 over the same period. The shadow minister for transport and various other important matters has mentioned to the House before how this very deliberate policy of the transport minister, Mr Anderson, sets out to subvert the intent of the Navigation Act 1912. I again remind the House that the intent of the Navigation Act 1912 is to require ships engaged in coastal trade to be licensed. The licence requires the ship operator to pay Australian wages for the time the ship is on the coastal trade. The act allows the minister to issue permits to unlicensed ships but only in certain and particular circumstances. I suggest to the House that the current policy of the government goes way beyond the intent of the act and way beyond that which is in the best interest of Australia and of our defence requirements. By adopting an approach that encourages the use of more single voyage permits there is a greater danger that flags of convenience ships will be used to undermine health and safety, maintenance and proper wages and conditions. The other point to note is that a significant percentage of the vessels using single voyage permits are oil tankers. In recent times our shores have been hit with some devastating oil spills involving Australian ships and foreign vessels. For example, the loss of 300 litres of oil from the Italian Laura D’Amato in Sydney Harbour in August last year reportedly cost $4.5 million to clean up. The loss of 325 tonnes of bunker fuel from BHP’s Iron Baron in Tasmania in 1995 cost more than $3.5 million to clean up. MightI say, as a Tasmanian, not only did it have an economic cost, it had a terrible social and environmental cost. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority deals with safety. It does what it can to police Australian waters under what is known as port state control rules-international treaties that grant a nation control over the soundness of ships in its territorial waters. Generally, AMSA has done a good job but there is little doubt that suspect ships are slipping through. MightI again mention that obviously there are particular matters that the member for Melbourne Ports will be raising later in debate which will require the minister’s attention. As our second reading amendment points out, there is still no process to check that all ships entering Australian waters have the necessary insurance. At our recent national conference in Hobart, the Labor Party reaffirmed our support for the cabotage provisions of the Navigation Act and it condemned the Howard government for abusing the single and Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19763 continuing voyage permit provisions of the act to disadvantage and undermine the Australian shipping industry. This attack on the shipping industry has had disastrous effects on defence, environment, immigration, and the national security of Australia. The replacement shipping companies and work forces have no allegiance to Australia, pay no tax, and are effectively guest labour in the Australian domestic transport sector. What we are left with is a strategy of blindly pursuing lower costs in the Australian coastal trade at the expense of more important priorities for Australia. What Labor is talking about is fair and reasonable pay and conditions for crew and the maintenance of our unique Australian marine and harbour environments. The current bill will go part of the way towards helping protect our coastal environment from polluters. We therefore support it, but there has also got to be a total rethink about the Australian government’s treatment of the Australian shipping industry and the people who work within it. On behalf of the shadow minister, Martin Ferguson, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for not requiring ship owners to demonstrate that they have adequate insurance cover on entry to Australian waters, and thereby not taking adequate steps to safeguard Australia’s marine environment”. (Civil Liability) Amendment Bill 2000, a bill which amends the 1981 act of the same name and clarifies shipowners’ liability for expenses incurred under the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981. In doing so, I would commend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for introducing this bill. It is a significant step forward. The problem in the past has been the question of liability. For example, when funds are expended in a clean-up operation, it may well be very difficult to pursue the further liability involved. This particular bill requires all vessels entering Australian waters to have insurance so that if there is an extensive clean-up involved then all cost aspects of it-the chemicals used, the police used and the specialist workers who are involved in the whole process-are covered by the insurance policy in place. Ninety-five per cent of the vessels that fit within the requirement of 400 tonnes up to 2,000 tonnes-vessels above 2,000 tonnes already have this requirement-already have insurance coverage. With this legislation, ships that do not have insurance coverage will now be obliged to do so. It is a protection of our marine environment in terms of cost recovery. So it is a step forward. This bill acts on the recommendations made in two reports, the 1998 Ship safe report and the 1992 Ships of shame report. It also fulfils a commitment made by the government in December 1998 in Australia’s ocean policy statement. As the previous speaker, the member for Denison, said, there is no doubt that there has been concern about the ships of shame that travel internationally. This legislation is about protecting Australian waters, Australian crew, and others who are involved in the marine trade, from the impact of these types of vessels. The bill makes a simple change to the existing legislation in that it requires certain ships that pose a potential risk to Australian waters to insure themselves against the cost of any oil spill clean-up operation. It should be noted that shipping companies are already required to undertake such clean-ups; but, as I mentioned before, the problem is that, when the money runs out, where do you go to ensure that there is cost recovery and that the government is not once again required to pick up the bill? This bill makes it obligatory for shipping companies to insure themselves against this eventuality, thus ensuring that all costs are covered.",158,Representatives Main Committee
338,Mr Baird (Cook) (11.22 A.m.),"I rise to commend to the House the Protection of the Sea19764 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 By way of background, the need for this legislation is clear. Thankfully, Australia has not experienced the type of environmental disaster involved in the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska some years ago. Having visited Alaska several years ago and seen first-hand the impact of the oil spill on that area, we need to be vigilant to ensure that all aspects of protecting our marine environment are put in place, because such a spill would represent a huge disaster for our pristine waterways. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure that, in terms of your beautiful part of the world and the protection of the waterways there, you would not want to see a repetition of what occurred in Alaska. We had a major problem in terms of the Sydney Harbour oil spill that occurred on 3 August last year, when an Italian tanker released 300,000 litres of oil into Sydney Harbour in a little over 25 minutes. The effect on harbour wildlife was very significant. It was a long time before a reasonable recovery could be said to have been made. A further example came to light on Phillip Island in January this year, involving a relatively small spill. While it is estimated that the spill involved only about one tonne of oil, again, the effects were significant. A number of birds and their young were killed, and at least 216 fairy penguins were significantly affected by the spill. In this case no culprit was forthcoming immediately and there was a possibility that the Australian taxpayer would have to meet the total cost of the clean-up. Following a lengthy police investigation, and after a sixweek period, the Attorney-General was able to announce that the police investigation had successfully traced the responsible vessel. In the end, a fine of about $5.5 million was imposed on the vessel. So the clean-up costs from this spill-a small one in comparison with many others that reach the headlines-could be recouped. Overall, about 300 oil spills are reported every year in Australia. That represents nearly one every day. Twenty-two out of the 300 have been regarded as significant and involved the type of response that we see outlined in this bill. In other words, serious oil spills are not as rare as we might believe, and the recoupment of costs is important. Every response to an incident such as an oil spill has a significant impact in terms of costs. There is the financial burden of paying for the chemicals and complex operations that are involved in the clean-up. There are the costs of bringing in experts and volunteers, and the lengthy police investigation. As you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, there is the cost of the impact that such spills have on the local fishing or tourism industry in an area which has a pristine environment. In terms of the mechanics of the bill, under the existing act, ships and shipping companies that use Australian ports are not required by law to have insurance that covers the cost of these spills. The bill puts this provision into the legislation. While it is true that most companies do have such insurance now, there remain a small number of tankers that come into Australian waters that do not. The bill inserts a new part IIIA into the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act that requires all ships weighing between 400 gross tonnes and 2,000 gross tonnes to maintain insurance to cover them in the event of an incident. Ships of 2,000 tonnes or more already have this requirement. There was some question as to whether the weight should have been less than 400 gross tonnes, but it was felt that ships of 400 tonnes and above were subject to regular inspections and that those below that weight were not likely to have the same serious impact on the environment as heavier vessels. It would also be extremely difficult to try to check all vessels. Ships of 400 gross tonnes and over will be checked by Australian Customs Service officers as part of their routine paperwork checks of such vessels. If a vessel does not meet the requirements of this act, it will be detained until it does. Appropriate action will be taken. Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19765 As I have said, the bill clarifies the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s licence to exercise its powers under the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act. This allows AMSA to take preventative action such as moving or even sinking a dangerous vessel and to recover these costs from the ship owner as well-which takes the process one stage further. For instance, in the past if a ship ran aground but there was only the threat of a spill and no actual spill, there was some uncertainty under the existing legislation as to whether AMSA could recoup any costs arising from preventative action. This amendment confirms AMSA’s ability to recoup those costs. A shipowner’s liability for these costs is in turn capped in accordance with the limits set out in the Civil Liability Convention. Any outstanding costs that arise from this maximum liability clause are then met through the international fund created by the convention. In his second reading speech to the bill, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry noted that Australia has been one of the main players in pushing for an international regime of compulsory insurance to cover the cost of oil spill damage. A new international agreement on this topic is currently being drafted, and it should be completed some time next year. However, these provisions are being introduced early due to the high priority that the government has placed on the protection of Australia’s fragile marine ecosystems. The provisions have negligible compliance costs for those affected and have the full support of the Australian Shipping Federation. This is a significant amendment that will do much to recoup the costs associated with significant oil spills. It is important that we continue our efforts against ships of shameparticularly in terms of protecting the Australian marine environment. The last thing Australia needs is a repetition of the Exxon Valdez Alaskan oil spill disaster. This bill will allow the cost of oil spills to be met by the perpetrators of the spills and by insurance companies when vessel owners run out of funds-or claim to have done so. Significant oil spills, such as the case of the Exxon Valdez, will be dealt with under the international agreement, and it is good to see Australia playing a significant role in facilitating such agreements. I commend the bill to the House. Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Amendment Bill 2000, which will adopt recommendations in the 1992 Ships of shame report and its 1995 sequel, should be supported. These reforms are long overdue. However, the government should be condemned for not taking this opportunity to ensure that ships weighing more than 400 tonnes are obligated to prove that they have adequate oil pollution insurance to cover the cost of any pollution damage caused before they enter Australian waters. The bill instead leaves these checking procedures to portbased authorities, thus allowing non-insured ships to travel into Australian waters without Australian authorities knowing whether they have adequate insurance. This leaves Australian waters vulnerable to damage caused by rust buckets such as the infamous Kirki. Because it dealt with an isolated offshore facility, that ship did not come into contact with port state control. Hence, when it broke up off the coast of north-western Australia and polluted a large area of our oceans, it was not being monitored by the proper port control people. The leakage of 300,000 tonnes of crude oil from the Italian flagged and owned tanker the Laura D’Amato into Sydney Harbour on the night of 3 August 1999 will be remembered by many honourable members. It certainly made Australians aware of how vulnerable our coast and ports are to oil spillage. The morning after the incident Sydney awoke to experience at first hand the immediate consequences of an oil spillage. It is probably the incident that sticks in people’s minds and the reason why this parliament is now considering this legislation.",161,Representatives Main Committee
339,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11.33 A.m.),"The opposition acknowledges that the19766 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 An overpowering smell like rotting plant and animal matter and the stinging oil fumes was pervasive all over that part of Sydney. A massive clean-up operation took over a week and involved 450 people, including 33 members of the Maritime Union employed by the Sydney Ports Corporation and Stannards. The crew on board the Laura D’Amato, a mixture of Filipino ratings and Italian officers, was implicated in the spill. Two valves inside the hull of the tanker appear, whether intentionally or negligently, to have been opened up to five weeks before the ship reached Sydney. The valves were certified as sealed by the external surveyors at the port of loading in Saudi Arabia. The cost of such a clean-up can run into millions of dollars. Moreover, the long-term effects of maritime pollution have consequences for Australia that range from the degradation of our environment and our fishing industry to effects on the tourist industry. A 60-page report by the head of Sydney Waterways, Matt Taylor, has recommended the prosecution of the owner and crew of the Laura D’Amato for the 10-kilometre slick that the leakage caused. The ship and crew were allowed to leave Sydney after the Neapolitan owners of the vessel posted an $8 million bond. In the meantime, the Sydney Ports Corporation has commenced lengthy legal proceedings under the Marine Pollution Act. Yet this act only provides for fines of up to $1.1 million for a corporation and $200,000 for an individual. Many have said that this ‘accident’ was predictable and inevitable, from a foreign flagship with a poorly paid, poorly trained, Third World crew of ‘convenience’ and substandard equipment and safety check measures. The owners of these ships know they are poorly maintained and dangerous. This seems to be the kind of globalisation that the Deputy Prime Minister was anxious be practised around Australian coasts these days when he talked about the overpricing of Australian shipping. The crew, usually recruited from Third World countries, are poorly trained, badly paidsometimes not paid at all. The shipowners see their crews as dispensable and therefore have no qualms about shocking working or living conditions. Blocked drains and toilets, malfunctioning equipment, defective or no fire fighting or lifesaving equipment, corroded cranes, winches and anchor cables, and vermin infestation are common features of such vessels. These boats are known as flags of convenience because they are registered with minimal cost, or sometimes no cost at all, in a country which turns a blind eye to safety standards and badly trained and poorly treated crews. These vessels, referred to as rust buckets or coffin ships, are now commonly known as the ships of shame, after the great report of that name that a former transport minister brought into this House after a 1992 House of Representatives committee inquiry. These ships make up only one in five of the world’s fleet but account for more than half of the worldwide shipping losses and marine pollution. If the problems of poor safety standards, malfunctioning equipment and badly treated and poorly trained crews were addressed seriously by countries like Australia, leakages from boats like the Laura D’Amato might never happen. Indeed, all steps should be taken to stop such devastating spillages happening anywhere. The previous speaker said that we have not had an Exxon Valdez in Australia. We ought to be taking all measures to see that we do not have one. We in Australia, with our dependence on sea transport, should be doing all we can to protect our marine environment. If the government was serious about the protection of our maritime environment, it would deal with these so-called ships of shame. Instead, we have a government that appears to be encouraging these vessels to use our ports more frequently. It has lifted restrictions on foreign vessels carrying Australian domestic trade and has suspended funding of the maritime industry. Indeed, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, the government agency Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19767 responsible for marine pollution, seems to be increasingly reluctant to pursue claims that these ships of shame are often responsible for deliberately releasing pollutants and toxic substances into Australian waters. You have to ask, why, when AMSA was presented with convincing evidence recently in Adelaide that the bulk carrier Joint Spirit had deliberately altered its engine room plumbing to allow oily waste to be dumped at sea rather than retaining it on board, AMSA failed to take action. The 1997 built 23,400-tonne dead weight ship Joint Spirit is owned by Kambra Kisen of Hiroshima, and is managed by Astro Shipmanagement of Manila under dual Panamanian/Philippines registry. On a voyage to Adelaide in May of this year-we are not talking about the Ships of shame report in 1992-the ship had a Korean captain and a mainland Chinese crew. While the vessel was loading barley for Japan, a Chinese crew member of the ship found his way to the Adelaide Mission to Seafarers pastor and explained in broken English that there had been environmental abuse taking place on the Joint Spirit. He had photographs, which showed that, over a two-week period, oily sludge was being directed straight into the ocean while the vessel travelled through Australian coastal waters and while at anchorage in Adelaide. He also explained that the crew’s wages were being withheld, but there was more concern with environmental issues. When AMSA was approached about the sailor’s claims and shown photos, they were quite excited that this could well be hard evidence that would enable the Australian authorities to arrest the ship, its captain and engineer. I am happy to produce photos to the minister to show that the sailor did not fabricate these claims. Strangely, however, the next morning when AMSA came to investigate and verify whether these photos demonstrated that oily sludge had been deliberately released into Australian waters, their enthusiasm had waned, and within 20 minutes or so they reported that the ship was fit to sail. This is not good enough. Despite the International Transport Workers Federation and its Australian affiliate, the Maritime Union of Australia, demanding an independent engineering inquiry, and despite managing to detain the ship for several days, their request went unheeded by the Australian government. This is something that I think is emblematic of the ideological view that pervades all of the government’s attitudes towards maritime matters. I do find it strange that the general manager of AMSA’s Marine Environment Protection Services, Mr David Baird, who, I understand, is related to the member for Flinders, was promoted to this general manager’s position from the humble position of surveyor for AMSA in Melbourne. I am sure the government is not packing public positions with its supporters or seeing that people who have the same ideological anti-union view of the world have such sensitive positions. I am sure it was done entirely on its merits. The International Transport Federation, church bodies and environmental groups have been pursuing the ships of shame on an international level, bringing to the attention of governments around the world instances of negligence and deliberate marine pollution, and making representations on behalf of crew who are often found to be suffering chronic health problems and malnutrition. Often these sailors have not been paid for untenable periods of time. Rather than working with the International Transport Federation and its Australian affiliate, the MUA, to address the problems that are still being caused by the ships of shame-and the underlying cause of deliberate and negligent damage to Australian coastal waters-this government has for some years been directly involved in an ideological mission to destroy the maritime union, both its seafaring branch and its stevedoring branch. I think this says something about the government’s credit on the issue of whether it is sincerely committed to safeguarding Australian coastal waters. While the opposition supports this bill, widespread doubts about what barristers call ‘the credit’ of this government should inform parliamentary and public debate. I would like to 19768 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 inform you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of a couple of examples of the kinds of ships of shame that have been visiting Australia since the report came out. An Indonesian radio officer, Budi Santoso, perished at sea after leaping overboard from a Panama flagged vessel Glory Cape to escape a mugging with iron bars. The hand of an Indian seafarer, Suhrid Bhowmik, turned gangrenous after being denied urgent medical attention off Geraldton. A Honduran, Rommel Salvadore, was rescued only minutes from death after climbing overboard from the Panamanian flagged vessel MV Hunter to escape abuse off Newcastle. A Korean, Baik Hyeong Ki, was disfigured for life by sulphuric acid due to slack safety on board the Panama flag vessel Sunrise Sakura in Brisbane. An unnamed Filipino seafarer was burnt alive with a shipload of Australian sheep on board the Panama flagged livestock carrier Uniceb. Two BHP workers were injured when the iron ore carrier Gigi2 broke up in Port Kembla. These are in addition to the more than 2,000 seafarers marooned around the world and 450 detentions of unsafe foreign vessels by Australian port control alone during 1996-98. I will read a message that I think is astounding. This was in a bottle tossed off a ship of shame anchored off Port Kembla in 1998. The message said: Please, if you can, call ITF because we have big problem on board. No money, no food, no water. Thank you. This related to an incident on 12 April 1998 where a Romanian crew aboard the Greek-owned Panamanian flag of convenience ship of shame, Tomis Future, was noticed by a local fisherman within earshot of the vessel. They waved frantically until he brought his craft closer, then they threw the message overboard in the bottle. The fisherman took it back to port and eventually it found its way to the ITF affiliate, the MUA. The ITF Australia got the crew off the ship and fed, paid and repatriated them. This is not an isolated case. This is one of the dramas being enacted almost daily around our coast and around the world. The member for Denison spoke of the increasing use of non-Australian seafarers in our coastal trade and gave some of the figures. They plainly illustrate his point that this government is, for ideological reasons, seeking to introduce more single-permit voyages, allegedly for commercial advantage, but, in my view, more to destroy the MUA and to bring the kinds of ships that I have described on to Australia’s coast to replace the safe practices and the merchant experience that we have here in Australia. I would remind this House of the record of the merchant navy during the Second World War. I was recently astonished to read the World War II history of the merchant navy in Australia. There must have been 40 or 50 merchant navy ships sunk off the coast of New South Wales by Japanese and German submarines. The history of Australia and the role of the merchant navy in Australia’s continuing commercial life obviously are of no interest to this government. This is illustrated further by the attitude of the government towards the MUA in the area of stevedoring. The hatred of the minister for workplace relations for the MUA and its members is well known. It is astounding that the Australian media and the public are not aware of the apparent contradiction in what this government said it was doing in engineering the massive waterfront strike. Its ostensible motives were to lower the costs of stevedoring charges for Australian importers and exporters in Australia and thereby benefit the Australian public and consumer. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you look at the cost of dry containers between any of our major ports and trading partners-between, say, Melbourne and Tokyo, Melbourne and Seoul or Melbourne and Singapore-you will find the cost for importers and exporters has not dropped one cent. The only thing that has changed is the share price of Lang Corporation, which has gone from $1.50 to over $9. There are no benefits for Australian consumers and the public from this ideologically motivated government with its hatred of the Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19769 merchant navy and of stevedores. It is disadvantaging the Australian people in a large number of areas, including in the costs of goods and services that should be being provided by both P&O and Patrick to importers and exporters around this country. There has been no advantage gained by the Australian people from that massive industrial dispute, whose ostensible motive was stated by the Prime Minister, in an address to the New South Wales Liberal Party conference, as lowering the stevedoring costs for importers and exporters. I am particularly surprised that members of the National Party have not been onto this more. They seem to support, as does the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, every Federal Court motivated attack on the MUA, but they do not notice that the lowering of costs of stevedoring charges is not being passed on to Australian farmers via Patrick or P&O. I notice that the Deputy Prime Minister, during the big, very expensive festa that this government had in London recently, met the chairman of P&O, Lord Stirling. I hope that in those conversations, all these months after the big maritime dispute, the Deputy Prime Minister was pursuing the Australian interests and seeing that P&O would lower, at last, the cost for Australian importers and exporters. Minister was tugging the forelock. We will see. I have asked a question on notice of the Deputy Prime Minister about the purpose of his meeting with Lord Stirling of P&O. The government’s credit on these maritime issues, both in seafaring and in stevedoring, is very low. The member for Batman and the member for Denison have indicated their support for the government’s measure. We have moved our own amendment. We will support the maritime and stevedoring industry as far as it affects the Australian national interest. This measure is something towards that end, but I believe that the matters I have outlined undermine severely the government’s credit on these issues. Ms JANN McFARLANE (Stirling) (11.52 a.m.)-The issue of pollution of our marine environment is one that impacts strongly on the electorate of Stirling. The electorate has some of the most pristine beaches in Australia and the northern part of the electorate also contains part of the Marmion Marine Park, which is an environmentally sensitive area. A huge number of my constituents engage on a daily basis in leisure activities such as surfing, fishing, sailing and diving. These activities are threatened by marine pollution. Last year I was invited to tour the MV Global Mariner when it docked in Fremantle. This ship was sponsored by the International Transport Federation and was touring the world as part of the ITF’s ships of shame campaign, a campaign that highlighted vessels carrying flags of convenience as a terrible environmental risk and exposed the appalling treatment of seafarers on these vessels. The Western Australian branch of the Maritime Union of Australia hosted the visit to Fremantle. I take this opportunity to congratulate both the state secretary of the union, Wally Pritchard, and the assistant secretary, Dean Summers, for their willingness to discuss maritime issues with me on a regular basis. On the Global Mariner there were a number of extremely graphic audiovisual displays that left the viewer shocked by the magnitude of some of the disasters caused by the greed of unscrupulous shipowners who hid behind flags of convenience in an attempt to evade their responsibilities should an environmental disaster occur-shipowners who use a flag of convenience to avoid maintaining a safe, mechanically and structurally sound vessel, who use a flag of convenience and put at risk the lives of seafarers sailing on these deathtraps. The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Amendment Bill 2000 is a step towards making shipowners responsible for environmental clean-up costs. The bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 to broaden existing arrangements that require ships to maintain insurance cover in respect of clean-up costs for marine oil pollution; clarify the",163,Representatives Main Committee
340,Mr Sercombe,"He was more likely tugging the forelock, wasn’t he?",167,Representatives Main Committee
341,Mr Danby,"My colleague the member for Maribyrnong says that the Deputy Prime19770 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 liability limit of shipowners in relation to clean-up costs; clarify the ability of AMSA to recover costs associated with combating oil pollution threats; and convert all penalties in the act from dollar amounts to penalty units. Shipowners already have an obligation to meet any pollution liabilities that they incur in Australia. This bill requires shipowners to have insurance so that these liabilities are met in most circumstances. The limited liability of this bill leaves some questions unanswered in the case of a major spill. However, it is an improvement on the current situation. I would like to say categorically that liability for pollution caused by vessels should be the responsibility of a shipowner, not government or the community. By requiring ships to carry insurance for marine pollution, we are taking a small step in the right direction to tighten controls on ships of shame. The civil liability act has a major flaw. It only covers ships carrying more than 2,000 tonnes of oil in bulk as cargo in a contracting state. It does not cover empty oil tankers or vessels carrying less than 2,000 tonnes of cargo oil. It also does not apply to pollution caused by bunker fuel or to vessels registered in other states. This bill attempts to address this flaw with limited success. One of the problems with this bill is that it does not require ships of less than 400 gross tonnes to hold insurance. It is a positive step that all ships of 400 or more gross tonnes, regardless of the country in which they are registered, which carry oil as either cargo or bunker, are required to hold insurance. Another flaw in this bill is that shipowners are not required to demonstrate they have insurance upon entering Australian waters. Checks are to be conducted as part of port control functions. This creates a risk. Ships which are not visiting Australian ports but which are travelling through Australian waters cannot be checked. There is a real risk that ships carrying a flag of convenience can still travel through Australian waters uninsured and cause pollution. The bill sets out guidelines for checking insurance cover. Customs officers will check all ships that enter Australian ports to see whether they have insurance cover. This will not cause any further administrative burden on Customs, as it will occur during the routine check of documentation that already occurs. This is a trade-off whereby total vigilance is compromised by an attempt to keep costs under control. Checking vessel insurance prior to entering Australian waters should be the process, not the flawed process set out in this bill. What happens to ships that do not have adequate insurance? These ships may be detained. The master and owner of an uninsured detained ship will be liable, upon conviction, of a penalty of up to 500 penalty units. Detaining the vessel, however, is a more active deterrent to shipowners not having proper insurance when entering an Australian port than any fine. The inclusion of bunker fuel in this bill is also a positive step. As I mentioned previously, liability extended only to oil carried as cargo. Bunker fuel is a heavy fuel oil used on oil burning ships. Due to its high viscosity, it is difficult to clean up and causes extensive environmental damage when released into the marine environment. An example that is widely used regarding the threat to the environment caused by bunker oil is the Iron Baron incident. The Iron Baron grounded on a reef off the coast of northern Tasmania in 1995. Approximately 300 tonnes of bunker fuel oil escaped into the environment. Clean-up costs were estimated at $3.5 million. There was a significant impact on local marine wildlife, especially little penguins. I am extremely aware of the impact of the release of bunker oil on the marine environment. If this were to happen off the coast of Fremantle, pollution would spread along the coast, damaging the local marine environment and threatening our tourist industry. In the electorate of Stirling, Scarborough is one of the main tourist attractions for both Western Australians Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19771 and overseas visitors. A release of pollution into this area would have substantial negative effects not only on the local environment but also on the local economy. I hope that nothing like this happens. This bill does take positive steps to control marine pollution. The International Maritime Organisation has, and is in the process of developing, conventions that provide a framework that deals with the prevention and indemnification issues concerned with marine pollution. The IMO is currently in the process of developing a bunker oil convention. This convention is not expected to be finalised until March 2001, and it may not come into operation until 2002. Therefore, this bill is a welcome step in the short term. The issue of marine pollution is only one of the issues facing our shipping industry. Australians need to protect what is arguably the most beautiful and naturally productive coastline in the world. To safeguard this important resource for future generations, we need to ensure that the shipping in our waters is of the highest quality. Workers in the coastal maritime industry have been campaigning for a greater presence of Australian flags in our coastal and overseas merchant fleet operations. To prevent marine pollution, we need to target ships carrying flags of convenience. These ships pose a potential environmental risk. The ratio of shipping casualties for flags of convenience and second registry vessels is three to one against vessels that carry a national flag. I am concerned by the trouble free process by which foreign ships can be granted a single voyage permit to trade anywhere on the Australian coast. Supposedly, a single voyage permit should be issued on a one-off basis when an Australian or suitable licensed ship is not available. This is not happening. Rather, these ships, which are too often substandard, are relying on permits to conduct scheduled runs around the Australian coast at the expense of Australian ships. Australian ships are insured and are properly maintained. There is no point introducing insurance provisions if ships are still substandard. This bill provides AMSA with the powers to recover costs for environmental clean-up operations. We need to look further than this bill on insurance to ensure that the seaworthiness of the vessels sailing on our waters is rigorously examined. Encouragement of the Australian shipping industry, a clampdown on ships carrying flags of convenience and the removal of discrimination against Australian vessel operators through misuse of single voyage permits are all required. The government has been talking about preserving our pristine environment. To do this it should look at the issues I have mentioned. The Labor Party supports this bill but we condemn the government for not making the inspection process more rigorous. The risk still remains that an uninsured vessel sailing through our waters could cause an environmental disaster. We only have to look at the Kirki fiasco off the coast of Western Australia to see that this scenario is very real. We need to avoid this happening again. The only way to do this is to ensure that ships sailing in our waters are insured and seaworthy. Flags of convenience ships are a real threat to our environment and a threat that we should not have to face. The government needs to take real action against such ships of shame. Let me sum up briefly and then come to some of the points that have been raised. There are four amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 in this bill. The first and most important of these amendments will require all ships of 400 tonnes or more to be insured to cover the cost of a clean-up following an oil spill. This will extend current insurance requirements for oil tankers to all types of ships. It should be said that most, if not all, Australian ships already have this insurance. The amendment will affect only the small number of foreign ships that are not insured. I understand around 95 per cent of ships are",167,Representatives Main Committee
342,Mr Anderson (Gwydir,"Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (12.02 p.m.)19772 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 insured. The amendment does not require any additional liabilities on shipowners. It simply requires them to be insured to cover existing liabilities. There have been some suggestions that the amendment does not go far enough and that there should be obligations on cargo consigners or ships charterers not to deal with a ship unless the ship has the appropriate insurance cover. Such a requirement would pose some very real difficulties with enforcement and there would be very little to gain from it. The requirement for insurance will be well publicised. It is highly unlikely that an uninsured ship will come into an Australian port and risk detention. Shipowners’ liability is to be clarified by the second amendment. Currently, where the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, or AMSA, takes intervention action to prevent pollution from a ship, a shipowner is liable to meet AMSA’s costs but the upper limit payable by the shipowner is not clear. The amendment resolves this issue. The third amendment will allow AMSA to recover its costs where it has responded to a threat of a discharge or disposal of pollutants-for example, where a ship has gone aground or caught fire. Currently AMSA can only recover its costs in cleaning up after an actual discharge or disposal of pollutants. The final amendment is to convert monetary penalties to penalty units. This has no effect on the value of the penalties. The bill is an important measure in protecting the marine environment. Let me respond to some of the comments that have been made again in this debate as they were in the previous debate about the amendments to the Trade Practices Act covering part X and also in relation to liner conference arrangements. I reiterate that inspection rates by AMSA of ships in Australian ports have been running ahead of target at around 59 per cent of ships. AMSA sets very high standards and, indeed, will detain ships when they do not meet satisfactory standards. I agree entirely that we do not want another Kirki, and I make it very plain that the government does not want another one either. We are putting in place the procedures to make certain that the chances of that happening again are reduced to the greatest degree possible. AMSA sets very high standards and, indeed, will detain ships when they do not meet satisfactory standards. I agree entirely that we do not want another Kirki, and I make it very plain that the government does not want another one either. We are putting in place the procedures to make certain that the chances of that happening again are reduced to the greatest degree possible. I note too the Labor Party’s comments regarding crew welfare. They appear to echo comments made by my colleague Senator Julian McGauran at the opening of the Seafarers’ Welfare Forum held last week in Melbourne. The forum was hosted by Stella Maris and the Australian Council of the Mission to Seafarers, two organisations that do very valuable work in improving the welfare and working conditions of seafarers. That forum was sponsored and organised by my department, by the government. The government’s commitment to this forum demonstrates its real interest in the welfare of seafarers. We hear the ALP pretending that they are the only people who are interested in the welfare of seafarers. However, I note that only one member of the Labor Party-just onecould be bothered to attend that forum last week and it was not the shadow minister, it was not the member for Batman. I want to make the point also that there has been the constant claim by the ALP that we are not concerned to look after the Australian shipping industry or the people in it. That claim is based in part on the ALP’s closely wedded arrangements with the unions in the industries on the waterfront and in shipping, and its inability to break free of the view that we ought to be a shipping nation, when in reality our clear priority is to be a nation of shippers. We are an Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19773 export economy-we are not a shipping economy-and our objective is in securing low freight rates. That does not mean that we have to compromise safety or standards in any way, shape or form. I want to emphasise particularly that we are concerned to maintain those standards, and that we are concerned for the welfare of seafarers. I understand that one of the forum recommendations was for the formation of a national seafarer welfare organisation. I am more than happy to give that very close consideration. ones who bleat constantly about this issue, and your commitment to it was demonstrated by the fact that although this is constantly used as an attack against me by the member for Batman, he was not there. Let me again emphasise that AMSA have a very important role to play in monitoring the standard of ships and that they do find defects in the accommodation and living arrangements on ships inspected under the port state control regime. In those cases a ship’s master is directed by way of a deficiency notice to have deficiencies rectified. Where those defects are of a sufficiently serious nature the ship can be, and ships have been, detained, pursuant to section 210 of the Navigation Act 1912, to ensure rectification before the ship sails. That brings me to the point where I thank the opposition. I have made a few points about what I see as their inappropriate focus on this and their consistent refusal to recognise that we can indeed set standards. We do set standards, we are committed to these things, but our primary focus in terms of prosperity and jobs for Australia has to be on securing low freight rates and being prepared to recognise that our economy is dependent upon us being efficient shippers rather than a shipping nation. Having made those points, I thank the opposition for its support. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Employment, Education and Workplace Relations Report Debate resumed from 14 August, on motion by Dr Nelson: That the House take note of the report. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (12.11 p.m.)-I am very pleased to speak about this report, entitled Age counts: an inquiry into issues specific to mature-age workers, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations. I was privileged to serve as a member of the parliamentary committee that compiled this report. In doing so, we took evidence from around Australia and, in many locations, heard directly from mature age unemployed people. That experience reinforced to me the need to never lose sight of the human face behind the unemployment statistics. In considering that human face, I refer to the contributions that I have received from two individuals in my electorate who are mature age unemployed. The first individual, R.C. Robins, wrote to me and I would like to quote some extracts from his letter. He says:",169,Representatives Main Committee

346,Mr Anderson,"No, I was not there; I have a lot of things on my plate. But you are the19774 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 I am writing this letter in disgust of the government’s recent comments and how it has singled out the unemployed on more than one occasion. I have been in the unfortunate position of being on the “dole” for several months. Like many in my age group it was no fault of my own that I found my self in this degrading situation. He goes on: UntilI was retrenched I had never been out of work, had always been able to support my family for nearly thirty years. It is not easy being out of work, trying your best to cope and being forced into a situation no one in their right mind would enjoy. The government is wrong when it declares that people become complacent and don’t want to work. I was offered a menial position for one month and managed to extend it to two months only because I had achieved more than was expected of me. The point I am making is that many of us want to work but due to circumstances are not able to obtain work. If the government implies that we enjoy being imprisoned in our homes day after day, because that’s how it feels they are mistaken. May be it’s time the government makes a genuine commitment to help people to seek employment instead of blaming and pointing the finger. That extract from the letter to me summarises the attitude that we need to take to the unemployment problem: we must recognise the human face of that problem. Many of the parliamentary committee’s recommendations in this report are directed towards recognising that human face: moving away from the rhetoric of finger pointing, blaming and naming and using terms like ‘job snobs’, and really addressing the problem. That contribution also speaks clearly of the heartache experienced by those left behind in a growing economy. Our economy has grown, enjoying a record stretch of growth dating back to 1992, and we have experienced a decline in the unemployment rate as a result. But this growth in and of itself is not solving the long-term unemployment problem. We have seen relatively small falls in long-term unemployment-29.7 per cent unemployment to 27.7 per cent in the last financial year-and very small falls in the number of very long-term unemployed or persons unemployed for more than two years. That percentage fell in the last financial year from 17.9 per cent to only 17.5 per cent. As this report makes clear, these trends are accentuated for mature age workers who, despite having better than average labour force participation rates and lower unemployment rates than the population generally, are at greater risk if they become unemployed. If they become unemployed, mature age workers are at a disproportionate risk of becoming long term unemployed or very long-term unemployed. The report posits various explanations for this, including age discrimination and the changing nature of work, rendering middle management jobs on the one hand and unskilled jobs on the other increasingly redundant. The problems that may arise for older workers of not having, or being perceived not to have, relevant skills, and the reluctance of employers to train older workers, are some of the explanations for this phenomenon that the report canvasses. Against that general background I wish to address the following three issues arising from the report: the nature of the industrial setting in which we are dealing with the question of mature age unemployment, the poor performance of the Job Network, and the role for regional policy. The report deals extensively with the fact that many mature age unemployed become so because of redundancy, and the way in which redundancy is treated is a key factor in determining the ability of the job seeker to secure new employment. The committee received evidence ranging from people being given five minutes to pack up their desks and leave the building after years of loyal service to high standard redundancy agreements negotiated between employers and unions to facilitate job search prior to redundancy taking effect. The grief, loss and health reactions to being made redundant are detailed extensively in this report. There is no doubt that those reactions are heightened if Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19775 people are given little notice or little warning and are treated badly during the redundancy process. The government members of the committee have recommended that a code of conduct in relation to redundancy be adopted to resolve this problem. The Labor members are sceptical about the efficacy of such a voluntary code. I think that scepticism is justified when, during the course of taking evidence and compiling this report, we were actually made aware of the fact that under the current legislative regime, which imposes one obligation on employers in relation to redundancythat is, that they need to notify Centrelinkthat obligation is honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Indeed, we took evidence in Newcastle that employers simply did not notify Centrelink when they were going to make workers redundant. We actually took evidence that National Textilesa very notable redundancy situation in this placedid not abide by its legal obligation to notify Centrelink when it made its workers redundant. So, given that the one legal obligation on employers at the moment tends to be honoured in the breach rather than in the observance, we are legitimately sceptical of the efficacy of a voluntary code. Having said that, obviously any regime which assists with educating employers about their obligations when making workers redundant is worthy of some form of support. I would now like to move to the issue of the performance of Job Network which was extensively canvassed in this report. Worker after worker who came before the committee gave evidence that in their view they had been parked, to use the terminology-that is, their Job Network provider had identified them as hard cases for getting into employment and had not made genuine or real endeavours to assist them with finding work. It has to be said that those conclusions were disputed by Job Network providers, but it was an experience that was repeated time after time in evidence by mature age workers who came before the committee. In those circumstances, it appeared to the committee that perhaps there was an accountability difficulty in terms of making sure that Job Network providers were doing the right thing by each and every unemployed person they were supposedly assisting. We need to recognise that the Job Network scheme has been predicated on allowing Job Network providers to pick winners and maximise profits by assisting people most easily employed back into employment. This fact was actually referred to by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business when it came before the committee. It said that the relationship between an individual unemployed person and the Job Network provider is in a black boxand really the department makes no or little inquiry about what happens within that black box. It was clear from the committee’s work that within that black box many mature age unemployed people are not being treated fairly. I would commend to the government for its serious consideration recommendation 27 in this report. It deals with increasing the accountability of Job Network providers for what happens within that black box to make sure that each and every unemployed person gets some form of legitimate assistance from his or her Job Network provider. I would also commend strongly to the government recommendations 28, 29 and 30, which deal with benefit changes, so that mature aged unemployed people do not have to liquidate all of their assets prior to becoming eligible for some form of social security assistance. I trust that the government will take those recommendations seriously. In relation to the Job Network system, apart from accountability, it seems to me-and this was not recommended by the report but, having heard the evidence which led to the report, I am increasingly of this view-that the so-called mutual obligation regime for unemployed people is one-sided. That is, unemployed people are increasingly told to bear new obligations of reporting, work search and the like, whereas the government, through Job Network providers, is not necessarily matching that obligation through the provision of services. 19776 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 One aspect that needs to be corrected in this system is that, whilst we are told that this is a competitive market in relation to the provision of services, the one thing we do not know about this competitive market is the question of price-that is, the amount that Job Network providers are paid to assist unemployed people is kept commercial-in-confidence. If the government genuinely believes in the rhetoric of competition and the market, the government would well know that a hallmark of a competitive market is perfect information and that there would be no reason why we as parliamentarians, or individual unemployed people, Australians generally, should not know what is being paid to Job Network providers to assist unemployed people. It would seem to me that that would give some form of empowerment to the unemployed person in their relationship with the Job Network provider; that they would be able to say, ‘I understand that you are getting X dollars to assist me,’ and they could then have a realistic discussion about how much of that quantum could be directed towards training programs, wage subsidies and the like. Having heard the evidence which led to this report, I would strenuously urge that as a change that ought to be made to the Job Network system. In addition, I would like to briefly address the question of labour market mobility and the need for regional policy because that seems to me, having heard the evidence around Australia, to be a theme of this report as well. On the question of labour market mobility, I would refer specifically to the evidence given by Mr Richard Denniss, a research associate of the Centre of Full Employment and Equity at the University of Newcastle. This evidence was given in the context of the Treasurer’s remarks that, to facilitate employment in regional Australia, perhaps wage rates ought to be lowered; and it goes directly to that question of the nature of regional unemployment and labour market mobility. The government’s perspective appears to be that, provided you have a growing economy, somehow the unemployment problem will fix itself right across Australia. And they continue to hold that view, notwithstanding that we can point to areas across Australia where unemployment is not being addressed even by growth in the economy. Against that background, the Treasurer thought perhaps it could be fixed by lowering wages. The evidence that the committee took was clearly that labour market mobility questions and regional growth questions cannot simply be addressed by maintaining a growing economy, they need to be addressed by specific regional policies. The evidence before us was in the following terms. First, there is not a significant difference in rates of mobility between WKH86DQG$XVWUDOLD WKDWHYLGHQFHZDVDFWXDOO\SURGXFHGE\5HVHUYH%DQNHFRQRPLVWV,WLV important that we recognise that, because it is often posited that the labour market in America is much more flexible than ours, but that is not borne out by the data. The evidence received by us also went to the question of price sensitivity to downward adjustments in wages. The evidence given is that, if wages are adjusted in those areas, we are going to tend to reduce consumption power and therefore have a downward spiral that threatens the livelihoods of local businesses who depend upon local consumption for their survival. The key conclusion from this evidence that we received in Newcastle is that, in order to make a difference to those areas which are facing high and stubborn unemployment problems, one needs to look not only at physical infrastructure, like problems with transport and communications, but at skills questions. I thought all of that evidence was very important, and particularly important in view of some of the issues that I face in my electorate. One of our local areas, the Sunshine area, which is in the municipality of Brimbank, consistently faces an unemployment rate which is more than double the national average. Obviously, amongst those figures would be large numbers of mature age unemployed people. Without spatially based policies directed to that unemployment problem in the vicinity of Sunshine, we will never really do anything about Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19777 that unemployment issue. That is an area which is not addressed by this report, but I think it is something that needs to be seriously considered if we are to make a difference for people right across Australia. In summary, I think this is an important report which should be studied by all members of the House. I trust that the government, in relatively short order, will give us a response to the report and adopt many of its recommendations, particularly those recommendations dealing with improvements in the Job Network and benefits structures. Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations was asked to inquire into the social, economic and industrial issues specific to workers over 45 years of age seeking employment or establishing a business following unemployment. The member for Lalor alluded to a number of the recommendations that came out of this report. While I do not dispute the content of the report as she described it, it is important to note that the comments on Job Network made by various witnesses were in fact made about Job Network No. 1 and not about the current system. Many of the accountabilities that she has called for have been enacted by the minister, independent of the recommendations in this report. Our report, Age counts: an inquiry into issues specific to mature-age workers, is the result of 18 months of investigation into issues that affect the lives of thousands of Australians either directly or indirectly. As a member of this committee since 1996, I have been very proud of the two inquiries into employment. In the last parliament, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know as a member of that committee, we undertook an inquiry into youth employment, and in this parliament we have undertaken this inquiry into mature age unemployment. The committee’s work and its final report offer a comprehensive assessment of issues that regularly come to my attention as a local federal representative. The report also offers a comprehensive list of recommendations, many of which have been applauded by the contributors from my electorate. The residents of Deakin, like those in many other electorates, have been touched by the dramatic changes that have hit our society since the mid-1980s. Like it or not, lifetime employment-that is, being employed in the same company, or at least in the same industry, from 15 to 65 years of age-has been a thing of the past for over a decade. The economic stability experienced in Australia from the fifties through to the mid-1970s is unlikely ever to be replicated. This reflection is important, as the Australians who are the subject of Age counts were born, raised and commenced work during these years. For many, the experience of work was a natural one. It flowed almost automatically from their schooling and continued, in many cases without interruption, to retirement. Since 1996, the Howard government has delivered on many election commitments. But it is fair to say that the issues behind this report, together with the demographic trends in our society, represent one of the next big challenges for any government. As with other reports, the recommendations contained in Age counts are now being considered by the government. I look forward to a full and considered response, and to being part of a government that will implement a range of new policy initiatives. It was a pleasure to be part of this inquiry for a number of reasons. To hear the formal evidence was extremely gratifying. More importantly, it was gratifying to hear the personal stories from the unemployed. Their evidence was heartfelt and often expressed the sense of frustration, disappointment, anger and, I am sad to say, the feeling of hopelessness about reentering the work force after a period of being unemployed. Through their evidence, I am glad to say that the once forgotten unemployed, those of mature years-45 and older-are no longer forgotten. We have listened to their stories, we have made recommendations and we",171,Representatives Main Committee
347,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (12.26 P.m.),"In March 1999, the House of Representatives19778 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 will act on their needs. To my mind, the need for urgent action has only been reinforced by their stories. In particular, I would like to thank those who participated in the committee’s public hearing held in Ringwood, in my electorate of Deakin. Although many individuals and organisations contributed, I particularly wish to acknowledge and thank those who appeared on the day-Mary Archibald, Noel Buchanan, John Ford and Ross Gardiner. Also, the evidence provided by Jobs East, the Area Consultative Committee for the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, was important. Louise Rolland, the executive director, its former chairman, Louise Di-Guisto, and former deputy and now chairman, Neil Stevenson, all gave valuable evidence to the committee. In addition, we also heard from the Indo-Chinese Employment Service, located in Box Hill. Their representative, Mr Hoang Vu Nguyen, offered rare evidence on the plight of the ethnic mature age unemployed. In formulating and debating public policy, the issues arising from Australia’s ageing population are increasingly apparent. In the case of employment policy, these issues are equally relevant. The age group 45 to 65 is rapidly becoming a larger proportion of the overall population and will increase rapidly until 2011. These problems are made worse by the trends of males in their 50s to retire early. It is abundantly clear that there is a need to address the circumstances of particular individuals, as well as the demographic imperative for Australian society to change the way it views those of mature age. It is important that we value the contribution which these people have made and continue to make in the workplace. It is a universal problem which is not unique to Australia. Last year I had the opportunity to meet representatives from the ILO in Geneva, as well as a very prominent social researcher from Switzerland, Ms Genevieve Mulday-Reday, who has been researching the various public policy initiatives in Europe which are aimed at addressing mature age unemployment. The evidence from Europe is that they, too, are struggling to overcome the problem and are struggling to implement policies which will work. In essence, I believe employers are one of the keys to addressing this issue. At the root of the problem is a need for a change in mind-set, both from the perspective of the employer and to some extent from the perspective of the mature age unemployed. One of the report’s recommendations is to have an Australian version of the British Employers Forum. I am pleased to say that Jobs East, my local area consultative committee, has, with the help of Minister Reith’s and Minister Bishop’s departments, pioneered such a forum. The principal aim of this work is to address the stigma and the negative stereotypical behaviour displayed by some employers towards workers aged over 45 years. Last year’s inaugural conference held in Melbourne was a resounding success. However, it is evident to all, including Jobs East, that the forum should now be held at a national level auspiced by a national body rather than by a regional ACC. Nevertheless, I congratulate Louise Rolland and her team for pioneering the forum in Australia. At this moment, Louise is on her way to Washington, where she has been invited to the US Committee for Economic Development conference titled ‘Ageing of the global work force: role of longer work lives and other policy responses’. I understand that Ms Rolland is the only representative from Australia to this conference, and I look forward to hearing of the conference’s outcomes. With respect to the change in mind-set for mature aged unemployed, I anticipate it will probably be more difficult for the current generation. Lifetime employment, the need to have a job or a career that is at least equal to or better than the last, and fulfilling the expected role of being the main breadwinner, all add pressure to the unemployed’s employment decision. For example, trends in participation rates show that the biggest level of participation is not amongst the males but amongst women aged 45 to 55, with more older males opting out of the labour force. Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19779 The concept of mature age unemployed males taking on a portfolio of jobs has been canvassed in this report. A portfolio of jobs can be seen as an alternative career direction. But, more importantly, if one does not look at that as a career direction, it can be part of the process of regaining the morale to take on re-employment. Of course, one of those jobs which is part of the portfolio can lead to full-time work. The Age counts report includes a number of recommendations, some of which may come across as controversial. I would like to touch on a number of these. The first is one which the member for Lalor spoke about, which is the introduction of a code of conduct for employers when carrying out retrenchments or redundancy programs. In my past life-and I am not proud of it-as part of my role as a human resources manager, I took part in various retrenchment and redundancy programs. Each time, I made sure that the most appropriate process was in place, giving due respect to those who were about to lose their jobs. The code of conduct which we talked about and then canvassed in a roundtable discussion with all the various players and stakeholders in the labour market area is one which government members have recommended. The code should be viewed as a best practice model to which all enlightened managers need to aspire in a similar fashion to the quality assurance standards which companies now adopt in the supply of product, and in the manufacturing process. A code of conduct can be used as a quality assurance model for the outplacement/retrenchment process, particularly by managers of small and medium businesses. There is sufficient evidence that outgoing employees who receive timely notice, counselling and outplacement assistance will have a better chance of finding another job. It is far better if you have a support system around you to help you to get a job rather than being out there on your own trying to muddle your way through the various processes and bureaucracies along with the nervousness of going to your first job interview after 10 or 20 years out of the job market. The Work for the Dole program was another recommendation. I am pleased to say that we recommended the Work for the Dole program in this report. The evidence from the Shoalhaven Area Consultative Committee was that they felt very positive about their own Work for the Dole program and advocated its extension to people over 45. It was suggested that those over 45 should be dealt with individually rather than having to work in groups with other unemployed people. We recommend this program, under a name not stigmatising to mature age workers, be extended on a voluntary basis to long-term unemployed job seekers over 45 years of age. One of the other recommendations was for mentors in industry. One may ask, ‘What is a mentor in industry? It is a concept we are not familiar with.’ We have found that there are unemployed people with experience and maturity who can play a valuable role in developing younger employees. In fact, the trend in Europe is very much down this path and some of the countries in Europe have adopted it. Whether or not it has been successful at this stage has yet to be decided but there are early signs that it will be. This sort of assistance-to employ some of these long-term unemployed as mentors in industry-is appropriate in a range of different circumstances, whether it be employment as part of the Work for the Dole type program or even as a niche program. Early intervention is certainly something that is highly canvassed and recommended throughout the report. Given the trauma experienced by many retrenched workers and their potential to be long-term unemployed, the committee recommends that there is a need for a fast-tracking procedure to identify as soon as possible those mature age workers at high risk of long-term unemployment for immediate access to the assistance they need. Recommendation 26 is that the Jobsearch Classification Instrument be applied to all 19780 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 retrenched employees before assessing their eligibility for income support, and that it preferably be done while they are still in employment. When mature age job seekers have been assessed by their JSCI as being at high risk of long-term unemployment and have met the assets and income tests, these clients should be immediately assigned to intensive assistance rather than having to wait for the qualifying period. The need to reduce waiting time for unemployment benefits was also also recommended. Under current laws, mature age unemployed with more than the specified level of savings cannot access unemployment benefits immediately. The committee was aware, however, that until relatively recently not every worker made superannuation contributions. Instead, some prepared for their retirement through private savings and investment. Those with no or little superannuation, therefore, should be given additional consideration. I know this is a measure long advocated by some of my constituents. I am sure that some of them would say, ‘Can’t we implement this retrospectively?’ That is a separate issue and a separate fight that needs to be taken up. Establishing a small business is often a high-risk option. Many mature age people, having lost employment, choose to establish or purchase a small business. However, many of these do not survive, often with very severe personal consequences. Key factors contributing to business failure include unrealistic expectations, lack of access to sufficient finance and inadequate business. It is imperative that budding self-employed business people be adequately counselled concerning opportunities, the risks and their chances of success. Training is a vital component of this and small businesses need to be provided with that training. Business management training is ignored by over 70 per cent of small business owners. They believe they know everything they need to know about small business; all they have got to do is open the doors and the customers will come in. If there was time, I would go through a number of other recommendations. I know that the member for Rankin will probably address a number of issues which I have not. I wish to express my thanks to the chairman, Brendan Nelson, and the deputy chairman, Rod Sawford, the other committee members and, importantly, the secretariat staff, for what I believe is a most important report which all members of the House should read. I look forward to its recommendations being adopted by the government. witnessed the social tragedy of unemployment amongst mature age workers. We had some first-hand experience of it, at least in respect of the fact that we saw a parade of very sad, despondent and demoralised unemployed mature age workers. I commend those workers for their initiative and their courage in coming along and talking to the committee so that we were not operating at some sort of academic level but at a very practical and real level where we could hear first hand of the social consequences of long-term unemployment amongst mature age workers. It is a fact that the rate of unemployment amongst mature age workers is lower than the overall rate of unemployment and is lower than the rate of unemployment amongst young people. However, the most salient point is that the duration of unemployment amongst mature age workers is extraordinarily long and it is in this that the social problems lie. Increasingly the definition, in the minds of employers at least, of the age of a mature age worker is coming down, so that we are now witnessing situations where people as young as 35 years of age are being regarded as mature age workers. People who have been in the work force for perhaps 15 years are regarded as mature age workers and, by being so treated, they are being stereotyped by employers. We found plenty of evidence in the inquiry that someone who comes along at age 35 is regarded almost as over the hill by an employer. One of the",175,Representatives Main Committee

If anyone comes along to their business trying to get a job, it may be that the human resource manager will look at this person and say, ‘That person is older than me. I don’t want to bring someone into the firm who is older than me,’ so there seems to be this bias towards recruiting people who are younger than the human resource managers. That brings me to an observation that I want to make as a result of this inquiry, and it brings perhaps a note of optimism. As life expectancy increases-and it is increasing in Australia-we should contemplate the point that when a business invests in a person who is being recruited into that business it invests inevitably in training. That means the resources of the business are devoted to giving the person who has come into the business the requisite skills to operate and be productive in that business. During the 1980s there was a movement that I think is now certainly regrettable towards reducing the age of retirement for superannuation and other purposes. It came to be accepted wisdom that 55 was the right age to retire. Consider this situation: an employer has a young person come along. ‘I have to invest in this young person,’ he says. But increasingly younger people go from job to job to job. That is not a bad thing, but the investment that that person puts into a young person may yield a return for only two or three years. However, if the hiring company business puts some investment into training an older person, and life expectancy increases, then the return may go on for many years. For instance, someone 45 years of age might be quite happy to stay in that business until 60. The employer is getting 15 years return, most likely, as a result of the investment into that mature age worker. Hopefully, as life expectancy continues to increase and our idea of what constitutes the working life of a worker expands, in the eyes of employers over time there will be some merit in the idea of choosing a mature age worker over a younger worker, in which case we may be able to break that cycle of very long-term unemployment among the mature age workers. If that ever happens it will be wonderful, but it will not occur in the work force for some years yet; it may occur gradually over time. In the meantime we have witnessed first-hand some of the devastating impacts of unemployment amongst mature age workers. I would like to refer therefore to some of the recommendations in the report. One relates to health, which I think is one of the most important issues in the whole inquiry. Recommendation 12 says: The Committee recommends that the Government fund a longitudinal study to examine the health effects of unemployment in Australia and the extent to which unemployment contributes to poor health and premature death. I will take a moment to describe the situation of my father who, living in the bush, lost his job in 1970 because the town was shrinking, wheat quotas were imposed and quotas were put on the cutting of ironbark in the Pilliga forest for railway sleepers. Dad lost his job. He went onto relief work, or tried to, but there was precious little relief work. It used to be funded by local councils-I am not sure if it still is. He ended up going back to timber cutting at 55 and it was literally killing him. So we moved to the city where, through his army experience, he was offered a job at John Lysaght at Chullora in Sydney. A couple of years later that enterprise started downsizing its work force and Dad lost his job again. To cut a long story short, he had a heart attack and he was dead at the age of 62. Over that period I certainly witnessed first-hand the devastating social impact and the impact on families when someone loses his job twice. Job security was so important to that generation. My father had been through the Second World War as a prisoner of war and he had been through the Depression. Certainly there was nothing more 19782 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 important, particularly to a male in those days-and that might seem a bit chauvinistic-than to hold onto his job. It certainly had a devastating impact on my father and led directly to his death from a heart attack. I fully support the recommendation here and I think we all, as Australians, need to be conscious of these impacts. The next important recommendation, particularly from my perspective in hearing the evidence, is that relating to early intervention. When someone loses his or her job as a mature age worker, there tends to be a fair bit of optimism on the part of that worker of getting another job fairly quickly. So the person does not seek help and generally no help, or inadequate help, is provided. It becomes clear only after months of being unemployedperhaps six months later-when the unemployed person thinks he or she does need help. Even then it may take some time for him or her to get around to getting that help. In the meantime he or she becomes embittered and demoralised. Finally when he or she decides to go and actively look for work and knock on some doors his or her resume for the past six months or year shows that he or she has been unemployed. The potential employer sees this and immediately says, ‘No, we do not want someone with a poor employment record like that.’ This country and governments of both persuasions have a responsibility to identify and pick up mature age unemployed workers early on-and that is the phrase ‘early intervention’. I warmly embrace recommendation 26, which says The Committee recommends that the Job Search Classification Instrument (JSCI) be applied to all retrenched employees, before assessing their eligibility for income support, preferably while they are still in employment. Where mature-age job seekers are assessed by the JSCI as being at high risk of long-term unemployment, and meet the assets and income tests; these clients should be immediately assigned to Intensive Assistance. I think that would do an enormous amount in terms of tackling head-on the problem of long term unemployment amongst mature age workers. There are a number of other recommendations that are also particularly important. The question of the incentive to return to work sometimes arises when people are on some sort of an income support. I was pleased that the committee, in a bipartisan way, was willing at least to embrace the idea of an earned income tax credit. Recommendation 16, combined with recommendation 15, reduces the taper rate or the withdrawal rate of unemployment benefits and means that an unemployed mature age worker can have a go at some part-time work without losing the majority of the government support that has been provided. Often the reentry into the workforce will be by that means-that is, by a part-time or casual job. Once they are back in the workforce, they get more confidence and more contacts because they are now in the network of employed people and businesses and they can then make the transition, hopefully, to full employment. One of the areas that we need to be very careful about is the area of payouts, and this was referred to by one of my colleagues, the member for Deakin. Very often an unemployed mature age worker, having lost his or her job, will receive some sort of payout. It might be in the form of redundancy pay, long-service leave, sick leave and annual leave. They then say, ‘I have got $20,000, $30,000 or $50,000. This is terrific; I will start up my own business.’ We witness many examples of people losing that money and then being in a terrible situation. They say, ‘I’ve got experience; I’ve got talents; I’ve got ability’, all of which are no doubt true, but succeeding in a small business is a lot easier said than done. We need to ensure that mature age unemployed workers who have that nest egg paid to them do not just squander it. We need to ensure that they go into these businesses with their eyes wide open and get adequate advice from government agencies and other authorities as to the risks of going into business and also some handy guidance on what it is that makes a successful business. They Wednesday, 30 August 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 19783 are some of the recommendations that I think are particularly important to note and to implement. Finally, in my own seat of Rankin, I have been trying for some time to get off the ground the idea of unemployed mature age workers assisting in volunteering for what is known as the Support a Reader Program. In a number of schools in Rankin, there are plenty of kids who could use the support of a volunteer, sitting down beside them and reading to them. This Support a Reader Program is a direct result of a previous, and the current, Labor government’s literacy and numeracy testing. Kids are identified through the diagnostic net as needing some remedial reading. There is a Reading Recovery Program where teachers are assigned to help those kids, but there is not enough money to go around. It would be marvellous if unemployed mature age workers could make a contribution to the community by coming along and reading to these kids. This would help to make sure that the same thing does not happen to these kids as happened to the mature age worker who has lost his or her job. Centrelink thinks it is a terrific idea and is happy to count those volunteering hours toward the work test for unemployment benefit. The problem is that, unfortunately, we hit a barrier in the Job Network. I can understand this. We want the Job Network providers, who have to make money, to identify potential candidates. We would run this out of our office if we could, but we cannot identify the potential candidates to match up with the schools. The schools in Woodridge and Kingston, in my electorate, are very keen on this and they too think it is a terrific idea. I hope that the government will support this sort of approach, and I will continue to pursue it. It is good for the self-esteem of the unemployed workers-it gets them back into the community-and, obviously, it is terrific for the kids as well. Finally, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the parliament. This whole exercise has been conducted in a very convivial and professional, bipartisan way. We had very few areas of dispute, and those areas tended to be not ideological but a matter of different perspectives. I think we have come up with a valuable report, and if these recommendations are implemented we should see some considerable improvement in the situation of the long-term unemployed in Australia. bring with them a degree of pain-financial, social and personal, emotional pain. Arguably, this pain is exacerbated for mature age unemployed people. Sudden retrenchment in midlife, for instance, can coincide with significant financial commitments and intense financial pressures: high mortgage commitments, secondary and tertiary education costs for older children, pressures to save for retirement, et cetera. The personal pain is often increased by a sense of betrayal at being retrenched after many years or even decades of loyal service. The anguish is intensified by difficulty in regaining meaningful employment and by fears of being on an unemployment scrap heap. For those whose identity and sense of purpose have been entwined in their careers, this loss in midlife can be devastating. The social consequences also can be severe, as social interaction is often closely linked to the workplace. Further, the embarrassment of being unemployed and the lack of financial resources both place a strain on social activity. Unemployment adds to family pressures and at times, sadly, to family breakdown. Many of the witnesses to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations inquiry on mature age unemployment spoke in frank and moving terms of the trauma they faced on finding themselves unemployed in their 40s or 50s. The committee certainly appreciated their very substantial and worthwhile contributions to the inquiry. I would particularly like to thank the group from the Blue",178,Representatives Main Committee
349,Mr Bartlett (Macquarie) (12.56 P.m.),"Retrenchment and unemployment always19784 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 30 August 2000 Mountains Community Resource Network-Judith Costin, Dennis Golding, Carl Hooper, Margaret Sutton and Alistair Wilson-who made a valuable contribution to the committee. The committee, in its report Age counts, made 38 recommendations arising from the many submissions and the exhaustive inquiry. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be pleased to hear that I will not recite all 38 of them. However, I would like to refer to a couple. They covered in general the critical areas aimed at reducing the trauma of retrenchment, assisting the unemployed in facing their financial burdens, reducing age discrimination and stereotyping in the workplace, and facilitating retraining and re-employment. The three or four recommendations I would like to refer to cover these main areas. The committee recommended that the government promote an education and awareness campaign amongst employers to counter the widespread age discrimination and to assist in developing an age diverse work force with ample opportunities for workers of all ages, but particularly mature age in this case, to use their vast skills and experience and to overcome the stereotyping that, sadly, is there. Many witnesses spoke of their battles with inaccurate and unfair stereotypes and the discrimination they found as they went from place to place to seek re-employment. Yet older workers have so much to offer, in terms of experience, maturity, work ethic and reliability. These are real assets in employees, yet somehow they seem to be overlooked or ignored. In short, there is a real need to make employers aware of the benefits that they could derive from employing mature age people. Secondly, a number of witnesses spoke of the insensitivity of their former employers in their handling of the notice of separation. Often it was callous and uncaring, with insufficient notice and with no assistance or guidance regarding support services. The committee recommends that a code of practice be developed to deal with the emotional, financial and practical impacts of job separation. Thirdly, regaining employment is a key challenge for many mature age people finding themselves unemployed. For many, the risk of long-term unemployment is real indeed. The committee recommends that, where possible, the Job Search Classification Instrument be applied to employees before they leave their employment and that those assessed as being at risk of long-term unemployment-provided they meet the means and activities tests-be immediately assigned to intensive assistance. This should occur before they actually leave employment, so they have a chance of quickly taking up that course of assistance and finding re-employment. The committee found that one of the significant barriers to re-employment is the low level of formalised training that many mature age unemployed people have. This was certainly not always the case, and some were highly qualified. But a number, particularly blue-collar workers retrenched from the manufacturing sector, lacked post-secondary qualifications. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.01 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: National Health and Medical Research Council: Research Funding (Question No. 1483) 2000: Will he update his answer to question No. 889 (Hansard, 30 September 1999, page 11177) regarding funding to the National Health and Medical Research Council in respect to Hepatitis C and HIV research.

Of the $1.3 million allocated for 2000, $837,000 has been provided through ANCAHRD. (b) A total of $4.1 million has been allocated to HIV/AIDS research in 2000 (compared with $5.194 million in 1999).

Goods and Services Tax: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Powers (Question No. 1562) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, upon notice, on 29 May 2000: What action can or will the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) take to address companies introducing charges for services which were previously not charged for in order to get around the ACCC’s GST price exploitation guidelines. The ACCC has been given strong powers to prevent price exploitation in relation to the New Tax System changes. These powers have been strengthened further by the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Act 2000 which prohibits suppliers from misleading consumers as to the impact of the tax changes on prices. The ACCC’s pricing guidelines indicate that businesses should not increase their net dollar profit margins as a result of the New Tax System changes. This general rule includes cases where a price is charged for a good or service not previously charged for, and the price cannot be justified on the basis of the tax changes or other relevant factors. Further, suppliers that introduce new charges for goods or services during the transition period should indicate clearly to consumers the bases for the new charges. Suppliers that mislead consumers by claiming falsely that new charges have been introduced as a result of the New Tax System may face substantial penalties of up to $10 million for corporations and $500 000 for individuals.

The cost for the provision of application assistance under the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (available only from 1 July 1999) to 31 May 2000 was $21,388. (4) Section 213 of the Migration Act 1958 requires that carriers be liable for the costs of detention, removal and deportation of an unlawful non-citizen if that person fails to comply with section 166 (immigration clearance) or, on complying with section 166, is detained under section 189 as an unlawful non-citizen. As members of crew, the majority of deserters enter Australia lawfully as Special Purpose Visa (SPV) holders and would not normally fail to comply with section 166. Accordingly, carriers are only liable for these penalties in respect of deserters who fail to comply with section 166 or are detained in immigration clearance (ie. before leaving the port). To the extent that there are suggestions that penalties for carriers that bring unlawful non-citizens to Australia may be less comprehensive at seaports than at airports, I advised in the House’s Main Committee on 22 June 2000 that I would look into the matter. The penalties for carriers that bring to Australia non-citizens, who are not authorised to enter or who are not properly documented, are the same for sea carriers as they are for air carriers. It should be noted that deserters, by definition, travel to and enter Australia as ship’s crew lawfully covered by the special purpose visa arrangements. Colston, Former Senator: Medical Reports (Question No. 1573) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 29 May 2000: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1154 (Hansard, 9 May 2000, page 15320), is he able to say whether the alleged travel expenditure by former Senator Colston is a matter in the public interest in that this matter involves the alleged expenditure of public monies. (2) Is he able to say whether, for the purposes of the Information Privacy Principles contained in section 14 of the Privacy Act, (a) the alleged travel rorts by former Senator Colston is a matter going to the protection of public revenue and (b) Principle 11 affords him a statutory right to disclose information in relation to the protection of the public revenue. (3) Is he able to say whether Principle 11 at sub-paragraph 1(e) provides him, as agent, the right to disclose the medical records of former Senator Colston; if not, why not. (4) Will he disclose the names and reports of the two eminent and independent specialists as described in his letter to me (reference CRL 99/9723 and Min 195211), in light of his statutory powers to disclose this information under the Information Privacy Principles. (1) The travel expenditure by any elected Member of Parliament involves the expenditure of public money and is a matter within the public interest. (2) (a) Details of travel expenditure by elected Members of Parliament may raise issues concerning the protection of public revenue for the purposes of the Privacy Act 1988. (b) Principle 11 (specifically, Information Privacy Principle 11.1(e)) allows a record keeper to disclose personal information where the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the protection of the public revenue. The starting point is that personal information should not be disclosed. Information Privacy Principle 11.1(e) does not compel disclosure of personal information. The issue in this case is whether disclosure is in fact reasonably necessary for the protection of the public revenue. (3) Information Privacy Principle 11.1(e) allows for disclosure of personal information where disclosure is reasonably necessary for the protection of the public revenue, or the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty. Disclosure of the former Senator’s medical records, which contain sensitive personal information, is not reasonably necessary for the protection of the public revenue, or for the other matters referred to above. (4) Information Privacy Principle 11 does not compel me to disclose the names and reports of the two eminent and independent medical specialists. I confirm my answer to question on notice number 1154. I consider that, as the medical reports contain very sensitive information, there is insufficient public interest to justify the release of the information. Goods and Services Tax: Aviation Charges (Question No. 1592) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 1 June 2000: In relation to the new aviation charges to be applied by Airservices Australia from 1 July 2000, what percentage of the increases in (a) Terminal Navigation, (b) Aviation Rescue and Fire Fighting and (c) Enroute charges are attributable to the goods and services tax. (a), (b) and (c) The average 2000/01 increase in prices by Airservices for Terminal Navigation, Aviation Rescue and Firefighting and Enroute services is 3.0% including GST. The GST impact on each service is as follows: Terminal Navigation + 9.49% Aviation Rescue& Firefighting Charges+ 9.24% Enroute Charges+ 9.66% Under the previous tax system, Airservices was exempt from wholesales sales tax. With the introduction of the GST, Airservices has been unable to gain any savings from the replacement of wholesales sales tax and their price rises reflect this. Airservices has however been able to offset these GST increases through the achievement of business efficiencies realising around 6.6% on average.

Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: In accordance with advice provided to me: (1 4) Under the Aged Care Act 1997 this is protected information. (5) Yes. Counselling and Guidance Services: Northern Territory (Question No. 1661) 2000: Further to his answer to question No. 1471 (Hansard, 19 June 2000, page 16437), does the Commonwealth provide any funding for the purpose or purposes of counselling and support services for indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory; if so, what sum is provided and how is that funding composed. The provision of counselling and support services is primarily a State/Territory Government responsibility. However, through the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH), the Department of Health and Aged Care provides funding for counselling and support services targetting Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory within community controlled health organisations and other similar services. $406 000 was provided in 1999-2000 for eight Bringing Them Home counsellor positions in the Northern Territory.

The total funding provided through OATSIH specifically for counselling and support services in the Northern Territory in 1999/2000 was $919 243. Through the National Mental Health Strategy, the Department of Health and Aged Care also provides funding for national services such as Lifeline and Kids Helpline– these services can be accessed by people in the Northern Territory.

Networking the Nation (NTN), the Commonwealth’s Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, has also gone online. The NTN Online system enables the grant application process, project management and project evaluation to be securely conducted online. Applicants are able to lodge supporting documentation and grantees are able to provide progress reports and claims for payment using the internet. The system also permits authorised external assessors to receive relevant applications and provide comments, and Board members to view and download applications prior to Board meetings, through the internet. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Aeronautical Charges (Question No. 1697) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 27 June 2000: In determining aeronautical charges at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, should the value of existing land at the airport be considered; if so, on what basis should that value be determined; if not, why not. Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd (SACL) is currently preparing a draft notification for consideration by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in relation to a new aeronautical pricing structure for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The pricing structure that SACL proposes to put in place has been designed to reflect to users the underlying costs of providing infrastructure and services at Sydney Airport, including the substantial opportunity cost of utilising prime land close to Sydney’s central business district. Until now these costs have been heavily subsidised by the Australian taxpayer resulting in a substantial benefit for airline customers. As shareholder the Government is committed to ensuring that it and ultimately the community achieves a full and fair return on the aeronautical assets, including land, it owns at Sydney Airport. Private Health Insurance Rebate Scheme: Expected Cost (Question No. 1701) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 27 June 2000: (1) What is the total expected cost to Government of the 30% private health insurance rebate in 2000-2001, based on the number of persons with private health insurance at the end of June 2000.

(3) For those with private insurance, what is the actual cost per capita to the Government of the private health insurance rebate in 2000-2001 referred to in part (1). (4) What percentage of those who had private health insurance at the end of June 2000 had (a) never previously had private health insurance, (b) private health insurance for less than 12 months, (c) private health insurance for less than 5 years and (d) private health insurance for five years or more. (5) What is the average annual cost per person of private health insurance premiums as at the end of June 2000. (6) What was the average per capita out-of-pocket gap for medical and hospital services for those with private health insurance as at the end of June 2000.

362,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) As PHIAC and Medicare data is not yet available for June 2000, the average per capita out-ofpocket gap for medical and hospital services for those with private hospital cover is not yet able to be calculated for that period. The in-hospital medical gap for the March 2000 quarter was $21.05 per service and $152.10 per episode. These figures have been calculated using PHIAC and Medicare data. Although these data sources allow the medical gap to be calculated, as they do not collect the fee charged for hospital services they do not allow calculation of the hospital gap. The only data collection source which records the fee charged for hospital services, and thus permits calculation of the hospital gap, is the Hospital Casemix Protocol (HCP). However, the latest period for which complete HCP data is available is the 1997-98 financial year.
