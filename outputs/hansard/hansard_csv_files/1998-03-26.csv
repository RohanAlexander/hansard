What this support relates to is, quite budget deficits were low, current account simply, one of the greatest financial crises in deficits were relatively low. In South Korea world history. Extraordinary devaluations they have been averaging around two per cent have occurred in these countries: in South of GDP in the last decade and in Indonesia Korea and Thailand it is about 50 per cent around 3 per cent.

In Indonesia, which had virtually Asian economic miracle. no inflation before the devaluation, just last There are a number of contributing factors month there was a 12 per cent increase in which seem to me to account for these extraprices, an annual rate of inflation already of ordinary developments. Firstly, there is the 31 per cent, and obviously it is going to go system of fixed exchange rates in all three of far, far higher. these countries-that is, fixed to the US Monetary policy is tightened to control dollar-which automatically caused these inflation or, more correctly, to prevent develcountries currencies to appreciate heavily as opment of hyperinflation.

All of the previous also by high interest rates. In 1995 they had factors that I have mentioned-,-the fixed $40 billion, in 1996 they had $100 billion and exchange rates, the large short-term capital in 1997, instead of an inflow of those sorts of inflows and outflows, the unstable financial dimensions, they had an outflow of $12 systems and the overinvestment---explain why billion. . these countries quickly fell into major problems once the ball started to roll. Why did it What these amounts mean for the five start rolling, particularly outside Thailand, South-East Asian countries in troublewhich was the only country with a balance of Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the payments problem?

If they are the IMF is prescribing more economic pain not done, the government is seen to be failing through tighter monetary policy which is to implement the IMP package, which further designed to control inflation-it is underdamages foreign investor confidence and so standable to do that-and is insisting that keeps the value of the currency down.

I suspect many of my colleagues have video cameras either at home or in their offices, but this one is different. This television video camera---closed circuit television camera-happened to be installed in a building at the Port Kembla grain terminal. It was installed to monitor activity on the grain berth and I actually saw it during a tour of Port Kembla last year. But this piece of technological equipment, I am informed by sources, has gone missing. I was informed last year in October that it had a technical problem and was taken back to Sydney. Information I have been provided with suggests that it is still in Sydney, probably in a packed box, a full 80 kilometres away from where it is supposed to be. It is in Sydney at a time when Port Kembla is a wide open import centre for drugs. The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs( Mr Truss) last week made an outrageous statement that I was playing party politics with the drug issue. I do not apologise for raising this issue or campaigning to ensure that the customs officers at Port Kembla are provided with essential resources to protect the community. I cannot understand or accept that a customs service with only five officers can adequately cover an entire area from Sutherland to the Victorian border. There were 16 officers two years ago. This government, perennial pennypinchers, are responsible for this. How can just five officers cover this massive area in a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift? NowI am advised that their current office at the coalface in Darcy Street, Port Kembla has just been sold off for $180,000 and they are all to be relocated in the Wollongong central business district. If it were not so serious, it would be funny: a port, which is wide open with only five officers, one hand tied behind their backs, operating on a ludicrous office hour shift, with no monitoring equipment, and now moved away from Port Kembla itself to the central business district of Wollongong. AndI am accused of playing party politics. If the minister wants me to provide bipartisan support, I am happy to do so, but only when the Port Kembla customs service is resourced properly to do their job of protecting the community. Port Kembla is in my electorate. It is the gateway to drug importation and I see kids able to get hard drugs for less than the cost of a packet of cigarettes. I will not stop raising this issue until this government takes the fight on drugs more seriously. If the minister wants me to shut up, it is possible. Put the Port Kembla customs service in a position, fully resourced, to close the huge gap which allows drugs into New South Wales and Australia. Always bear, in mind that Port Kembla is less than an hour's journey from Cabramatta, the drug distribution centre of Australia. It is esst(ntial that the service at Port Kembla be restored to what it was when Labor was in power.

367,Mr Anthony (Richmond) (9.44 A.m.),"The exciting communications reforms that thisThursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1761 Richmond and all over rural Australia. Thanks largely to the lobbying effort by many coalition backbenchers-from both the National Party and the Liberal Party-the government has given an iron clad commitment to ensure that regional Australia shares the benefits of the new digital TV broadcasting regime. On behalf of the people of the Tweed, Byron Bay and Ballina, I will personally make sure the government sticks to these commitments. High definition digital TV technology gives viewers movie quality pictures and CD quality sound as well as many other features. The coalition government has promised the bush will not be left behind and will get the same digital services as the big metropolitan areas. The government will make regional broadcasters in regional areas and on the North Coast-where Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl is from-meet a detailed information plan which includes a firm start date for digital services and a commitment to maintaining viewer coverage. I would like to congratulate the networks, particularly the commercials NBN and Prime, which give very good quality service to the North Coast of New South Wales. People on the North Coast will begin getting a service in less than three years, with the full gamut available by the end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004, years ahead of many other developed countries. Many other measures are also being put into place to ensure that regional broadcasters are given certain concessions so they can build this infrastructure. Clearly it will be a lot more expensive with transmitters and transponders than in the metropolitan areas. The government will also consider the issue of providing additional support to regional broadcasters once those broadcasters have developed their business plans and evaluated the costs of changing to digital. Under the government's plan, owners of broadcasting transmission facilities will have to give reasonable access to those facilities to digital broadcasters. The transition period is obviously important. TV programs will be broadcast on both digital and analog for at least eight years to give North Coast residents time to buy new sets. This is reasonable as eight years is longer than the average life of analog sets. It is very different, I might add, to the regime that was put in by the previous government on mobile telephones. Digital TV will provide viewers with far more choice. For example, you can get different camera shots of the same football match, even if it is the local team at Tweed Heads or Coffs Harbour, and selected displays of game and player statistic.s, as well as access to the Internet. National broadcasters-particularly the ABC and SBS, which do score very high ratings on the North Coast-are not being left out of the race. They too will broadcast the revolutionary new digital systems. This is a good policy. It is a good policy for regional areas. It goes hand in glove with the regional telecommunication fund which is looking at developing greater Internet services. I do hope that, with the full privatisation of Telstra, we see another large chunk of public money going to building better infrastructure, not just in the area of digital TV but particularly in the area of Internet-(Time expired) Bushfires Mr O'KEEFE (Burke) (9.47 a.m.)-In my electorate last weekend, we saw another example of the frailty which we all face when pressed up against the power of nature when it unleashes its forces. In this case, bushfires in the Trentham region claimed a number of houses of constituents of mine. In the circumstances and the conditions of the day, I think we are all very lucky that the damage and the potential danger to people was limited to the extent that it was, given that the conditions were almost identical to those of Ash Wednesday some years ago. 1762 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 It does say a lot for the people of the area that they have learned lessons from the Ash Wednesday experience. They have certainly done much more to protect their properties. We have much more sophisticated equipment and facilities in place. The whole range of the large force of emergency services workers-which include CFA volunteers, professional fire personnel, state emergency people and backup from our police officers, and health care workers and counsellors-clearly mobilises now in a way that we just did not have before. I think there is some heart to be taken from the fact that in these circumstances we now seem able to defend ourselves in a way which was not possible before. The one very sour note which has come across from this particular weekend's effort is that it does appear that the fires were deliberately lit and were not just isolated outbreaks. There were a number of fires lit in areas which meant that it was almost impossible for the emergency services personnel and the firefighters to really get a firm strategy together other than to tackle fires wherever they came up next. I would just like to express in the padiament my very sincere thoughts in respect of the people who have lost properties and homes, and to make an offer on behalf of all of us to assist them in any way we can. In particular, I would like to congratulate also the many people involved in the effort who came to their aid last Sunday and Monday morning. Soil Degradation attention that should be of concern to all of us: a situation that affects every man, woman and child in this country, irrespective of age. I refer to the mineral degradation of the soils from which our food is derived. A United States Senate report in 1936 said that 'the alarming fact is that the foods (fruits, vegetables and grains) now being raised on millions of acres of land that no longer contain enough of certain minerals are starving us, no matter how much of them we eat.' From preliminary investigations, it has become evident that our soils are equally as deficient in trace minerals as the soils in the United States are-if not more so-not only from the plants' point of view, but also from the human body's point of view. There is little, if any, consideration given to the mineral content of our foods. The only consideration to date has been to maximising the yields of any given crop. So, if the crop requires more trace minerals to grow well, it is given them; but, if we humans require trace minerals to be healthy but the plant does not heed them, our requirements are totally ignored. What is more, it is not commonly realised that vitamins control the body's use of minerals and that, in the absence of minerals, vitamins have no function to perform at all. Lacking vitamins, the system can make some use of minerals; but, lacking minerals, vitamins are completely useless. This is vital to the health of our nation. Without the proper mineral balance in our bodies, we cannot function properly and we start degenerating in a progressively downward spiralslowly at first, but then faster and faster until the degeneration gets to a point where we, as individuals, can no longer ignore the devastating symptoms that, more often than not, end up killing us. That is the way'it happens to most of us. And the sad part is that we think it is natural, just a part of getting old. It is not natural and it is not part of getting old. Back in 1936, the warning was loud and clear that, if we do not get all the minerals we need to stay healthy, we will get sick, suffer and have shorter lives. Dr Linus Pauling, twice a Nobel prize winner, stated that you can trace every sickness, every disease and every ailment to mineral deficiency. What we have been doing for the past 50 years or so is taking 60 minerals",124,Representatives Main Committee

If you ran your bank account like that, with $60 out and $3 in, what would happen? You would end up bankrupt. Although this is a very serious and complex situation, there are some simple, common sense answers. For example, some very positive research has been conducted over several years in North Queensland and elsewhere, where the adding of mineral rock dust containing up to 70 mineral elements to various soils not only increased the tonnage of the crops there but also reduced the acidity of the soil, while replenishing the depleted minerals at the same time. According to our preliminary research, this Queensland quarry has an estimated reserve of around 20 million tonnes, while another 23 reserves have already been identified. There is simple evidence to support what I am saying, for all of those who would like to check it out. Second Sydney Airport for Finance and Administration ( Mr Fahey) and the recent decision by the Parramatta City Council in regard to the Badgerys Creek proposal are indicative of the certain inexorable drift of opposition in western Sydney to the Badgerys Creek proposal. Recently, the western Sydney alliance of councils, representing 1Y2 million Australians, has produced a document that certainly slices apart, in a very definitive way, this proposal. I want to congratulate that coalition of representatives: regardless of their political affiliation, they have indicated that this proposal-which an attempt at selling was made, on the basis of jobs for the region in a period of high unemployment-is certainly engendering strong opposition from the general pUblic. The document by the councils certainly goes to the fundamental flaws in the environment impact statement previously exposed by SMEC itself, the government sponsored analyst of the proposal. The document attacks the failure of the environmental impact statement to look at the ancillary infrastructure problems. It raises the aspects of a questionable model for regional impact analysis. It talks about the minimal analysis to justify the fancied 63,000 jobs. It indicates that this concept, that noise at 10 kilometres will wake people only once a night, is really pie in the sky, but it puts forward the proposition-which seems to have a far greater basis-that the noise will wake people as much as six to 20 times a night. The western Sydney region is already characterised by significant pollution problems acknowledged by virtually everyone as being far worse than those in the rest of the city. This document also states: Broad assumptions are made regarding major infrastructure requirements such as funding for rail links, road construction, upgrades and maintenance, and timing and the installation of a fuel pipeline. Detailed costings are not provided, nor are definite alignments for rail and road corridors. Interactions with other airports in the Sydney Region are inadequately described in the Draft EIS given they are based dn preliminary flight path data.

Australia Post: Ballajura but I want t() talk about the infrastructure in Ballajura, which is a suburb in my electorate. Ballajura was first established about 15 years ago, and in recent times it has had a fast growing population. We. /!.ll want-to see population growth in areas, but only if infrastructure is available to it. Over the last few years the population has gone from 9,000 to 18,000, and a lot of those people are quite young people who have moved into the electorate with young families. Currently they do not have a post office, and their postal requirements are dealt with by an agency at the local newsagency. You can imagine a busy suburb of 18,000 people with their postal requirements going through a newsagency where they queue up next to all those magazines and disrupt the newsagency's customers. It is unacceptable. . There are other suburbs in my area that are looking for support. Greenwood, with 10,000 people, has its own post office. Warwick, where my office is situated, with a population of 4,000 people, also h-s its own post office. After a number of constituents approached my office, I contacted Australia Post, and we went to have a look aUhe situation at Ballajura. In fact, they have fixed a few things. In other words, now they do not do their tills at 4 o'clock, at peak time, and they have also organised a better queuing system. But it.is unacceptable to fix queues when in fact what is needed is a proper postal office out in that community. The community in the past has had its need for schools, and we have approached that. We are trying to fix the transport Peeds. Two years ago they had some water problems. The local community approached me, and on their behalf I approached the state government and it was able to fix their water problems. I am asking Australia Post to have another look at the needs of Ballajura-a fast developing suburb, a good suburb with some fine people living in it, and a suburb with a population that has gone from 9,000. to 18,000. They do need an Australia Post office out there rather than an agency in the news agency. The news agent is a wonderful small business operator, and he probably has a lot of licence fees from those Australia Post transactions. But, unfortunately, the demand is great out there for an Australia Post office and I ask Australia Post to consider locating an office in that suburb. . for members' statements has concluded. , Second Reading.

374,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (9.59 A.m.),"I would like to conclude my muchThursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1765 Committee, in relation to this issue of death benefits there is a proposal-which I believe is a big step forward from the current situation-to allow fund members to nominate those who are to receive the benefit in the event of their death while they are at work. However, there are some preconditions on this flexibility: there is a three-year expiry date on any nomination; the sole purpose test must be applied to the nomination-in other words, you cannot nominate a friend as a beneficiary; the nomination must be witnessed; and the nomination is to be disclosed in the member's annual members statement. The last two matters are unobjectionable and, indeed, I believe are very desirable-that is, the nomination be witnessed and that it be disclosed each year in the annual members statement. Both those things are fully sl,lpported. However, with respect to the three-year expiry date, I believe that that is a fairly patronising attempt in the legislation to limit people's choice about the way in which they nominate beneficiaries. Most people do not anticipate their early demise. If that is to occur during one's working life, it would often be very unexpected and often quite sudden. And people do not plan well for their early death-that is the obvious reality of daily life. We all hope to live into retirement and to fully collect on our superannuation benefits. Therefore, a three-year expiry period automatically means that many people will not have a valid nomination at the very point when they need it because, if it expires every three years, only a small percentage of people will remember to renew that nomination every three years. SoI would suggest that most will end up being expired at the point when they are actually required. The reality is that people are not required to update their will. A will remains valid notwithstanding the elapse of three years, five years, or any other period, for that matter. The nomination is to be disclosed each year on the annual members statement. I support that and I think that is an adequate safeguard. If people change their minds, which is presumably the intention of the three-year expiry period, then the fact that they are reminded of their nominees each year when they get their statement-and most people do look at the statement, given that it discloses the amount of money they have in the fund; it is a matter of some interest to people-means they will have the opportunity to check their nominations each year. The statement could, of course, draw their attention to the fact that they can easily change that nomination if they wish to. So while I accept that people's life circumstances do change, the reality is that for most other legal documents of much greater import than this we do not build in an automatic three-year expiry. I think that is a serious shortcoming of what is otherwise a reasonable advance in the law. The other issue which needs to be examined, but is more controversial, is the issue of the sole purpose test being applied. This seeks to limit the range of people that you can nominate. This is a very difficult question, because obviously if people had retired in the normal course of events, they would have received their cheque. They are then free to do two things. They are free to spend that money or give that money away in any way they see fit, absolutely without limitation. The other thing they are permitted to do is to leave that money in their estate through their normal will in any way they see fit. Again, there are not limitations on the way they dispose of that money, post retirement, either through their estate and their will and testament or through their spending patterns. The reality of this is that if we limit this test in this way, we are imposing an additional hardship on those who happen to die early, while still working, prior to the vesting date of their superannuation policy, and limiting their choice in a way we do not limit the choice of 1766 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 those who have retired. As I said the other day, it is my contention that death is the ultimate bona fide retirement. The reality is that if you have died, clearly that superannuation policy vests. While we would all want to see that fund go to the immediate family of the member, the reality is that it is the member who understands best what their needs and aspirations are and who needs to benefit from the superannuation proceeds of their estate. . ., .. Often people have complicated family relations, often not following the traditional pattern these days. Therefore, to specify it to a legally predetermined limited range of beneficiaries that we decide, as the parliament, are the right people to receive this money will in many cases be correct. But in some cases-and I am aware of some from my own constituency work-this will impose a significant hardship on those people who the member would otherwise want to have benefited from their estate and who, in normal circumstances, in the event of a normal retirement, can ensure that they benefit from the estate. It is only in the event of the early death that we impose this extra hardship on people. I believe this is a significant improvement in the existing law and I believe we should empower people in relation to their superannuation to allow them to make a binding nomination. In one case in my experience a member had made a nomination, but of course, under the old law, it was not binding. Because the nomination was in some degree controversial-it left 25 per cent of the proceeds to a friend of the member, 25 per cent to a close relative and 50 per cent to her mother-the reality was that the mother and the sister did not qualify as normal beneficiaries ·of this person. Therefore they had to contest this payment, because the superannuation fund wanted to exercise their discretion to pay all of the money to the friend who was claiming to be a beneficiary because they were in some way that they attempted to demonstrate-which was not particularly valid, but they attempted to demonstrate it-dependent on the member. So the mother and close relative, the sister, are going to miss out on this payment because the fund wanted to ignore the nomination form of the deceased member. This law would still perpetuate the trustee's right to ignore those people. I think that is quite wrong. In this particular circumstance, those people were entitled to the member's payment. I know one can always conjure up bizarre circumstances where that would not be right, but it is better to place trust and faith in the wisdom of the member concerned to best know their own family circumstances. Therefore, I would appeal to the government to review these two particular areas and .to comment on them further in the committee stage. We can re-visit this matter in another place if, on the balance of those inquiries and responses, that appears to be desirable. Bill 1997 will make various miscellaneous amendments to the superannuation legislation to maintain and strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the superannuation supervisory framework. Many of the points are contained in the second reading speech. I would like to reflect on a few of those points which have an effect on the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, the SI(S) Act, as it is kn9wn. These specific amendments include permitting a trustee of a fund to amend the governing rules of the fund to enable the acceptance of binding death benefit nominations from members. I would like to particularly focus on this proposed amendment. Unfortunately, there continues to be some discrimination in the way that we treat some nominees of people who hold superannuation accounts. I am referring specifically to the way that homosexual couples",128,Representatives Main Committee
375,Mr Hockey (North Sydney) (10.06 A.m.),"The Superannuation Legislation AmendmentThursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1767 are treated. At this stage, there has been no attempt by either side of politics to permit a binding nomination to be enforced so that a partner of an individual is the beneficiary either at the time of death or at the time of maturity of the superannuation policy. As a member of the Liberal Party and as someone who believes passionately in the principles of liberalism, I strongly believe that people should be judged not on their sexuality or on issues where the community may treat them unfairly. People should be treated as individuals and equal members of the community, provided they do not themselves give up that right to be a fully fledged member of the community by committing an unlawful act resulting in gaol. I cannot for the life of me understand why a binding nomination provided by a gay personeither a lesbian or a male homosexual-should preclude a partner, a friend or any other person that they may be in a relationship with, if that is their nomination. This cuts to the very core of the principles that I believe underpin modern liberalism, which I enunciated in my maiden speech. It is time for this parliament to take a strong stand and to provide the opportunity for an individual to nominate a partner or a friend notwithstanding their relationship. That person should be a binding beneficiary of the estate, the superannuation part of the estate or the policy itself. That is particularly applicable, given the announcement by the Prime Minister on International Women's Day, which I strongly applaud and which puts on the table, at the tiine of the marriage break-up, the accrued superannuation entitlements of one of the working partners in the relationship. It applies equally to men and women: I may be able to access my wife's superannuation and vice versa. That is only fair and just, and at the same time it is a fundamental part of liberal principles that people should not be discriminated againstbn the basis of their sex or, for that matter, their sexuality. It is something that we should take forward as a parliament. This bill deals with a new division in the SICS) Act which applies alternative in-house asset rules to certain defined benefit funds with large accumulated surpluses, subject to appropriate actuarial controls. Also, it extends from 5 June 1997 to 5 June 1998 the transitional period during which tax file numbers already quoted for superannuation purposes may be taken to have been quoted for surcharge purposes also. The bill provides greater power to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner so that the commissioner can revoke an approval of the trustee without ministerial clearance where the revocation is requested by the trustee. That is a particularly important power to protect the beneficiaries in this case. The bill also strengthens the arm of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in relation to monitoring and investigation powers, by expanding the number of parties to whom existing powers apply and-importantly, given the size of the funds and the large risks that are involved in the funds management-by increasing the penalties for non-compliance. This bill also amends the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act to enable the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to be constituted by one, two or three members, rather than the present mandatory three members. This improves the efficiency of the tribunal. The bill provides for an improvement in the transparency and the process of constituting tribunal panels. It will require the tribunal chairperson to make available to the public guidelines concerning the circumstances under which the tribunal may be constituted by fewer than three members. 1768 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 The final principal act amended by this bill is the Bankruptcy Act, which is amended to ensure consistent treatment of the superannuation benefits that are bankrupt, regardless of whether the bankrupt's benefits are in a regulated superannuation fund or an exempt public sector superannuation scheme. What this does is to create a level playing field. The playing field has for some time discriminated against members of private sector funds. But, importantly, this legislation is, in effect, again trying to repair some of the problems that have been passed on to us by the mismanaged introduction of superannuation. I personally regret the fact that we had to introduce the superannuation surcharge. It would not have been necessary but for the $lO.S billion Beazley black hole which we inherited and which we have set about repairing. We have set about repairing it for a distinct purpose: to shore up Australia for the next downturn in the world economy, to shore up Australia so that it can benefit from a sustained level of economic growth and low inflation, and to create better work practices that make us more internationally competitive. The superannuation surcharge basically ensures that the three per cent of people in the popUlation who happen to be earning more than $70,000 a year are on an even playing field with the rest of the community. But the fundamental problems with superannuation go to the fact that governments over the last few years have continually been moving the goal posts. That is a source of great frustration to many accountants, to many lawyers, but most significantly it is a source of great frustration to contributors. I will give credit where credit is due. When superannuation arrangements were first introduced in the 1980s by Bob Hawke, it was the right decision. People had to start to put away, in a very defined way, money for their future. If you like, it was a private contribution to their own retirement. Over the last 20 to 30 years we have seen a demographic change in Australia. People once had two very distinct parts to their lives. The first part involved their education, their teenage years and their growth phase, while the second part involved their working phase and a retirement period, which for some was a comparatively short period, quite tragically. However, these days the population is living longer and there are three long phases in people's lives and retirement is a key third part. Previously, retirement was regarded as a period of 10 or IS years from the age of 6S. If we all lived to 7S, that would be great. Well, of every three women born today, one is going to live to be 100. You are seeing a major demographic shift in the nation. Therefore, we need to provide for our future. As I said, I give credit to Bob Hawke for taking the major step of establishing superannuation. But the taxation arrangements in relation to superannuation have been fiddled over the years, and quite tragically so. People are noY' taxed on their contributions on the way in and they are taxed on their contributions on the way out. We should have followed the original UK model where tax is only applied at the point of collection and the funds accumulate pre-tax profits over the years. Regrettably, these days we have a very confused and unstable system involving the taxation of superannuation. At some point someone is going to have to take a tough decision with those people taking a lump sum payout when their superannuation matures, taking a 100 per cent payout of their funds. Quite frankly, for many people that will be the most significant amount of money they will ever have in their lives. Despite all the accumulated wisdom and despite the fact that it is their money, we need to be able to protect people from shonks out there who are prepared to say, 'I want your money. Come and invest in this nice little comer store in Upper Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1769 Cumbucker West and you'll be rich forever.' Some people will be tricked and will pour their life savings into that comer store in Upper Cuinbucker West, a place where there are only two dingoes and a Cobb& Co cart that passes by every three months. That is tragic. We have all seen examples of that. At the same time, there is no doubt there are inany people in the community who would be more prudent investors than certain fund managers, and that needs to be taken into account at well. However, I do have reservatiqns about the current entitlement to the bulk payout. I do have significant reservations about the current taxation treatment of superannuation. We have inherited a very confused and difficult system and, at some point of time, there needs to be a bipartisan commitment to redress the imbalances of the current system and to provide people with long-term certainty about the direction in which superannuation and the taxation arrangements relating to superannuation are taken. Finally, I strongly support the proposed amendment bill before this House.· I do reiterate my strong support for the entitlement of beneficiaries of superannuation accounts to be nominated and be binding in relation to all individuals and specifically in relation to gay couples. I also reiterate the fact that we do need to focus as a parliament on providing greater certainty in relation to superannuation entitlement and taxation and provide the community with that certainty, so that those young girls that are born today that will live to be 100 will not be relying on the generosity of the state in 2098. They will in fact be able to provide for their own retirement so that they can live with dignity and certainty and so that they can ensure that they pass on to their children-and I would expect their great-grandchildren even by that stage-a quality of life that is indeed better than that which was passed on to them._ Hockey) was making some quite thoughtful observations about the complexity of the taxation treatment of superannuation. But it ought to be said, certainly I have found as I go around the superannuation industry, that there is no one measure which has done more damage to superannuation and which has made the taxation treatment of superannuation more complex than this government's superannuation surcharge. It was said to be a measure which would impact on high-income earners, but it has in fact damaged all workers, lowand middle-income earners as well, because of its complexity and because of the load that it has thrust on superannuation funds in requiring them to obtain tax file numbers and things of that nature. It threatens all those lowand middle-income earners who do not declare their tax file numbers with the 15 per cent surcharge. No single measure could have been calculated to do more damage to superannuation than that measure has .done; To turn to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 itself, this is a bill which allows trustees to accept binding death benefit nominations. Trustees' responsibilities and duties come from trust law and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. They place a prudential and fiduciary responsibility on superannuation fund trustees to exercise care, skill and diligence in undertaking their duties on behalf of superannuation fund members. Trustees regard the discretionary allocation of death benefits as an important part of the prudential responsibilities. There is no question of that. It ought also to be noted that generally trustees are not paid to undertake their role and do not benefit financially from that discretion to allocate death benefits.",130,Representatives Main Committee
376,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.22 A.m.),"The member for North Sydney( Mr1770 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 In the area of death benefits, a superannuation fund trustee may accept a nomination by a fund member to pay any death benefits to any person or entity. However, under the present arrangements, the member's nomination is not binding on the superannuation trustee. Trustees have to ensure that any payment meets the sole purpose test, which is that a superannuation fund should be maintained solely for one or more core purposes or one or more ancillary purposes relating to the provision of benefits for use on or after retirement. The sole purpose test also allows for the provision of benefits on or after a fund member's death if the death occurred before the member's retirement and/or age 65 and the benefits are provided to the member's legal representative, to any or all of the member's dependents or both. A fund member's legal representative can also be a representative of a deceased estate. The government has before us a bill which contains technical amendments which permit superannuation fund trustees to amend the trust deed of their funds to allow them to accept binding death benefit nominations from members. There are a number of advantages in having a trustee discretion and there are also some advantages in not having a trustee discretion. This is a very interesting debate to which the members for Bonython( Mr Martyn Evans) and North Sydney have made contributions. In the area of advantages, if benefits are to go directly to an estate, you find that other creditors may have access to the funds before any dependents get access. State assets are subject to additional taxes from which superannuation eligible termination payments are exempt, so that can erode the value of the death benefit. In most cases, trustees are able to quickly deliver death benefit payments to appropriate dependents. This is unlike the delays which all too frequently occur where the assets are dealt with pursuant to a will and you get disputes and so on. Trustees can approve advance payments in specific cases to alleviate immediate financial hardship. In some cases, there may not be a will which determines who should receive assets and that can cause further delays in the payment of benefits to dependents and additional legal costs. As against that, there are advantages in not having trustee discretion. Established precedents which already exist in a state law attach rights of certain parties, either in law or by direction through wills. Probate courts have specific knowledge of these laws compared to trustees. Leaving everything to the estate creates an area for potential disputes. Discretion creates more administration delays and costs to trustees and the superannuation fund. Making it binding will improve the time and money spent on these cases, reducing the trustees' workload. We could anticipate perhaps reduced legal costs and fund administration time. We could eliminate the cross-subsidies of expenses and we could reduce disputes over trustees' decisions. We have also heard quite powerful arguments from the member for Bonython and the member for North Sydney in favour of the person who has the superannuation fund in their name being able to have their wishes given effect to and that their wishes ought to be paramount in these areas. An interesting article in the Sydney Morning Herald from Annette Sampson talked about the present situation where superannuation funds will ask you to nominate who you want the money to go to. In her words, 'This is an illusion.' If someone else can convince the trustees that they have a better claim to the money, the trustees are obliged to override your preferences. She expresses the view that it is outrageous that fund members cannot treat their super and/or any death benefits emerging from it in the same manner as assets held outside the superannuation system. She points out that, while dependents Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1771 can challenge a will, it has clear legal standing as a statement of your wishes and a strong case is needed to overturn it. With super, all you need is to prove dependency, which can result in some unfair distributions. She welcomes this legislation as a step forward on that basis. It is probably fair to say that there is the potential for some injustice to occur under either arrangement. If you .have a situation where someone has nominated that their death benefit ought to go to a particular person and trustees determine that it should go to somebody else, that may well be. a: situation of injustice and inappropriate outcomes. Equally, if someone nominates that their death benefit should go to a particular person and then circumstances change, it is probable that in some cases people would not change a death benefit nomination which was many years outstanding and did not reflect their own personal circumstances. You might find the trustees being forced to give effect to that binding nomination in circumstances where it would not be just to do so and the personal relationship which had given rise to that nomination had long since fallen by the wayside. It is probably fair to say that some injustices would occur under either arrangement and it is a question of coming up with the best possible arrangements. In terms of Labor's position, we would see the measure in this bill as being a step forward. We would like to see it referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for further examination to see whether there is indeed a case for taking the matter further. The bill goes on to apply in-house assets test rules to individual subfunds. The in-house assets test rule provides protection for super fund members' contributions by strictly limiting a company from borrowing from its own super ,fund. The reason is that, if an employer fails, employees' super benefits are protected. This measure closes a loophole whereby some individual super subfunds-separate super funds which are subsidiaries of a larger super trust fund-have been allowed to avoid the in-house assets test. Labor supports this measure. The next provision in the bill extends the transitional period from 5 June 1997 to 5 June 1998 for funds to use already quoted tax file numbers for surcharge purposes. This will assist super funds that, for other purposes, collected members' tax file numbers before 5 June 1997 to also use it for surcharge tax purposes, thereby improving the administrative efficiency of collecting the surcharge. Labor supports this measure, as it may help some low income and middle income earners to avoid paying the surcharge. As I said at the outset of my remarks, the surcharge has been an administrative disaster from start to finish. The only thing from this government which has fared worse is the Prime Ministerial guidelines on the ministerial code of conduct. It has been a disaster. Even as recently as Tuesday, in the Sydney Morning Herald there was reference to Murray Wyatt, a director of Morrows Pty Ltd, saying to an industry conference that the collection of additional tax by the federal government through the super surcharge is turning into a debacle and threatening people's confidence in superannuation. He said that it was becoming clear how complex, unnecessary and unwieldy the surcharge was, and that the surcharge 'has disrupted and undermined public confidence' in superannuation. This is entirely regrettable, and the government really ought to be condemned for the damage that it has done to superannuation through such things as the surcharge, its abandonment of the government co-contributions in super, and various other measures that it has taken. The next provision in the bill is to expand the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's monitoring and investigation powers, to widen the category of parties to whom they apply to 1772 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 include custodians, and to increase the penalties for non-compliance. This provision will increase the protection of members' contributions and is supported by us. It is also the intention of the legislation to allow the chairperson of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to convene either a one-, twoor three-member panel hearing, instead of the current requirement for compUlsory three-member panel hearings. This is set to improve the efficiency of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The changes to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal are intended to speed up the current backlog of complaints, many of which are non-controversial and may not need full three-member panel hearings. . While the bill does not specify what type of cases will be heard by how many panel members, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal chairperson is required to publicly release written guidelines setting out how the tribunal will· be constituted for different classes of complaints. Labor has been in contact with Mr Neil Wilkinson, the Chair of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, about the release of these guidelines, and we are satisfied that the appropriate transparency will take place. We need to understand that these measures occur against the backdrop of the recent Federal Court decision in the Bishop case, which has prevehted the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal from making determinations which are binding on superannuation trustees. This is not an uncommon problem facing tribunals where, under the separation of powers that we have constitutionally in this country-arid properly so-challenges are taken to the courts on the basis that any given tribunal is exercising judicial power which ought properly to be exercised by the courts and is therefore acting unconstitutionally. In the Bishop case, the Federal ·Court has held that this is-indeed the case for the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. That Bishop decision has effectively gutted the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal's powers. There is no doubt that that decision has done the tribunal some damage. That is a matter of concern to Labor, as, indeed, it ought to be a matter of concern to the wider community. Labor established the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal as a low cost, reliable, fast, dispute resolution mechanism and we think it has worked well. The alternative for lowand middle-income earners in the past was that you had to go off to the court to seek resolution of any problems that you had with superannuation trustees. We think the tribunal has functioned pretty well and has been a better alternative. I understand that the government has appealed the Bishop case to the High Court. That is a proper thing to do. But, generally, the government has been very slow.in reacting to what is likely to have a massive impact on this part of the superannuation system, an important component of the system-dispute resolution. We believe thpt the government has not taken this issue as seriously as its significance deserves. I again call on the government, as I did at the time of the Bishop decision, to urgently address this issue in the interests of consumers. We would certainly welcome any indications from the government about the actions that they are taking with the superannuation industry to try and ensure that the very good work of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal continues, notwithstanding the Bishop decision. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a second read,ing amendment which I wish to move and I think now is the right time to move it. I understand thacopies have been made available to the Main Committee. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1773 ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its concern about the Government's administration of Australia's superannuation system and, in particular, calls on the Government to: (1) admit that its policy announcement on divorce and superannuation was vacuous and designed to deceive the Australian public into thinking this Government has a policy on superannuation and divorce; (2) explain why it has tliken two years to announce it is having discussions with industry when a substantial amount of work was done by Labor, in government; (3) release what policy information it has developed on this issue to date, if any; (4) ensure that the principles of division of superannuation apply to the ending of all relationships, not just divorces, but also common law marriages which dissolve; and (5) ensure that any policy proposals brought forward are consistent with broader retirement incomes policy"". In moving that amendment, I think the government ought to be condemned for what was a vacuous policy announcement on superannuation and divorce made on International Women's Day.

387,Mr Hockey,"What did you do for 13 years?1774 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 remarks through the chair and not directly across the chamber to the member for North Sydney. 1995 and 1996. It is simply not good enough to get up here in 1998 and say, 'We are going to start doing something about superannuation and divorce'. There is a failure, on the part of the government, to recognise and build on work that both Labor and the parliament generally have done on the issues of superannuation and divorce. Let me point them out to the honourable member for North Sydney, who seems to be unaware of them. A Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act recommended in 1993 that superannuation be considered as property and that the Family Court be given discretionary power to split a benefit between spouses in proportion equal to the length of marriage or cohabitation, by reference to the total period of contribution to the fund. Labor established a working group to examine this issue. It had an extensive name-the working group to develop a scheme for splitting entitlement to superannuation under the Family Law Act. It consisted of representatives from the Attorney-General's Department, Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Office of the Status of Women, Treasury, Finance, the Australian Taxation Office, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, Social Security, Family Court, Law Council of Australia and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. It was a substantial working group, and for good reason. That working group was to report in 1996 and was formed to develop a scheme whereby superannuation would be dealt with as a separate and discrete asset. That was its first term of reference. The second term of teference was that the asset would be distributed between the parties, upon breakdown of marriage, equitably within the operation of law. The third term of reference was that the distribution of the asset would be determined by the period of cohabitation and the period of contribution to the fund. The fourth term of reference was that the proposal should be consistent with Labor's retirement incomes policy generally. In June of 1995, the attorneys-general outlined their planned approach to the scheme. This was that superannuation should not be treated as property but as an asset or as a financial resource for the future. It would retain its identity as a retirement benefit for both partiesmeaning that superannuation benefit would be split into two separate accounts, one for each divorced spouse, at the time of the divorce or the divorce hearing. The accounts would operate separately until vested in each individual. It is my understanding that a draft Family Law Amendment Bill (No.2) was at an advanced stage of development at the time of the last election. Why hasn't this government used this information, and this work, to come forward with a real policy rather than this vacuous announcement, saying, 'We are going to do something about this; we are going to go out to industry; we are going to consult'? So we have got this deceitful announcement which is designed to-Mr Hockey interjectinghappened for the last two years?

391,Mr Kelvin Thomson,"There has been a change of government. And what hasThursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1775 now you get up and say that you are going to do something. The Australian people are not going to be deceived by such a vacuous announcement. They are too smart for that. The treatment of superannuation assets in the event of a marriage breakdown can impact significantly on the financial security of divorced women, particularly those women who have not accumulated retirement savings due to other demands being placed on them which limit their participation in the paid work force. The issue of the splitting of superannuation after the ending of relationships has been handled by the Family Court on an ad hoc basis, often without the appropriate legal jurisdiction. The difficulties for the Family Court result from the question of whether superannuation falls within the definition of property under the Family Law Act 1975-that is, whether the Family Court has a jurisdiction to include it in orders-and, secondly, how and when superannuation assets are valued. At the point of divorce, for example, they may be worth considerably less than in the future. Superannuation is not generally considered as property unless it is vested in the individual member's name. The Family Court has no power to order superannuation fund trustees to release superannuation assets before they are vested in the individual, which usually occurs once preservation age is reached or upon resignation or retirement. To date, the Family Court has been forced to adopt one of two approaches to the splitting of superannuation, neither of which has resulted in a balanced outcome. We tend to have a situation which disadvantages either women or men. If hearings are adjourned or orders deferred until superannuation becomes payable, this potentially disadvantages women. This approach does not accord with the clean break principle, which the Family Court generally supports, and it could see the property settlement deferred for many years, during which time the personal circumstances of both parties could change. Alternatively, superannuation gets considered as a. financial resource rather than as property, potentially disadvantaging men in the sense that ex-wives are often compensated for the loss of the interest in their ex-husband's superannuation by increased amounts of other assets. This can disadvantage men who cannot access their superannuation and may not have sufficient other assets. They are forced to borrow, to go into debt to pay that compensation. In 1996, the coalition said that it would examine the treatment of superannuation following the dissolution of marriage. The policy stated also: Tennination of marriage through divorce ... poses a major threat to the economic security of women, particularly those who are unpaid workers. The regrettable thing is that in two years we have gone backwards from where we were in 1995 and 1996. Paragraph 8.19 of the Labor Party's national platform of 1988 states: Labor supports a fair and equitable retirement incomes sYl>tem which: ... in the event of the ending of a relationship, ensures equity and fairness in the division of benefits While we can give in principle support to the government's policy announcement, which is consistent with our national policy platform, the more we look at it the less there is to see. :rhis, in effect, has been a do nothing announcement from a do nothing government which ISsuperannuation.",138,Representatives Main Committee
392,Mr Hockey,"You should apologise for 13 years of incompetence in relation to1776 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 superannuation, that we built it up from something which was a privilege for the well-off few to something which became available to ordinary workers. We' set in place a decent retirement incomes system for this country, something which did not exist before the Hawke and Keating governments. Superannuation is one of our proudest achievements and we are happy to talk about it any time, any place. We are concerned that the government has failed to act on the working group's recommendations. It has taken two years for the government to announce a policy, which is to conduct yet another review. There is no question that this is a complex area and cannot be solved overnight. There is no question that, in terms of dealing with superannuation assets at the time of marriage dissolution, there are issues involving the taxation arrangements. I noticed that Daryl Dixon, in a quite substantial article in the Age recently, talked about some of the issues that occur. If we were to have legislation which, for example, permitted the splitting of superannuation pensions as well as lump sums between spouses, that would place divorced couples in a more favourable position than intact couples where one spouse receives all the superannuation pension and the other spouse has very little income. It would not be appropriate, in my view, for us to seek to develop policies that would encourage marriage dissolution for superannuation tax reasons. I think we would all agree that that would be an undesirable outcome. It is also the case, in my view, that superannuation ought to be treated as something for retirement, rather than something that people can or should have access to pre-retirement. So it is important in terms of developing appropriate policy that we keep sight of that and keep sight of the purpose of superannuation. There are a number of issues which Daryl Dixon identifies in that article. I think that all those who are interested in this area need to take account of those things. What we have from the government so far is a failure to release the report of the joint working group on family law reforms. We have in fact the history of inaction in this area by government, and it is something for which the government ought to be condemned. They ought to get on to some serious work in this area, taking advantage of the preliminary work which was done by Labor in years gone by. In the other areas of the bill, we support what is being proposed and we think that these things are worthwhile. We think that there is a role for the Senate committee in examining death benefit nominations to see whether that principle of people being able to make binding death benefit nominations ought to be taken further. We will take a great deal of interest in the work of the Senate committee in that area. moved by my colleague, the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson), and this bill today. I could not agree more with the parliamentary secretary, the member for Braddon( Mr Miles), and I do not always agree with the honourable member on a lot of issues. I agree with him when he said in moving that the bill be read a second time that superannuation plays a significant role in the government's commitment to increase national saving, and in its retirement income policy.

394,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (10.51 A.m.),"I am pleased to support both the amendmentThursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1777 superannuation, ordinary workers and those who were not at the top of their field did not have access to' this. However, the Labor government put in place measures that ensured that a minimum employer contribution for wage and salary earners in Australia is contributed for everyone. Thanks to these initiatives introduced by the former Labor government, more than 93 per cent of full-time employees, 67 per cent of part-time employees, and 59 per cent of casual employees, are now covered by superannuation. It is the responsibility of government to ensure that people are encouraged to contribute to the superannuation scheme because it is a win/win situation. Individuals win because when they retire they are assured of an income. The nation wins because national savings increase, thereby delivering great benefits to the economy. Furthermore, if superannuation is to playa role in the government's retirement incomes policy, then all people who contribute should have equal access'to their super upon retirement. That is an issue that I wish to go to today. I am pleased to see that in the debate earlier today, the member for North Sydney( Mr Hockey) called upon the government for action to ensure that all people have equal access to their superannuation be.cause at the moment that is not the case. There is discrimination ba-ed upon people's sexual preference. There are a significant group of wage and salary earners in Australia who have little incentive to contribute to a superannuation scheme because their spouses do not have access to superannuation benefits upon their death. As the legislation currently stands, gay and lesbian couples are discriminated against. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 aims to improve the monitoring and investigative powers of the Insurance and Superannuation'Commissioner. This improvement in accountability must be appJauded and must be supported. The bill also aims to improve the efficiency and productivity of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, once again a positive initiative. But what power does the tribunal or the commissioner have to address the legitimate equity concerns Of same sex couples? The answer is 'none at the moment' because this legislation is currently flawed. I have here some 450 letters addressed to federal members of parliament which I will be delivering today. These are from people who live in New South Wales in 42 different federal electorates and they are asking for the legislation to be amended. The letters draw attention to: aspects of current Cominonwealth superannuation law which are highly discriminatory, particularly in regards to the payment of superannuation death benefits to surviving partners of lesbian and gay relationships. The letters go on to state: In effect, the current legislation prevents equitable payment of a person's own money, should they pass away, to their chosen partner on the basis of their partner's sex. The Labor Council of New South Wales is currently conducting a campaign which is being coordinated by members of the Inter-Union Group against Discrimination in Superannuation. They distributed pamphlets around the time of the Mardi Gras in Sydney, and they are also distributing pamphlets and information throughout workplaces to raise awareness of these issues. I applaud the Labor Council of New South Wales for taking this stance because quite often issues like this' are hard to take on. I remember that. the first time. I raised this issue in the i>a-liament I was heckled by another member on the basis of making an inference about 1778 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 people's sexual preference. In the community there is still a great deal of discrimination and a great deal of angst concerning gays and lesbians. However, the Labor Council have shown that they are prepared to provide leadership on this issue, and I am pleased to hear that members on both sides of the House have indicated that they are prepared to show leadership on this issue also. I would like you to consider this scenario which comes from the Labor Council campaign. This document says: Susan and Juan have been in a de facto relationship for less than six months. Richard and Vincent are lovers who have lived together for twelve years. Juan and Richard are co-workers. On their way to a work-related event they are killed in a car accident. Juan and Richard have both been in their industry superannuation fund for ten years and accumulated $100,000. Juan died without a will, having never completed a nominated beneficiary form. Susan is identified as his spouse by the trustees of the fund. Susan received a $100,000 benefit tax-free. And she should. However, Richard has gone a step further. He has done everything humanly possible to ensure that his partner receives the same treatment, receives benefits as a result of his death. The document continues: Richard has maintained a will which names Vincent as the sole beneficiary, as does his superannuation form. Although this assists the trustees in making the payment to Vincent, he is considered a ""nondependant"" and is required to pay $15,000 tax on the $100,000 benefit. So Richard only receives $85,000 whereas if it was a heterosexual relationship the full $100,000 would be paid. The document goes on: If Vincent had died without a will, Richard would quite possibly have received even less. Certainly, if he had not nominated his partner as a beneficiary on his superannuation form, that would have made it even more difficult. The document continues: He might have received none at all and could quite possibly have been forced into prolonged legal action over the decisions regarding Vincent's estate. To me it really is an absurd situation to suggest, and I have had it suggested to me, that people might pretend that they were in a gay or lesbian relationship in order to receive benefits. Underlying it is an assumption that heterosexual couples would not do it and that somehow gay and lesbian couples are prepared to be more deceptive than heterosexual couples; whereas I think the chances of people lying about a relationship are far greater in a relationship which is totally accepted by everyone in society, as heterosexual relationships are. I do not think that a change in the legislation would lead to any abuse by people. This bill is a lost opportunity to redress the wrong in this legislation. Part of the bill seeks to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act of 1993. Item8 of schedule 2 of this bill will insert a new subsection 59(l)(a) relating to death benefits. The amendment would allow the trustee to provide any benefits in respect of the member on or after the member's death to a person or persons mentioned in the notice being the legal personal representative or a dependant or dependants of the member. There are two issues here: firstly, the amendment does not require the trustee to abide by the member's death benefit nomination. There is no mandatory requirement for a superannuation fund to change its rules to allow for such a nomination. Secondly, same sex Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1779 couples continue to be excluded because of a very narrow definition of spouse. Spouse is defined in the same way as in the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936 to include: Another person who, although not legally married to the person, lives with the person on a bona fide domestic basis as the husband or wife. The point for same sex couples is that they do not live as husband and wife and so cannot fall within this definition. To allow death benefits to be distributed to a member of a same sex couple, the definition of spouse would need to be changed. With this amendment there are only two possible ways a partner in a same sex relationship can therefore access their partner's superannuation but; ultimately, this remains at the discretion of the trustee of the fund. The first possible way is if the partner can prove financial dependence. It is not necessary to prove financial dependence if you are in a heterosexual relationship; the access to your partner's superannuation is accepted, regardless of your own financial position. Therefore, what this bill is really doing, even though it is a step forward, is suggesting that people in same sex relationships are discriminated against if both partners are working and contributing to the nation's economy by earning their own living. What irony we have here when this superannuation bill will benefit someone if that person is a dependant of their partner. I think the right to work, to seek employment and to earn your own living should have nothing to do with sexual preference. I think that is the problem that is identified in the changes in this bill. The other way that death benefits can be accessed is if the partner is named the sole beneficiary in the member's will. The estate can then be named as a death benefit nominee. However, apart from limited access to what should be a right, this also presents a number of problems. Instead of easily accessing the payment, the surviving partner may have to wait for probate, and the payment is likely to be taxed, therefore, at a rate of up to 21.5 per cent instead of being mostly tax free. Furthermore, the beneficiary will have to stand in line behind any creditors to the estate. I am certain that the member for Braddon and his friends in the Lyons Forum would be horrified that the legislation makes it possible-albeit by the back door-for gay and lesbian couples to have limited access to superannuation death benefits. This amendment to section 59 of the SI(S) Act goes some way towards allowing same sex couples better access to death benefits. It does not address the fundamental issue of discrimination. Certainly it is possible to access death benefits but only by convoluted means and that is not an equitable solution. Access requires a good working knowledge of the legislation. That therefore excludes people who do not have the education or the economic means to access this information. On top of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference, you effectively have discrimination on the basis of economic or class position in society. In order to address this issue of discrimination, the definition of spouse needs to be altered to include same sex partners. This is not only a view that exists on this side of the House. I have said in the House previously that, unless the government rectifies this legislation, which is possible I hope through the committee we are proposing the legislation be referred to, I have prepared a private member's bill to do just that. I am pleased that the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who is here in the chamber today, last week in parliament said: ... I have considerable sympathy for what I understand will be a private member's motion to be brought on by the member for Grayndler ( Mr Albanese) in relation to superannuation entitlements for same sex couples. 1780 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 Today we have seen the member for North Sydney come out in support of superannuation for same sex couples and that is a very positive development. I am sure the member for Chifley( Mr Price) would be prepared to come outin support of this legislation as well. I hope that this will not be necessary because I fully support the call of the member for Wills for the bill to be referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation so that this issue of death benefits can be more closely examined. I have hopes that this committee will concur with the findings of the Senate legal and constitutional committee's inquiry into sexual discrimination. The report was tabled in December 1997. Recommendation 7 states that all Commonwealth superannuation legislation and related legislation directly or indirectly affecting payment to people on the grounds of their sexuality or their gender status be reviewed and amended. That recommendation draws support across the party boundaries and is deserving of action. With this bill we have an opportunity to ,take action. The report further recommended that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation be asked to consider and report further on any barriers to superannuation contributors being able to nominate a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries of lump sums, pensions or other payments. That goes to the heart of the question. Why is it that someone who contributes to their superannuation fund simply cannot nominate their partner and that partner, regardless of their gender, have full and equitable access to their superannuation benefits? In conclusion, I support the bulk of this bill. It is a positive step forward, but it can only be improved if it is referred to the Senate committee to ensure that the discrimination that I have identified is rectified. Australian society has moved a long way and, no matter what perspective you come from in this parliament, there is something to be said for rectifying this situation. If you are an economic rationalist, then surely you believe in the level playing field and therefore oppose discrimination on economic grounds. Even some people whom I would not agree with on many issues can support the thrust of what I am saying. Secondly, if you are a liberal of the small 'I' variety, you have to support this proposition that I am putting forward today that people should not be discriminated against in any area of their lives. In terms of superannuation, people will live much more comfortably knowing that if something were to happen to them-say, an accident on the way to work, as ih the Labor Council example-their partner will not have to engage in legal action on top of the trauma that he or she will already be suffering. This bill ensures that people in a same sex relationship will be treated in exactly the same ,way as people in a heterosexual relationship. I call upon the House to support the bill and the second reading amendment, and to take action on this issue. If the House does not support it, I will be introducing a private member's bill on this issue in the next session. Hopefully, I will be able to rectify it that way, with the support of all fair-minded members of the House of Representatives. Mr Hockey interjectingdraws to my attention that, in the debate on superannuation, I am allowed-and I am honoured-to follow the member for Grayndler ( Mr Albanese), who has'raised an important issue about superannuation for same sex couples. I previously said in the House but I think it is worth reiterating that'one of the regrets of my life is that, in chairing the committee that looked into child support, I did not address the issue of same sex couples in the report, although fully cognisant of the problem.",140,Representatives Main Committee
395,Mr Price (Chifley) (11.11 A.m.},"The honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hockey)Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1781 I took the view that the recommendations we were making were sufficiently widespread that that would be a complicating factor. My optimism about either my own government or subsequent governments implementing the recommendations was widely off the mark and, hence, I have always regretted that we did not tackle that issue. I certainly think it is entirely appropriate that we should have superannuation rights for couples, whether they are heterosexual or same sex couples. I hope that the Senate committee will conscientiously look at that recommendation that has been referred to it. If we look back at the 13 years that Labor was in government, perhaps one of the best things we did-the thing that has perhaps stood the test of time most-was with superannuation. It often amuses me that we see history repeating itself. The Chifley government's National Welfare Fund was gutted by the Menzies government and then finally abandoned. We were the government that delivered the last stroke because the National Welfare Fund was a mere shell with no money in it. It is important to remind people that under that scheme-if you go to senior citizens they will certainly remind you-people paid a separate amount of income tax and a separate amount into the National Welfare Fund. To that extent, it was a fully funded fund. More is the pity that, in terms of national savings, it was not allowed to survive, because everyone who was in the work force was participating in it. The government of which John Howard was Treasurer left us in a pretty sorry state where basically public servants and executives in private enterprise were covered by superannuation but not very many other people in society. In other words, people were basically dependent on their own private savings and a pension in terms of their own superannuation. Of course, it is a pity that, if you like, the coalition-having championed the idea-of the importance of national savings, both public and private-should, in the very short two years that they have been in office, have started emasculating the coverage that was inherent in the Labor Party's proposals. Of course, the real losers in all that are the ordinary men and women of Australia. I wanted to comment on the announcement by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) of his intention to have a policy about superannuation as property in marriage dissolutions. I have never seen an announcement about a mere intention to have a policy receive such wide publicity. Perhaps the member for North Sydney could enlighten me. This is a new approach by the coalition that you do not merely make policy announcements but you make announcements of an intention to have a policy. about your intention to have a policy on airports? you have the intention to announce a policy in terms of superannuationannounced thatMr Hockey interjecting-",144,Representatives Main Committee

Whilst interjections of a reasonable nature may be accepted by the chair, the constant badgering of the honourable member for Chifley will not be tolerated. Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to make the point that, in this superannuation legislation, those workers who do not provide their tax file number are being caught up in the superannuation surcharge. I want to make the point that, if they retire or if they are retrenched, that money is caught up into it. Of course, you have the cosy and typically Liberal scheme of hitting the old PA YE taxpayer but, if you have got an accountant and a solicitor, you can get a family trust going and you can evade and avoid your fair share of tax, in this legislation. Mr Hockey interjectingSpeaker-is very proud of that situation, shame on him. I repeat: shame on him! Let me make the point about tax reform. Isn't it a pity that, when it was announced, there was no intention by either the Prime Minister( Mr Howard), who announced it, or the Treasurer to invite a bipartisan approach to tax reform? From a Labor perspective, we will always be concerned to ensure that the system is equitable, that it is fair and that all people pay their fair share. That will always underscore a Labor Party approach. But of course the Prime Minister and Treasurer just want to play a partisan game. Of course, the opposition is not on board on tax reform in the manner that they have announced-that is, through imposing a GST and failing to pick upcontain his remarks to those relevant to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Billl997 that is before us, regarding superannuation and divorce. wind up with the point that I think an opportunity has been missed. Mrs Bailey-You're the one who missed it. in the national interest and to develop a bipartisan approach to it. I want to return to this aspect of announcing the intention of a policy on superannuation. People have said to me, 'What do you think about it?' In a sense, my first response has always been to say, 'I think it is a bit unfair,' and then I have said, 'No, actually there is nothing unfair in the limited amount I have known about it' -that is, that superannuation should be considered as part of the property settlement-'but the problem is that you are not fixing all the other problems at the same time.' It is as though in family law matters superannuation is the most important issue.",145,Representatives Main Committee

You cannot go to the Family Court without your superannuation being taken into consideration. Does the government think this is a brave new policy to win over the women's vote and to give the perception that this is the government's biggest concern in family law matters? If so, it is already happening. All you will be doing is codifying it in some way but without having a decent debate about how property should be split up. I think we should have a debate about it, because it is certainly not a 50:50 split. It is certainly not proportioned between the parents with some left for the children-and I think that is worthwhile investigating. Let me make this point: the courts will always award more than 50 per cent of superannuation to that parent in residence with the child. I do not have a difficulty with that; that sounds logical to me. But what happens in three years time when residency is reversed? Is that property settlement looked at? Of course it is not. Is that fair? I do not think so. Can we do something about it? I am not sure, but it is worthwhile having a debate on it. It is typical of this sleight of hand government. I would say to you that there are many more important issues in the family law area that affect women than just superannuation. Firstly, you are carrying on the grand tradition of governments of throwing all the federal money at dead marriages and relationships. I think this is crazy-absolutely crazy. I do not know how members of parliament can sit contentedly and suggest that superannuation is the most important issue in family law, when people cannot afford the family law processes. We have absolutely no idea of what individuals are spending on family law. I can tell you what the federal government is spending: more than $100 million on the Family Court, more than $100 million on legal aid, and nickels and dimes out of the Attorney General's Department in supporting families through the family program before the relationship or marriage is dead. The Family Court, for example, is very proud to say, 'Only five per cent of cases get to the court,' as though this is some fabulous success measure. There is a very good reason why more cases do not get there: absolute financial exhaustion. People are exhausted; not only do they spend all their own money, not only do they borrow on their bankcard to the limit and borrow from their parents for as much as they can possibly afford, but they never have enough money. There is this basic lack of equity and access to family law. We are talking about what the rational economic approach should be, what the small '1' liberal approach should be. Let me tell you what a working-class, western suburbs approach is. It is to say to the parliament, to the courts, 'Don't give us rights, don't tell us we have legal rights as citizens, if we cannot possibly afford to exercise them, if there are no avenues to exercise them.' I know that applies in other areas of the law. At the end of the day, when we talk about family law, sure, we are talking about parents who, for whatever reason, can no longer live together as a family, but the Family Court sees or deals with cases involving 150,000 children. So, if people cannot spare any compassion or thought for the parents, think about the children. There is urgent need of rapport. Just as the Bishop case, which has an impact on this legislation as far as the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is concerned, is saying that the tribunal cannot exercise judicial power, there is a huge gap in the Commonwealth's constitution-that is, our ability to set up proper tribunals, like the states do in residency and tenancy matters, a guardianship board, small claims tribunal, the list goes on. With the greatest respect to the High Court, they have 1784 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 interpreted the constitution in a way that leaves people with the perception that some of their rulings are more reflective of their desire to preserve the prerogatives of the judges than of dispensing justice to ordinary citizens. As in any area of activity, whether it is this parliament or organisations out in voter land, we all need to go through processes of change, of refining what our core missions are. Any system that seeks to preserve something that only the elite in society can afford is ultimately bringing itself into disrepute, if not threatening its own very existence. I think both the legal profession and the judges have been very selfish in these matters, and it is up to the parliament to try to work around these particular cases. AlthoughI am scoffed at by my colleagues opposite and, I must say, one alongside, I think there is a real opportunity to do something good for ordinary people by working together. The honourable member for Bonython( Mr Martyn Evans) deserves the credit for raising this issue about employees who have superannuation and their ability to nominate the person they desire to get their superannuation in what he describes as the ultimate form of retirement-death whilst at work. That is, we have a situation where, if a person makes a valid nomination-which can only last for three years; there is a time clock on it-for a partner or a person to be the beneficiary, the trustees have the power to override that nomination. I find the power of the trustees in this matter quite extraordinary. There is also the issue with some superannuation schemes that there are not regular meetings of trustees. So the matter gets held up for their first meeting and if they decide that they want to closer investigate the nomination, or, indeed, overturn the nomination, it may not be done at that meeting. And it can take some two or three years after the death of the person with superannuation for the final decision to be made. I certainly welcome the legislation. I sincerely hope that it will find its way to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that has done so much good work. But I also support the amendment that has been moved by the opposition in this area. In particular, with the announcement of the intention to develop a policy on superannuation in family law matters, the government is really disappointing a lot of people. There is need for reform in the family law and child support area, but this superannuation matter has already been dealt with by the court. There are many other matters that the government should focus its attention to. I rather regret that it was a sham announcement. Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is schedule No.3, which proposes to strengthen the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the SCT. The honourable member for Chifley( Mr Price) touched on it in his remarks and, I guess, earlier speakers did also. It is interesting because this bill was drafted and introduced into the parliament long before last month's Federal Court ruling that the SCT was unconstitutional and that it can only review procedures and not decisions, thus throwing the superannuation industry into turmoil. While the intent behind the third schedule, to improve the productivity and efficiency of the tribunal, to enhance its role in promoting public confidence in the superannuation regime, is an honourable one and one that is entirely supportable, it seems somewhat redundant under the circumstances. Of course, the government does not bear any responsibility for the decision of the Federal Court in this matter and nor should it. However, in the event that an appeal to the High Court is unsuccessful, it is vital that the government be prepared to legislate so that",146,Representatives Main Committee
411,Mr Rocher (Curtin) (11.30 A.m.),"Perhaps the most interesting schedule in theThursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN· COMMITTEE 1785 the tribunal is endowed with the power needed to resolve disputes about the distribution of benefits. Since its inception in 1994, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal has formed a critical part of the fabric of the superannuation industry. Its present impotence does not preclude any of Australia's seven million superannuation fund members from pursuing action in the court system, if they believe they have been unreasonably and unfairly dealt with by their trustee. However, litigation can involve a substantial cost to the agreed fund member whereas disputes to the SCT could be made in writing and without requirement fodegal representation. The Federal Court's determination that the cost-effective independent Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is unconstitutional in part of its deliberations and operations represents a significant lost opportunity for superannuants. As one independent analyst has noted, the SCT was 'vital to protect fund members against wrong decisions by trustees'. Mr Noel Davis, a lawyer with Clayton Utz, echoed that sentiment by saying, 'In some instances, trustees make decisions adverse to members that they should not make' and that the SCT was necessary for maintaining consumer protection. Assuming that the final outcome of this situation' is that the SCT continues to be able to review decisions as well as procedures, the government's plan to correct the anomalies in subsections 14 and 15, which currently prevent certain complaints from being heard by the tribunal, is a sensjble one. Of course"" it needs to be remembered that the court decision only affects those cases where the SCT has determined to amend a trustee's original decision which, in tum, affected the distribution of payments. I understand that there have only been around 50 such cases industry wide in the four years that the tribunal has been operational. However, the total number of complaints that have been heard by the SCT is much greater, at around 4,300 cases. Experts fear that many of those who may have pursued legitimate action through the tribunal will not opt to do that in the court system simply because of the cost involved. Dr .Michaela Anderson, policy director of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, was reported in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 13 February 1998 to have said: It leaves us without a proper avenue of dispute resolution. We've always wanted something that's fair, quick and cheap. But alilhat's left now is for people to go to the courts, and most members of super funds can't afford to do that. The most common cases to have gone before the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal over the past four years have been those relating to the payment of death benefits and termination of employment payments. However, the recent announcement by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) that the coalition will legislate to have superannuation benefits taken into account in the distribution of assets during a divorce proceeding will almost certainly see an increase in the number of complaints to be brought before the SCT. As Ms Jill Ferguson, journalist with the Age, postulated in her article of 14 February 1998, the decision to increase fund choice to all new employees as set out in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) 1997currently before the House and on the Notice Paper-'merely underscores the. need for a tribunal that is judicial in nature to deal with members' concerns'. The proposed amendments to, subsection 9(1), to allow the tribunal to be constituted by either one, two or three members, selected by the tribunal chairperson, is a sensible one and will allow the SCT to deal with cases in a more timely manner. Given the predominance of disputes 1786 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 before the tribunal that relate to the payment of death benefits, any move to expedite the hearing process is most welcome. If the Federal Court's decision is upheld, industry experts predict that many trustees will become increasingly sensitive when directing the allocation of benefits in controversial cases. It is an untenable situation that trustees who have implemented past decisions at the direction of the tribunal may now be challenged in a court of law over their actions. Worse still is the prospect that a fund trustee may be able to be sued retrospectively by someone disadvantaged through a tribunal determination. In the interests of maintaining certainty and stability in the superannuation industry, there must be an immediate clarification of the position of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. If the Federal Court's decision is confirmed by the High Court, then, as a matter of urgency, legislation should be prepared and introduced in this place immediately to clarify the liability of a trustee in the event of a challenge to the earlier decision or decisions of that trustee. The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister( Mr Miles) explained in his second reading speech that the coalition has taken steps to make superannuation a more attractive long-term savings vehicle for Australians. However, all the signs indicate that initiatives like the savings rebate have, at least so far, had a negligible impact on national savings. The 13 November 1997 edition of Savings Pulse, an organ of the Perpetual Funds Management organisation, noted that over the past two years the percentage of Australians who did not save at all rose from 17 per cent in 1995 to 28 per cent in 1997. The author of that article suggested that the government 'needs to develop a more useful mechanism to affect the Australian attitude to long-term savings.' If government is going to reduce the growing trend towards household indebtedness, as was documented in a recent study by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, the government will have to act promptly in this instance. Superannuation is still regarded with great suspicion in this country, and the gutting of the SCT by this latest setback will do nothing to reverse that. SoI commend the amendments outlined in schedule 3 of this bill to the committee and anticipate a timely and responsible determination of the status of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. a.m.)-I would like to thank the honourable members for Bonython( MrMartyn Evans), Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson), Grayndler ( Mr Albanese), Chifley( Mr Price) and Curtin( Mr Rocher). They raised a number of issues in relation to the bill that I will address in tum. Firstly, in relation to the quotation of tax file numbers, the amendments contained in the bill extend from 5 June 1997 to 5 June 1998, the transitional period during which tax file numbers already quoted by employees to employers for superannuation purposes may be taken to have also been quoted for surcharge purposes. This transitional arrangement ensures that employees do not have to quote their tax file number twice. Importantly, to take advantage of this arrangement, the employer must notify the employee of the intention to use the employee's tax file number and provide an opportunity to the employee to object. Secondly, the honourable members pointed out that the amendments to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, the S(RC) Act, contained in the bill, do not address the effect on the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal of the recent Federal Court decisions of Bishop and Leshem. The Federal Court found that the tribunal review powers are invalid because they involve the exercise of judicial power. The government is fully committed to",148,Representatives Main Committee
412,Mr Miles (Braddon,"Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (11.40Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1787 ensuring that superannuation fund members continue to have access to an efficient and effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism. The government is still examining options in this area. The government has also made an application seeking special leave to appeal the Federal Court decisions to the High Court. In addition, the government is carefully examining other options to ensure that superannuation fund members continue to have access to an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. These options include replacing the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal with an industry based scheme, or restoring the tribunal's powers through legislative amendment. If this proves to be possible through the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, the relevant merits of these options, including all the legal, policy and administrative implications, need to be examined very carefully so that a sustainable solution to the problem can be found. It was not the intention of the amendments in this bill to address the effect on the tribunal of the Federal Court decisions of Bishop and Leshem. The amendments contained in this bill, which were developed when the tribunal review powers were fully operational, are intended to improve the operation and efficiency of the tribunal. It would be premature to withdraw these amendments while the possibility of restoring the tribunal's review powers remains on foot. The third issue concerns the amendment to permit trustees to accept binding death benefit nominations from members. The honourable member for Bonython questions the reasons for the proposed three-year expiry of such a nomination, and the application of the sole purpose test which limits the persons whom a member can nominate as a beneficiary. It Sh9Uld be pointed out that any time limit on the life of a nomination is to be placed in regulations. These regulations will be developed in close consultation with industry and consumer groups. However, as a starting point, it is our view that a three-year expiry of a binding nomination provides a safeguard against the payment of the member's death benefit in accordance with an old nomination where the member's domestic and personal circumstances have changed since the nomination was made. It should be noted that it is intended that the regulation, subject to consultation, will provide that a member will be able to easily confirm a nomination by signing a form provided to the member with the member's annual statement. The three-year expiry period will begin to run again from the date of the member's confirmation. It should also be stressed that the sole purpose test does not prevent a death benefit being paid to the deceased member's estate. Therefore the death benefit can be paid to a person who is not otherwise a dependant of the deceased. The amendments in this bill to permit trustees of superannuation funds to accept a binding nomination from a member for the payment of death benefits will provide greater efficiency in the processing of death benefit claims by superannuation trustees and more certainty for members. In conclusion, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the superannuation supervisory framework. It is, vital that an effective regulatory regime is maintained to ensure the security of superannuation savings, and public confidence in the superannuation system more generally. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the bill to the chamber. Question unresolved. 1788 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 further questions to be considered in relation to this bill, in accordance with standing order 277, the bill will be returned to the House for further consideration. Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 December 1997,.on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. Amendments) Bill 1997 contains numerous technical amendments to the taxation legislation. These include fixing drafting errors in legislation, clarifying existing provisions and reducing the compliance requirements associated with various existing provisions. We are approaching this legislation as non-controversial in the community as it appears that there are no significant policy issues raised by the bill and no representations have been received by us at this stage suggesting amendments to the proposals. . The bill appears to be a move towards the United States system of an annual taxation technical amendment bill. That is to say, it is attempting to group all the non-policy legislative matters together in one. piece of legislation instead of including purely technical amendments in bills with significant poHcy matters, as has previously been the case. The general concept of a technical amendments bill is certainly not one which is opposed by the opposition. We -re not proposing that no minor policy items could be treated in such a piece of legislation in the future. It is the case that it may be appropriate for minor issues of policy detail to be addressed in the context of addressing technical problems in legislation. Indeed, it would be silly to redraft a particular provision and not deal with a minor policy issue that has arisen in the sarneprovision. However, that is the sort of format that could be open to abuse. It must not be abused by slipping through major policy changes under the guise of purely technical amendments. If the government were to attempt to do that, then clearly goodwill from the opposition towards this type of minor legislative reform would be dissipated. The second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum explain the precise provisions and proposals. I think it is worth saying while we are discussing the issue of taxation laws that we have a situation at the moment where the government are saying in this country, 'We want to have a tax debate. We have got tax reform on the agenda and we want to have a tax debate.' But in fact they do not want to have a tax debate. Everything they are doing is shrouded in secrecy. It is said that we have got a task force examining tax reform options. That is a process that has been couched in incredible secrecy. Officials have admitted that there are no written records being kept of the meetings of the task force. There are not even written agendas produced before the meetings. That is not the usual workings of a public service. That is political use of the Public Service by the government. While the government have been asserting that tax reform is essential, they have not engaged in any public debate about the plethora of reform options that are available. They confine themselves to statements getting stuck into the existing system-in my view, often without foundation. But they do not say anything about the reform options that are available. None of the information produced by the Treasury has been released about the options considered nor the relative merits of different approaches that could be taken to address various issues.",150,Representatives Main Committee

It simply wants to hide its proposals until as late as it possibly can and then pretend that its preferred model is the optimum. This is a form of deceit.

It ought to release them now so that the public can properly assess the decisions that the government is proposing to take. Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to contest the idea that there is a crisis in the tax system. Indeed, the Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill 1997 that we are debating now reflects the way in which tax works. Problems arise from time to time in any taxation system; it is the responsibility of government to address those problems as they arise, as indeed the government is doing with this piece of legislation. The Treasurer ( Mr Costello) has been running around for the past six months-probably longer now-pretending that the tax system is not sustainable. The primary purpose of a tax system is to raise revenue. The taxation system, it has to be said, has to be in pretty good shape because it basically collects enough revenue to finance surpluses throughout the whole forward estimates period. Indeed, the Treasurer, in one breath, said, 'The taxation system is rotten. It's had it. It's got to be thrown out.' In the next breath he went around boasting about the fiscal position. He might be prematurely boasting, but he is boasting about the fiscal position. the chair. The honourable member for Gippsland will have an opportunity to respond to any provocative statements when he has his 20 minutes McGauran) suggesting that the tax system which raises revenue bears no relationship to the government's budgetary position and prospects. It is the first time. I have ever heard such a proposition advanced that there is no connection between tax and the budget. when he gets the call. The tax system is serving this country well enough to produce a situation where the books are balanced. The tax system constantly needs renovation and refurbishment. We, in government, always acted to improve the tax system and to address problems that arose. We will continue to do so. We do not accept the argument that the system is broke and therefore we have to have a GST. We have no intention of imposing a new tax on goods and services. What we have is a government which is frightened of the tax debate and, indeed, in the House yesterday, when there was a matter of importance concerning the taxation of discretionary trusts, thi! Treasurer ( Mr Costello) was nowhere to be found. He did not participate in that debate and he has not come forward with proposals to address the problem of the abuse of family trusts for tax purposes. That is a problem that the taxation commissioner has indeed identified for quite some time now. He put a report to the previous government just prior to the change of government drawing attention to this problem and, in particular, to the way in which high-wealth individuals were evading their fair share of tax and to the fact that family trusts were playing a major role in their doing so. We have seen precious little in the way of action from this government to address that problem and so it has got worse rather than better. We know that one of the reasons for this",152,Representatives Main Committee

418,Mr Mcgauran,I didn't say that.,153,Representatives Main Committee
419,Mr Kelvin Thomson,"Nevertheless, the member may wish to explain his position1790 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 is that many in the government, both senators and members, have family trusts. Therefore, it appears that it is not in their own interest that the government should crack down on family trusts. Instead what they say is, 'The tax system is broke and we're going to have to tax ordinary people on food and on clothing, and going to the footy, or going to the theatre, or anything they might want to do by way of entertainment; we are going to have to put those taxes on because we are not prepared to address the family trust problem.' It is worth noting that, in the trust loss legislation that did pass the Senate in the past week, we saw an exemption which dramatically diluted the effect of the crackdown on trafficking in family trust losses set in train by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis), back in 1995. What we need to get from this government is evidence that it is fair dinkum about cracking down on tax avoidance through the use of trusts. That is the sort of thing that the community needs to make the tax system work better and work as well as it can, rather than say that this system is broke and, therefore, we have to throw it out and replace it with a system which is fundamentally unfair. Those who have had the opportunity to have a look at how a GST would work would understand that it is inherently regressive and that there is no way of addressing those problems with a compensation package. Lower income people have a higher proportion of their income go in paying the costs of a GST than do higher income people. It is inherently unfair and there is no way of fixing it up. You could have problems both with a high level of GST and with a flat rate GST. One of the problems is that the government is simply unwilling to come up with its GST model. It is scared by its previous experiences when it produced quite a detailed model that was rejected by the Australian electorate which had the opportunity to have a good look at it. It has decided, 'Oh well, we're going to change; we're going to do it differently this time; we're going to hide that model; we are going to unveil it at the last possible moment'-if indeed we do see it prior to an election being called. We also have problems with what is referred to as the 'compensation now' .problem-that is, no-one can be guaranteed that he or she will not be worse off at the outset. This idea that you can design an effective compensation scheme to ensure that no low or middle income people are made worse off through the introduction of a GST simply cannot be done. Indeed, even if you can seek to design such a system, you have what is referred to as the compensation in the future problem. No-one can be guaranteed that they will not be worse off further down the track. One of the interesting things about a GST, and the experience in other nations of a GST, is that the rate of GST can and does tend to be increased, whereas the compensation package tends to be decreased. That is the sort of thing that has happened in New Zealand. The international experience of a GST is that, despite assurances to the contrary, the initial rate at which it is introduced is inevitably increased over time. Of the 27 OECD countries which have a GST, 21 of these have already increased the standard rate of tax from its initial level. In the United Kingdom the VAT was initially 10 per cent and now it is 17Y2 per cent. In New Zealand the GST was initially 10 per cent and now it is 12Y2 per cent. In addition, over time governments tend to eliminate or reduce the concessions on certain goods and services which are initially introduced. History shows that, once this form of taxation is introduced, it never gets repealed. Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1791 The other sorts of problems that it throws up that simply are insurmountable are the problems for small business. The first problem for a small business is that of becoming an unpaid tax collector. The wholesale sales tax is a relatively easy system to administer and comply with. There are presently around 75,000 registered tax collection points. Most small businesses are not registered. They are not wholesalers. They do not need to get involved with this. But a GST would require around one million additional taxpayers to register and remit GST on a regular basis. Small businesses are not going to get paid for that tax collecting role. The second problem is that they will have high compliance costs. They will have the initial transitional compliance costs and they will have ongoing compliance costs. The initial costs will include self-education, new equipment, new business systems and related professional advice. Those things will vary considerably between businesses but you will see new hardware such as cash registers with a GST tax capacity, computer software, accounting software, new sales dockets and forms to include provision for GST, and that is on top of the time that small businesses will need to spend learning how a GST works and registering with the Australian Taxation Office. The ongoing compliance costs will include the time taken for GSTpaperwork, professional advice, record keeping for possible GST audits, the cost of being audited and so on. We will see very significant problems for small businesses. I also want to refer to the black economy problem. A lot of people say that one of the problems with our existing tax system is the problem of straight evasion. There is no question that that is a problem but a GST will not fix it. Indeed, it increases the incentive not to report transactions because by doing that you not only avoid the income tax that may be payable on those transactions but also you avoid the GST. I have spoken to people in Canada about this matter. I said to them, 'How is it that the progressive conservative party managed to be reduced from a parliamentary majority to two seats in a single election?'-that is a pretty crushing election defeat; it makes some of the election defeats we have seen in Australia seem pretty mickey mouse-and they said, 'GST.' When I asked them why the GST was such a debacle, one of the things that they mentioned was the avoidance. No-one wanted to pay it so they were not reporting transactions. So far from dealing with the black economy it provides incentives for the black economy to increase in size. In addition to those things, it is clear that GST is no solution to unemployment. Internationally, there is no relationship between consumption taxes and unemployment rates. The United States, for example, does not have a GST and it has one of the lowest levels of unemployment among advanced economies. We have the inflation problem. There is no doubt that a GST would generate a price surge, an inflationary surge. For example, a 15 per cent GST would generate a surge of around five per cent. There is no guarantee that inflation would fall quickly to its pre-GST level. We have a whole series of problems with GST. The government has failed to put forward a model so that we can haye some discussion about how that will impact on ordinary Australian people. I call on the government to release this model, not to keep us in the dark. It is time that we had a decent tax debate in this country, not a phoney one. The obligation is on the government, which is arguing the case for change, to put forward its model and not hide its light behind a bushel with secret meetings that are not even being put down on paper. It is high time that that was done. Having said that, as I indicated at the outset, the opposition does not propose to oppose this legislation. 1792 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 congratulations of the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson) for this innovative reform, namely the Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill 1997. Again, it is a reform introduced by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) after Labor's 13 barren, hollow years of inactivity on tax. I will come to that in a short moment. We have introduced a housekeeping measure that those opposite applaud. A central feature of the address to the chamber by the member for Wills has been that there has been no tax debate, that we are hiding details regarding the introduction of a goods and services tax or the like. Where has he been for the last few months? You cannot open a newspaper these days without columnists or editorialists waxing lyrical on the subject. There is enormous debate in the community, very much fostered-indeed, generated and promulgated-by the government. We started the whole tax reform debate, and, indeed, the first instalment of the government's transparent encouragement of public transport has been the Treasurer's publication In need of reform, which is easily available to the member for Wills and to any of his constituents. It does two things. The first is that it shows that the government is serious about an informed public debate with regard to tax reform. People are not going to be able to participate fully and in a knowledgeable way until they accept the case for reform-which you do not. That is the second thing: you do not believe there is any need for tax reform. In fact, your incredible statement-as I took it down accurately-was this: 'The tax system works satisfactorily and the books are balanced.' We have not balanced the books by raising taxes. We have not used the tax system to introduce fiscal discipline. We have cut government spending and have eliminated waste to a very large extent. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjectinga balanced budget or a budget surplus. books by way of increasing the taxes-as the Labor party sought to do in the Dawkins budget of 1993. The only way they could address the budget deficit which they created themselves was by increasing taxes. We will not increase taxes; instead, we will reform the tax system. The idea that the government's departmental task force on tax reform should involve the opposition is so absurd, so ludicrous and so impossible that the member for Wills could not have"" said it with any seriousness. Why would a government involve an opposition that has already declared its hand on the issue of tax reform and has again reinforced that, through the member for Wills, here today? Why would we involve such blind. opponents of tax reform in the tax debate and the discussion within government ranks? It would be rare enough anyway for any government to involve their opposite number in internal policy making; let alone involve an opposition that has categorically ruled out any 'support whatsoever for tax reform involving a GST. It is an absurd and really pointless argument for the member for Wills to make. It shows how shallow has been not only his contribution this morning but also the whole opposition approach to tax reform. Who does not believe we are in need of tax reform---other than the member for Wills, who has told us that the tax system works satisfactorily and that the books",153,Representatives Main Committee

The Treasurer, in the booklet he has published in the past few 'weeks, makes out a compelling, convincing and unassailable case for tax reform. I could not help thinking, when I decided to speak on this legislation, 'Here we go again: yet more legislation on tax!'---even though they may be technical, correction types of amendments. After this debate, we will debate the tax law improvement bill; ,there is a welter of tax legislation entering the parliament and being imposed on taxpayers, their financial advisers and accountants and the like-and the Treasurer knows it. The Treasurer is not happy about. this at all. In fact, he states how complex this system has become. He states that the income tax legislation is just too complex. When the Income Tax Assessment Act started off in 1936, it was 120 pages long; now it is 3,300 pages long. It has doubled in size over the past seven years, and it may well double in size over the next seven years. It is an intolerable situation. Again, with regard to sales tax the Treasuter, in the interests of an informed public debate, sets out what an administrative and compliance nightmare it is, with its complexities that are mind-boggling even for specialists in the area. It leads to absurd situations, as he points out, where basic necessities of life, such as toothpaste, are being taxed but where others, such as toothbrushes, are not being taxed. Then there are the philosophical arguments about incentive and reward for effort and work. So there is a need for tax reform. We would happily involve the opposition with it, as we do other members and representatives of the community. The tax task force is of course taking advice from right across the economic, even political, spectrum. But we have to exclude the opposition. Who will ever forget their conduct during the 1993 election campaign-the distortions, the exaggerations, indeed, the outright lies often told., We are not going to involveMrs Bailey-I remember it well. then opposition at that time, putting the case in a very genuine and honest fashion and finding that, at every turn, her political opponents were distorting her message dishonestly. So, really, why do I even have to rebut the suggestion that the opposition wants to be involved with the government's tax reform task force. The absurdity of it is only too obvious to anybody. At the same time the member for Wills tried to tell us about family trusts and the like. This is a very important area of public policy. It deserves an informed debate. Reforms or amendments to tax laws may well be needed, and that is under active consideration by the government. But do not blame us for this. In fact, the member for Wills cited, in a very generalised, un attributed wayunattributed argument that he made about tax losses-tax avoidance he called it. Tax avoidance is a crime. Tax minimisation is a moral issue. Of course, most of these family trusts involve tax minimisation, not tax avoidance, I would have thought. In any event, without getting into a discussion of the merits or otherwise of this area of taxation, let me make the point that the figures now available to us surrounding family trusts and any tax lost to the revenue were dtlfingLabor's years. Again, he was pontificating about the need for reform for an area of tax that his government studiously, and deliberately, ignored or neglected over many years.

Well this was an1794 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 that they can lecture the government about tax policy and the need for tax reform. But, again, they are confused here. On the one hand, the member for Wills will tell us that the tax system works satisfactorily, the books are now balanced, but, on the other hand, for political reasons he will selectively pick out different areas that may suit his attacks on the government. The point is that this government is serious about tax reform. It has nailed its colours to the mast on the need for tax reform. It will see this· through. We will not shirk. We already see the beginnings of a scare campaign being mounted by the opposition. It will not distract us from what we know needs to be done-that is, a fundamental overhaul of the tax system for the benefit of all Australians. I will draw my remarks to a conclusion and again make the point that the bill before the chamber is a very important one, despite the fact that it is adding further to the length of the Income Tax Assessment Act. One final point I will make is that there is a technical amendment to those provisions dealing with capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. A major reform of this government when it came to power was that we assisted small business to deal with Labor's capital gains tax, so as to provide that incentive and that reward so necessary for people who invest their life savings and their family security in small business. The way we have reformed that area very substantially is something we are very proud of. because we get an opportunity to remind each other about a few of the facts associated with the whole issue of tax reform over the past 13 to 15 years and to set the record straight. Even my colleague would have to concede that, in 1983 when there was a change in government, one of the priority areas of the new government of the day was to look at the tax system to see what reforms were necessary. Similarly in 1996, it became an issue for the incumbent government to say what was necessary to try to improve the tax system, and to build on what was there-admittedly, in line with the different philosophies that political parties have to see whether other emphases needed to be placed. I am interested that, in the next bill to be debated here, we are talking about another issue associated with taxation and taxation reform. I am sure a few issues will be raised there. This particular bill, though, does tidy up a few of the existing taxation laws and, far from introducing any sweeping changes, it simply makes some technical amendments to the existing legislation. I agree with the member for Gippsland when he says that, over the last several years, taxation law has grown enormously in size and complexity. That is, I think, without dispute. Anybody who has had anything to do with the taxation system knows this is the case. There have been a lot of cases, and I have witnessed some in parliamentary committee work in previous years. One of the reasons that has occurred is that there is always a group of smarties that are out there trying to be ahead of the Australian Taxation Office and the governmentand I use that in a broad sense-to see ways in which they can not only minimise their taxation obligation to Australia but also engage in outright avoidance. Therefore, any government is caught behind the eight ball and always has to play a catch-up game in this re--t. . The Treasurer ( Mr Costello) might think that, by putting out this document, he is trying to get ahead of the game. In fact, what he has signalled is his government's belief that there is a need for some further taxation reform. If you believe what the member for Gippsland has",157,Representatnes Main Committee
427,Mr Martin (Cunningham) (12.15 P.m.),It is always a pleasure to follow my colleague,158,Representatives Main Committee
428,"The Member For Gippsland ( Mr Mcgauran) In Debates About Taxation Reform Or Anything Else,","Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1795 said, it has stimulated debate in the community. I think debate has been stimulated in the community but not necessarily for the reasons that he believes. Debate has been stimulated in the community because the taxation system does have a need for reform. I believe that to be a fundamental case that cannot be argued. But the methodology that is required in that reform is where we see the difference, and where we see people in the community expressing differences of opinion. For example, very early on in the piece when it was suggested that, by eliminating a wholesale sales tax regime and replacing it with some form of a goods and services tax across the board with minimum exemptions, there was a group in the community who thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Organisations, such as the Business Council of Australia and ACCI-representing large businesses with their own taxation departments, corporate and taxation lawyers and a string of accounting departments willing to put in place the necessary wherewithal to introduce something like that in terms of a change in the taxation system-were quite happy about that. But I am not so sure that those one million small business people out there were exactly rubbing their hands with glee. As my colleague the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson) pointed out, the compliance costs associated with existing systems, let alone the compliance costs associated with the imposition of a goods and services tax, are yet to unfold. On the GST itself, we are now really talking about the grandson of GST. It got a run back in 1986; it got a run in 1993; and it is getting a run in 1998. One has to wonder when it will actually run out of legs. Despite the best endeavours of the member for Gippsland and the Treasurer, you cannot escape from the fact that, whatever proposals the government has to reform the tax system, there is nothing out there for people to judge it by. He is right that debate has been stimulated throughout the Australian economy and the Australian electorate, but it is not necessarily informed debate because we do not know what form the taxation reform proposed by the government will take. Yes, there is the document that is referred to, and yes, you can point to discrepancies between toothbrushes and toothpaste. You can talk about the fact that, for example, you pay wholesale sales tax on a brand new motor vehicle but you do not pay it on a used car. There are the fleet systems and so on, and those at the upper end of the spectrum are the ones that buy the new cars, but most of the punters in Australia do not. They go for the used cars, so they are not going to be caught with that. If they get a 10 per cent or a 15 per cent goods and services tax, however, that is going to increase the actual cost of that particular product that they themselves want. My point on this is quite simple: it is all well and good to talk about the need for tax reform, and Treasurer Costello was trying to make a case for that, but we do not know what that reform is going to entail. We have had people talking about eliminating things like the payroll tax; we have talked about BAD and Fill that operate and are collected by the Commonwealth on behalf of states. Those are two state issues, so when are we going to see what the Commonwealth government has in mind to recompense the state governments for, perhaps, taking off those taxes and taking away the ability of the state governments to raise much needed revenue to replace the revenue they are not getting from the Commonwealth at the minute for things like hospitals, nursing homes, child-care centres and all the rest that have been slashed and burnt out in the last couple of budgets? The states have a vested interest in this. They have a clear interest to say to Treasurer Costello and Prime Minister Howard, 'Show us what you have got in mind, so that whatever 1796 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 necessary adjustments we have to make at a state level to change our taxation regime we can put in place.' Similarly, when we start to talk about eliminating wholesale sales tax and replacing it by a goods and services tax, what rate are we talking about at which that is going to apply? There seems to be a general view in the community that we are talking about 10 per cent only. Why? It is because politically we could"" not go any higher than that. We saw the nonsense that the Treasurer tried to put out a couple of weeks ago, when he was trying to suggest to people that the government would absolutely, in legislation, lock it in that it would be at a rate that would never change. He knows, I know and even the member for Gippsland knows that that is just impossible. It is impossible for technical reasons, but it is impossible also because governments just cannot do that. In every country where a GST has been introduced at a particular rate it has changed, and never downwards. If it becomes the major source of a government providing income to itself, then to be spent on a variety of programs which the constituency at large expects of the Commonwealth government, then clearly the government cannot lose revenue by locking itself into a particular rate. When we start to talk about some of the other taxation measures that perhaps are going to be examined, there are issues of fuel taxes. I know the member for Gippsland, representing a rural community, very much has im interest in this. What is going to be the outcome there? What about some of the other provisional tax arrangements that might be in place? What about the arrangements associated with superannuation? Are these going to be picked up as part of the broader taxation reform process? That we do not know is the simple answer to that. We read""in the financial press today that it will be at least two months-or at least that is what the government is saying-before the actual package is dropped. I hope it is not so long. I hope it appears a bit sooner so that we can sit back and debate the issue. The member for Gippsland has repeated a nonsense that has been stated in the House in the last couple of days when the issue of taxation reform has been debated, both in question time and on a matter of public importance, that Labor did nothing. Half of these technical amendments that we are debating here this afternoon are fixing up the taxation changes which Labor put in place. I remind the honourable member for Gippsland, and many other people on the other side, that in ·1983 the biggest growth industry in Australia was tax avoidance and bottom of the harbour tax schemes. Who fixed it up? P.J. Keating, Treasurer, Labor Party. What was the next thing that he did? He looked at what the personal income tax scales were in this country and said, 'This is unfair. Most people are getting very close, with bracket creep and everything else, to the top marginal tax rate', which was 60c in the dollar. He then dropped it to 47c or 48c, and then when you add the Medicare levy you get another 1Ylc on top of that. The bottom rate was 30c in the dollar, for people in Australia who are the so-called battlers that the Prime Minister likes to talk about; now it is 20c, with a changed scale in the middle. That was tax reform of a personal tax nature and yet people say that Labor did nothing. We then had the tax S.UOlmit, and' arising out of that, of course, was an options paper prepared by Treasury with the famous options A, Band C. There were various elements of a consumption tax in option C, with capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax and a whole range of the other so-called nasties. If the Treasurer of the day had not been knocked over by the Prime Minister of the day and the ACTU at the hotel up the road, that might have been put in place. That is history. That is the way of it. Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1797 As a consequence, we ended up with taxation reform sponsored by the Labor party. It saw the so-called nasties-which really are an important element of taxation revenue-put in place. These reforms attacked the avoidance and minimisation areas, fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax, and so on. As a government we went to great pains on capital gains tax to say that we were not going to tax it on the nominal value. We were actually going to make some allowances for inflation, and all the rest of it that was tied into that. There were reforms and a carefully thought through taxation system put in place to deal with issues on the way through. That raised the issue of things like dividend imputation, so that taxes were not levied twice on businesses. We saw the business tax rate lowered to stimulate the businesses in this country-and on it went. I simply say to those people that would argue that there was no reform under Labor that they should go back and read their history books. There was. Those on the other side of the House may not agree with it. They may not think that the crackdown on bottom of the harbour tax schemes, or tax in capital gains, or putting fringe benefits things in to knock off the free lunches by some of their mates in the Victorian parliament-these sorts of things-were Labor reforms, but that is the way of it. That was bringing equity into the system, but it was also attacking it at the source in personal income tax rates. Those people who march around this place and say that Labor did nothing should go back and read their history a little bit. The other thing that we have been talking a great deal about here is the issue of trusts, because it is picked up in the legislation we are debating today. It is a very important issue. As was suggested yesterday-and I think that the member for Gippsland also talked about this today, asking why Labor had not done something about it-in 1995 when the size of the problem became known to the Treasurer, Ralph Willis, he did do something about it. He put a piece of legislation into the parliament to crackdown on the use of trusts for tax avoidance. An election was called-we lost-and it was two years down the track before the government then put in, last week, their watered down version of this issue. My friend the member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) has a bit of a smile on his face because this was an argument he used yesterday in the MPI. But it is true. It is simply a fact that it took two years before you decided you wanted to do something about it--or at least the government did. The simple fact is that the amendments here contained in the Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bi1l1997 go to a number of tidying up exercises that are required to give some further transparency and ease of understanding of what is required. I wish it speedy passage through the parliament. Motion (by Mr Rocher) agreed to: That further proceedings on this bill be conducted in the House. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Roads to the need for additional federal funding to complete the greater western Sydney orbital roads",158,Representatives Main Committee
429,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Hollis),"Order! It being 12.30 p.m., I propose the question:",161,Representatives Main Committee
430,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (12.30 P.m.),"My speech on the adjournment debate goes1798 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 system and for further development of cross-regional links between employment zones and regional centres. The completion of this roads network is to allow full development of industry in western Sydney and to ensure that this region benefits economically both during and after the Olympic Games. The federal government has recognised the western Sydney orbital between the M2 at Seven Hills and the M5 at Preston as part of the future national highway link through Sydney. As such, its funding is the responsibility of the federal government. The western Sydney orbital is estimated to cost $800 million to build to a national highway standard with divided carriageways and graded, separated intersections over its 43-kilometre length. The previous federal government in its May 1995 budget committed $260 million to commence construction of the first stage of the western Sydney orbital between Pres tons and Cecil Park. Construction was to start in 1996. Additionally, in August 1995 the then federal minister for transport committed $220 million for the second stage of the western Sydney orbital between Cecil Park and the M4 at Eastern Creek. Construction was to start in 1998. The present federal government has reneged on that commitment. In November 1996 the then federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume( Mr Sharp), announced that the federal government had set aside only $109 million, over five years, towards restructuring works comprising environmental assessment, land acquisition and other planning activities. Based on advice from the federal minister at around that time, the New South Wales government has included $7 million in the New South Wales budget for the western Sydney orbital in 1997-98. However, the federal minister has yet to announce the funding allocated for this project for that 1997-98 period. The completion of economic development of a region is affected by the capacity and efficiency of the existing transport network to service commercial vehicles and freight movements. Greater western Sydney has a population of 1.6 million people. It has a gross national product of $35 million and produces 10 per cent of New South Wales's agricultural output, yet it has not one freeway standard cross-regional road. Road transport is the major contributor to the distribution industry. New and expanding industries are increasingly seeking proximity to major road networks to reduce transport costs. Development in technology also leads to companies locating near other industries and local markets rather than close to their own headquarters. The existing road network out from Sydney's metropolitan CBD is radial and lacks direct cross-regional links between employment zones and regional centres. High levels of congestion are increasingly being experienced on the existing freight corridors serving greater western Sydney, including the M4, the M5 and Cumberland highways. The capacity of the M4 has already reached 4,200 vehicles at peak hour traffic times. This congestion is threatening the competitiveness of industry and commerce located in greater western Sydney due to insufficient freight movements and longer transport travel times. If real industrial and commercial development is to be achieved, attention needs to be paid to the movement of freight both within greater western Sydney and to the major terminals at Port Botany and Kingsford Smith airport and to the rail terminals at Chullora and Enfield. There is also a need to take into account the likely trends in freight demand based on both future industrial growth and changes in freight activity such as just-in-time, centralised Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1799 distribution, cross-docking, outsourcing of transport and distribution processes, smart warehousing and electronic trading. The region's business community has identified the completion of what is termed the arterial road grid consisting of the existing M4, the Cumberland Highway, both Windsor Road and Old Windsor Road, the M2 under construction, the planned M5 East, and the western Sydney orbital as essential for western Sydney's economic development. Finally, this clearly means that t-e federal government has to add additional finance to complete this work. Employment job seekers far more choices in selecting job referral centres and a greater opportunity to match employment with their aptitude. In Melbourne's eastern suburbs we have been well served by the employment initiatives of the Howard government. Apprenticeships and training programs have been brought back from the dead after 13 years of Labor neglect and my electorate of Deakin has benefited greatly from these increased vocational opportunities. Job Network will expand upon gains already made by this government in helping people find work. For too long the unemployed were treated like products riding a conveyor belt on a production line. If one passed all the checks along the way, there was a slim possibility of a job at the end of the line. For the many who did not make it to the end, there would be training programs where long term unemployed without skills for the work force were directed toward positions fof which they mayor may not have been suited. But more importantly for the ALP and the former employment minister Beazley, they had them off the books of long-term unemployed. Mr Deputy Speaker, the retraining gurus got their money whether there were successful job outcomes or not. Everyone was a winner, except the unemployed who genuinely wanted work. Constituents in the electorate of Deakin have consistently made two points to me when telling me about their treatment as job seekers: firstly, they had little or no contact for months with their case manager and secondly, their time was being wasted by attending compulsory group sessions. The minimum level of assistance was all they received. We believe that people deserve better and Job Network in itself, will become a departure from Labor's failed policies that delivered programs but no jobs. Job Network is also a timely recognition that new ground must be broken to drag down unemployment levels and the time spent between jobs. With the organisations that will comprise the Job Network, the pay-off will come at the same time that it comes for their client: when that client is placed in a job. This should ensure that there are significant efforts on behalf of each client. I am pleased to inform the unemployed in Deakin-the seven per cent according to the December figures-that many of the Job Network providers have considerable experience in placing people in positions. Deakin and Melbourne's east will be well served by the network. The· 10 providers judged the most suitable have been Inner East Group Training; Connect Employment and Trading Services; Job Support Vic; Mission Australia; Indo-Chinese Employment Service; Salvation Army; AHEIC Chandler; Melbourne East Group Training; Employment National, which is the revamped CES; and KYM, which is the amalgamation",161,Representatives Main Committee

Of those 10 job providers who won contracts for the eastern suburbs, five are existing local providers. To those who tendered and missed out, opportunities exist for subcontracting to the winriing providers. I note, Mr Deputy Speaker, with interest that Saturday's press featured in. its employment pages an advertisement from Melbourne East Group Training, a very reputable and well-known organisation in the eastern suburbs. They were calling on applications for 49 positions, including field staff, customer service personnel, job club leaders and administrative assistants. No doubt, the other organisations will also be looking for new personnel to se-ve their clientele. These changes will provide a level of service and opportunity not before offered to job seekers. Job matching, job search training, intensive assistance, new enterprise schemes and apprenticeship and training services are the types of services whiCh will be available for those hunting for a job. Of course, this comes on top of the very successful job pathway program in the eastern suburbs-$348,000, the largest job pathway program in the country. They are very close to meeting their targets by the end of April. It comes on top. of the one-st?p shop in Ringwood, the only one-stop shop that actually looks after the needs of the young kids as well as serving the needs of the employers. They are very successful programs that have been initiated by this government. . In the very near future, I will be hosting a meeting of all of these providers to find ways in which we can work together to maximise the impact of the scheme. Mr Deputy Speaker, all these providers should be congratulated and I will certainly be endeavouring to work with them in partnership as I have done in the past two years. I congratulate them and look forward to continued successful outcomes for the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. (Time expired) Health Insurance adequate Medicare agreement with the states and the territories has to be one of the major concerns to this nation. The Premier of Queensland called the government's funding offer a 'son of dud'. The Premier of Victoria called it 'totally unrealistic and very unfair'. The Premier of Western Australia said he would cause the Prime Minister 'a politicalproblein' if he did not increase his offer. The Premier of New South Wales said th-t John Howard was 'treating Australians with contempt'. We have heard in broad terms how dramatically the Howard government's obstinate refusal I to compromise on this issue will affect the public health systems of the states and the territories. What does it mean to thebealth professionals on the ground? What does it mean from hospital to hospital, from patient to patient? It means longer waiting queues for surgery and care. It means people will not get the best treatment that oUr world-class public hospital system is capable of giving. They will not have access to the most advanced technologies and medicines. It means health professionals will be run even more ragged trying to give people a higher standard of care without the necessary financial support. It means bed closures; it means ward closures; it means hospital closures. The human cost of the Howard government's failure on public health .funding will be heavy. In my own state of New South Wales, an estimated 400 people per day are dropping out of private health insurance. This presents an annual cost to the state's hospital system of $260 million. The current Medicare agreement states that, for every two per cent fall in the amount",163,Representatives Main Committee
432,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (12.40 P.m.),"The failure of the federal government to reach anThursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1801 of people holding private health insurance, an equal adjustment in funding should take place. Not only has the current federal government not lived up to this agreement, but it has directly cut funding to the New South Wales public hospitals by another $34 million. To make up for the thousands leaving private health care the New South Wales government needs an extra $350 million a year to take the strain off the public health system. The Howard government has offered them a mere $17 million. Yet while this is happening before our very eyes, this Howard government continues to throw $600 million a year down the drain at a failed scheme to coax Australians into maintaining or picking up private health cover. With 66,000 people dropping out of private health in the three months to December, it is obvious that the scheme has been an unmitigated disaster. The Howard government's failure on health is beginning to have a dramatic effect in my part of western Sydney. Those constituents of mine who are now seeking public health care have three major choices in our area: Liverpool Hospital, Fairfield Hospital or Westmead Hospital. All three are fine health establishments. The children's ward of Westmead especially is known for its standard of care throughout the world. However, despite the fact that the New South Wales government has now ploughed an extra $1 billion into the health system .over the last three years, hospital waiting lists are increasing and will increase more because the Howard government cannot see fit to provide adequate funds for public health care. Fairfield Hospital now needs an extra $3 million per year, which is just enough money to cater for the 1,251 extra people they are expected to have to care for as more and more people from our community leave private health cover. Liverpool Hospital needs an extra $8 million to cope with the 3,320 extra patients that are expected to be coming through its doors in the next 12 months. Westmead Hospital needs over $20 million to look after the extra 7,862 patients who will now be dependent on its care. The predicament facing these threepublic hospitals serving my community is very real and very desperate. The Howard government must bring itself to understand the human cost of its failure to provide the adequate funds needed under the Medicare agreement. As the premiers displayed at their conference last Friday, this is an issue that crosses party boundaries. It is about health and is about the care of all Australians. The longer the Howard government fails to see that the more people in my community and communities like it across Australia will continue to suffer. In the very limited time. I have left to me I would also like to bring to the attention of the House that we have also experienced the closure of two more Medicare offices in my electorate. The Medicare offices at Marylands and Cabramatta have been closed by this government. We are looking now at a population of over 1.1 million for whom the only Medicare office between Liverpool and Parramatta is in my own area of Fairfield. The queues are excessive and the staff are doing an excellent job. I congratulate them for handling the business that is now coming to them. It is a disgrace. These offices were closed without any proper consideration given to how it was going to affect the people. This, on top of what is happening to our public health system, is something that this government must bow its head in shame about.

433,Mrs Draper (Makin) (12.44 P.m.),"I would like to speak about the Makin Tough on1802 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 March 1998 parent of three children, I am very concerned and disturbed about the extent of the drug problem in our community. However, I believe that the war has not been lost as some try to suggest. It is up to us as a community to work collaboratively. As we all know, one of the best ways to deal with the issue of the misuse of drugs is to educate not only our children in schools but also our families at home. It is the Tough on Drugs package which will deliver this education to the community. Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, Special Minister of State, and I have undertaken to implement a drug education campaign within Makin, with the aim of reducing the number of illicit drugs in our schools and the demand for illicit drug use among school children. The launch was a very important day for everyone in Makin. Among the guests were the South Australian Minister for Police, Emergency Services and Correctional Services, the Hon. Ian Evans; Senator Grant Chapman; Mrs Jill Grove, from the Drug and Alcohol Services Council; and Sergeant Bob Kemp from the Para Hills police station, who addressed the issues surrounding drugs in our community and the adverse effects of drug use. It was also a delight to have in attendance representatives from many of the churches, community groups and organisations within Makin and, most importantly, the SRC representatives who attended from schools across the electorate. Channel9 Adelaide identity Xavier Minniecon hosted the launch, which also featured the local band Cabinet, who delivered a strong message about the use of drugs and peer pressure, particularly among school children. At this point I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work over many years and the achievements that have already been made in the area of drug awareness and education, not only by our schools councils but by programs being run by our service clubs, such as the Lions Drug Awareness Foundation and the Rotary International Drug Abuse Prevention Committee. I am also aware of the work being done by Apex Clubs in their research for the prevention of youth suicide, which research does suggest has a link with the misuse of drugs, both legal and illicit. Prior to the launch of the Tough on Drugs campaign I had the pleasure of meeting with all of the school principals in my electorate to discuss the launch. All of the principals stated that further funding for the program was a necessity, as well as teacher-friendly packages for the implementation of the program. I am happy to report that the Makin community have welcomed the announcement from the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) of a further $100 million for the national Tough on Drugs campaign for treatment, counselling and education. Our teachers and school community in general have, over the past decade or so, carried the tremendous burden of an overcrowded curriculum, to the extent that our society expects so much from our teachers-from teaching our children, literally, to tie their shoelaces, to improving their socialisation skills and a myriad other skills that were once part of family education in the home. Overall, teachers do a great job. When I visit our schools I am constantly amazed at the extraordinary talent and abilities of our students, which have been fostered and nurtured by our teachers and for which they must take credit. However, in relation to drug education it is now time for our parents and families to take a proactive role by taking ownership of the problems facing our kids and talking to their children about drug use. As a community we need to take responsibility for our children and not expect our schools to tackle the problem on their own. Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin and I will be co-sponsoring parent information nights across the electorate of Makin over the Thursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1803 coming weeks and months, so that parents can become much more involved and informed of the services available to them. As I have said, the war against drugs is not lost. In Makin we have commenced a full frontal assault because our kids are worth the effort. I commend the Prime Minister for his stance on family values and his Tough on Drugs campaign. Codes of Conduct codes of conduct and what they actually mean. Codes of conduct have been in the news a fair bit during the term of this government. I have had some trouble defining code of conduct, given that the question of what the code itself actually is has altered considerably in the time of this government. Initially, I thought the code of conduct related to guidelines-rules, if you like-for ministerial responsibility and under what circumstances and in what way a minister should act on the question of propriety. But I have decided that it is now not that at all. I think I have really understood it. The wording is not 'code of conduct', but actually 'in code of conduct'. The code is the issue. It is not the conduct; it is the code. It is a bit like a Cheshire cat. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, recall in your youth-not that long ago-Alice in Wonderland and the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat said, 'Words are what I mean them to mean, not what I say, what I mean them to mean.' The circumstances change on an ongoing basis. I think we are in a land where there are many Cheshire cats. But the king of the cats at the moment is, I think, the Prime Minister on this issue of the question of what the code is The other thing is whether this code should be a written code of conduct. I have pondered that as well, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I have decided it should not be. Maybe it should be on a tape or on a CD, sort of like in Mission Impossible. I am sure we all recall Mission Impossible, the series, where Jim Phelps would go along to a bus stop or a park and he would come across a tape machine. He would tum it on, and the tape would play and tell him something. I suspect in the case of this government the tape would say something along the lines of, 'Your ministry, should you choose to accept it, is to be resources, transport, small business, administrative services, assistant treasurer,' et cetera. 'Of course, if you, or any member of your administrative team are apprehended, the Prime Minister will deny all knowledge, all responsibility, for your actions. Good luck, Jim. This tape will self-destruct in five seconds.' Let us face it, the tape took five seconds to self-destruct, which is a bit longer than it took for the Code of Conduct under this government. But then, as the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) said, and we have seen this develop over time, as a code of conduct it started off as 'This is the new way forward.' This was the new, better standard, including steak knives! Then it went to a situation where it was very similar to the standard practised by previous governments but with some improvements. It went on from there to being the same. I am a bit worried, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if this government goes on much longer, the circumstances may well be that it is actually something beyond that-that it will go back further than that to a situation where it is something akin to the last century. It is only a matter of time. When I look at some of the ministers who have gone already, I do express quite a bit of sympathy. I want to stress that I know a number of the people who have in fact paid the price",165,Representatives Main Committee

When you set a high jump, and you set a level that must be passed, people have to pay the price when they fail it. But certainly, Jim Short, amongst others, was unlucky in the circumstances. I think one person who has been very lucky has been the current Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), who I also know quite well and have a lot of time for. But there is no doubt that he is in breach. I am sure that Jim Short, who is in London now, will be looking down here and wondering what the fuss is al,l about, and probably in his own way is happy.

Lachlan has also been nominated Youth Governor of Queensland. Over the past six months I have been working with a group of young people in my electorate who have now formed a task force. This group of eight young people, after several meetings with me, decided that it would be beneficial to hold a forum for the youth in my electorate in which they could express their views on issues that are relevant to them. The task force; with my assistance, will now hold a youth forum which they have called the Lilley Youth Conference. It will be on 5 April at one of the local high schools. The youth attending will range in age from 15 to 25. The task force has recognised four main issues to be discussed at the forum. These are education, employment, self-esteem, and youth welfare. ' We have invited young people that are either full-time or part-time students, those who work part-time or full-time, and those who are currently seeking work. This is to ensure that the outcomes of the forum are truly representative of all youth in the electorate. The issues that are to be discussed were chosen for the specific reason that the youth felt that these were the issues that were of concern to them and that the government should hear their viewpoints and ideas about them so that, when it is making decisions on these matters, young people would have some input into policies that are aimed at, or directed to, them. Education was an obvious choice, as this is an issue which inevitably affects all youth. Another obvious choice was employment, as it is a major issue for youth today.

440,Mrs Elizabeth Grace (Lilley) (12.54 P.m.),"The speech I am about to read wasThursday, 26 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1805 'Unemployment', a term which is immediately fraught with negative connotations. Self-esteem is a relatively taboo term, as there are of course ties with low self-esteem, chronic depression and, to a more serious extent, suicide. However, it must be recognised that this is a major problem for youth in our society. The fourth choice, youth welfare, is another key issue in today's society. The financial assistance offered by the government and available to youth is quite often imperative for the standard of living of young people. Such a forum as the one that the Lilley Youth Task Force and I are holding is a vital tool to bridge the gap between young people and their parliamentary representatives. If we do not know what it is that young people need, how can we help them? The youth task force is one of many active discussion groups currently running in my electorate. These include a group for youth suicide prevention and also a group looking at finances and problems with the elderly. However, the special thing about this forum is that it will include the views of those people who live in my electorate but have not been able to have their say via the ballot box, as either they are too young or an election has not been held since they have become legally recognised aadults. The guest speakers at ·the youth forum will be Dr Cheryl Hurst, who was nominated Queenslander of the Year and also received an award on Australia Day. She has done extensive research into breast cancer,· and she is going to be talking to the young people on the topic of education. Mr Craig Maney from Albion McDonald's, will be talking to the young people on employment. Mike Young, who is the Olympic coach for the Australian baseball team, will be talking on self-motivation. Ben Myers, who was selected as Queensland's youth representative at the people's Constitutional Conventionbenefits that we can give young people. The main idea of this forum is to inform the government of the views of young people. I am confident that the outcomes will be positive, constructive and truly representative of what young people would like to see happening in these areas. I look forward to presenting the findings of the forum to the House, so that young people's voices will be clearly heard and so that their ideas might be a help for change in areas that are to be reviewed. As I said at the beginning, this speech was written by a young man in year 10 at Sandgate High School. It is always a pleasure to be able to give young people a chance to develop their skills and express their views. I congratulate Lachlan Kay on an excellent speech. I have every confidence that the youth forum will.be a resounding success, when it is considered that young people of this calibre are taking an active part.
