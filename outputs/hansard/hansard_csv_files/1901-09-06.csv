But we have a certain position with regard to the Empire, and we are beginning a practically independent course of Government and national life, and we must be very careful ""to keep clearly before us the two facts that 'by this Commonwealth institution that we ""have inaugurated we have become one of the civilized peoples of the world and that, whether we will or not, whether united with Great Britain or as an independent people, we must mix with the peoples of the world, and must consider international ]f we were an independent people we might take many courses, especially if we were an inBritish Empire, an empire which is so large dependent peopleof greater development than at present, with every part of our foreshores inhabited by a brave people, instead of having, as at present, a mere handful of people in this enormous continent. we should do nothing to wilfully with that union between ourselves and the country from which we have sprung, which is not merely one of affection or one of race, but one also of mutual interest. tlie other hand we must recollect the great and impressive fact that we are a people situated practically in the eastern seas, and that we have a continent of such enormous proportions that whilst the southern parts have a climate suitable to the British people, one-half of our territory is either tropical or sub-tropical. recollect that the-northern portion of our continent lies in close proximity to millions and millions of people of an alien and servile go a little north of Port Darwin we find in the Malay Peninsula, in all parts, either under the protection or within the sphere of influence of the British Empire, hundreds of thousands of Chinese and people of kindred nationalities practically carrying on the commerce and forming the most industrious element in tlie populations of these countriesNow, the question that naturally arises in dealing with a Bill like this is what is the object we have in view. Our desire is to prevent any alien or servile races from so occupying large territories in Australia. as to mix and interfuse, not merely among themselves, but with our own people. We have heard a great many definitions, almost ad nauseam, with regard to what is called a white Australia, but it is necessary for us to repeat what we mean. I must confess that some years ago I looked I Sir William McMillan. with less apprehension than I do to-day upon the possibilities of tlie future, and I'still think that there is an unnecessary amount of alarm raised in referencetothisquestion. I cannot, however, shut my eyes to the fact that the large majority of the people of Australia, backed up by nearly all the representatives of the people of Queensland, have given it as their unfaltering opinion that, no matter what measures are necessary, Australia must be kept pure for the British race who have begun to inhabit it . We have to deal here relations. with a very difficult questiou. AVe have to consider it as a people forming a part of the and so comprehensive that it contains amongst its citizens men of all colours and and enterprising of all classes. Our difficulty, therefore, whilst part of the British Empire-o r even if we were an independent State-i u dealWe must undoubtedly see that ing with a question so serious and so real is interfere to arrange so that we can keep out the undesirable elements without doing injury to those international interests, without which no great country etui live and trade. This On Bill, however, Seeks to do in a crooked and indirect way what we ought to do straightforwardly and honestly, and while I admit the difficulty, and whilst I know the history of similar legislation in the States during recent years, I do not admit that this Commonwealth Parliament, if it is to reach a certain goal, should be in any way hampered We must also or hindered by the precedents of other States. I hold that if we are perfectly sure that a certain policy is necessary to uphold the purity of the race of Australia-if a certain character. Further, when we policy is necessary in order that the civilization of a purely British character implanted on our shores shall be continued as the population increases, until we become in the future a great populous countryI do not think we should hesitate, for one moment, under the peculiar circumstances of the case -wit h our position in these south-eastern seas, open to millions of these servile and alien people-to say to Great Britain, ""Tin's is a problem which you and we have to face, and the more straightforwardly, and the more honestly we face it tlie better for the future."" Every one of us, no matter what our individual views may be, must feel, especially belonging as we do to the race which has been more broad-minded, more cosmopolitan, and more adventurous than any other race the world has known, that in attempting to shut out any human beings from our shores and from the privileges of -.British freedom, we are doing a very extreme aet. It was once our boast that if the negro set his foot on our shores, from that moment he was free. We are, no doubt, under peculiar exigencies and under special local circumstances, reversing that great principle of British freedom and British refuge. experience ' of the thirty years, I think I am right in saying that public opinion in Australia, almost to a man, is determined that this country shall be free from what has been the curse of many other civilized countries. I do not think that any honourable member will charge me with trimming my sails to meet the current breeze when I know that the current breeze will not bring me in the right direction. But I confess that, while I do not feel so extremely on this subject as others, I am imbued with quite as strong opinions as to the necessity of reaching this goal as any honourable member in the Chamber can be. I hope that during the ages to come this country will always look to Britain as its fatherland. I hope -we shall never lose that proud distinction, which I hold to be a distinction greater than any in the w o r l d "" I am a British citizen."" But if I thought that we had to put in the scales, on the one side, the British connection with certain restrictions on our autonomous government, and the populating with South Carolinas many portions of the northern parts of the continent, and On the other side a disjointed empire, I would unreservedly make my choice. But this Bill is an absolute fraud. Government. honourable member for Wentworth is talking nonsense. inclined, in debating a subject, to shut out from myself the whole purview of that subject. We are told we must cover up our real intentions in this Bill, and must trust to refined diplomatic administration on the part of the (Executive Government. -sufficient experience of the flabby character oB Executive Governments in Australia during the last ten years to know that a Government is strong, determined, and lion-hearted in the extreme, so long as it is sure of a majority. But when Parliament meets, and when a section-and ' I do not refer invidiously to any section of the House, because in this matter the extremist belongs to all parties-bu t if , in view of this Bill being a comparative failure, as I believe it will be, there is an amount of agitation created by any section But, having had the of the existing Parliament, on which delast twenty or pends the majority and life of the Government, then good-bye to firmness and courage, and we have the Government as flabby as a jellyfish. It seems to me, especially in the case of a Government which extends its influence over such an enormous area, to be absolutely impossible, apart from what I have said, to administer this measure with sufficient judiciousness and sufficient firmness. We must recollect that we have not State Governments within moderate localities looking after State Bills of this kind, but that we have a country 8,000 miles round. In the administration of a Bill of this kind we have to trust to the executive authority exercised, not only by high-class men, but by inferior under-strappers ; and it will be impossible to exercise that judiciousness of mind which is so necessary in such a very delicate matter. Therefore, I say most distinctly that it is better for us, if we are to deal with this question at all, to put in an Act of Parliament exactly what we mean. AVhat we mean, in the view of all Australia at tbe present time, is that we will prevent any large infiltration of alien elements into the component parts of our national life, and that we will preserve purefor all time the British element with which we started. There are two modes by which this population may become infiltrated by alien elements, and one is almost as dangerous as the other. No matter what one's opinion may be on this subject, either in general or in detail, we all agree that there is an inherent power in the Government to keep out hordes of undesirable citizens. To take a very extreme illustration, if a shipload of lepers were attempted to be landed on any part of the Australian shores, the Government would have a perfect right to say"" Clear away from our coasts."" In the same way, if there were arriving large I have had numbers of Japanese, Chinese, Malays, or others coming in the particular mode to which I have referred, the Government would have a perfect right, as a Government, to say, "" You must not touch our shores.""

But the danger which has developed itself of late years is the slow infiltration of people in small numbers, which have become larger of late, and these people are gradually taking up positions in the midst of our civilized life. That process, if it goes on for a certain number of years-and what are a few years in the life of this nation ? will undoubtedly create a marked difference in the component parts of our people in Australia. I must confess that I was not so apprehensive of this a few years ago as I have lately become. W it h all my cosmopolitan views, I must say that many of these aliens are not nice people to be seen in the lonely bush of Australia. But we are asked to pass a Bill which gives the most drastic powers in one direction, but which, if it be workable at all, must be worked under the judicial ideas of an executive. The only way to meet this danger is not by compromise or half measures, but absolutely and boldly, and to say that these people shall not come at all. ber support that 1 support it . will get the chance. principle is-and -! do not generally play to the gallery-that the large majority of the people of Australia have said absolutely that these alien races must not enter our territory. In New South Wales a polltax of £ 1 0 0 was put on Chinamen. That was practically prohibition; and when we regard this question at all, we regard it as one of prohibition. Let us consider for a moment, after these general remarks, the details of the Bill. What does the Bill say We are to do ? The Bill is not merely drastic in one respect, but it is absolutely unfair and unpatriotic in other respects. It says, forsooth, that every man, not a regular resident, who comes to these shores may be asked to write out in .the English language a sentence or paragraph of 50 words. In the first place, we have British subjects, within 200 miles of London, who have never spoken a word of Englishi n their lives-Welshmen. We have also a similar population in Ireland, but only to a small extent. Then we have the French Canadians, who are some of the best citizens, of the British EmpireBu.tthe Bill will allow the educated negroof South Carolina to come in, while w& shut out our own fellow-citizens from Canada. How futile this will' be? We want to keep out the Japanese labourerWhy, Japan is becoming at present a highly-educated nation. English is being; taught in the schools there, and in a few years there will not be a Japanese labourer who will not be able to fulfil this test. It is not the educational test that is required -and that is the dishonesty of the B ill but it is the avoidance of race taint. W h a t is the good of our saying anything elsesaying one thing and meaning another ? . I , of course, feel that the work we have to dois a very unpleasant work. It is a work which every man must feel is only a matterof stern necessity, as is capital punishment in the case of a murderer. But if it is to be done, let us do it thoroughly, completely, and honestly. honourable member deal with our IndianBritish subjects? my opening remarks-and nobody can bemore seized of the difficulties and dangers of I will the position than I am-that-Av e are a component part of the British Empire, which ismade up of all sorts of races and classes of men. But the fact that.these difficulties, My arise, and that we are a part of the British Empire renders it all the more necessary at. this initial stage of our Commonwealth lifethat we should meet these difficulties straight out, face to face, and that we should tell the-' Imperial Government that although we desire to cling to the British connection for all time we must not be hampered by these conditions which arise out of our union with theEmpire. Furthermore,"" I deny that we have a right to put ourselves on the sameplane as either the Crown colonies or thedependencies of Great Britain. Great Britain has two functions to perform in a world-wide empire.

They have been the result of political and imperial evolution. To-day, if Great Britain as a Christian countiy which has led the way in humanitarianism all over the world, could without cowardice safely get rid of many of her responsibilities she would do so. But those responsibilities are there, and the British race will never shirk them. We have an empire created under conditions never before known in the civilized world. governing colonies connected with an imperial centre 12,000 or 14,000 miles away? Whoever heard of four millions of people at that distance connected with the parent country and having all the independence of autonomous government ? Here let me say that some reflections and remarks which were made the other night with regard to Mr Chamberlain were absolutely unfair and uncalled for. In one of the deputations which Mr Chamberlain received he said"" Gentlemen, we recognise the fact above all others that this is a voluntary union."" To-morrow, if these four millions of people in a constitutional way said to Great Britain"" We want to delete from our Constitution the glorious words ' under would say"" You can go. You are our own people, and we wish you godspeed in your destiny, though we are sorry to part from you."" quoting Mr Chamberlain ? practically quoting what Mr Chamberlain said, and what requires no quotation, because it has been the thorough understanding of that principle by the statesmen of England during tlie last 30 years, which has made possible the union of the British Empire. If it had not been for the slack hand, and the desire that the same self-government which Englishmen enjoy should be enjoyed by us within our own domain, if there had' been any attempt to interfere with it, Australia might not to-day be united with the British Empire. WhatI want particularly, and without any unnecessary repetition, to impress upon honourable members is that we have come to one question so enormously critical, so enormously far-reaching, that it must be settled in some way or other. It must not be settled by a crooked Bill of this kind, but Many of the in some way b} which the almost unanimous T wish of the Australian people will be fully carried out, because upon this question we are not speaking with an uncertain voice. Upon this matter all party spirit is dead, and Australia speaks with practically one voice. Therefore, I say, let us face thisquestion. Let us throw on the British Government the necessity of saying whetheri t is possible for us to deal with it in thisway or not. tlie shoulder. cumstances and conditions under which local, measures have been drafted and passed have no parallel with the position of this great Commonwealth Government to-day. Let us tell the British Government that we are confronted with a great difficulty, not arisingout of our connection with the Empire somuch as out of our position in these southern seas. Let us tell them that we do .not wantto do anything which will create international difficulties, and that we are strong to the death for our union with the old mothercountry ; but that this is a difficulty which we have, and which every man to-day in England, if he became an Australian subject, would also have to face.

24,Sir William Mcmillan,"I an*with the original British stock-bu t who if this Bill is carrier! out as it may have to be -carried out in order to secure its object, will be absolutely shut out. I am glad that the Prime Minister is present, because I took -down a remark of his the other day in which I must say he forgot the statesman and descended rather to the role of special pleader. In order to justify this absolutely impossible clause, which requires that every immigrant must be able to write in English, the right honourable gentleman saidThe reason for this provision is that if a man wants to come into an English speaking country to pursue his avocation there, the language which that people is concerned in his knowing, is the language which will enable them to do business with him. Surely that would be a retrograde movement on the part of the British people. The idea of our saying to every German, Frenchman, or other person of a civilized -countiy that the reason we keep him from our shores is that we expect -on all occasions to speak our language, and that a man is not fit to become a citizen unless he can speak the English language, -its very much like asking a man to swim before he gets into the water. How are -these people to know our language before they come amongst us ? How are the thousands of industrial people who carry on vine-growing and other avocations well known in Europe to come here if they have first to learn the English language? But this very test will be absolutely useless amongst some of the eastern people. Japanese who comes here will soon be able -to successfully pass this test in the English language. Let us look at what this provision leads us to. We have in our Constitution obtained power to enlarge the functions of government, but it seems to me that, in connection with many of the Bills going through this House, our particular function is to restrict the powers of other people. This Bill contains a clause by which, if a single undesirable immigrant is allowed to leave a ship which comes into one of our harbors, the master of that ship is either to lie bailed up to the detriment of his business or to pay a fine of £100. All this bears upon my point that if we are going to restrict the immigration of undesirable aliens we ought to do so straightforwardly, and to aim at the people whom we propose know grant under this Bill? Sir William McMillan. captain of a ship know whether a person can write fifty words in English or not? The measure throws the onus on the shipowner of mustering his crew, and if there be a single person missing-and we know how impossible it is to exercise any surveillance over men on board ship in certain places it practically says to the captain-""You r ship must not leave this harbour, and if you do not get securities or pay the fine you will be sold off, lock, stock, and barrel. ' 1 This is another instance in which we shall be doing an enormous detriment to the shipping and international relations of Australia. Let us go straight to our goal. We have to deal with the question, which is not one of our own seeking. It is one which depends upon our surroundings in this part of the Pacific. Let us tell the British Government that we do not intend under any circumstances to let these people come everybody into Australia. Let us tell them that it is not for us by superfine arrangements in a Bil l leaving everything to administrative control to pass a practically dishonest measure which means one thing and says another. Let us say not only that we are perfectly aware that our union with the British Government creates a difficulty that it is very hard to get over; but that we trust to the British Government to give us fair consideration in this difficulty. I may say this is not the first difficulty that will arise under the peculiar relationship that we Every have with the mother country. This is only the first of a series, and what I want to prevent is this : I want to prevent any Bill going before the Home Government which does not fully, honestly, and completely tell that Government what we mean. am sure we will all join i u heartily congratulating the honourable member for Wentworth on the excellent speech which he has just delivered. To me it has a ring of genuineness about it that I am delighted to hear from the opposite side of the HouseI sincerely hope that my honourable friend will assist the Government to carry out all that he has indicated. I am quite sure that if he is prepared to recognise this as a measure, not of party, but involving great interests to this nation, there is no honourable member who will not join with him in to hit.

There are a number of people who appear to think that this danger is not as great as it really is.

The remarks made by the honourable member for Wentworth have come to me with a very great amount of surprise, and I must say that I welcome them. The Government cannot do better than welcome the hearty co-operation of the acting leader of the Opposition. If I understand the policy of the Government, and if I understand the desire of the people of Australia aright, they are determined that Australia shall be kept free from alien invasion and contamination.. That being the case, the problem we have to solve is what is the best way to do it . The Government think the course they have proposed is the best, and the quickest way of carrying out I referred to that object at the present time. it is not a question of whether a man is an alien or not. tion of colour but a question of alienship. We have something like 800,000,000 Chinese and Japanese, within easy distance of Australia, from whom we have to fear contamination. The question we have to decide is whether we are prepared to take steps that will immediately put an effectual stop to the inroads that are being made i u this direction. Are we prepared to adopt the absolute prohibition suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth, and to That indicate to the Imperial Government that we are determined that that prohibition shall take place, and are prepared to take all the consequences? There was no occasion for the heroics into whicli my honourable friend worked himself in referring to the relationship between Australia and Great Britain. If the Parliament and the people of Australia are unanimous, the Government of Great Britain will be prepared to meet us, and to indicate even in the faintest degree that there is an)thought of separation seems to me to be altogether unwarranted. The honourable member for Wentworth indicated that Mr Chamberlain from his remarks, at any rate, was prepared to meet any request One has only to that came from Australia, and to talk about separation in view of that fact seems to me to be altogether unnecessary and unwarranted. I rejoice to think that the interests more directly represented by my honourable friend are prepared to meet the be seen in demand that is being made for a white Australia. I found when I went to Northern Queensland that the commercial and banking and manufacturing interests met me with this statement"" You need not trouble about the Kanaka; that problem will settle itself. It is the Chinese and Japanese that you have to fear."" On making closer inquiry I discovered that the Chinese and Japanese were fast beginning to make inroads upon the interests of these very people.

There is from this section of the House one by the honourable member for Melbourne may, without presumption, congratulate the Ports in regard to the conversion of a number acting leader of the Opposition upon the of people on the question of coloured immispeech he has made to-day. It seems tome gration, because of the ramifications of the that he not only stated the position taken coloured races having extended of late to a up by the majority, and undoubtedly the much greater degree than was the case only large majority of the people of Ausa short time ago.

45,Mr Watson (Bland),"I think that a good deal in the contention put forwardliving we think necessary, in order that our people may be brought up with a degree of comfort, and with scholastic advantages which will conduce to the improvement and general advancement of the nation, some pause must be made in regard to the extension of the competition of the coloured aliens generally. Another aspect of the question is that in the northern parts of Australia, both on the east and on the west coast, we find that coloured people have gained more than a footing-the y have practically secured control. Tn the northern parts of Western Australia the pearl fisheries are being run with coloured divers, and large numbers of these men-Malays and other coloured aliens-ar e still being imported nnder contract to work as divers upon the pearl-shelling grounds. I do not say that these men are allowed to overrun the State; but they have established settlements on the coast from which they work the fisheries. Sir them from working the fisheries three miles off the coast. within the three-mile limit. there. from landing and making the shore a base of operations, and the probability is that if they had no base from which to work, our white people could compete ' successfully against these coloured aliens. It is because these men can use the Australian shore as a base that they are able to work the pearlshelling even beyond the three-mile limit. landing. prevent them from having a base in sufficient proximity to enable them to carry on the industry. Then, on the Queensland coast, we find that Thursday Island is to-day a coloured ssttlement containing the most heterogeneous mixture . of races it is possible to conceive. We find, too, that the Japanese, Javanese, and various other coloured peoples, have been coming to the mainland of North Queensland in such numbers as would, I think, be most alarming to the minds of the people if they thoroughly understood how far this immigration is proceeding. The honourable member for Kennedy reminds mc that since the affirmation by the Queensland Government of the treaty which was arrived atbetween the British and Japanese Governments, the number of Japanese in Queensland has increased within eighteen months, or two years by over 3,000. These figures, represent the immigration from one nation only, and do not include the Javanese,, Malays, Manillamen, and the hundred and one different kinds of coloured men who> go to make up the peculiar collection ot races to be found in Northern Queensland. Again, in the interior districts of.' the various States we find Afghans and Hindoos employed, some as cameldrivers, and some as hawkers, and in each instance becoming a menace to the people in the sparsely populated districts. I do not suppose that there is one man who* has not read of or experienced the troublethat these coloured hawkers give, especially where women and children are left-and necessarily left-unprotected , in the sparsely JOHN FORREST -We cannot stop settled districts. It is common knowledge that these men are not only insolent, but, actually threatening in their attitude towards women and children unless trade is. done with them. This menace has been brought under the notice of the police, no shell and in some instances action has been successfully taken against these hawkers. All these things go to show the dangeithat confronts us, and the necessity for some definite action being taken. It is said by some of those who object to legislation of' this sort that, while we may be justified in keeping out Chinamen, Japanese, Manillamen, Malays, or Assyrians, we have no justification for attempting .to keep out of Australia the coloured British subjects of His Majesty the King. I would direct the attention of people who think in that way to the fact that the British Government today admit the power of this Commonwealth and of the people of Australia to differentiate between Indian British subjects and white British subjects, because they themselves differentiate between them. The British Government do not think of putting the Hindoo or any other native of India upon the same plane as the people of the United Kingdom. The ground I take is that the natives of India are British subjects and subjects only, whilst the people of the United Kingdom are citizens as well, and British subjects in Australia are citizens also. That constitutes a wide distinction. I do not",23,Select Committe E On Coinage Drawn Tlie Position Of South Africa And The

50,Mr Watson,"It would, at all events,believe that the British Government will object to our restricting or preventing the influx of Indian subjects into this Commonwealth, but if they do object it will be for them to treat their subjects in India as on the same plane as other British subjects, and give them local self-government. They -will not do that, and I do not think they would be justified under the circumstances in doing it ; but the mere fact that they have not so far extended it , and that the people of India are subject races, governed by the British people, owing to their superior intelligence and powers of organization, justifies us in expecting from tbe British Government treatment different from that accorded to the subjects of British India. Coming to the Bill itself we find that it is framed on the model of the Natal Act, and I am bound to say that while I appreciate the difficulties that appear to confront the Government, I cannot agree with the methods by which they propose to deal with this question. The NatalA c t was, I admit, the outcome of a series of negotiations with the British Government, but as indicated the day before yesterday, in connection with another matter, there is, I think, a considerable distinction between the position occupied, in regard to negotiations with the British Government, by a single State, or single dependency, and that occupied by a federation of States such as the Commonwealth of Australia. Consequently we can quite understand that where the British Government might not agree to go the whole distance with regard to restrictive legislation of this character passed by a single State, they might take a different view and be much more liberal in their treatment of proposals coming from a body like this, representing such an important section of the British Empire. I do not think that the Natal legislation has been efficient. It is a pity that the Government have not been .able to obtain tlie return I moved for some weeks ago, because it would have shown what the experience has been in connection with coloured immigration during the five years preceding and the period succeeding the passing of the New South Wales Act. ternal Affairs) 1 haveendeavoured to obtain tlie information, and, if the honourable memmember know how many of these were ber will permit me, I will tell him what I returned immigrants? have received. I have obtained returns from Victoria and Queensland only so far-that admit, is a difficulty. I take my figures is, returns of alien immigration to Australia^ during the five years between 1896 and 1900 inclusive. Victoria can supply only the figures showing Chinese immigration and emigration, but Queensland gives all the particulars asked for. In Victoria theexcess of Chinese immigration over emigra-tion for the period referred to was 1,297: In Queensland tlie number of coloured persons admitted during the same period, including Chinese, Polynesians, Japanese, Javanese, and other Asiatic races was. 13,399. Tbe departures numbered 9,401, thus leaving an excess of immigration over emigration of 3,998. I will show how these figures are made up. I have delayed laying the information on the table owing to want of particulars from the other States; but I have a return showing, the number of coloured aliens admitted into Queensland from 1896 to 1900. It appears that in the five-year period the increase of Chinese in Queensland was 753 as against 1,297 in Victoria; the increase, of Polynesians was 1,926 increase of Japanese, 847 ; decrease of Javanese, 132 r increase of other Asiatic races, 604, showing a total increase of 3,998, of which something just under one-half were Polynesians. That is all the information I have received up to the present time. very interesting in itself, but, unfortunately,, it does not touch on the main question to which I was referring immediately before the Prime Minister gave the figures. I was. urging the desirability of having figures toshow the experience under the Natal Act, as passed in New South Wales, Western Australia, and, I believe, in Tasmania; but these figures, it appears, are not available. I have been able, however, to get some figures with reference to Western Australia from the beginning of this year. That State, I believe, has only recently begun to differentiate, for statistical purposes, between coloured people. As I mentioned, incidentally a few nights ago, when this, matter was under discussion, the information from AVestern Australia shows that during the first three months of the present year, there was an increase in coloured",24,Select Committe E On Coinage Drawn Tlie Position Of South Africa And The

New South Wales-as to Tasmania, I do not know-that the Natal Act has not been efficient; and I am convinced, further, that the Bill proposed by the Government, if passed in its present shape, will not achieve its object. That is the whole -objection I have to the Bill. I quite .sympathize with the object of the measure, but I contend that under its provisions it will be possible for a man to pass the .examination and still be one of the most -objectionable immigrants imaginable. We know that education does not eliminate the -objectionable qualities of the Baboo Hindoo. versities in America now. -Oriental, as a rule, the more he is educated the worse man he is likely to be from our point of view. The more educated, the more cunning he becomes, and the more able, with his peculiar ideas of social and business morality, to cope with the people here. I do not think there is any advantage in restricting the admission of -coloured people to those who are educated ; and, in any case, I contend that the number which will filter through under the Government's proposal will still be -sufficiently large to constitute a great menace to the well-being of the people .as a whole. Then, it is undesirable, to say the least of it, that we should attempt to place any' bar in the way of white people, as is proposed by the Bill. We know that many uneducated white people, are proved later to be valuable colonists. I am not now speaking of one particular race as against another, but we can at least say that Great Britain has benefited to a very large degree in the past by the steady invasion by a portion of the more northerly European races, which has been going on during many centuries. That invasion has helped to build up a national character which is unique, and which certainly is in no way inferior tb that of any other European nation. W it h this experience behind us, it would be an error to pass any legislation which would place a bar in the way of immigration from ' other European nations, so long as that immigration does not get beyond reasonable bounds-so long as immense hordes do not come over. Whilei t continues merely in driblets of people of an enterprising character, who wish to make a better living for themselves than there is a chance of their doing in their own countries it would be a mistake to interpose a barrier. AVe have room for every man who has a standard of living equal to our own, and whose general tone is. in no way inferior to that of our own people. We have room for all such in Australia, and I for one would be slow indeed to put a bar in the way of their coming -here, unless, of course, it is shown that we cannot achieve our object in any other way. But I contend that it is possible to achieve our object in another way. I believe that we can get passed the provision of which I ' have given notice ; and here I would like to say that I do not intend to press the latter -part of the amendment, which has reference to Pacific islanders, the Government having given notice of their intention to deal with this in another Bill. My proposal is to insert a sub-clause (a) in clause 4, prohibiting the immigration of any person who is an aboriginal native of Asia or Africa, and I believe that the Colonial-office will not be likely to reject a Bill containing such a provision. .If the Colonial-office authorities are likely to reject such a Bill once, I do not think they are likely to reject it a second time. If , however, as some honourable members contend, the Bill is rejected a second time, then, as I said yesterday, the sooner we understand what our powers are, and how far this autonomous government with which we are supposed to have been endowed is a reality or how far it is a mockery, the better it will be for all. While I entertain no manner of doubt as to my proposal going through, if it be carried by this and the other Chamber, it is highly desirable that we should thoroughly understand our position in regard to our powers for the preservation of our own interests. It was suggested that, owing to an amendment of the character I have indicated, the B ill might be postponed for an indefinite period while negotiations are in progress, and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked what was going to happen in the meantime.

It is no use having one door open and a few locked. able member. When considering the possibility of this legislation being unduly delayed, I was endeavouring to regard the case in its worse aspect from my point of view. My contention is that we are not likely to have any undue delay-that there is no probability of the Royal assent being refused-whe n it is understood that the people here have definitely made up their minds in favour of legislation of this character. I regret to notice the absence of some provision dealing with the importation of labour under contract, and I have indicated an amendment dealing with this phase of immigration. In America, there has been legislation of the kind I suggest in force for some little time. I notice that 13 z one of the Melbourne newspapers is attempting to make merry over the probability of a bishop brought from England to govern one of the denominations here, or a professor I did not make that for a college, being stopped under the proposed clause. But, so far as such cases are concerned, I am quite willing to make exemptions. Mr O'MALLEV -Such people are stopped in America. follow Americai n a slavish way in this matter. My objection to the importation of labour under contract is that the people engaged have, in very few instances, a proper knowledge of the conditions which obtain in the land to which they are coming, and where they have to live until the expiration of the contract. This, of course, does not apply to University professors, or other people in the position referred to by the newspaper. In regard to the ordinary I am afraid there is very working man-the labourer and artisanthis position does apply, and it is to prevent such people being imposed on, and binding themselves into slavery in ignorance, that some such clause as the one suggested should be passed. Of course, if the agreement be abrogated, and these people are protected from the consequence of their ignorance while away from the Commonwealth, I have no objection to their coming in as immigrants. My desire is that some limitation or restriction should be placed on the wholesale importation of men, such as even now is going on in New South Wales. In that State we find that Chinese have been imported under contract, and we are told that in F i j i lately, the Colonial Sugar Company have imported a number of coloured people from India to take the places of the white mechanics hitherto employed in the sugar mills. Quite recently we learned from a report in the London Times that 50 Russian carpenters are being brought out under contract to Australia. In each of these instances there is ignorance prevailing as to the conditions obtaining here, and it is necessary that the interests of these people should be safeguarded in the manner I propose. I do not desire to detain the House at any further length upon this point. I think that the Bill as introduced is ineffective. The method adopted is a roundabout one, and, although if we could achieve our object in no other way I should be prepared to go in that direction, I think there",26,Select Committe E On Coinage Drawn Tlie Position Of South Africa And The

Further, we have to live under the conditions which will obtain here in thefuture. Consequently, we say, with a human parasite preying upon the people the utmost respect and with every confidence that our desires will be given ear to, that we wish these people to be prevented at all hazards from coming within the confines of Australia. Mr O'MALLE Y (Tasmania) I desire first to congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth upon his grand democratic speech. I am glad to say that it has knocked the bottom out of all the kinky methods adopted in this Bill concerning the forth to the big cities, and settle down to educational test. I am glad to be able to feel with the honourable member for Melbourne' Ports that we are united upon this question. I am pleased that the House, as the mouth-piece of the people, so shortly from the peorjle, is going to be united upon the greatest question which ever came before tralia. I will take another point. The leader a nation to solve-on e of the problems of the age. If the Australian people had only lived in the southern states of America-^as I have-and had seen tlie dire results of the present mingling of the Africans with the whites, they would put their feet down and say"" We are going to profit by the terrible mistake of the American people, and we are not going to leave it to posterity to solve such an unholy problem."" There has been a great deal of talk about the rights of the British subject. But I hold that tlie Commonwealth of Australia should not be called upon to give more rights to a black man in Australia from India than the Government of the United Kingdom extend to him themselves. There is a vast difference between a white man in Australia and a black man in Calcutta. The people of Australia are citizen subjects, but the people of India are subject citizens. They do not govern themselves, and I think that this distinction was splendidly drawn by His Excellency the Governor General at the recent banquet. We need not go any further. I wish to point out that the educational test proposed in this Bill will The bishop will simply live upon the people. keep out the labouring people. It will keep out a million Canadians if they want to come here-me n who are splendid farmers but who cannot read English. YetI am sure that His Majesty would not like to lose them from Canada. But from my experience in the EastI can assure honproposed will not shut out the Japanesei f they desire to come to Australia. It will not shut out tlie Indian"" t of f "" who becomes of the country. It will not shut out the intellectual Afghan. We have more to fear from the educated coloured people than from the ignorant coloured people, because the latter will not attempt to mingle or associate with the white race. My experience in the southern states of America is that a first class education disqualifies the black people for any kind of workwhatever in the line of industrial creation. They at once go live upon their wits just as some white men do. That class of people will not be shut out by the proposed educational test. It s adoption will only add to the great volume of the parasitical element which is now sucking the life-blood out of the worker in Ausof the democratic party said that he did not want to shut out bishops or preachers. I want to shut out both preachers and bishops if they are not prepared to settle in Australia, to grow up with the country, and to assist in developing it . In the United States of America there is an Act called tlie Alien Act. When they built the great Roman Catholic college in Washington and engaged clergymen in Europe and various other parts to send out there, one of the leading' cardinals of America said-""We will have American clergymen."" "" No,"" was the reply, "" we want to send out men who will teach the young American abnegagation and submission according to the ideas of Europe."" The new clergy were met at Castle Garden, and tlie authorities told them that they were aliens and would have to go home. They went home. Why should a foreign bishop or preacher be allowed admission to Australia any more than a foreign labouring man 1 The latter will go forth to hew the forest, tunnel the mountains, build bridges over the rivers, and create something for the people. In fact he is the pioneer for the clergyman and the bishop. He is the first who should be shut out if he is not an Australian. Then again, let us look at the Chinese merchant. Does the proposed test shut out the educated Chinaman, who is the very worse man we can have in the community ? I remember when the Chinese drove the servant girls out of California, and when all the farm hands cleared out because they could not compete with the six Chinese companies. How did it wind up 1 It wound up by all the little farmers selling out to the big men and leaving the countiy. Then the big men engaged Chinese from the six companies which bossed tbe show. Then, if any man said one word against those six companies, all the Chinamen would be called oat on strike, and the squatter or big agriculturist or fruit-grower could not get a Chinaman to go to his place or to pick his fruit, and there were no white labourers left. Then the Californian people for years and years called upon the United States Congress to shut out the Chinamen. I heard the late Henry Ward Beecher say that God made America for all nations and all people. "" L e t them come,"" he said. "" O h come ye to the waters, our wine and milk we will freely give to all your sons and daughters."" That is all very fine coming from the pulpit. But when tlie people of the Pacific slope persuaded certain members of Congress to visit California they dropped tbeni down in the Chinese dens, and left them there for a night. The result was that the Congressmen went back to Washington and passed a law shutting out the Chinamen for twenty years. All sorts of means have been tried to exclude John Chinaman, but he gets there just the same. They cannot shut him out. With all due deference to the Prime Minister the proposed educational test is absolutely absurd. I know that the right honourable gentleman means well. I know that the Government mean well, but they are only human. ber is divine. Mr O'MALLEY -There is something in that.. As I know that other honourable members desire to speak, I merely wish to add that I am pleased the honourable member for Wentworth has upset this show today. I am going to assist in getting into this B ill a clause providing for the absolute exclusion of undesirable aliens. No danger will result from such legislation, because the men in Great Britain are sensible. Lord Chatham declared on one occasion that 13 z z if he had been in America he would have fought with the Americans. The American and Canadian rebellions have shown Great Britain that it is folly to interfere with a free people when they are determined to struggle for their rights. The British people are sensible upon these questions. We are here upon a continent set apart by the Creator exclusively for a Southern empire-for a Southern nationand it is our duty to preserve this island continent for all eternity to the white race, irrespective of where they may come from. day, I had the honour to present a petition in connection with this Bil l from the Australian Natives' Association. That petition set forth the sentiments of tlie native-born Australians, and prayed this House, as speedily as possible, to pass into law some measure -nhich would have the effect of keeping Australia white. Those exact phrases were not used, but they convey the meaning and sentiment of the nativeborn of Australia. It was, therefore, with more than ordinary pleasure that I listened to the deliverance of the honourable member for Wentworth this morning. His manly style and straightforward utterance must give pleasure to those who have long felt that Australia is in serious danger from the influx particularly of coloured aliens. I must candidly confess that I hardly expected such a deliverance from the honourable member, and I am the more pleased to find that I have been disappointed. Whether or not the proposals of the Government are sufficient to carry out what we have in view remains to be seen. That those proposals are not such as the Government would under other cir-. cumstances have put forward I verily believe. They are proposals put forward because of the necessities surrounding our Imperial connection. We were told by the Prime Minister, when introducing the Bill, not in so many words, but certainly in effect, that that so far as his Ministry was concerned, they would be just as strong in their desire to exclude aliens as the honourable member for Wentworth himself would be, and that they were equally desirous of preserving Australia absolutely white with any other honourable member. The Prime Minister pointed out, as he had a right to point out, that in consequence of our Imperial connection and the difficulties that are likely to arise in regard to British subjects, it",27,Select Committe E On Coinage Drawn Tlie Position Of South Africa And The

Speaking fov myself alone I would infinitely prefer to adopt the method suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth, and state in the Bill, in a straightforward manner exactly what we want to do. We want to exclude absolutely every kind of coloured immigrant. Let us put that desire on the face of the Bill and ask the Home authorities to support us. The test must come some day as to which of the two great powers, so to speak, is best able to say what is proper for whether on the one hand the Government of Australia or, on the other, the Imperial Government is to have that right. For my own part I think there can be no doubt as to which of the two is the better qualified to speak, and to speak authoritatively. having a full knowledge of the alien question, and of Australian public sentiment, those who are able to appreciate the danger of these vast hordes, should they be cast loose; those who are in touch with the feelings and aspirations of Australia ought to be best qualified to say what is most suitable for Australia. come sooner or later, and when it does come, we want it to come in a way that will provoke the least possible friction. In a matter of this kind, where the internal administration in connection with a matter which does not extend beyond tlie limits of the is in question, we have the best right to make our views heard, and the best opportunity of making I have referred. cussing day, some forward for excluding I was delighted to see the proposal carried which was then put forward, but I think that in connection with this Bill we shall be on very much firmer ground in taking the stand, that I hope we will take, in excluding these undesirable immigrants. honourable member for Wentworth that the Bill was absolutely a fraud. I do not know that that is so. It may be that it will prove to be ineffectual in its operation. It may be that the educational test, perhaps, will not be sufficient for the purpose in view. honourable member I fear that will be Mr Hume Oook. so, but I wish to emphasize the fact that the Bill is what we are forced to take because of the conditions which surround the subject, and it is not what we our ourselves would desire. As to the educational test it is just as well to be reminded that the Japanese and others, particularly Indian subjects, are quite able to pass that test. Those are the very races, above all others, that we desire to keep out of Australia. The Afghans, the Cingalese, and Japanese are amongst the least desirable citizens of Australia. They do not enter upon the productive works of tlie country in the way in which European alien Australia; races do. For the most part they content themselves with hawking goods in the country, or taking menial occupations in the towns and cities. The hawking element has been descanted upon this morning, and every honourable member who has been in the Those country districts knows ful l well to what an extent that trade has been mopped up by the Afghans and coolies; he knows, too, what a dreadful scourge those men have become in the back blocks of Australia. But they can all pass the educational test. There are universities in India where the coloured subjects of the The test must King receive as good an education as we can give to any of the white subjects of the K i ng in Australia. Some of these menI have met some of them myself-ar e mathematicians of the highest, order. Some of them are scholars of repute. We have had instances of some of them entering the Commonwealth Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and passing all examinations there with credit to themselves and the country to which they the test to which belong. In such cases the educational test When we were discan be of no use at all. It must be abthe Postal Bill the other solutely worthless. In addition to these similar proposal was put there are others who do not attend unicoloured labour. versities, but who nevertheless receive a very good education. The Japanese particularly are adopting a method of education, not merely with respect to literary subjects, but with respect to technical knowledge, which threatens to be a serious menace to AusThe tralia. Forty or fifty years ago the Gersaid mans went into the manufacturing towns of England, and made contracts with the best artisans they could secure among the trades it was proposed to establish in Germany. Those engagements were made for a certain number of years. The men Like the received extremely good wages. They went to Germany and taught the Germans the English methods and English arts of manufacture. Profiting by that example, the Japanese are doing precisely the same thing. They are engaging workmen of the best class to go to Japan and enter technical schools and colleges, as -well as manufactories of various kinds, in order to teach the Japanese British methods of manufacture and production. Therefore, in a very short time we shall not only have these persons educated in British literary subjects, but in British arts and manufactures, and then that contract labour, to which the honourable member for Bland has referred, will be a much more serious question to us than it is to-day. These men, educated in British methods, having a f u l l knowledge of the manufacture of goods calculated to sell in the markets of the Commonwealth, will be imported here under contract, at very low rates of wages, to compete in our own markets in the manufacture of those goods which hitherto have been exclusively made by our own people. There are two kinds of education going on in Japan, and many of the people of that country could pass the education test provided in this B ill ; so that to that extent the Bil l will not help us. I should very much prefer to provide some other system more straightforward and more explicit in the body of the Bill, and let the Colonial office take the responsibility of saying that Australia does not know what she wants, and that it will not let her have what she asks. The test has to come. Leti t come in such a manner that the whole support of the people of Australia will be behind the proposition. On the subject of a white Australia there is scarcely a white citizen within the confines of the Commonwealth who would not support the proposition embodied in the amendment by the honourable member for Bland. To return to the question of contract labour. I think one other effect of the proposition to exclude labour under contract may be to preserve us from some of those ills which have happened to the American people in connection with their citizen communities. As honourable members know, there are quite a number of towns in the United Statesi n which German, Spanish, Italian, and French is spoken, but not the British language. I would welcome any class of European to Australia, provided he floes not establish himself in citizen communities and provided he speaks our tongue, acknowledges our institutions, and assimilates with us. But I cannot and will not welcome to Australia large numbers of men who will band themselves into bodies, speaking their own particular tongue, still honouring their own institutions, merely making a convenience of Australia in order to obtain a living, and then, when they have acquired a competency going back to their native land. That is what is being done to a large extent by the Japanese and others. It may also be done by alien European races. I therefore think that the proposition made by the honourable member for Bland, if carried into law, would tend to restrict the establishment of these citizen communities, alien in language and aspiration to ourselves, and further tend to make those men become Australian citizens, assimilating with us, acknowledging our ideals and aspirations, and working with us to those ends. I have already said the test must come some day or other. I feel that tlie Empire as a whole is interested in the preservation of the union of Australia. Great Britain does not want to see the Australian Commonwealth go to tbe wall. If she wants anything at all, it is that this young nation that she has seen come into being shall be strong and successful in its competition and in its race with other peoples of the world. For the safety of the Australian nation, for the good of her national life, we require that Australia shall be white. Do honourable members think that Great Britain does not recognise our aspirations in this regard, and that she will not grant us what we want 1 If it is put to her, as it ought to be, that for the safety of the union it is necessary to exclude alien coloured labour, Great Britain will not refuse to do what we ask. She is already well aware of the sympathy which all Australia entertains with regard to the affairs of the Empire; she knows f u l l well that with respect to any matter with which she is Connected, Australia is with her heart and soul; and when Australia makes this demand for her preservation, for the solidarity of the British people, for the successful establishment and the carrying on of a British nation in these southern seas, she will not refuse it . Therefore, I would have no hesitation in placing in the body of the B ill the proposition made by the honourable member for Wentworth, and saying that it is in the interests of Australia that no coloured native of India or Africa shall ever come witain the confines of the Commonwealth. think the Ministry stated a few days ago that they were prepared to put in force the inherent power which the Crown possesses to stop the immigration of aliens, pending the passage of legislation by this Parliament. It struck me at the time that that was a mistaken course. I do nob think that any compulsion should be initiated by the Government, except on the authority of Parliament. When the great case of A h Toy v. Musgrove was decided it was very clearly laid down in opposition to the preponderance of legal opinion, at all events, up to that point, that there is an inherent power in the Crown to prevent an alien from landing. alien is stopped from landing, he has no right of action in British courts to enforce the payment of damages for trespass. A t the same time, however, it was as clearly stated that for the Crown to exercise against friendly nations that latent prerogative would give a justifiable opening to international remonstrance. 1 therefore thought that a Government which is so careful about international complications that they actually take up an Immigration Restriction B ill which has been shelved at home, and endeavom to persuade Australia to pass it, should be sareful to hearken to an expression from the judicial bench which fits in with Imperial authority as regards not angering the susceptibilities of other nations. I know vtry well what Mr Chamberlain has in his l-jnd in regard to his desire that the colonies should have-althoug h the Imperial Parliament may not pass it-a n Immigration Restriction Bill. laid it down in a despatch which, I think, was sent in 1898 to the colonial Premiers, that what he was considering was the Japanese susceptibilities ; that Japan appeared to be, of all coloured nations, the one that was strongest and most friendly with the United Kingdom; and that it was, therefore, inexpedient that Australia should by any legislation offend, to use his own words, "" Japanese susceptibilites."" There is no doubt that the ground of objection taken in England is that the principle of exclusion ought not to be based on colour. The right honourable Mr Chamberlain expressly stated that in 1897, at the Premiers' Conference in London, and he somewhat softened tlie objections to coloured labour that were up to that time held by Australian Premiers. A t the meeting that was held in Sydneyi n 1896, it was decided by the Premiers of the various colonies that the principle of the Chinese Restriction Acts should be applied to all coloured labour, and a Bill was introduced into the South Australian Parliament, and I believe into the New South Wales Parliament, extending the principle of the South Australian Chinese Restriction Act of 18S8 to all Asiatics, with very few exceptions. ThisB ill passed the South Australian Parliament, and I believe also the Parliament of New South Wales, but when it was sent home, Mr. Chamberlain withheld the recommendation to the Crown that assent should be granted pending the holding of the Premiers' ConferThat is to say, if an ence, and he subsequently got the B ill disallowed. He then explained to the Premiers that the natural desire of the Australians to exclude undesirable immigrants could be attained, as far as Asiatics were concerned, by adopting the principle of the Natal Bill, and he also stated at that meeting-appar ently contradicting what was implied from his statements as regards the Asiatics, that the desire of Australia was to exclude colour -that the true principle of exclusion was not colour, which would affect 200,000,000 or 300,000,000 of His Majesty's subjects, but that the right of exclusion should be exercised where immigrants were dirty, or paupers, or immoral. It seemed to me when I read this speech of Mr Chamberlain's to the Premiers, that it was about as egregious a piece of political cant as one could very well conceive. The idea that a man who was dirty should be excluded was absurd-as if a ship's bath could not cure him of He clearly any objections that might be urged against him on the ground of want of cleanliness. So far as men being paupers is concerned, we have to recollect that some of the best men-me n of enterprise, men of intelligence, men through whom the British Empire has become what it is -lande d on these shores practically "" stone broke."" They were not what we know as paupers within the meaning of an Act of Parliament, but there were very few men who landed here, stirred by a desire to take part in the development of this' great country, who landed here with more than a few pounds in their pockets; and are we going to leave it to some subordinate officer of the Executive to determine what degree of poverty shall afford justification for the",29,Select Committe E On Coinage Drawn Tlie Position Of South Africa And The

Is this immorality to be commercial immorality -and is this stipulation to come from a country which has recently passed through a series of commercial crises which have not been specially marked byan3'displayof commercial morality ?

It is not always the woman "" who minces ""virtue and does shake the head to hear of pleasure's name,"" but who, as' the poet ' tells us, often "" goes to't with a more riotous --appetite,"" who would be excluded by such legislation. But the unfortunate, who, male honour, or who, being endowed by nature with a too great flush of -womanly susceptibility has in a weak moment yielded to male importunity, and, without permanent blemish of mind, has sustained irreparable injury at the hands of man. To talk of making immorality a bar is to give utterance to a piece of nonsense, and to suggest something that is utterly impracticable, but which might, at the same time, have the effect of stopping a considerable number of intending immigrants from coming here. There is no doubt that the lain's mind was the colour question, and that he contemplated our acting as a catspaw for him, because the Imperial Bill that was introduced in 1898 was not passed by the Imperial Parliament, but was opposed by some of the most powerful sections of the press as leading to nothing more, if I remember aright the words of the Spectator, than an additional staff of inspectors at various ports. Though this matter has been shelved at home, Mr Chamberlain, having been in communication with the Premiers of Australia previously, is now desirous that we should act as a kind of : 1901.] Restriction B ill . 4643 catspaw in reference to this matter. He does not wish to offend Japanese susceptibilities by raising the colour question.; but the question is whether we are to subordinate our undoubted desire to prevent coloured immigrants from coming into Australia to the exigencies of Empire, as expressed by Mr Chamberlain. This is a very big issue, but the question he has raised is whether our desire to make colour the basis of rejection shall be subordinated to the desire of the Imperial Parliament to consider the susceptibilities of the coloured races, and in the first place of that coloured race which is now armed to a point which entitles them to some consideration among tlie nations of the world. There is another But how on earth are we reason which actuates some British statesmen in their desire not to offend Japan or even China. There is about £300,000,000 of British capital invested in China. Two-thirds of the trade of the Yangtse-Kiang region belongs to England, and according to the statistics of 1896 about 80 per cent, of the trade of the river ports is English, and these are matters of course, which have very great weight with the Imperial authorities in considering tlie expediency of assenting to Australian legisperhaps, trusting too much to lation against the coloured races. I do not really think, however, that the Imperial Parliament will refuse to assent to any legislation that we may pass on this subject. Mr Chamberlain never said that the final assent of the Crown would be withheld ; but he seems to have got over the Premiers, who were engaged in a round of festivities at the time of the Jubilee celebrations, and some of whom were knighted, or had other honours conferred upon them. A t all events, the Premiers of the various States, who had decided to ' make colour the line of distinction, immediately backed down, and represented that the desire of the Australian States could be attained by the means suggested by Mr Chamberlain. I cannot give the exact text of their minute on the subject, but that was its effect. I quite agree with those who say that wo ought to protect ourselves against an invasion of the lower races. I do not think there is much danger to be apprehended from this source just at present, notwithstanding the statistics of the last four or five yearswhich have been given by the Prime Minister. If we take the statistics from 1859 up to the present time we find that tlie number of Chinese within the Commonwealth has shrunk",32,Select Committe E On Coinage Drawn Tlie Position Of South Africa And The
71,Matter That Really Affected Mr Chamber,"considerably in Victoria from about 44,000 to 12,000, and that during tlie whole period the numbers have been gradually declining. In 1888 the s.s. Afgliam, came to our shores with 268 Chinamen on board, and it was owing to tlie refusal to land in Victoria about 60 Chinamen on board who were in excess of the statutory number allowed to be carried by the steamer that the celebrated case of A h Toy versus Musgrove arose. The people of Australia were' then frightened that we were going to be overwhelmed with Chinese, but the experience during the last 50 years has shown that these aliens have always come here in flushes and the true statistics of the increase or decrease of these races amongst us are to be found in a comparison of succeeding periods of ten years. To take the figures of any period for five years would be quite misleading, as it will be found that by taking the period from 1885 to 1890, there was an excess of immigration into New South Wales, whilst in the following five years up to 1895 there was an excess of emigration over immigration. On the whole, the-number of Chinese amongst us is gradually declining, and I do not believe there are 12,000 in the whole of the States as against 45,000 in 1859.

A t the same time. I am prepared to put upon our statute-book a provision which will really face the substance of this question and exclude coloured aliens. I in its generic sense, to cover Kaffirs -and have only been talking about the unnecessary others. What was objected to was that timidity of Australians with reference to an invasion of the black races. In the future there may be greater danger. The superstitions which have for ages kept the Chinese at home, and which would not permit them to leave their bones in a foreign country, are gradually being weakened, perhaps under the influence of Western civilization. Until recently the Chinese would not allow mining to go on in their country because they thought that if they dug down more than 30 feet the spirits of their interred ancestors would be disturbed, and evil spirits come up and give them trouble. It was a religious principle among the Chinese that they should go home to die; and by some extraordinary process they seem to have entertained the same antipathy to leaving their bones outside their own country as did the Greeks of old. Even that form of patriotism, however, is now weakened among the Chinese, because we find that they are settling themselves permanently in parts of America and in the Straits Settlements. We have the testimony of the late ProfessoiPearson and others that, during the last 30 years, there have been indications of the weakening of those superstitions which have prevented the Chinese from becomingthat is due to permanent residents in a foreign country, and an increasing tendency to settle abroadUnder these circumstances, we must makecorresponding provisions against the probable pollution of the higher race in the only part of the world in which the higher white civilization has an opportunity left to develop itself. Professor Pearson points out that if we allow the northern parts of Australia to be open to the immigration of coloured races, we shall reduce the rest of Australia to the same position as the Cape found itself in owing to a similar operation being allowed in the case of Natal. The reason given by the Government of My figures are intended Natal for the introduction of this measure was different from that alleged by tlie Government here. What Natal objected to was that the immigrants from India were of the very lowest type. There were negroes in Natal already.

The objection being on the ground that the immigrants from India were of the lowest type, it was thought that the best test to apply would be the educational test, as the one that would prove effective. But in passing this legislation, the Natal Government did not go to the stupid length which is gone in the Bill we are now discussing.

This question was raised in South Australia by men entitled more than I am to speak on behalf of Germans-me n who were born in Germany and represented German constituents. I have represented a constituency, half the electors of which were Germans, and I know the degree of dissatisfaction with which the exclusion of German immigrants by means of this educational test, was met. I do not think that, at this stage, I am justified, especially after the excellent speech of the acting leader of tlie Opposition, in dealing more elaborately with the Bill.

92,Mr Glynn,"I will accept the Primetaking up a B ill which was opposed by the British press, and which, when introduced in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, was not proceeded with. TheB ill does not deal broadly with the question of coloured labour, and the Ministry ought to have the courage to tackle the question generally. most other honourable members who have spoken, I am of opinion that we should aim directly at the object we are striving to attain, and not try to achieve it in a rounding classes. We find men agitating on the about way. We are all agreed that the object we are striving for is to keep out the Asiatic, and I wish the B ill was also directed to keeping out the Polynesian. My warm support of the Government during the election campaign was given because I believed their desire was to maintain the purity of the race on this' -continent; and I believe the Government are still in earnest in the matter. This question is far more important in the eyes -of Australia than the Tariff, or any other -question we are likely to discuss. The Tariff another Chinese den we found al large quantity -question may interest Victoria and New .South Wales, and in a lesser degree the -other States; but this is a living and burnscribed as being in a fearful state of decomposiing question throughout the Commonwealth. My support of the Government is not so strong or so loyal that I can remain behind them if they are going to make a retrograde movement in this matter. I have heard the condition of affairs in (Queensland referred to in this House and at public meetings -outside, but I have not gone about the citv of Melbourne with my eyes shut. I have seen tbe canker spot in every part of Australia. I have visited ; and while it may be true that we have a more polyglot population in Queensland than there is elsewhere, and that in the public schools there we may see almond eyes and brown or half-brown complexions, we need not go outside Melbourne to see a similar state of affairs. I recognise tlie importance of the commercial and industrial competition which these people are bringing on us, but to my mind there is a much more serious aspect of the question. There is the maintenance of the purity of the race, which is more than threatened, and I believe there has been too much apathy and indifference in some of the Statesi n regarding the question from this point of view. Otherwise we would have had a much more active crusade against this class of labour than even we have to-day. I have authorized returns from various parts of Queensland, which go to show that there has been no exaggeration in the statements made. It cannot be unknown to honourable members and to the public generally, that wherever the Asiatic congregates or hordes, there we find insanitary conditions. Unfortunately I have to accuse those who are, perhaps, the most active in the crusade against this class of labour, of being amongst those who most actively support its continuance. I refer to the workplatform for the exclusion of the Chinese, and yet these men are amongst the best customers of tlie Chinese' hawker. If these people only knew what they were buying from the Chinese, their dealings with them would fall off considerably. I have here a newspaper account of what was reported by the medical officer of Townsville:Some of the Chinese oystermen in that town kept boxes of the luscious bivalves lying in slimy mud, with a stream of sewage trickling round and through the boxes to fatten the oysters. In of festering fish lying in trenches exposed to the sun, and undergoing a process designated by the occupier as "" preserving."" These fish are detion. What is true of Townsville in this regard is also true of Little Bourke-street and other Chinese quarters in the various cities of the Commonwealth. A few weeks ago I moved for a return which would show the influence the presence of these aliens have on the health of the community. The return I desired was one giving the number of lepers segregated in the various lazarettes of the Commonwealth. I have not yet received the return, but I have here figures showing the number of lepers who have been treated in the State of Queensland, and they are sufficiently alarming to convince us that, on this ground alone, there is reason why no time should be lost in dealing, not only with the Asiatic, but with the Polynesian. It is only since November, 1892, that lepers found in Queensland have been segregated in the lazarettes of that State. We have now in the Queensland lazarettes 10 Europeans, 14 Pacific Islanders, 6 Abbrigines, and 1 Chinesea total of 31. The patients who have died in the period of not quite nine years since 1892, are 11 Europeans, 27 Pacific Islanders, 3 Aborigines, 9 Chinese, 1 Malay, 1 Philippine, 1 Madrasee,",35,Malcolm Mceacharn Bu T Ship Saving Of Labour To The Extent Of 700 Per
93,Mr Wilkinson (Moreton),"Like-and 2 Singalese; and, in addition, 10 Chinamen were sent to their own country. The total number of patients segregated in Queensland since the establishment -of the lazarettes in 1892, is 96. -am perfectly satisfied that had the same amount of supervision been exercised over the alien races in the other States of the Commonwealth as the democratic party in Queensland have forced the Government to exercise there, the dread scourge of leprosy would have been found to be more widely distributed than has appeared in other parts of tlie Commonwealth. I wish to emphasize the fact that those Europeans who have contracted this dread disease have led as cleanly lives as most of us. The disease has not come to them through any immoral relations with these people, but through their dealings with them. Some of the individuals who contracted leprosy have moved in high circles. In one particular case, of which . I know, a gentleman occupied for a considerable time a leading position in a provincial town in Queensland. occupied rooms in a leading hotel, never appeared at the table without gloves, and thought he was suffering from some common form of skin disease. But a new doctor who had some knowledge of leprosy came to the town, diagnosed his complaint, and informed him that he was suffering from lepros3 . That opinion was confirmed T by others, and in the interests of tlie community the patient surrendered himself to the authorities, and is now, I believe, in one of the lazarettes in Queensland. I mention this case, painful though it may be, to show that this complaint is not confined to the working classes ; that it may invade the highest and most exclusive homes, and infect the wealthy as well as the humbler ' classes of the community. I feel more strongly upon this question than upon any other question that is likely to come before this House. I would not support for an hour any Government which I thought was going to palter with this evil, because I know the dimensions which it is assuming, not only in the State of Queensland but throughout the whole Commonwealth. W it h regard to the possibility of our attempting to grasp too much and thereby losing all, I wish to say that I believed, when advocating the union of these States, that we were going to get a larger and more complete measure of self-government than we formerly enjoyed. It is a painful surprise to me to find that we are to subordinate our desires to what we may call the exigencies of Downing-street. I do not know that we have any warrant for believing that I Downing-street will dare to set their opinions in opposition to the expressed will of the people of the Commonwealth as voiced by their representatives in this Federal Parliament. A t any rate, we should go straight and give them the opportunity of saying whether or not they agree with what we have done. We shall then know exactly what to do. far we are to govern ourselves. ing these views it gave me very great pleasure to hoar the address delivered by the honourable member for Wentworth. It confirmed the belief which I have previously expressed that 75 per cent, of the members of this Parliament were determined that this matter should be dealt with in no shilly-shally manner, and that we He should declare in favour of reserving Australia for the white races. I wish to say a few words in regard to the educational test which is prescribed by clause 4. I am very sorry indeed that the Government have deemed it necessary that the test should be the ability to write 50 words in the English language. I have had perhaps as good, if not better, opportunities of knowing the value of the services which the German and Scandinavian races have rendered to Australia, as have most honourable members. It might be thought that because a very large number of the settlers in the constituency which I have the honour to represent are Germans and Scandinavians I am making somewhat of an electioneering speech. That is not so. I have come to this Parliament prepared to express my honest convictions, supremely indifferent as to whom I offend or whom I please. I know it is not the intention of the Government that any invidious distinction shall be raised between the European races, but I am also .aware that these people will take umbrage at the condition which this Bill imposes. If we are desirous of having the assistance of these people we should not prescribe such conditions. I have seen their homesteads cut out of the jungles and scrubs of Queensland, where scarce another man had the heart to go.

If there be any departure from that policy my allegiance will be to the policy and not to the men responsible for it. My desire is to know that in whatever little part it may be iny lot to play in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, I have given a vote to preserve Australia for all future time to the best races of the world and not to the servile races of Asia.

L . Solomon. I read many of his pamphlets upon the exigencies of the situation at tlie time he was conducting his anti-Chinese crusade. That was when the desire was awakened in me that Australia should be reserved for the Australians. Nothing could have given me greater pleasure than the speech of the honourable member for Wentworth, to which we listened this morning. I trust that in committee Yesterday the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V. L . Solomon, congratuunderlated me upon having made the Government climb down. I am going to congratuthe Government as with their late myself upon having made the honourable member for Wentworth climb down. Only tlie day before yesterday that honourable member interjected that this was only skirmishing. My reply was that I was very sorry the honourable member was not skirmishing in the front rank. NowI am pleased to say he is not only skirmishing, but fighting in the front rank for a white Australia. I compliment him upon having seen the error of his better ways so soon, and upon having joined the fighting line. It is one of the greatest surprises which I have had since I have been The civilization to which we have a member of this Parliament. There are, however, some dangers ahead of him in regard to the Kanaka Bill, which can be referred to at the proper time.

The Bill, however, is not aimed at people who are willing to work under the same conditions as the rest of the white men of Australia. Every one knows tlie difficulties and dangers ahead of this measure, and I think that half a loaf is bettor than none. If we find that this Bill is not efficient it will rest with ourselves to make it efficient. It rests with this Parliament to make it operative if we find that as it stands it would not be operative, and I am sure that there is sufficient intelligence-if not, as some honourable members think, on the Government side of the House, at least on the Opposition side-to do that. so at the last general election. might alter the position. after another general election. some honourable members seem to stick pretty tight whether they are anchored or not.

Therefore, there is the same old cry, COOK -And honour our "" Go west, young man, go west;"" and out west the young men go. The Japanese and other eastern races, however, are following them there. They have gone out west as storekeepers. One honourable member said he was very pleased to see that the interests represented by the honourable member for Wentworth were coming round to the cry for a white Australia. They are coming round because it is affecting their own pockets. These coloured aliens are entering into competition with them. They are opening up stores in towns in Western Queensland. They have their own merchants on the coast, and they deal exclusively with one another. That is why the interests referred to wish to see them done away with. I am anxious to do all that I can to get rid of these aliens and keep our race pure. Every man knows what happens when coloured races get in among us. They at once bring the white races down to their level, instead of rising to the level of the whites. Those who do raise themselves to the level of the whites get as cunning as foxes, and, notwithstanding our laws and our detective skill, they beat us at every turn. For that reason, if for no other, I would assist any one, no matter what his political opinions were, to rid Australia of the curse. What do we find as to their vile eastern diseases?

The price offered was so low that no white man would take it. The consequence was that a sparkling subadur went up with a new shipment of Hindoos full-blooded bucks from Bombay-who one-twentieth of the lowest rate for which a white man could do the work. That is another reason why we desire to get rid of these aliens. competition with the white worker, but with the white storekeeper, and it is because of that fact that we polled such a solid vote in Queensland for a white Australia.

I contend that there is no' ground whatever for assuming such an attitude as that described, and whilst we have men in public positions who are ready to make such excuses for the introduction of coloured aliens and for countenancing their immorality, I think it is the more necessary that we, as a Commonwealth, should deal with the matter speedily and effectively. so long as the Kanaka is there the white women are not safe. Kanaka is not so bad as many of the other races. In some of the western towns of Queensland, one can see people of all colours -black , brown, brindle, tawny, and all sorts of shades-and it is impossible to tell what race they belong to, but they are not Kanakas. So far as the Hindoosi n Natal are concerned, I have had a little experience of them. I saw them there in 1879-80, when they were being brought in in ship-loads. It was not because there was any scarcity of labour, but because the Kaffir would not work for the wages that were offered on the sugar plantations of the lower Tugela River. These Hindoos came in at such a rate that the Government did not know what to do. A t first they fostered these men and engaged them on the railways, where they held every position but those of masters; but the day of retribution was not very far off, and the Government were very sorry, before they introduced the Immigration Restriction Act, that they had had anything at all to do with them. We do not want to repeat the experience of Natal. We can see what is going on here in the absenoeof the necessary restrictive legislation friend who has just sat down-and I hope in this direction, because we are now having Afghans dumped upon our shores. These men, after landing in Victoria and finding that there is no employment for them here, will make their way into Queensland, where they will be welcomed with open arms. If some honourable members would only read the unbiassed reports that have recently been published in the Melbourne Herald, upon the conditions surrounding the sugar industiy in Queensland, and see the light that is thrown upon the alien question in all its worse phases, they would have no hesitation whatever in voting in favour of keeping this Commonwealth white. The desirabilitythe necessity-of a white Australia is one of the principal planks in our political platform in Queensland, and we started out on the hustings to stand or fall upon this question. I think it was the honourable member for Parkes who suggested that we should have a Royal commission appointed to inquire into the whole matter, but I would ask what better Royal commission we could have than the referendum vote that was given in Queensland on 30th March last. The answer given was most emphatic, not only by the block vote of the whole colony in connection with the Senate elections, but also by the divisional votes recorded in the election of members to the House of Representatives. The sugar districts from Carpentaria to Rockhampton returned Mr Bamford as a strong antiblack labour man. He told them straight out what he meant to do, and the man who opposed him, who was in favour of retaining black labour, was rejected. Coming down the coast, we have the honourable member for Wide Bay, who is another labour man, and in every case the opinion of the people has been most emphatically voiced in favour of the exclusion of black labour. In connection with the Senate elections three labour men topped the poll, and if that result is not sufficiently emphatic I do not know what is wanted. l a m very gratified that the Prime Minister has grappled with this subject in spite of all opposition. I know engine-drivers, guards, or stationas well as a good many honourable members that the wires have been pulled for all they are worth to t r y and get the Prime Minister to trim on this subject, but I thank God that he has remained firm and that he is going to help us to fight for a white Australia. he will allow me to call llim my friend in the truest sense-ha s a robust and direct manner which has secured for him the respect and admiration of the House, and we know that at all times he speaks with true sincerity and with very f u l l information.

113,Mr Knox (Kooyong),"My honorablethe primary and the principal danger to be feared in connection with alien immigration is to be looked for from the Japanese and Chinese and other similar races, and not from the Kanaka. The latter may constitute a big danger, but it is a manageable danger. other is a danger which is insidiously growing into the life of northern Queensland, and which will have to be dealt with cautiously, but drastically, and, I hope, thoroughly. I am one who appreciates, as I am perfectly sure every other honourable member appreciates, the magnitudeof the consequences which underlie the operation of this measure should it become law. The possibility of complications is very great, and I sympathize entirely with the Government in the course they have proposed, although, as I interjected earlier in the day, I believe in straight-out issues, without subterfuge ot any nature whatever, being placed in measures which come before us. I was therefore pleased to hear the words which fell from the acting leader of the Opposition, though they showed a somewhat novel departure in one who is usually so judicial in his utterances, and one who is fully aware of the difficulties which surround the situation, but if the Government will adhere to the educational test as the one which they believe to be the best under the circumstances, I for one shall support them in the endeavour to carry that principle through. declaration on that point.

Reference has been made to the health conditions under which people live in North Queensland. I made it my business when I was there, and by means of communications since, to ascertain what these conditions really are. I am informed that the health conditions above a certain line are such that children born there of parents who are engaged in ordinary work-and I think the honourable member for Maranoa will support me-ar e not anything like so strong as the children born in cooler latitudes. medical men, and particularly of one medical man, who speaks with authority on the subject, and who is absolutely opposed to the introduction of this alien labour. His idea is that a race of Australians, if forced to do heavy work the climatic conditions which prevail in Northern Queensland, will breed children who, in a large percentage of cases, will have ailments incidental to tropical regions ; and, further, that if there be a continuance of this work the third generation will not breed at all. I saw children suffering from iimernia and other illnesses incidental to such climates, and I take it-althoug h I know the honourable member for Maranoa looks at this from a different point of viewdistrict, and in the hottest part of that area, that if the work these men have to do be increased the evil I have indicated will also be increased.

The honourable member for Maranoa, who is always direct, and, I believe, is always just, the difficulty in which the Government find consider our made reference to the Hambleton plantation. A most honourable and skilled gentleman is in charge of that plantation, and to suggest that he or the company he represents, would wilfully lead visitors to suppose that there is a condition of things which does not in reality exist, is, I am sure the honourable member will admit, most unfair. On the contrary, the conditions of labour and thearrangements at that mill are such that it would be impossible to re-adjust them simply because some visitors were coming. Itwould dislocate the whole of the company'sarrangements; and I may here say that I made a personal examination in order tosatisfy myself as to the conditions underwhich the Kanakas there live. week. soon as the session is over. session is over. remain here. I did observe that there were Japanese engaged at that mill, who in my judgment were doing work which could have been effectively done w it h out any detriment to their health by white under men. There is a class of labour in that country which the white man cannot do if"" he is to sustain his fibre and strength, but. there is another class of work, however, which is performed by Japanese, Chinese, and Hindoos, and which I think ought to be done by white men.

By all means let us accept it , and help the Government to deal with this very difficult question. I could not help thinking in listening to this debate how very quickly public opinion has advanced upon this subject within the last few years. I have just been thinking that it was within these very walls that the late Professor Pearson uttered those words of warning, that were hardly regarded at the time, but which he afterwards reiterated in his very interesting work, National Life a/nd Character, which have attracted tlie attention of statesmen in all parts of the world. I have a vote for the district which 1113honorable friend, the last speaker, represents, and perhaps it is appropriate that, following upon his heels, I should indicate that I am watching him. The honourable member puts his points clearly, honestly, and straightforwardly, and no man can mistake what he means. If Australia has any national question, this is it. 1 recollect a passage from Proude's Oceana, of which I was reminded when I heard the eloquent speech of the honourable member for Maranoa. I looked it up, and I find that Froude prophesied that, because Australia has no national question, we shall have no men of first-class distinction. He saysWo have our national concerns to look after and our national risks to run, and therefore our thoughts iind anxieties are enlarged. They have none of those interests; their situation does not allow it. They will have good lawyers among them, good doctors, good men of science, engineers, merchants, manufacturers, as the Romans had in the decline of the Empire. But of the 'heroic type of man, of whom poets will sing and after ages be anxious to read, there will not be so many, when the generation is gone which was born and bred in the old world. Such men are not wanted, and would have no work cut out for them. The speech of the honourable member for Maranoa, has convinced me that there is still room for great and heroic characters within the bounds of Australia. I sincerely hope that as he has been in the old country, and has been convinced by his experience here of the need there is for legislation of this character, he will be able to transmit to his descendants to all generations the importance of keeping Australia for the white people. I hope that no. attempt will be 14 A 2 made to make party capital out of this matter. There have been some indications in that direction. I am proud to see that all parts of the House seem to concur in the view that we should t r y to keep this continent, which is almost the only temperate part of the world that is available for settlement, exclusively for the white races. The Government are to be congratulated upon their promptitude in bringing forward this measure. ThoughI differ from them as to the particular means to be adopted for accomplishing our object, I must say that they have acted in a laudable manner in endeavouring to lessen the difficulties which confront the Home authorities in the settlement of this important question. The Home authorities have their difficulties. I am quite sure that no honourable member wishes to increase them. A t the same time, looking ahead, I do think that we shall create more difficulties not only for ourselves, but for the Imperial authorities, if these undesirable immigrants once get a footing in large numbers within our bound? aries, than if we keep them without our boundaries. out our boundaries under this Bil l as it stands. every one will credit the Prime Minister with the best determination to keep Australia white in accordance with his promise. A Bill of this sort was before tlie Yictorian Parliament a few years ago, and on that occasion I resented the tortuous, indirect manner in which the Colonial-office dictated to the colonies in the past the direction in which they should carrj' this legislation. We were told then that Victoria could not pass a law of this sort. There is some force in that objection. By herself Victoria would not have sufficient weight to legislate against the influx of Asiatics. But what about the Federal Parliament ? Is the Federal Parliament to be still in leading strings, as the different State Parliaments were? Are we to be hampered and told from another part of the world what is best for us, and what are to be our interests ? I want to know where we are.

I do not believe that in the mother country they will ever refuse to sanction the enactment of legislation which is put in the direct form in which the amendment proposes to put this legislation. Probably honourable members have heard of the story of little Lord John Russell. Sixty -years ago the coast of Australia was not so well defined by the British authorities as it is now. A t that time, when there was no Sir John Forrest to monopolize and appropriate all Western Australia, which is one-third of the continent, the story was told that the French Government wished to get a foothold in Australia. The Ambassador of Francei n London was instructed to call on the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Lord Russell, and to ask him which part of Australia it was that England claimed. The Ambassador saw Lord John Russell, who was a little man. In the room were a stool and a long ruler. Lord John Russell, in answer to the question put to him, mounted the stool and drew the ruler right round the map of Australia. ""That, sir,"" he said, ""is what England claims."" If the British Ministry in those times refused to allow even the Frenchmen, with their genius and with their high ideals of civilization, to appropriate part of Australia, we are equally justified in refusing to allow Asiatics to invade our shores. comparison between the two cases. able member another instance then. The Marquis of Salisbury, who ife the leader of the Conservative party in the House of Lords, has within the past three years assented to the principle which we are now trying to establish. which Parliament in 1898. Of course no one will attempt to press the analogy to the extreme with regard to Lord John Russell and the Frenchman. But I wish to point out that the very principle we are asking for was affirmed by the House of Lords, although the Bill containing it was not proceeded with in the House of Commons owing to lack of time. On 23rd May, 1898, the Earl of Hardwicke brought in a Bill for the exclusion of undesirable aliens. It was carefully debated, and the Marquis of Salisbury spoke in favour of it . As usual, the Marquis of Salisbury gave as his reason I for doing so the narrow view that the unrestricted admission of aliens threw more burdens upon those who have to pay the rates. Of course he always looks after the ratepayer particularly. In the speech in which the B ill was introduced it was shown that in England undesirable aliens, such as Polish Jews, were increasing in number each year. The honourable member for Parramatta in forms me that if they had in England the same proportion of aliens that we have here, they would have a million. I find, here, that when in 1898 they discovered that they were adding to the number of aliens in England they brought in this Bill to restrict immigration. Lord Hardwicke, in moving the second reading of the Bill, saidAVhereas for six months in 1894 the total was 19,400, or an average of some 3,200 a month, the figures for four months in this year are 14,500 odd, or an average of 3,800 a month, thus showing a monthly increase of over 600 for this year as compared with four years ago. Therefore, because there was this immigration of aliens into England they chose to bring in the Bill. into account the emigration. House to understand that these figures arc net.

137,Mr Higgins,"Lord Hardwicke saidI n the most conservative assembly in the w o r l d t h a t reason was adduced, and w h y on earth should we not pass this B ill for the same reason. L o r d H a r d w i c k e continuedThe first thing, my Lords, that the newlyarrived alien with his wife and family-the alien is usually married-does , is, not unnaturally, to seek a lodgement, and this he must do in a quarter where other aliens are living. He finds every house full-house s always are full in the east end of London-and he thereupon proceeds to offer the landlord u little higher rent than his English tenant is at present paying him. The noble lord, after referring to the in creased and ver y excessive rents obtained for these places, proceededWell, my Lords, to revert to the alien who has just arrived with no means of subsistence, and with his wife and family, he has succeeded in getting a lodging, but how is he to pay the rent ? He must obtain work at any price, even at a rate considerably below the standard current in the district, with the all too probable result of oustexamination to be physically sound, and ing some English labour, and generally lowering the standard. But that is not enough to meet the demands for rent and living. The standard of life also has to be lowered, and the newlyarrived alien is able to live in a way that no English working man or working woman would consider decent. He proceeds to take in lodgers, and rooms-frequentl y a single room-alread y overcrowded by the alien and his family, are still moreovercrowded by the inclusion of two, three, and more lodgers. This brings me to another point. It h in k t h a t we ore free from any race antipathy ; that we feel in regard to these peoplewhether their skins are black or coppert h a t if they only had the same standard of life which we have, we would be glad to have them by our side. There is no question of racial hatred. The Polesi n London are Polish Jews.

Conversations with any of those people affectedand I have spoken to English Jews who are equally affected-convinc e one that their complaints are not prompted by any race hatred, but by a sense of personal loss incurred through the habits and actions of a group of people; and were these people English the feeling would be exactly the same. TheB ill was supported by the secretary of the Board of Trade-(the E a r l of D u d l e y ) w h o saidThis increased foreign immigration is undesirable Commons is an unworkable machine and both from an economic and social point of view. It is undesirable economically, because the competition between British workers and workers of this imported type is not an equal one. The latter can live upon a wage, as my noble friend has said, upon which an English workman would starve, and the result, therefore, must be either that the British workers are driven out of those employments which are affected by this competition altogether, or that, in the case of the women workers, they are forced to supplement their earnings from other sources. Then the E a r l of Dudley went on to say thatEven the strongest advocates of free-trade would, I should think, hardly contend that free trade principles should be pushed to the extent of driving certain sections-larg e sections-of our working classes into pauperism, or worse, and of replacing them by foreigners of a very low and degraded type. He referred to the AmericanA c t , w h i c h excludes a man if he is not found upon even compels such men to be shipped back. Of course the usual arguments were raised against the proposal-argument s such as have been used continually against the Factories Act here-in regard to sweating in the clothing trade, namely, t h a t if it were stopped it would prevent a means of outlet for the woollen manufacturer of England. L o r d Herschell said :The fact that the clothes are made here has the effect, almost certainly, of causing a larger manufacture in this country of the materials from which the clothes are made, and the materials for example with which the clothes are sewn.

Hes a i d It appears to me that this legislation is wise and desirable and I shall certainly support my noble friend for this reason : that the number is increasing of those chargeable to the rates.

I am sorry it was ever suggested by the Colonial office. It does not reflect credit r upon that office, or upon the Natal Government for adopting it , and I really felt it, very much against my grain, when the matter was discussed in the Victorian Parliament, to be a party to a piece of hypocrisy. As regards the suggestion that the method provided in the B ill prevents difficulties, it seems to me that instead of preventing it creates difficulties, it accentuates and intensifies the difficulties, because as has been said during the debate, the difficulties are a thousand times greater if we have the Japanese and other foreigners within our boundaries than when they are outside our boundaries. I do not like a good deal of the argument which has been used in tins matter with regard to morals. I hope we are not going to indulge in the hypocritical attitude of saying that we are more moral than the Chinese. From accounts received from those who know the Chinesei n their own homes, there is no doubt that they are more moral than we are. I want to dissociate myself from the point of view of those who would make out that we are more righteous than our neighbours. The morality of the Chinese is great in their own associations and in their own homes, where they have the traditions of their race and their own families about them. But when they are shifted from their moorings, and come amongst a race different from their civilization, then comes the hotch-potch and the mixture. Have honourable members seen the vices of the mixed races as they appear in San Francisco? I have been through the dens of San Francisco, and of all the sights I have ever seen, I have never witnessed any more degrading or filthy than those. in Melbourne. ' best part of the city of San Francisco is taken up by the Chinese quarters. They have about 50,000 Chinese there, and it is the peculiar effect of the mixture of the two civilizations which we have to deplore and avoid. I am quite willing to admit that in their own associations the Chinese are as good as we are, but it is only as long as they It is quite true there stay there. It is when they come, not to bring family life with them, but when they come chiefly in large numbers of males into a country, where they seek gold by hook or by crook, that the clangers of contamination and evil are very great indeed. I shall not occupy the attention of honourable members very long, because in these second reading speeches, when I see that the House is really of one mind in regard to the main object, and that it is a mere question of detail as to the way in which the object is to be attained, I do not think there is any occasion for long speeches. I think this is a critical time, and we ought to act at once. members look at the geographical position of Australia, they will see that we are just near the centre of disturbance in the world.

The fact is that the European powers are, for their own purposes, stirring up a beehive in China, and when that beehive is thoroughly stirred the bees will come out and we shall be stung. It is a veiy cheap and a very easy thing for the European nations to stir up matters on the east coast of Asia, because they will not feel the effects. But as soon as that great swarm of bees begin to move it will first of all move here, as this is the place of all others to which it is likely to come. Those Chinese who have come here have carried back with them the information that Australia is a good country, that they are able to get plenty of good land and to live in peace-as long as the larrikins will allow them--and that they are able to carry on trade, and unless we put some restriction upon them they are bound to come here in very large numbers. China, but also in India, that the people are beginning to acquire new notions. When was in India a few years ago I was told by one of tbe B-ajahs that if they travelled over the dark waters they would, in the next transmigration of souls, become asses, and they did not want that to happen. However, I believe these ideas are gradually being broken down, and we have to fear an influx from all the eastern countries. I Want to prevent tbe Empire from being dragged into complications arising out of this coloured race question, and it is because of that that I desire to see steps taken speedily for the purpose of preventing these people from coming to our shores. The honourable member for Kooyong referred to the unsuitability of the climate in the northern part of Australia to the constitution of our white people. I understand that the honourable member thinks it will be impossible to develop the north of Australia, except by means of coloured labour. I think it always wise to treat one's opponent's arguments in their strongest and best light, and in a f u l l and fair way; and I think there is the strongest evidence that, just as in India, we cannot expect children to be so healthy in tlie northern parts of Australia as if they were brought up in more temperate climates. I will assume that the northern Australia will be totally unfit for white men to settle in. That is, perhaps, going too far, but I would sooner see northern Australia unused and undeveloped for a generation or two than have it peopled with Asiatics. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The unsuitability of the climate in northern Australia for white labour only applies to those following agricultural pursuits. that even at tlie very worse, if it means that we are to leave that part of Australia undeveloped for a time, and confine our exertions to the development of the rest of the continent, that consequence should be faced with complacency for tlie present. The difficulty is to get rid of these people if we once allow them to obtain a footing on our shores. We have only to look at the great difficulty which is being experienced in America in connection with the greatest racial trouble ever known in the history of the world, in order to take warning and guard ourselves against similar complications. I have not lost faith in the inventive powers of our It is not only in race. I do not think we have come to the end of our inventiveness or resource, .and my experience is that when a want is felt, the inventive faculty is exercised to meet the difficulty. If there is gold to be won in northern Australia, or if there are desirable lands to be cultivated, no matter what the difficulties may be, they will be met by the resources of civilization, and the northern part of Australia will be developed in all good time. gold that is being carried on in New Guinea at the present time. in which gold is being won in a place that is most unhealthy and which is infested with savage cannibal tribes. White humanity will go anjnvhere for gold-me n will go to the poles and endure the utmost privations, and they will equally go to the tropical regions and face disease and even death. The only question that remains for us to consider is the method by which we are to achieve our object. The Government have proposed a method which-withou t any offence to the Government, because I quite understand their reasons, which are very laudable I call the hypocritical method of requiring intending immigrants to subject themselves to an educational test, about which we care nothing. The other suggestion is that of the honourable member for Bland, that we shall have no African or other aboriginal natives introduced here.

155,Mr Higgins,"Yes. There is a case-words, but I think that even the honourable member's words must be altered to some extent. The question is which of these two methods we ought to adopt, and I have no hesitation in expressing my preference for the direct method. I say that, not only because it is direct, but because at the beginning of this Federal Parliament it is very important for us to know exactly where we are. I wish to know whether this Federal Parliament is to be dictated to, in the legislation which it desires to pass in the interests of the people, by any authority outside, because if it is it is important that we should know it . It is possible that, ignoring the precedent set by the 1898 Bill and the speeches made by the members of the present Ministryi n England, the Colonial-office will put its foot down and not allow this measure to go through. Although such a result is not likely, I should prefer to see even that occur rather than that there should be any doubt attached to our position. I think we should speak out plainly to the Imperial authorities, and that they should act straightforwardly towards us. One of the difficulties we had in the Victorian Assembly was that we were always told not to pass certain Bills in a certain form because they would be thrown out in another place. We had that sort of thing here ad nauseam; but I think it is our duty to legislate to the best of our judgment, and then if our action is not to be supported, the responsibility will not rest on us. I should, however, be sorry to think that the Acts which are passed in our first session would meet with the disapprobation of His Most Gracious Majesty the King, on the advice of any Ministry, and I hope the Government will give their supporters a free hand with regard to the method to be adopted in achieving the object which this Bill has in view. I feel that the whole House appreciates thehonesty of intention with which the B ill has been brought in, but Australians, with all their faults, are straight, and as they have spoken out plainly and indicated what they want in this matter, we should adopt what we think is the most effective means of accomplishing their wishes and allow the responsibility of thwarting us to rest with those who may be prepared to take it . no desire to enter into a general discussion of this question, and my remarks will be quoted from a despatch from the Secrebrief. The honourable member for Maranoa tary of State for the .Colonies to the was pleased to make a somewhat personal attack on me as being an enemy of a whiteAustralia, but I beg to tell the honourable member that I am as warm a friend of a white Australia as any honourable member here. I regard a general discussion of this question as almost useless, because I am perfectly sure that there is no representative in this Chamber who would dare to rise up and express himself as opposed to the idea of a white Australia. The people of the Commonwealth have pronounced for a white Australia, and I am here to give my utmost support to the effort of the Government to attain that object. The whole question appears to me to be one of method, and I think the debate might very well be confined to the discussion of the best means of effecting our object. The Bill presents one method which, although it is very cumbersome, would arrive at the object of excluding coloured people from settling upon this continent. A t the same time, it would exclude those of my own countrymen who cannot talk English, but whose mother tongue is Gaelic. We are, however, told that it is not intended to have that effect, but that the only way in which we can achieve our purpose is by a roundabout course. The difficulty I have mentioned could be got over by requiring intending immigrants to write out a sentence of any European language instead of a sentence in English, and I hope the Government will consent to such an alteration. The other method suggested is the straightforward one proposed by the honourable member for Bland, which commends itself to my judgment;-so far as I may regard myself as free to follow the plan that I should prefer. The question is whether we are free to vote for the straightforward method proposed by the honourable member when we remember the speech made by the Prime Minister, in which he informed us in very plain terms that the method proposed by the Government was about the only possible way we had of accomplishing the common purpose we have in view. If the Prime Minister will still state to the House that the method proposed by the Government is the only possible way, I shall be compelled to stand by tlie Government.",49,Malcolm Mceacharn Bu T Ship Saving Of Labour To The Extent Of 700 Per

I am perfectly well aware that English is being taught in nearly all the schools in Japan, because I have been there and have seen very intelligent pupils going through their lessons. One of the greatest difficulties I see is that the educational test alone is not likely to keep out the Japanese, who will very soon be able to meet in large numbers any test of the kind. better position if all the aliens that came here were educated, seeing that the question we are concerned with is the mixture of races 1 the educational test, which is simply a means to an end, and is a fraud in a way.

It must be evident to the Government, however, that we prefer the direct and straightforward way of accomplishing the purpose, and the Government might yield to the sense of Parliament, and allow us to pass a measure of the kind, and chance its being rejected by the Imperial Government.

170,Mr Cruicksha Nk (Gwydir),"I mayand I always have a strong feeling when I see our mother country becoming involved in wars with other countries. know why there should be this great desire to invade and get possession of the lands of other countries when we have such vast territories in our own States, unoccupied and unused. I desire to see tlie Government of the Commonwealth, with all the force and power at their disposal, enforce the principle of keeping speaking possessions for English-speaking people, and encourage and allow every other nation to have their own land, laws, and rights. I have travelled, about the world a good deal, and I have found that some of the most intelligent men, so far as languages are concerned, were probably Nubians, and native guides. I look on the educational test as a perfect farce. tralia might be populated with if only that test were to be applied. The honourable member said that it was difficult, or impossible, for Australian workmen to compete with Japanese, because of the fine work, the system of living, and the wages of tlie latter. I go further than the honourable member, and would not only not allow aliens the opportunity of competing here, but if cheap labour is employed in producing goods manufactured in other countries and sent here, I would impose taxation so as to make them taxpayers in the countiy in which they are going to sell their wares, just as I would tax the producer in this country, who has to depend on the same market. towns a system of Chinese and in Sydney, to a large extent, have taken possession of all the fruit shops. We daily see Australian men giving way to these newcomers, and becoming, I regret to say, in many instances dependents on the State. sible, Australia kept for the Australian and English-speaking race, and I would give similar rights to every other nation in regard to their lands. I like to see every class, every religion, every nationality growing up in its proper place, and each protecting its own rights and interests. I shall not live long enough, but those who come after me will see an Australian race, in the making of which a great deal will depend on this Parliament. great deal more importance to the alien who comes here as a resident to live with his Mr Cruichthank. wife and to bring up his family, than I do to the passing casual labourer. If we are to I do not have an Australian people, we cannot allow a system of intermarriage with coloured foreign races ; and if I were the power that be, I would not hesitate to say that Australia should be kept for a white race. I would encourage trade between all the different countries.

Probably to some extent it may be a revenue tax, but at the same time for Maranoai t mightencoiiragetheemployment of ourown people. I do not want any taxes very high, and I have never said I did. But my feeling is more in regard to the question of race. I should like to see the Australian people constitute the noblest and ablest race upon this sphere. What the race is to be will depend to a large extent upon our system of education, upon the legislation that is enacted, and upon tlie provision made for tlie comfort and well-being of the people. I rejoice that during the period in which I have been in public life I have consistently voted for any legislation which I thought would raise the conditions of living There is growing up in our inland for the masses of the people. P go still storekeeping, further, and advocate the exclusion from Italians, these shores of coloured aliens because their aspirations are impaired by traditional and hereditary bondage. There is no affinity between these people and Australians, and there never can exist between them any I would like to see, as far as poshealthy intercourse. I think that our united efforts should be directed to preventing our territory from being encroached upon by a class with whom it is unwholesome to intermarry and undesirable to associate, and who can never be incorporated into our common life without vitiating that future national greatness which is the very foundation of every patriotic Australian's day dream.

175,Aus,"Mr CRUICKSHANK I do not carethoroughly realize the difficulties of the Government in introducing a measure of this kind. A t the same time. I regret that they have adopted what I would style a backdoor method of accomplishing their desire. I much prefer the straight-out method of dealing with the difficulty presented to us. Of course, we are told that the Home Government will not sanction direct legislation of this character. point out that, within, comparatively a few years, the educational test proposed in this Bill will have become an absolute farce. The honourable member for Wentworth told us that within a very short time the Japanese will be able to pass any test in the English language. one which is changed from time to time ? majority of the natives of the Indian Empire wili soon be able to pass any test in the English language. I do not think that the Home Government would refuse to sanction direct legislation of the character suggested. Perhaps, because I am a young politician, I always believe in attacking any difficulty in a straightforward manner. horror of going round corners. I believe in lighting in the open, and detest crawling round to the back door. Of course, I recognise that if the Home Government did refuse to sanction the legislation which we pass, delay would be inevitable. That is the only reason which prompts me to favour the policy of the Government. If , by .reason of the Royal assent being withheld, several months were to elapse before legislation restricting the admission of coloured aliens could be enacted, there would be a very large influx indeed of these undesirable immigrants to our territory. It is better I think, in passing a Bill of this kind, to attack the difficulty from the front. referred to the Chinese and Hindoo hawkers. It must be admitted that the Hindoo hawker is a decided curse. A t one time these hawkers became such a pest that it was almost impossible for a farmer to leave his house with any degree of safety, as these hawkers intimidated the women into purchasing their wares. The only cure for this evil with which I am acquainted is to keep a pack of dogs, of which the Hindoo is very frightened indeed. Some honourable members have said that if we stop the immigration of aliens we shall stop development. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that it would be better to see the development of tropical Australia postponed for a generation or two, than to admit undesirable aliens to our shores. Of course, if we could settle these aliens in the tropical portions of our country and keep them there all might be well. But naturally they like But I would to get down into localities where the climate is colder. It is only to be expected, therefore, that once they gained a footing upon our shores they would come down and oust the white people from the more temperate regions. There is one provision in this Bill which I think will press very harshly upon the ship-owner. Indeed, I do not see how it can ever work. If a coloured man goes on board a vessel the I think so. A agent or captain of that vessel will have to ascertain whether he can write his 50 words of English from dictation. In reading the newspapers the other day I noticed that one gentleman was deputed to dictate a passage in English. This he did with such a brogue that no man could reasonably be expected to pass the test. It was a I have a mixture of English and Irish. The officer was asked if what had been read was English. ""Yes,"" he replied, ""and it is very good English too."" I trust that there will be some way of protecting the ship-owners. They ought not to have the responsibilibj' thrown upon them of ascertaining whether immigrants are really qualified to enter tlie Commonwealth or not. I recognise that under the present conditions we run a very great risk of being swamped by undesirable aliens, and I therefore hope that we shall insist upon preserving Australia entirely for the white man. It seems to me that this measure is debatable and non-debatable. We have been Some honourable members have fighting a kind of phantom, because we are all agreed as to the object which we have in view, namely, the securing of a white Australia. We find that there is really no opposition to that proposal, and it is very difficult indeed to fight a phantom. But there is after all very serious opposition to the best way, and I think it is the only effectual way, of accomplishing our purpose. We have been told by the Prime Minister, in no doubtful terms, that the only way of achieving what we desire is by adopting the indirect method provided by",52,Malcolm Mceacharn Bu T Ship Saving Of Labour To The Extent Of 700 Per

179,Mr Rona Ld (Southern Melbourne),"the language test. That is what we have 'to fight. I believe in the direct method, and am going to press for it . In -the first place it is altogether a bogy, a figment of the fancy of the Ministry, that the Home authorities will reject this measure in the event of our enacting direct legislation excluding coloured aliens from our shores. a knowledge to the contrary. timidated by a reference to knowledge which we do not possess. We are here as a jury to deal with the evidence which is before us. In the Postal Bill we have inserted a provision prohibiting the employment of coloured labour upon our subsidized mail steamers. There is no absolute certainty that the Imperial Government will assent to that Bill whilst it contains such the first place on the hustings and now in a provision. There is just as much likelihood that they will withhold the Royal assent from that measure as that they w ill refuse to sanction direct legislation for the exclusion of undesirable immigrants if it be placed in this Bill. adopt tlie heroic and straightforward method, and the method which is stripped of all cant. Let us tell the Home authorities that the Australian people are of one mind in regard to this matter. ThenI am sure that our object will be accomplished. It will be a very serious thing if we are intimidated by the threat of what may happen, by reason of the action of the Imperial authorities, if we do that which we are sent here to accomplish. We ought not to begin our legislative career by inducing the Home Government to frustrate our ambition. If they do that once, and we make it easy for them to do it , tbey will do it a second time. If we have to fight this matter, let us fight it now, gracefully, kindly, and without seeking to create disturbance or to put difficulties in the way of the Imperial Government. Let us make it quite clear that what we say we mean, and what we mean we say. The Prime Minister has assured us that this is the only way of accomplishing our end. It is an indirect way, however, and I cannot for the life of me see why we should have this hypocrisy. language test will really keep out undesirable aliens, and that it will serve the same purpose as the amendment which has been circulated with a view to keeping out all the aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, and Polynesia. If it will accomplish that, then it will.be known by the Home Government to have that effect. W h y not, therefore, say in so many words what we intend to do ? Why this hypocrisy ? There ""is no reason why we should have to resort to that kind of cant in order to placate the Home Government. The means by which we achieve our object is immaterial. We want to accomplish our aim. If this circumlocutory process were the only I refuse to be inway, then, as I desire to see these aliens excluded, I should be willing to accept it . I refuse to believe, however, that the Imperial Government will take tlie responsibility in the present position of affairs at home-and we do not want to take advantage of the present state of tlie old country-of frustrating the express wishes of the Australian people. That wish has been expressed in Parliament, and if we make it perfectly clear that we desire to keep this Australia of ours free and uncontaminated, I am sure the Imperial Government will not offer any objection. Let us do this in the interests Let us, therefore, of the Empire, and then we shall make it clear that there is no offence meant. I rather like the language test. I believe the day is coming when the great federation of the world will be a federation of the English-speaking peoples, and this proposal might be a very good means of achieving that end, by making the language test the right of entry amongst us. I can see perfectly well, however, the f u t i l i ty of it. It will not keep out the undesirable aliens. It has been shown over and over again that the very worse class of men we have to fear are the educated aliens. We have to fear them because they are adventurous, enterprising men. They come amongst us, and they are not the least undesirable because they are educated. Some ten years, ago an African man named Nero arrived in Scotland. He was a professor of a university in Africa""; a splendid scholar, a linguist of the very first order. He made his way into the churches, and into the hearts and homes of tlie people of the place. Yet he was the greatest fraud imaginable. He outraged the good feelings of the whole We are told that the society with which he was associated, and the Christian principles of those who had taken him to their bosoms. Still, he was an accomplished scholar and orator. The Prime Minister speaks about changing the standard, but we should want to get up early to create a standard which such a man",53,Malcolm Mceacharn Bu T Ship Saving Of Labour To The Extent Of 700 Per

We do not object to these aliens because of their colour. We object to them because they are repugnant to us from our moral and social stand-points. Here let me deal with the moral the Government have been attacked from pulpit in this city. It has been said that their proposals savour rather of Paganism than of Christianity. I want to say, however, that our intention in regard to these alien races is perfectly honourable, and that we have no racial hatred or antipathy towards them. We wish them well; we desire to do them good, but we do not believe that by allowing them to come among us we shall do anything to elevate them. often happens. Some pure-minded, noble woman marries some degenerate debauchee, with the hope of reclaiming h i m ; but the almost inevitable result is that the man drags her down to his level. with these inferior races. Even if we go back a considerable time before Christ we find that whenever an inferior race tried to blend with a superior race they dragged the latter down to their own level. There is a tendency in human nature to degenerate. The optimist would like to believe that goodness is stronger than evil, but history goes to show that where an inferior people blend with a superior race there is a general tendency to come down. The best course to adopt is to endeavour to induce them to assimilate with us by attraction. Let us set up a standard which is high. Let us remind them that -our social and moral standard is to be kept high, and that when they are fit to enter into union with us we shall be glad to receive and welcome them. That is where the moral element come3 in. To associate with them is simply to come down to their level. It is not Christian morals any more than it is good socialism to believe that we can blend not to our own deterioration with these people. I wish the Government to see that we want to deal w i th this matter in the most frank and outspoken manner. We want to show that it is in the interests of imperial unity ; in the interests of the integrity of the British Empire itself, because, if we admit these mixed races, it will only lead-as it always has done-to complications. tan population. interests will bring us into conflict with these people. To have any considerable number of Japanese or Chinesei n our standard. The intentions of midst would lead very soon to complications with that very troubled part of tlie a very prominent Christian far east from which they come. We should point out, therefore, that it is in order to prevent any complication, or any conflict of interests, that we make this proposal. There is a nice and a nasty way of doing it, so far as our relations with the Imperial authorities are concerned. A nasty way would be to do it in defiance of the Home authorities. But there is another way of doing it . We may safely leave it to the head of the Government to find the proper It is just like that which very terms in which to couch his despatch to the Colonial Secretary, and show him that the only way in which the people of Australia will allow this to be done is in a direct straightforward and unsophisticated manner. SoI f we leave it to the Prime Minister to show that it is in the interests of the Empire, and to avoid complications with the far East that we do this, I am perfectly sure that his wisdom will prevail. I am sure he is with us, and that he intends to give us our ideals. We cannot talk over the Colonial Secretary to our side, but we can show him the sweet reasonableness of our demands in such a way that the Government will not refuse. He will at the same time be led to understand that the people of Australia are not the people who go in for circumlocution. If we once start the practice of going around corners then we shall always have to act in that way, and if we do it, it will be at the expense of our honesty and dignity. We are all one in end and aim, from the head of the Government to the leader of the Opposition. Seeing that is so, there is surely not likely to be any difference between us as to the means by which that end is to be achieved. Our motive is good, and it is only in regard to the means of carrying out the object that we differ at the present time. Let us lay our heads together and adopt the best system. As honesty is the best policy, so it will be found that a straightforward method is the best to adopt here.
