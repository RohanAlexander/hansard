The main decency back into the taxation system to ensure reason they are doing that is to make sure that that Australia promotes investment rather than their kids get into higher education institutions. capital gains or speculation and by looking at It seems to me to be a mad proposition that parents who are prepared to spend up to $5,000 are, we know that they would not say that they a year on their child's education in secondary would cut pensions and they would not do it school will not make any contribution when it immediately. There are many other areas which comes to tertiary education. I honestly believe are just as sensitive as that but which we know that people nowadays will make that investment the Opposition is too gutless to tackle. But, of and I do not think it is asking too much of them course, education is a sitting duck because all to ask them to help fund the education of our anyone has to do is sit on his hands and do young people, certainly in the context that we nothing, and over time the higher education secare going to expand the system to accommodate tor will actually be starved of those funds.

I believe that the Committee has recognised in its proposal to the GovThe Liberal Party of Australia is the only ernment that there may be a deterrent in bringing party in Australia that is still talking about full back fees. I agree with that, because it is very tertiary fees. Its position is that institutions should hard for people on low incomes who want to go be allowed to take on students over and above into tertiary education to be confronted with a those who are publicly funded, by allowing them high up-front cost. The Wran proposal does not to pay full tertiary fees. That is a very discrimihave that. In fact, it takes the money back much natory policy in that, as I have said, people on later in life, when the recipient of the benefit of low incomes would not be able to attend those higher education can afford to pay it back.
