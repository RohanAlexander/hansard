228,For The Needs Of The School's Kids. Mr Lyons,"to move:Thursday, 25 August 2011 Boothby Electorate: South Road Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (9:30): I would like to speak about South Road. From the entrance of the Southern Expressway to Sturt Road is only a short distance. It would only be one kilometre of the 22-kilometre stretch of South Road from Darlington to Winfield which I would like to one day see as a non-stop expressway, and yet it is one of the major bottlenecks on South Road. Every commuter from the southern suburbs would use this stretch of road, even those who do not use the Southern Expressway but come from Happy Valley, Aberfoyle Park and Flagstaff Hill travel this road. For such a small part of the road it has attracted an enormous number of commitments, promises and announcements from the state and federal governments. I have tallied at least 10 commitments and announcements from state and federal governments going back to 2006 about planned work on this stretch of road, and after 5½ years nothing has happened. The Department of Transport, Energy and Infrastructure has an animation of light rail running up to the front door of Flinders Medical Centre and car park 1 of Flinders University. It looks great, but is totally unfunded and will not be delivered by the South Australian government. The latest broken promise from the South Australian government involves switching a promised $75 million interchange with a pre-existing traffic light. What was to be a fully funded infrastructure development has now been cancelled. The excuses which have been offered by the state government and by their minister, Pat Conlan, are laughable. They hope for federal funding. Apparently it is due to the GFC, the floods in Queensland or the dog ate it, but here briefly are some facts. Firstly, the federal government has provided $500 million to the SA government for South Road, including this stretch of South Road. That money has been spent elsewhere. That was the state government's decision-it was Pat Conlan's decision-and they knew this when they promised this interchange 18 months ago. Secondly, what the state government also would have known is that federal money comes in five-year cycles. The next major funding cycle will not arrive until after the 2014 state election, and Pat Conlan and the state government knew this 18 months ago as well. Thirdly, what they said at the time was that the interchange between South Road and the Southern Expressway is fully funded by them and does not rely on Commonwealth funding. Pat Conlan and the state government are damned by their own words, and he has been caught out. After nine years of cynical spin the public now cannot believe any of their promises.

230,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (9:33,"by leave-I want to draw to the attention of theWright. The document will be received as a tabled document. This document will now be referred to the Standing Committee on Petitions for consideration. Argiropolos has organised seeks a permanent end to the live export of all animals. The petitioners have expressed the view that there is no such thing as humane live export of animals, that animals suffer intolerably in very long distance voyages to Indonesia and the Middle East on ships where there are few workers to look after up to 100,000 animals, that there is terrible overcrowding, that thousands of sheep on each ship can starve because they have never before eaten dry pellets which they cannot recognise as being food after a lifetime of grazing on grass, that sick and injured animals are rarely spotted in densely overcrowded pens and that their bodies are only discovered at the end of the journey. The petitioners observed that 80 per cent of Australian abattoirs are already halal certified and Middle Eastern supermarkets are already selling these Australian chilled meats, making live exports no longer necessary. She expresses concern that animals arrive in countries which have no animal welfare laws and are subjected to indescribable horrors there. The petitioners demand an immediate and permanent end of live trade to Indonesia and demand the confirmation of an end date for all live animal export. Miss Argiropolos has gone to some trouble to provide further information about this issue to me regarding the value of processing meat in Australia and supporting Australia’s meat processing industry rather than engaging in the live export trade. She further suggests that Australia should follow the precedent set by New Zealand when it introduced stringent guidelines back in 2004 which have ended the live export trade there, but of course New Zealand has a very lucrative domestic meat processing trade.

It is unfathomable, given that from the Prime Minister’s comments earlier on about the new paradigm of the parliament to let the sun shine in and a more transparent process. Over the last couple of weeks people travelled from all around Australia in convoys to merge at Canberra to have their voices heard. They came to Canberra because they were angry. They came to Canberra because they believed that they had been lied to and they believed that the government was no longer listening to what they had to say. They wanted to voice their frustration, their anger and their opinion of feeling abandoned by this government. They came from all around the country, including my electorate of Wright, at considerable personal expense to voice frustration. These people are not political activists. These people are not the people that you would see in a union rally. They were not paid to do this. They are not contracted to attend marches or rallies. These people got out of their normal routine and made the trip down here because they wanted to make a statement to let the government know that they were furious. Many of them had never been to Canberra before. Most of them certainly had never been to a protest before, but they felt strongly enough about this government’s performance that they wanted to come and have their voices heard.

Another bloke, a larger transport operator, was concerned with the increasing regulatory and cost inhibitors of his business, in particular registration fees-and I acknowledge that is a state matter. How did the government react? It ignored them. In fact, not only did it ignore them; it ridiculed them. The Prime Minister and the ministers refused to meet with these people and openly insulted them. Of course they are angry and hostile. They feel betrayed because we have a Prime Minister who first said, ‘I will no more challenge for the leadership than be a full forward for the Dogs’, ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead’ and, the clanger of all clangers, ‘Nine out of 10 families will be better off under a carbon tax.’ (Time expired) Apple Imports Ms COLLINS (Franklin-Parliamentary Secretary for Community Services) (9:39): As many people would know, the apple industry is an historic and integral part of Tasmanian industry, particularly in my electorate of Franklin. Tasmania has historically been known as the Apple Isle. Indeed, I have a significant number of apple growers in the south of my electorate, as I said, in the Huon Valley. In the last week we have obviously seen a decision from the government that we will accept New Zealand apples exported to Australia. I put on record my support for the apple industry in my electorate. I assure the apple growers in my electorate, as I have done publicly in my electorate last week, that we have done everything we can but that we lost the World Trade Organisation appeal; we lost it on the science. We now have to accept that science, which tells us that the risk is minimal. We have introduced significant biosecurity measures over several months of consultation with the industry to ensure that we protect our industry in Australia. What we cannot afford to do is risk retaliatory action. I know that Tasmania exports $127 million of product to New Zealand every year. We export $39 million of chocolate. We export zinc, paper and newsprint products; just to name a few. We certainly need to protect those industries in our state, and at the same time protect our apple growers. The other thing that I want to reassure the industry in Tasmania of is that New Zealand exporters have said that at the moment they expect to export only to untapped mainland markets and certainly they will only come to Tasmania if there is a market there for them. I have already sought assurances from Coles and Woolworths. They have said that they cannot see in the foreseeable future that they will be stocking New Zealand apples. They intend to continue to stock Australian product, and certainly I will be supporting campaigns in Tasmania to continue to support the Tasmanian product. As I said earlier, we grow quite a number of apples-significantly the Pink Lady, the Fuji and the Golden Delicious. They are very well liked apples, stocked by our supermarkets and little independent stores in Tasmania. People are indicating to me that we have a great product and that everybody wants to continue to support our product. MAIN COMMITTEE As a government, we have looked at the science before us. We have lost our WTO appeal and we are making the only decision we can to protect our other industries, but also to protect our other farmers in Tasmania, the other horticulture and agriculture, from retaliatory action. We are doing what is in the best interests of our community, of the Huon Valley in my local electorate, because we need to ensure that we do not face that retaliatory action. My understanding is that there could be up to 100 per cent tariffs on Tasmanian products into New Zealand, so we need to do all that we can to protect our farmers from both ends. (Time expired) National Seniors Week about making a contribution to their communities, creating networks to support others, combating social isolation, fundraising for important causes, caring for each other and their families, and many other altruistic activities. It is no different to any other week. However, this week in August we are celebrating National Seniors Week. National Seniors Week gives us an opportunity to acknowledge not only the contribution of seniors but also to consider the challenges they face. Policies that affect seniors are broad and varied within the federal sphere. They are a group that is particularly affected by most federal government policies and decisions. Whilst there are obvious areas like aged care and the pension, seniors are also affected by health policies, industrial relations, carers, disabilities, veterans affairs, and of course, the cost of living. Policies affect seniors in ways they do not affect other groups in our society. There are many pitfalls within policies that directly target seniors of which many are not aware. Take, for instance, the superannuation guarantee age limit. Superannuation is in place to help people save for their retirement, yet currently the superannuation guarantee applies only to workers up until the age of 70. This means that if you continue working past the age of 70 your employer is no longer required to pay you superannuation. I believe that this current age limit unfairly discriminates against older workers and may cause them to question their continuing employment. The coalition has also recognised this and took a policy of abolishing this age limit to the last election. It would be remiss of me not to comment on how the carbon tax will affect seniors. Selffunded retirees who do not hold a Commonwealth seniors card will not receive any of the government’s proposed compensation. That equates to 285,000 Australians who have saved to fund themselves in retirement and do not rely on the taxpayer who will now be significantly worse off. This is on top of the government already halving the maximum limit on concessional superannuation contributions, again providing a disincentive for seniors to actively work towards supporting themselves. Additionally, working seniors earning a salary of about $70,000 will face an increase in their marginal tax rate of an extra 2.5c in the dollar as of 1 July next year and those earning just $25,000 a year, currently taxed at 15c in the dollar, will see this rise to 19c of every dollar. So for both these groups the incentive to earn extra income is again diminished. A single self-funded retiree who earns more than $50,000 immediately starts to be worse off under the carbon tax and a couple on $80,000 or more will receive no compensation at all. I regularly receive feedback from my constituents that it is very difficult to access the information they need on issues such as those I have discussed. That is why I am pleased to MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Constituency Statements

Macedonia Parliamentary Friendship Group hosted His Excellency Mr Pero Stojanovski, Ambassador of the Republic of Macedonia, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Macedonian independence. I could not attend the event, but I was represented by Andrew Hunter from my office. The date of this event fell roughly between two significant dates in modern Macedonian history. I understand that 2 August is St Eligius Day, celebrated in Macedonia to recognise the anniversary of the beginning of the Ilinden uprising. This uprising against the centuries long Ottoman occupation occurred in 1903 and was a key event in the development of Macedonia. The Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 led to the dissolution of the Ottoman empire. This period coincided with the first wave of Macedonian migration to Australia, almost entirely from the Aegean Macedonia. The country officially celebrates independence day on 8 September because on that day in 1991 a peaceful democratic referendum endorsed the country’s independence from Yugoslavia. Last week His Excellency, Mr Pero Stojanovski, spoke of what had been achieved in the first 20 years of independence and of the challenges still to be met. According to the 2006 census, over 80,000 Australian residents identified themselves as having Macedonian ancestry. The South Australian Macedonian community was established by migrants from the Aegean region of Macedonia in the 1920s and 1930s. The majority settled in the inner western suburbs of Adelaide, but many later moved to Adelaide’s northern suburbs. A subsequent wave of Macedonians came in the 1960s and 1970s. Australians of Macedonian ancestry have made a considerable contribution to all walks of Australian life-in the professions, in business, the arts and sports, where most notably Australian Rules footballer and 1990 Collingwood premiership player Peter Daicos is still referred as the Macedonian Marvel. In South Australia there are a number of organisations and groups that identify with the members of the Macedonian community. The Macedonian community of Adelaide and South Australia was established in 1947. This community group is the home to the Macedonian United Lions Soccer Club and the Macedonian School of South Australia. It also publishes the quarterly journal Iskra. The annual Macedonian cultural day festival, which was first held in 1983, was a successful part of South Australia’s 150-year anniversary in 1986. In 1969 the first Macedonian Orthodox Church in South Australia was built adjacent to the Macedonian Hall in Findon. Another church, Holy Mother of God in Woodville South, was established during the late 1990s. A range of Macedonian radio programs exist in Adelaide. In more recent years the Macedonian Social Club was established in Brahma Lodge to cater for Macedonians living in Adelaide’s northern suburbs. MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Constituency Statements

Bradfield Electorate: Schools national parliament to congratulate the cast, the crew, the orchestras and all involved with two fine school musical productions that I have been lucky enough to attend recently in my electorate of Bradfield. The first was a production of Annie, a joint production of Hornsby Girls High School and Normanhurst Boys High School, and the second was the St Ives High production How to succeed in business without really trying. The plots of both of these musicals, for those who have not seen them, contain moments of interesting relevance to politicians. Annie is set in the depression and features Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a character. How to succeed in business without really trying could be described as a series of case studies of successful tactics in office politics, but those tactics may have some broader relevance. Be that as it may, I want to warmly congratulate all who were involved in these two fine productions. I thoroughly enjoyed attending them and the standard of the singing, acting, music and all aspects of the technical production was excellent. I particularly congratulate the principals of the schools involved, Mr Robert Phillips of Hornsby Girls High School, Mr Mark Watson of St Ives High School and Mr Jeff Bruce of Normanhurst Boys High School. I also want to congratulate the producers of the two productions, Mrs Nicole Johnson for Annie and Mrs Pam Bullock for How to succeed in business without really trying. In my view, the staff of these three schools are to be very warmly congratulated for giving their students the opportunity to participate in these two productions. I believe that they have given these students a very important message about complementing their academic work with interests in other areas. By exposing their students to the witty and sophisticated lyrics and the infectious music of a top-notch Broadway musical, they have demonstrated how high intelligence, combined with hard work, can produce all kinds of output which is of human and social value. There is no doubt that legal opinions, medical diagnoses or financing proposals will loom large in the career plans of many students of these three schools, but these two musical productions are a powerful demonstration to all students of these schools that there are many other forms of human endeavour which are of equal importance. I therefore want to warmly congratulate all who were involved and say that I thoroughly enjoyed attending both productions. Everybody involved with them-cast, crew, staff and supporters-can take great pride in what they have achieved.

It was a mistake made by the previous Liberal state government that did not have the foresight, even if they could not afford to build the whole road, to plan ahead to ensure that there was space next to the existing expressway to duplicate it. It has been left to the South Australian government to duplicate it. I am very pleased that they committed to this in the state election campaign, and they have confirmed it this week. However, there is some concern within the community over a number of specific design aspects, which I want to highlight to the House and which I hope that the state Labor government will pay considerable attention to. The first is the entry and exit point at Panalatinga Road. Currently residents have expressed their desire to include at this intersection an additional entry and exit ramp to accommodate those wishing to enter the Southern Expressway at this intersection to travel south and also for those wishing to travel north and exit at this intersection further down the southern suburbs. This is critically important because this is about connecting up the communities of the southern suburbs, making sure that they have access, that it will attract investment in jobs and a whole range of things. Ensuring that there is good ability to commute and to get across is really important. Many petitions that I have sent out have returned to my office saying that this is really important. I certainly urge the government seriously consider this and to plan for it so as not to make the mistakes of the past-that is, of not planning for this important addition to the Southern Expressway. There has been some talk this week about the Darlington interchange. We know with the Southern Expressway that we need to make sure there is flow of traffic. There is no point in having the Southern Expressway flow only to then become congested at the end. It is important that the design at Darlington and the Darlington interchange is one that allows for free traffic movement to ensure that commuters from the southern suburbs can actually continue on their journey and not experience any congestion.

There are more than 1,000 signatures on this petition, which deals with community concerns with the federal government’s decision to withdraw funding from the Occasional Childcare Services Program, more commonly known throughout Victoria as Take a Break. The Take a Break program is critically important to mums and dads and their children in my electorate. Under this government’s decision to take $12.6 million away from the Take a Break program, we are left with many towns such as Swifts Creek, Paynesville, Gormandale, Cann River, Heyfield, towns which are quite small, that face the prospect of having no occasional childcare service whatsoever after December this year. I have spoken before on this issue and raised my concerns, but if the government is not prepared to listen to me perhaps they will listen to these 1,000 Gippslanders who are basically saying they want a fair go. It should not be so hard for regional communities to get a fair go out of this government. I hope someone is actually listening. The concerns have been raised by the Victorian Neighbourhood House Association’s Angela Savage, who is the executive officer. Ms Savage has written to me and other members MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Constituency Statements
237,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (09:54,"I rise to present a petition which was found to be inexplaining the potential risks if this funding is not restored by the Gillard government. The risk is that at least 142 childcare workers stand to lose their jobs and over 220 community organisations which received government funding in the past would not be able to offer occasional childcare services in the future. I acknowledge from the outset that this program has been funded previously with a mix of state and federal government funding. The federal government used to provide 70 per cent of the funding and the state government 30 per cent of the funding. In Victoria we are seeing Victorian state MPs taking the opportunity to harangue their Victorian coalition government and demand that they provide the services in the future. The Victorian government has been prepared to stump up their 30 per cent of funding. What they are demanding though is that the federal government restore the 70 per cent that they used to provide. It stuns me, quite frankly, to have a government which is prepared to spend more than $12 million on climate change advertising propaganda but cannot find $12 million to help the children in regional communities receive some occasional childcare and to also provide support for their parents who often require a bit of respite or also require the opportunity to undertake some part-time work. It is a staggering decision from the government. It just shows how out of touch some of the Labor members in this place are. They are prepared to spend $12 million on propaganda but not $12 million on occasional childcare services. I think it is hypocritical of state Labor MPs to be haranguing the state government in Victoria and then not also coming to the Commonwealth minister and demanding that she reinstate that funding. In presenting this petition I just hope that finally someone in government is actually listening to the people of Australia. It should not be this hard for the people of regional communities like those in Gippsland to get a fair go from this government. The petition read as followsTO THE HONOURABLE THE SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF This petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the withdrawal of funding for occasional childcare services by the Gillard Government in the 2010/11 Federal Budget. Of particular concern to the undersigned are the potential impacts on remote communities where 'Take a Break' childcare services available through Neighbourhood Houses and community centres may cease as a result of this decision. In many rural and regional communities childcare services operated through Neighbourhood Houses are the only childcare option available and play a vital role in supporting volunteering, workforce and social participation. We therefore ask the House to support a reinstatement of occasional childcare funding by the Federal Government to enable rural and regional communities to access quality childcare services. from 1121 citizens Petition received.

MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Constituency Statements
238,Mr Byrne (Holt) (09:57,"I rise today to pay tribute and acknowledge my friend andVietnam Veterans Remembrance Day took place last week and therefore, my knowing Denny, it was a good time for me to talk about him, to share some of his story and give an account of his life as a Vietnam veteran: one story, one thread, one account of a life’s journey from one of the almost 60,000 people who served our country in Vietnam. But something really troubles me in hearing the stories from our returning Vietnam veterans-the recurring stories. That is their treatment from some elements of the Australian community upon their return after service, treatment which profoundly wounded them, scarred them and affected their return back to their loves ones and their community. Denny was a private who served 22 years in the armed forces-10 years in the Regular Army and 12 in the Army Reserves. He ended his services as a temporary captain. Denny’s apprehension about his return to Australia commenced just prior to his return from Vietnam in April 1970. Denny recalled being in a war zone in a foreign land and expecting Australians to be supportive of our troops and his brothers-in-arms, as he would say, who were serving alongside him. Understandably, he says it cut a lot of blokes fairly deeply hearing the news of protests and demonstrations, particularly those that disrupted their supplies and mail from loved ones at home. Upon returning from 12 months service at age 21-in other words, a full tour of duty in Vietnam-Denny, like many other returning soldiers, was flown back on a midnight flight to Sydney to avoid confrontation from an expected crowd of protestors at the airport. When the returning soldiers were directed through Customs he saw that his family had flown up to greet him, including his father who was a World War II veteran and his brother who was in the Navy. However, this joyous homecoming and the presence of his family was short-lived as it was not long before rotten tomatoes and cabbages were thrown his way from a dozen or so demonstrators who also carried placards. Some homecoming! This shameful, this disgusting treatment of those who were laying their lives on the line for our country cut very deeply for Denny and many other veterans. They still recall this disgraceful treatment to this day. From 1970 until the late 1980s they felt that their contribution to this country’s military history had not been recognised. Of course now they believe that it has been recognised. But can I say this as someone who knows Denny and his enormous contribution to our community, particularly post his service in his role with the Casey Regional Welfare Association: on behalf of our community I apologise for those people who interfered with your recovery and did not adequately represent the true feelings of our country. I hope this goes some way in helping to heal the wounds that you have experienced in service and laying your life on the line for our country.

National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Representatives
239,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper,"Order! In accordance with standing(Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011. The bill amends the existing act to increase the cap on the national residue survey component of the deer slaughter levy from 4c to 10.5c. It is not proposed that 10.5c be levied at this stage. Governments, as we did and as this government is doing, always increase the amount by more than the requirement to save coming back to parliament every Pancake Day when more is needed. In this case, this whole thing is happening because the deer industry in Australia needs certain money to do MRL testing levels so that our clients overseas are comfortable with whatever is in the deer meat they are importing from Australia. This has to be paid for by the industry. The industry is probably less than half what it was 20 years ago in terms of numbers, so there are fewer people paying it; they need the money to actually do the MRL testing. The Deer Industry Association of Australia has support from its members and we have the bipartisan support of the parliament to do what the industry is asking. I should mention here that 85 per cent of the product of the industry is exported to Europe and other places. Deer farming has a 100-year long history in Australia. It is primarily located in regional areas across most states. It is based primarily on temperate deer species: 50 per cent fallow, which is the production base; red deer and elk, 40 per cent; and the remaining 10 per cent is made up of more tropical species, particularly rusa and chital deer. There are over 500 producers involved in the deer industry. To be quite honest, I am a little surprised that the number is actually that high at this time. It is in one of its cycles, and at this present time it is not the biggest cycle it has been in. The bulk of the industry is concentrated in Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania, and some of the more tropical species are in Queensland and WA. The industry had a peak production of 30 tonnes with a value of almost $2.5 million. Fifty-five per cent of the production value comes from venison and venison products. The remaining 45 per cent is velvet and antler products. The deer population in our country nine years ago was estimated at 200,000. However, with the long drought the numbers of the national herd and the fluctuations of the industry, that was probably less than 100,000 four years ago. The proposed changes occur at a time when the deer industry has suffered a significant decline in production, so they need the same money out of 100,000 that they got from 200,000. The deer monitoring program is critical for maintaining access to international markets, as I said earlier, particularly to the EU, where it is a very traditional meat. Industry requested these changes to ensure residue testing can be continued at a level to provide continued access to these markets. In conclusion, the coalition supports the increase in the levy to 10.5c. Only 6c is what the industry proposes to have the government levy at this time. National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011 and I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I had to work very hard to get to the top of the speaking list for this topic, but thankfully I was able to push my way through the other members of the Labor Party and I am proud to be able to speak on it. I thank the member for Calare for his contribution. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is my understanding that you used to have a deer farm, so you would be very, very interested in this topic. I see the member for Wentworth in the chamber and I understand that he has a very ‘dear’ farm, so he might be interested as well. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Bills
240,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (10:01,I rise to speak on the National Residue Survey,132,Bills
241,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (10:06,"I am pleased to rise to voice my support for theThis bill will help ensure the viability and sustainability of the Australian deer industry. Deer were introduced into Australia more than 100 years ago. Today the deer industry is well established for breeding deer species for the production of velvet antler and, more importantly and more significantly I guess in terms of value, venison. The species that are farmed in Australia include about 50 per cent fallow, 40 per cent red deer and 10 per cent elk. Some of the tropical species are rusa and chital deer in Queensland and Western Australia. They are the deer more suited to tropical climates. And of course there is also the brief, migratory, annual visit of Santa Claus’s reindeer-at least that is what I am informed by my young children. Back in 2002 there were 200,000 deer on Australian farms, particularly in Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania. But as I said, there are also some more tropical deer harvested in Queensland and Western Australia. The onset of drought halved the deer population and the farm gate value of venison dropped from $2.47 million to $1.24 million. Obviously this is a big hit to the producers and this bill is a response to some of their concerns. More than 85 per cent of the venison produced in Australia is exported to Europe and South-East Asia. The deer industry pays a number of compulsory levies to support the industry. These levies include a deer export charge of $5 per animal, a deer velvet levy of two per cent of sale value and a deer velvet export levy of two per cent of sale value. Deer producers are also required to pay a compulsory slaughter levy of 8c per kilogram. Unfortunately the decline in deer production over the last 10 years has significantly reduced the amount of money raised through deer levies. The levy is defined in the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998. ‘Residue’ refers to the monitoring of the residue level of chemicals in the venison. This bill will not increase the levy but it does change the way the levy is allocated. Presently 4c per kilogram goes to fund activities undertaken by the National Residue Survey and 4c per kilogram goes to research and development and is paid to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. This bill will increase the levy cap from 4c to 10.5c per kilogram. This will enable the portion of the levy that goes to the national residue survey to be increased to 6c per kilogram and the R&D component will be reduced to 2c per kilogram. As the member for Calare touched on, this is a normal rejigging to accommodate the concerns of the industry. Residue monitoring is obviously important to ensure that consumer confidence in the meat product safety and quality remains and is also required for Australia’s meat to be sold to the European Union. Because Europe is such a significant market for Australian deer meat it is important that we have a viable residue monitoring program, and this bill will help to achieve that. Obviously our venison sales story is part of our clean and green foodstuffs message that I am sure the member for Eden-Monaro is very familiar with. The Australian products have a good brand overseas but we can only maintain that brand through vigilance. Importantly, the reduction in the research and development rate of the deer slaughter levy is not expected to have an impact on deer related projects undertaken by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. I think it is also important that this bill does not impose an additional tax burden on the deer producers, who have suffered significant losses MAIN COMMITTEE over the last decade. However, because this bill will increase the levy cap to 10.5c it will enable the industry to seek future levy increases without the need to further amend the act. I speak here as a Queenslander, Mr Deputy Speaker, like you. Obviously, with your history as a deer farmer you would understand this industry more, and I thought with your long history in the House you might be able to shed some light on why the Queensland coat of arms-the oldest coat of arms in Australia-has a deer on it. The brolga is on one side; obviously that is a very Australian bird, probably for me one of the most graceful birds in the world. That sits there easily but on the other side of the coat of arms-the coat of arms that was granted in 1893 by Queen Victoria-is the red deer. I did a bit of research. Also on the coat of arms are a sheaf of wheat, the head of a bull, the head of a ram, a bit of sugar canereflecting the rural activities of Queensland-and even some gold. Dr Mike Kelly: No Wally Lewis? back for New South Wales to have won the State of Origin. An honourable member: Not quite. interestingly enough. Underneath the coat of arms it has the state motto, Audax et Fidelis, which means bold but faithful. That could be my motto, I suppose, or yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps. The coat of arms was changed in 1977, when the red deer and the brolga were put on the side-the supporters of the coat of arms-and apparently the thinking of that well-known Queenslander, or New Zealander, Joh Bjelke-Petersen was that the red deer was the link back to the royal herds near London, and the brolga is obviously Queensland’s distinctive bird. While we do not have as many deer producers as the other states, we do have a deer on our coat of arms, so I welcome the measures in this bill that will ensure a viable, quality deer industry continues and I commend the bill to the House. interesting if quirky contribution. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10:13): I thank the honourable members for their contribution to this debate, and particularly the interesting contribution from the member for Moreton. Obviously Queensland is a state we hold dear and our thoughts will be turning to them this Saturday night as the Wallabies face the All Blacks at Suncorp stadium. The National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011 has been sought, as has been pointed out by the shadow minister, by the deer industry itself. It amends the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998 to increase the maximum allowable levy rate cap on the national residue survey component of the deer slaughter levy from 4c to 10.5c per kilogram of carcass weight. The proposed change provides for changes to the relevant regulation so that the deer slaughter levy can be reapportioned. The research and development component of the levy will be decreased from 4c to 2c per kilogram and the NRS component of the levy will be increased from 4c to 6c per kilogram. Increasing the NRS rate to 6c per kilogram will support a viable residue monitoring program that underpins access to key export markets for the deer industry. As was pointed out by the shadow minister, it is very important that this is the underpinning for the industry MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Bills

244,The Deputy Speaker,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton for hisbecause 85 per cent of their product is for export. Therefore this ensures and enables them to maintain that access to the key export markets for the deer industry. So, the increasing of the NRS rate to 6c per kilogram will support that viable residue monitoring program. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation does not expect the decrease in the R&D rate to have an impact on future deer-related projects. I know this is also of great interest to deer producers in my own region. There have been ups and downs in that industry in Eden Monaro over recent years but we still have relevant activities, so it is principally New South Wales and Victoria that are affected, notwithstanding the comments by the member for Moreton. Also, I would like to reflect on the comments of the member for Moreton of the importance of trust in our product labels and in our products. Increasingly so, as I have been involved in this portfolio of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I have noticed the growing consumer dynamic in the entire world in relation to eco-labelling, health, trust and reliability in products, so this is a very important measure to underpin that level of trust in our product. I thank the honourable members for their contribution and commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. ABC Helicopter Crash were horrified and deeply saddened to hear of the tragic helicopter accident which took the lives of three of the ABC’s most well-loved and most experienced employees-Gary Ticehurst, Paul Lockyer and John Bean. They died doing what they had done well for so long; bringing the vision of Australia-particularly the Australia that is beyond the cities where most of us live-those images and that life of the Australian bush to the rest of this nation. In doing that work over so many years they were part of the great mission of the ABC, which as a national public broadcaster is able to knit together this country and, in particular in the way it serves regional Australia and represents the views of regional Australia and the images of regional Australia, serves to remind all of us that there is a world elsewhere, that there is an Australia outside of the congestion and the busyness and the hustle and bustle of the city streets. While we may not be like the clerk in Banjo Paterson’s famous poem and wish that we were out of the city and out there with Clancy droving, nonetheless we can at least have some insight into that world courtesy of the ABC. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10:19 to 10:32 three men who died in this tragic helicopter crash, Gary Ticehurst, Paul Lockyer and John Bean, had spent much of their lives-particularly Paul and Gary-in recording and documenting the life in rural Australia.

246,Mr Turnbull,"Before we adjourned to vote in the division I was observing that theoutside the cities, whether we, like Banjo Paterson, fancied ourselves leaving the busyness of the city and going out for a more rural life, going out into the wide open spaces of Australia. As we were coming back from the division the member for Forrest reminded me of his extraordinary gift for reading and remembering poetry and so we turned up that poem, Clancy of the Overflow, which I have not memorised, but those last two stanzas really sum up the image of an urban country like Australia that for all of its life-and we have been one of the most urbanised countries in the world, despite our vast land mass-how, as a very urbanised country, we still seek to stay connected with and to understand regional Australia. Those last two stanzas Paterson writes: And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste, With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy, For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste. AndI somehow fancy that I’d like to change with Clancy, Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go, While we faced the round eternal of the cashbook and the journal – But I doubt he’d suit the office, Clancy, of ‘The Overflow’. Gary Ticehurst, Paul Lockyer and John Bean did not suit the office and they died as they had lived. Gary Ticehurst had been the ABC’s lead helicopter pilot since the 1980s. He had logged more than 16,000 hours of flying time, most of those in his work for the ABC. He is remembered for many great stories that he enabled the ABC to cover, but probably the most spectacular was his consistent coverage of the Sydney to Hobart yacht races. Of course in 1998, in that tragic race, he played a very important role-much more important than just delivering us spectacular imagines of the yachts at sea-where he effected the rescue of 14 crew members of the yacht Business Post Naiad, which tragically lost its skipper and one of its crew. He was out there in that wild weather spotting the yachts and relaying their position to the search and rescue officials. He saved lives. He did not simply record the life of the sailors, he saved lives. He was loved by all of the people that he worked with at the ABC and, as I said, he represented the wings that enabled the writers and the cameramen to get out and record the life beyond the cities of this great country. Paul Lockyer was one of the most distinguished journalists in the ABC and, indeed, in Australia. His career had spanned more than 40 years, which is remarkable because he looked so young. He was extremely well preserved. Clearly the life of being an ABC journalist is very good for one’s personal appearance. He always looked youthful and brought a vitality and an energy to all of his reporting. His jobs at the ABC have spanned just about every corner of its activities, but most recently his focus had been, as I said earlier, on regional issues. Very recently he was in Grantham when the floods hit in Queensland this year, as my colleague, Mr Buchholz has spoken very eloquently about. He was regarded as one of the people, one of their own, by the people of the Lockyer Valley-and appropriately, given they share a name-and the Mayor has said that every time he returned to Grantham, which he did many times after the floods, the locals embraced him as truly one of their own. He was a man of great compassion, great professionalism and embodied the very high standards of journalism. MAIN COMMITTEE Of course, the most beautiful words are not nearly as persuasive or as compelling without the pictures, and John Bean, the cameraman who also died in this crash, had been working for the ABC as a cameraman for 20 years. He had worked on a whole range of Australian television programs: Australian Story: Catalyst, New Inventors, Gardening Australia, 7.30 and Landline. He, like Paul Lockyer and Gary Ticehurst, had a fascination with and a love of the landscape of Australia and his work on the documentaries Return to Lake Eyre and After the Deluge are great testimony to both his passion and his art. These three men will be sorely missed by their families, by their colleagues and by all Australians. It was a tragic loss and, as I said, they died as they had lived, serving the people of Australia through that great public broadcaster, the ABC. I would also like to take this opportunity to honour another great leader of the ABC, another great journalist, Ian Carroll, who many of us have known. He is the husband, of course, of Geraldine Doogue, another very distinguished journalist. Ian had a remarkable career with the ABC. He died of a very cruel disease, a very cruel cancer. He worked right up until the end of his life. He had contributed to so many programs over the years at the ABC. He was an interesting man; he was in his mid-sixties when he died. He rather belies the view of Gen-Y that only the people in their twenties can be great innovators. He is an encouragement to all of us because he was the founder, in large measure, of the ABC program Lateline, which of course has become one of the most significant current affairs programs in Australia and really is one of the handful of platforms on television where there is actually the scope for a reasonably informed, intelligent debate about public policy, which is an enormous part of the ABC’s role. Also, over the last decade, Ian really pioneered the entry of the ABC into the digital world. In my view, the ABC does a better job on the digital platform-on the internet, with iview and its podcasts-than any other broadcaster in the world. If people want to correct me on that then I would be very interested to be proven wrong, but I think what they have done is extraordinary. You take the way in which the reach of so many outstanding programs and Radio National have been expanded exponentially with podcasts, the way that the reach of ABC television programs has been expanded dramatically with iview and, of course, the ABC’s many websites-whether it is opinions as in The Drum or so many other platformshave really expanded the reach of the ABC. Far from being, as one might have expected, a rather stuffy old public broadcaster, it has become a real leader in digital innovation. This was done by Ian Carroll. He was the driving force. He was the one that more than a decade ago was pushing the ABC and saying, ‘This is the new frontier. Our world does not end at free-toair television and radio. We have to drive into the digital arena’, and they have done it very well. Ian is also deeply missed. It was a very tragic week for the ABC to lose those four men. All of them made a great contribution the ABC-a remarkable one and unique contributions in each case. All of them are very sorely missed, so it is appropriate that this parliament records our sadness at their passing, our respect for them, conveys our condolences to their family, friends and colleagues at their work, and also in doing this, recognises the great work that the ABC does to bring our wonderful large nation together, and in particular to bring together the far-flung parts of Australia, out in the bush in regional Australia, to the clerks in the city, who in the midst of MAIN COMMITTEE the bustle, without the ABC, would only be able to dream of the splendours that Clancy enjoyed. Government and Minister for the Arts) (10:43): I, too, would like to rise in this condolence motion for the loss of three great reporters who told the regional story. The ABC is the national broadcaster and whilst they have lost, in fact, four members of the ABC family last week that, in many ways, is part of the nation’s family, too, because of the stories they tell and the way they tell them. The cameraman, pilot and journalist who died in outback South Australia last week so tragically were doing what they did so well as a trio. They told the regional story, the Australian story, through the prism of the regions. They understood, better than most, the patchwork nature of our society-and that term has been used a lot lately, but each patch is different and the ability to explain those differences and present those differences is, indeed, an important work in its own right. Paul Lockyer did this as the journalist, John Bean as the cameraman and Gary Ticehurst as the logistics operator, obviously getting them into remote areas, into difficult, otherwise inaccessible areas, certainly inaccessible for the purposes of a news cycle. They had been working together on news and feature projects in the Lake Eyre region. It was not the first time that they had been there because they had done a wonderful documentary on previous occasions in the Lake Eyre region. Like those who have had the privilege to see it with water and without water and to note the fascinating differences, to be able to record that and tell the story about it takes it to an audience that does not have the ability to access it but can nevertheless marvel at the wonderment of the change, the rehabilitation, the revivaleverything that comes from the enrichment of water and flooding plains. Paul Lockyer was one of the ABC’s most experienced journalists and he also had a great ability to tell the stories. He cut through and gave all Australians an unrivalled insight into the bush and to remote communities. He had a real passion not just for news, but a passion for the regions, and that is a great thing to see. It has been an essential ingredient of the great message that the ABC has been able to convey over the years through television and radio, but it is more than just the telling of the story, it is giving strength to the regional voice. It is believing in it, having the passion for it and articulating it in the most effective ways. All of his stories conveyed empathy, respect and a deep understanding of the issues that faced people who live and work in regional Australia. They do think differently than we do here in Canberra. They see issues through a completely different perspective and their challenge, always, is ‘how can we better our opportunities?’, rather than the hurly-burly that goes on here for so much of the time. I mentioned before that they perished in the Lake Eyre region, but Paul had undertaken an outstanding series on Lake Eyre which he was in the process of filming. His compassion covering the recent floods also made him a household name because Paul was the voice, the only journalist effectively, to be able to get into Grantham after that devastating flood that took so many lives and changed forever the nature of that peaceful valley, a valley that carries the same name as Paul himself. But he was the voice. He was there and he was able to bring the story-the hurt, the pain, the understanding, that empathy I talked of before-he was able to bring it to the outside world, so as people were grieving he was able to demonstrate an MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Statements On Indulgence
247,Mr Crean (Hotham,"Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Localunderstanding and awareness in the rest of the community of just what had happened in terms of a community that effectively had been washed off the map. John Bean was an award winning cameraman who was with Paul at the time of the Lake Eyre series and the three were filming when the tragedy occurred. The filming, itself, will be a lasting legacy to them. It is just so tragic that they were taken in an area that they understood, that they loved and that they wanted to tell the story about. They were experts in their field, extraordinary men who not only captured the spirit of regional Australians, but helped to tell their stories. As the ABC’s former head of international, John Tulloh, recently said of Paul Lockyer: 'He had in abundance the best virtues of humanity. So many that you would not know where to start. It’s no wonder that strangers who featured in his stories, especially in the bush, trusted him. They probably recognised the kindred country-boy spirit in him. They knew he would never exploit them and always would tell their stories faithfully and knowledgeably.' I think that is important because the regions did trust him. He was from them and he returned to them. He never forgot them. He loved them and loved the regions in a way that he saw part of his life’s mission was to better tell their story, their challenges, their triumphs and, on a number of occasions, their miseries. John Tulloh went on to say, 'He felt for the despair and plight of farmers and their families in the dust bowls who were part of his stories.' As I mentioned at the outset, Paul was well known for his coverage of the devastation in Grantham and in the recent Queensland floods. In relation to that, Mart Warburton of the Grantham Recovery Council said this of him: 'One of few reporters who could balance his professionalism of the job and the compassion of the heart-a true gentleman. Since the first meeting in January until now Paul would ring from time to time just to see how I am going and how the community is recovering. When he was able to come back to Grantham he would make a huge effort to try and see as many residents as he could that he knew from the disaster. We all felt that we were more than a story to Paul. That’s why he was an honorary Grantham local, a friend, and always welcome in our community.' John Bean was also a man of immense capability and popularity. He was described by his friends and colleagues as incredibly humble, positive and warm, with an infectious laugh, and like Paul and Gary was a master in his field. It is terribly important with the stories of regional Australia that the visuals are there. The skill of the cameraman is essential to complement the editing, the text and the delivery of the reporter, and John Bean was an incredible part of this team that so sadly has perished. As John’s wife, ABC Landline reporter Pip Courtney, said, ‘I just hope lots of people have a Beannie in their lives like I’ve had.’ That infectiousness and that lovability were very much part of everything that those who spoke of John are reminded of. Gary Ticehurst was an extraordinary pilot. John Tulloh recalls this in relation to Gary Ticehurst: In my time at the ABC there were many stirring deeds by reporters and crews, but for me there was none greater than during the disastrous 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. That is when Gary and cameraman, then Peter Sinclair, hovered in gale-force winds above stricken yachts and life rafts in tumultuous seas to coordinate their positions with rescuers, turning away only when in his calculation they had just enough fuel left to return to land. They made it with just a few litres in the tank and it was said his actions saved the lives of probably 25 crew members in that race. MAIN COMMITTEE It is the skills of these pilots that we rely on not only for the accessibility and the logistics work that made up the trio, in terms of the three that perished, but also the bravery, skill and precision and the ability to understand your capacity but also the task at hand and to have the determination to make the judgment, but most of all to put the saving of lives at the forefront of the determination as part of the job that he saw as his requirement to undertake. Over the years I have had a lot to do with regional reporters and the professionals who cover regional stories. I have always found that the regional media are great to deal with. They are interested in you being there to understand their circumstances, to identify and hopefully to help. The regional reporters also call it how they see it. It does not always go our way, but that is the nature of journalism. They do know their stuff and they do know their regions and their audiences. In this tragedy Australia has lost three men who knew their audience, who knew their issues and who knew how to convey the stories of regional communities in a very powerful and compelling way. I know that they will be deeply missed and I extend my deepest condolences to their family, friends and colleagues. WhilstI am on my feet, could I also have the indulgence to place on record my condolences for the passing of Ian Carroll, another ABC journalist whose death I think happened around the same time but after the condolence motion was moved in the parliament by the Prime Minister. I met Ian Carroll over 40 years ago when I was making it in the industrial movement and he was a reporter for the ABC in those days. It was an exciting time because there were many industrial disputes in those days when we did not have something that came to emerge called the prices and incomes accord, which in its own way helped transform the nature of this country. I was involved in a trade union-the Storemen and Packers Union. I had just finished at university and Ian was on the round with a lot of other key journalists at the time-Ben Ainsworth, Barry Donovan, and Michael Gordon, who is still writing with the Age as National Editor. This was an exciting group to be involved in. But Ian, you knew at the time, was more than just a reporter and certainly more than just an industrial roundsman. He did have a creativity. He had big ideas about him. He went through the ABC in a number of guises but the two areas that he picked and was innovative with, and why the ABC are privileged to have these people work for them and why the nation is the better for it, were where the media was moving and the emergence of the moving media cycle. He understood that. And for that reason he pioneered the ABC Lateline program; he saw a niche. As the 6 o’clock news moved more to domestic tragedies and the like and less to political stories there was a market still there for strong political debate, and so Lateline developed and Lateline stands today. He also understood the technology and the importance technology could play in terms of enabling the message reach of the ABC; not just the media dimension, but the message, the storytelling and all that went with it. He was instrumental in driving the ABC in the direction of the embrace of the digital economy. It is fortuitous that we reflect on that in this condolence motion, because the government is undertaking at the moment the convergence review that is looking at this whole question of the convergence of technologies. So the circumstances in which his legacy will be remembered are terribly important. I place on the record my condolences for his passing and my very best to his surviving family, in particular Geraldine Doogue. MAIN COMMITTEE portfolio to engage with many members of the ABC regional news and current affairs world-sound recordists, cameramen and camerawomen, journalists and on occasions helicopter pilots. Having seen the work of that crew, I simply wanted briefly to record my sorrow at the loss of three of their number, all truly experienced and outstanding representatives-Gary Ticehurst, John Bean and Paul Lockyer. Each of the three had a distinguished career, but each of the three was well known more importantly still for their decency, humanity and professionalism. Gary Ticehurst, whilst a pilot of 25 years with the ABC, was rightly remembered most importantly for his courage during the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in 1998. As other honourable members have recorded, he chose to put the safety of those in the water and in stricken boats ahead of himself and brought his helicopter perilously close to some very tight moments, but in so doing he guided a rescue crew in and was responsiblecommittee at the moment so the chamber will be suspended until the chair is resumed. Sitting suspended from 11:00 to 11:02 second during the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race of 1998. It is fair to say that there are many families that remain whole as a consequence of that decision. John Bean, of course, was an awarded cameraman. His work took him right around the country and he had worked in rural Australia. I make this point because, having worked with many ABC journalists and camera crew across rural and regional Australia, I have a sense of the passion they have for their job. It is important to acknowledge that they are a fundamental glue-whether we agree or disagree with any particular story-to the ability of people in regional Australia to have a voice, to have access to an understanding of the broader things that are occurring within their region and to simply be in connection with the rest of the country. Paul Lockyer, who was of course the best known of the three to have perished in the Lake Eyre helicopter tragedy a week ago, was a journalist who brought to life the drought. He then brought to life the rains and the magnificent spectacle of Central Australia in full bloom, both for its environmental benefits but also the human stories that went with it. Again, a tragedy which perhaps became the leitmotif of his work was his role and work in Grantham in the immediate aftermath of the tragic inland wall of water that tore through that town at the start of this year. I simply wanted to record my sorrow at their passing in such circumstances. Like many in this House, it was my portfolio, not so much my electorate, that took me into many circumstances where I have worked with ABC regional crew. They do a tremendous job. To lose three of their principal leaders was a great loss for them and the community, but above all else a loss for the families of Gary Ticehurst, John Bean and Paul Lockyer. honour to be a union official, the National Secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union.

251,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (11:05,"Before entering parliament I had the greatever represented in my industrial capacity. It was with great sadness that I and my colleagues at the CPSU learnt that long-term ABC journalist Paul Lockyer, cameraman John Bean and pilot Gary Ticehurst had died in tragic circumstances. They were filming the flooding at Lake Eyre in Central Australia and the helicopter crashed in a remote location on the lake’s edge. Investigators from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau only reached the scene on Friday night. We had hoped that it would not end in tragedy in that 12 or 14 hours after learning about the accident, but regrettably that was not the case. Paul Lockyer was a distinguished international journalist who produced a truly remarkable body of work, and in statements in this place and elsewhere many people have paid tribute to that work. He had been a correspondent in Washington, Singapore and throughout Asia and had won a Logie award for best TV reporter. His work in recent years focused on regional and rural issues and his work on the Queensland floods this year won universal acclaim. I am quite certain that he will, tragically posthumously, receive further awards for that work. Not only that; it is clear from the outpouring of grief and regret from not only his colleagues at the ABC and in the Australian media community but also from the broader ABC family that Paul was highly valued as a good friend. The qualities that made him a good friend and a good mate shone through in his journalism and touched audiences everywhere across Australia. It is not easy to win trust let alone affection from people who are living in regional Australia, but it was clear from his reports from regional Australia that he was good with people and they in turn respected and trusted him with their stories. At the time of the accident, Paul, John and Gary were filming for another acclaimed documentary for ABC Television on Lake Eyre. Paul Lockyer was one of the ABC’s most experienced journalists, with an award-winning career spanning more than 40 years locally and internationally. Many speakers in this condolence motion have spoken about Gary Ticehurst, who was by all accounts one of the best amongst the media pilots. I never met him personally, but I know of him by fame and reputation. On more than one occasion during that infamous Sydney to Hobart race he put his life at risk to ensure the safety of the crews on stricken yachts hit by storms. He was famous within the profession and it is fitting that his work is paid tribute in this debate. Brisbane based cameraman John Bean worked for the ABC for 20 years across a diverse range of programs, in news and entertainment, including international assignments. In my time representing workers at the ABC we used to represent the people who were behind the camera and the people who did not generally get the fame that the journalists and others did. They were famous and well-respected amongst their colleagues but generally little known amongst the Australian public. It is tragic and perhaps ironic that it takes a tragedy such as this to make the Australian community stand up and recognise the wonderful value of their work; they come out from behind the camera and become visible to us. These men were not only dedicated media professionals; they were also husbands, fathers, sons and uncles. I know this is a terribly difficult time for their families. I take this opportunity and join with all of my parliamentary colleagues to extend my personal sympathy to their families and friends and to the entire ABC community, who I know are missing them dearly. remarks of the members for Wentworth, Flinders and Throsby and the Minister for Regional MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Statements On Indulgence
252,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (11:10,"I associate myself with the eloquent and movingAustralia, Regional Development and Local Government this morning-and others too-in this condolence motion. My sincerest condolences are offered to the families and many friends of the three ABC news crew who died in a helicopter crash while filming near Lake Eyre in outback South Australia on Thursday, 18 August. We were sad to hear of the loss of award-winning journalist Paul Lockyer, experienced pilot Gary Ticehurst and gifted cameraman John Bean in such tragic circumstances. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has a long and proud history, with news crews working relentlessly and tirelessly to bring Australian news, world news and regional news to our living rooms. Paul and John, as news gatherers, did it marvellously well. The helicopter pilot was one of the best. Australia’s media has been dealt a harsh blow. They brought to our small screens the stories of the people, the outback, rural and regional Australia-what I like to call real Australia-and the colour, exuberance, vibrancy and vitality of the bush. The media has lost three of its finest. The nation is poorer as a result. They were fine men and fine Australians. May they rest in peace. offer my sympathy to the families of Paul Lockyer, Gary Ticehurst and John Bean. I knew Paul quite well and considered him a friend. I think he was a great friend of regional Australia; there is absolutely no doubt of that. His origins in Western Australia and in the country, I think, flowed through his capacity to tell the stories of regional Australia. We share the same age, so it also brings home one's own longevity in a sense. I used to speak with Paul on the phone a bit about some of the regional issues that are out there. He would ring from time to time just to see what I thought was happening, what was not happening or what should be happening. The last time. I spoke to him was in relation to a story on a piece of legislation that I will actually be introducing into this parliament on the next sitting Monday to do with coal seam gas, coal activities and groundwater issues under the EPBC Act. Paul was one of those who are very, very astute. He was obviously a very professional journalist. I think there are a lot of journalists in Australia today who should actually look at how professional these people were-Gary as a professional helicopter pilot; John Bean as obviously one of the best in terms of his capacity to operate a camera and his ability to send the message back; and Paul as the journalist. They were a great team. But to send that message back you needed a great photographer. The last time. I spoke to Paul he actually said that he was looking forward to going back out there. We shared a common interest, I guess. We used to talk occasionally above the love of inland Australia, the deserts and the way in which water is so vital to this nation in a range of areas. I think he was particularly captivated by the way in which the Channel Country in Queensland related to that very dry area around Lake Eyre and how that region absolutely came to life when it rained in the Channel Country in Queensland. He was going back out to do a follow-up story on that when the tragedy occurred. His capacity to tell the real story of regional Australia-the country stories-as I said probably went back not only to his roots in regional Western Australia but also to the professional edge he put to it. Too often these days we see journalists who want to make themselves the story, be part of the story or present their interpretation of the story. I think the great attribute that all three of these people had was that they were able to relate to the people they were talking to. MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Statements On Indulgence
253,Mr Windsor (New England) (11:11,"I would like to join this condolence motion andPaul Lockyer never looked down on country people, as some journalists who do not understand those real issues of country Australia tend to do. They do not mean to do it and I do not blame them, but it sends a body language message to many. I think we saw the way that they were accepted in Grantham as well. They were not in there like voyeurs looking at the damage and trying to pick up the story of damaged people; they were there in a sympathetic way to tell the tragedy of the story of the people actually on the ground. My brother-in-law and good friend Andrew Pursehouse and his wife, Cynthia, spent about three hours with Gary on probably the last story that they did in New South Wales, at Breeza, looking at a similar issue, the impact of mining activities on water resources. I know they represent a whole group of people right across regional Australia who have engaged with Paul, Gary and John on various occasions and told their story. Tim Duddy, who has been a champion for regional Australia as well, also spent much time with Paul on that same story in my local region. On the morning that we heard that there had been a tragedy in Lake EyreI went to our local ABC radio station to offer my condolences, because they are a real family. There was no-one more respected than Paul Lockyer in terms of journalism. Everybody knew Gary Ticehurst and most people knew John Bean. The emotion in our local ABC-and I am sure it was right across the nation-was palpable. People were genuinely upset. Catherine Clifford, the news announcer, did an extraordinary job-she knew Paul very well-in being able to go to air at 6.30 and make those announcements. I make my contribution today not just on behalf of myself, my family and obviously the community I represent, but very particularly for that ABC family that is out there right across Australia who have lost these extraordinary professionals. My eldest son, who is a farmer but is also a helicopter pilot, had contact with Gary Ticehurst on a number of occasions, particularly in the Kimberley area a few years back when the movie Australia was being filmed. Right across that network of professional pilots and helicopter people they all know each other and obviously they feel for the families as much as we all do. I would just like, if I could, to mention a common friend of both Gary Ticehurst's and mine, a fellow called Ian Wiskin, who, with Gary, was instrumental in forming the Helicopter Association in New South Wales. They were also involved in the national association. Ian, as many would know in this House, has been here on a number of occasions to represent various issues. He was very close to Gary Ticehurst. I will be attending the funeral of Paul Lockyer tomorrow in the company of Ian Wiskin and we will convey some of the messages that I have heard from other members and other members of the community as well. I extend the sympathy of my family and that of the electorate of New England and regional people generally to the families of these people. Because of their absolute devotion to their task and their capacity to relay the stories as they really are, they will not be forgotten, particularly by country Australia. I think other members have spoken about that. We feel extreme sorrow for their families on this very sad occasion. MAIN COMMITTEE Lambert, Private Matthew Debate resumed on the motion: That the House record its deep regret at the death on the morning of 22 August of Private Matthew Lambert during combat operations in Afghanistan, place on record its appreciation of his service to his country and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (11:20): I rise on this condolence motion regarding Private Matthew Lambert, who, on 22 August 2011, became the 29th soldier to be killed on active service in Afghanistan. It was his first tour of Afghanistan with 2RAR and, sadly, his last. But it was not his first tour in the service of our country. Private Lambert served our country in East Timor, undertaking two tours of duty. An expert sniper, he has been recognised for his service and has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal, the Afghanistan campaign medal, the Australian Service Medal, the Australian Defence Medal and the Timor-Leste Solidarity Medal. He also wore the Infantry Combat Badge in recognition of his special place-fighting for freedom, putting himself in danger to protect us. Private Lambert was killed on night patrol on a mentoring mission with the Afghan National Army in the Khas Oruzgan region just north-east of Tarin Kowt. Private Lambert’s career in the Australian Army commenced in the Army Reserve in 2005 before he went full time in his service of our country in 2007. As I understand it, his loss is the first loss that 2RAR have experienced since the Vietnam War-that is, the first loss of a military serviceman in action. We think now of Private Lambert’s wife, his family, his colleagues and his friends. We are devastated for them that they have lost a loved one and we are also devastated for our country that we have lost a great Australian who has served our country very dutifully and well. We will never forget him and will forever be grateful for his sacrifice. I would also like to take the opportunity to recognise the other 28 Australian soldiers who have given their life during their service in our campaign in Afghanistan: Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsley, Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Signaller Sean McCarthy, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, Private Gregory Sher, Corporal Mathew Hopkins, Sergeant Brett Till, Private Benjamin Ranaudo, Sapper Jacob Moerland, Sapper Darren Smith, Private Timothy Aplin, Private Scott Palmer, Private Benjamin Chuck, Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby, Lance Corporal Jared Mackinney, Corporal Richard Atkinson, Sapper Jamie Larcombe, Sergeant Brett Wood, Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, Lieutenant Marcus Case, Sapper Rowan Robinson and Sergeant Todd Langley. We thank you for your service to our country. We thank your families for their sacrifice. Lest we forget. Finally, I would also like to record our gratitude to the 3,280 active service men and women who are serving our country overseas at this point in time in Afghanistan, East Timor, Egypt, Iraq, the Middle East, the Solomon Islands and also Sudan. We are thinking of you and we wish you to come home as speedily and safely as possible after your tour of duty. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (11:24): Once again I rise in this place to honour an Australian soldier who has fallen in Afghanistan doing the vital work of restoring security, peace and prosperity to that country. TodayI honour the life and service of Private Matthew MAIN COMMITTEE Lambert. In doing so, I once again offer my condolences and the condolences of all Canberrans to his family and his friends. As I have said before, this is a town that is home to many members of the Defence Force. We are a community linked very closely with those men and women who come from around the country to serve their nation and their people. In my former roles in the Department of DefenceI met many members of the Army and other services, so while I never met Private LambertI know all too well the kind of man he was. I have no doubt at all he was dedicated, courageous, proud and honoured to serve. I had reason the day before yesterday to join with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Veteran’s Affairs to launch the FamilySMART program, which is being developed by the Defence Community Organisation. The purpose of this program is to make sure that the families of defence personnel are looked after when their loves ones are deployed. At this event I spoke to many relatives, wives and children of members of the services who are or have recently been deployed overseas. I mention this program because I think it shows just how connected the defence forces are and just how much the death of Private Lambert will be hurting the entire defence community. It will cut deep, just as the deaths before him have done. These are tough, gritty and determined men and women and they know the risks they face when they are deployed to places like Afghanistan. However, this does not make the loss any easier. As I have mentioned before, I have been fortunate in my short time as a member of this place to travel to Afghanistan and to meet soldiers like Private Lambert. I was very, very impressed and deeply affected by their professionalism and their dedication to their duties and to their mission of bringing stability to Afghanistan. It is not just a very important mission for ensuring that the global environment is more secure and protected from terrorism and the brutality of the Taliban and al-Qaeda but a mission with direct consequence for the safety and security of Australians here and overseas. It is a mission that is making a difference. While on my trip we met with a number of members of the Afghan parliament, one of them the internationally renowned Fawzia Koofi. Ms Koofi is the chairwoman of the defence and territorial affairs standing committee, has a masters in business and management and is a strong advocate of human rights, particularly of women’s and children’s rights. She is also from a political active family. In our meeting she was articulate and forthright. She praised the international presence in Afghanistan and wanted it to last as long as possible because it ensured women like her were safe. In Oruzgan we met only with men from the provincial government, army and police in Tarin Kowt and local leaders in the Mirabad Valley. All of them praised the international community’s work in building vital infrastructure, including schools, waste management and food storage facilities and women’s and children’s health centres. They were at pains to point out the gains in stability and security in the last 12 months, particularly in the last six months. My trip to Afghanistan left a permanent mark on me and put into sharp focus the reality of life on the ground for those deployed there. It is a place that is hot and dusty during the day and freezing at night. It is a hard place. But, as is so typical of the character of Australian defence personnel, they just got on with the job. Words cannot possibly do justice to the work and sacrifice of Private Lambert or to the extent of the grief of his family and friends. Once again, all I can offer is my eternal thanks and to say that the people of Canberra are grateful MAIN COMMITTEE and we will not forget the sacrifice of Private Lambert and his efforts, and neither will the people of Afghanistan. His commitment will not be in vain and he will be remembered. Matthew Lambert. But this is without doubt another tragedy, a tragedy for our country and a tragedy for several Australian families. I pay tribute to Private Lambert, a dedicated soldier, a soldier who always wanted to serve his nation and serve the national interest, beginning with the reserve forces in Brisbane and moving on to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment based in Townsville. Although having served two tours of duty in Timor, he had recently joined the third Mentoring Task Force in Afghanistan. It was on this deployment that he lost his life for a very good cause. When you look at what we are trying to achieve in Afghanistan, it is often open to criticism that we should not be there, that it cannot be won or that we are there for the wrong reasons. There are myriad excuses why this is not the right thing to do. However, when you look at the sort of place Afghanistan was before the war began, when you look at the evil that the Taliban and their allies represent, when you look at the very negative outcomes that the Taliban had imposed upon that country, something had to be done. As is usual in these cases, somebody needs to make a decision to do something about these problems in the world, these evils in the world. I pay tribute to those prepared to do what needed to be done. But of course the political determination is at one level. Ultimately to back up that political determination people need to be there on the ground. People need to pick up a rifle and they need to go to these places and take the action that needs to be taken. Evil needs to be opposed, bad people need to be stopped, and the women and children of Afghanistan need to be protected. We cannot look at these people like the Taliban or al-Qaeda and say that they are representatives of the mainstream within Afghanistan, because they are not. As usual with these sorts of elites, oligarchies or dominant forces, they rule for themselves with no regard for the people. The keeping of children, particularly girls, out of education is not an element of a progressive society. It is not an element of an organisation, a government, that has any legitimacy in the world anywhere. It fell to certain countries in the past to stand up and be counted and be prepared to send in the troops to deal with these people. So many of our soldiers have served with honour and great distinction in Afghanistan. As we know, 29 have now died for the cause. It has been a cause of honour, for good in the world, and we should never walk away from that. We should never count so much the cost that our determination should ever waiver. For those who have died, it is a great tragedy and it is a tragedy that their families will always have to live with, but if we were to walk away at any point before this job is done, then so much of what they have died for would be in vain. The trouble is that there are still evil people out there-the Taliban. As I said before, they do not rule for the people; they rule for themselves. They rule with a view of the world in a very skewed and negative manner that will never be in the best interests of the people in Afghanistan. In the future it may well be that more Australians may die, and that will never be acceptable. We should always strive to make sure that the chance of that is as limited as possible, but in the end the decisions that we make in this place and that the government makes in this place can have the ultimate impact on a family. Australians may die for a cause, and that tragedy may be repeated on many occasions yet. However, as I said before, we should never waiver from the commitment we have to doing the right thing in the world and MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Statements On Indulgence
254,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (11:29,"I welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to Privateto making the world a better place for not only people in this country but people in other countries around the world. The cause of democracy sometimes has to be fought for and sometimes Australians will have to pick up weapons and do what needs to be done. I pay tribute to the Australians who serve today and who have served the national interest and the cause of decency, good and democracy in the world. Many have done so. They have all done so with distinction. It is certainly my view that Private Matthew Lambert, a distinguished soldier from the 2nd Battalion, did not die in vain. He died for this good cause. I pay tribute to him, a great soldier, a great Australia, and I offer my sincerest condolences to his family and his spouse. I wish her all the best and I know that this parliament, with bipartisan support, will always see these soldiers and their families are looked after. my respects over the loss of another soldier in Afghanistan and another soldier from Townsville. A member of Townsville’s 2RAR, since transferring to the regular army in 2007, Private Matthew Lambert was a sniper and part of the Mentoring Task Force. Having served in East Timor in 2009, this was his first mission to Afghanistan, and he had been looking forward to again serving his country abroad. Those who knew Private Matthew Lambert have spoken of the respect that his fellow soldiers had for him and the skill he displayed in completing any task given to him. Private Lambert is the first member of 2RAR to be killed in action since the Vietnam War, and I know how tough the other day must have been for the soldiers in that battalion. 2RAR are indeed second to none. My thoughts are with them, though, at this difficult time. I also recognise the impact that this tragedy will have on the wider Townsville community. We are a tight community and the men and women of the ADF are a significant and valued part of that very tight and reserved community. There will be many in Townsville mourning the loss of Private Lambert this week, and his service and sacrifice for his nation will never be forgotten. Private Lambert was described by his mates as a loyal friend. His partner moved to Townsville two years ago to be with him during his post. I offer my deepest condolences to her and to Private Lambert’s family as they grieve his terrible loss. This is the 29th casualty our country has suffered in Afghanistan and the task of mourning the men we have lost is never easy for the Defence Force, the Australian community and this parliament. However, as other members and I have said in the past, we must never get away from what is our collective determination to finish the good work that Australia’s Defence Force men and women are doing here and in Afghanistan. Private Lambert was extremely proud to serve his battalion, his regiment and his country. It could be seen as cold comfort, but his family and friends can be proud of the job that he and his fellow servicemen have done and are continuing to do in Afghanistan. Substantial progress has been made as a result of Australia’s involvement, and we are on track to achieve our goals and our mission. This includes making the transition to Afghan-led security in the Oruzgan Province, a role that Private Lambert was strongly involved with as a part of the Mentoring Task Force. Enabling the Afghan people to independently keep their country secure is an extremely important job. It is vital for them and for international security that we stay the distance and see this mission fulfilled. I would like to offer my full support to 2RAR, to all Defence personnel in Afghanistan, and in fact other theatres abroad-anyone serving overseas-and those who will soon deploy MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Condolences
255,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (11:36,"TodayI rise to follow previous members in payingthere. I thank them for the job that they are going to be doing and are doing. Australia has lost another brave soldier, a battalion another mate, another family a son. As Private Lambert’s partner and family enter this incredibly difficult period, I offer them my deepest condolences and I hope that in some small way the knowledge of the high regard and admiration with which he was held by all who knew him and worked with him offers some level of comfort. I was at the pass-out parade for 2RAR, and Major General Gillespie spoke very highly of the job they were about to do. I know that Lieutenant Colonel Smith and his team were very proud of the job that they were doing. They were very eager to get across and do their work. The men and women of 3rd Brigade work very hard. They train and they are battle ready. He was at the point. To me, bravery is only a concept. Never in my life have I had to put my life on the line. To have the intestinal fortitude to take the point and lead the way for others bears noting. Private Matthew Lambert was brave, as are his colleagues. His bravery and his sacrifice has not gone unnoticed and will not be forgotten. Matthew Lambert, your deeds will live forever. You did what very few could do. You made a difference. Lest we forget. Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Defence Minister and all members who have so respectfully made a contribution to this motion, and in doing so of course have risen to pay their respects to and to honour Private Matthew Lambert. As others before me have indicated, Private Lambert was a sniper with the Townsville based 2RAR. He was of course very much part of an important campaign we have embarked upon in Afghanistan. I did not know Private Lambert, but as a former Defence MinisterI know many people like him. All of our soldiers are individuals and each and every one of them is different in some way, but there is something common to them all, and that is their courage, their high level of fitness and training, their very high level of competence and expertise, and in addition to that their commitment to their service and their thorough belief in what we are doing in Afghanistan. I am sure that Private Lambert is no exception to that rule. Nor do I know Private Lambert’s family and friends, but having spoken to so many family members of those who have fallen before Private LambertI would be very surprised if Private Lambert’s family were not fully supportive of what he was doing, were not fully aware that he believed in what he was doing, both the cause and the way he was pursuing that cause, and that he really wanted to be doing what he was doing. All members of the Australian Defence Force are volunteers. They undertake their task for the right reasons. I have not found an exception. All of them do it for the right reasons and because they believe in what they are doing. I also believe that both our soldiers and their parents fully appreciate the risks involved. Parents in particular are not happy about their sons taking those risks but are fully supportive of their decision to do so. We not only thank Private Lambert for his service today; we also thank his family, friends and spouse, who I should have included in my earlier comments about parents. We also thank them for lending their support to him in terms of what he had decided to do with his life. I say ‘life’, because in many senses this can be a lifetime commitment. This is No. 29, which is 29 lives too many. One life is too many. As I have said many times in this place, both as minister and as a private member, the longer we are in Afghanistan, the more people we lose, the more difficult it will be to take a majority of the Australian people MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Condolences
256,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"Chief Government Whip) (11:41): I join with the Primewith us, or in other words to persuade the majority of Australian people that we should be there. Again, like others, I take this opportunity to explain why we are there. We are there as part of an international force playing our role, an important role, in maintaining stability and safety in a global sense. We are also there to protect Australians, whether they be Australians here in Australia or indeed Australians travelling elsewhere in the world, including other countries in our neighbourhood. We have seen two very significant events both in Bali and in Jakarta, very close to home. Many Australians travel to that part of the world. This is about ensuring that these acts of terror do not again proliferate and come so close to our doorstep. Can we win? That is always the question. It is a reasonable question. There is not much point in being there given the expense both in human life and fiscal terms if we cannot win. I always say that it depends on what your definition is of ‘winning’. For me, winning is the international forces withdrawing from Afghanistan safe and secure in the knowledge that the Afghan national security forces, both police and armed forces, have the capacity to maintain their own security. Of course, that only comes if collectively we play a significant role in building an economy, in building governance and in building a justice system. I go back to the question, based on that definition, can we win in Afghanistan? I believe the answer is yes. It will not be easy. We as a country have now reconfigured our operations-I was minister at the time-to focus on the training of the Afghan National Army in particular but also the Afghan National Police, and we are still playing a role in those other areasgovernance building, aid and building an economy. But our key focus now is to lift the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army to a level in which not just we are confident but the international community is confident. The test is applied by NATO and not by us. It is not for us to determine when they are ready. 4th Brigade needs to reach a point where we are all collectively confident and satisfied that they are capable of maintaining their own security. All the reports that I receive are that we are making very good progress in that regard. I do not know the detail, but no doubt Matthew Lambert was patrolling with members of the Afghan National Army at the time of his tragic loss. We are making good progress. We are getting there. It is an achievable objective and we will get there. When we get there we can leave Afghanistan with the rest of our international partners and allies safe in the knowledge that Afghanistan will not again descend into chaos and will not again descend into a breeding ground and launching pad for those extremists determined to perpetrate their acts of terror indiscriminately not only in Afghanistan but around the globe, including potentially Australia. We have been very lucky on Australian soiltouch wood-thanks largely to our very competent intelligence and security bodies. We have been very lucky not to have an event here, but we know from those we have averted that it is very possible. Afghanistan and all of its consequences for the border region with Pakistan is very important in terms of maintaining our success in avoiding such attacks. Private Matthew Lambert, with his colleagues, was playing a very important role in that mission and achieving that objective. On that basis we say thank you to him for his huge sacrifice, we say thank you to his spouse and his family for their huge sacrifice, and we send the message to them that we shall not forget his deeds and we will maintain the course in his honour and finish this job. MAIN COMMITTEE Lambert, who was tragically killed while serving with Mentoring Task Force3 in Oruzgan Province in Afghanistan. Today, in this parliament, we offer our deepest sympathy to his family, to his friends and to his mates. I make particular reference to the member for Herbert, who spoke very eloquently earlier. Our thoughts are very much with the Townsville community in this difficult time and I am sure the member is providing excellent support for a community in mourning. Private Matthew Lambert’s colleagues described him as a man who excelled at any task he was assigned to and a soldier who proudly served his country. Only a few short weeks ago I returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was privileged to spend time with countless service men and women of the ADF, but I was particularly fortunate to spend a day with Mentoring Task Force 3. The men and women of MTF3 are proudly upholding the ANZAC legend, a legend that has seeped into our national consciousness. They are upholding courage; they are particularly upholding compassion, often in the face of significant adversity; and they are upholding the value of having a go and that eternal Australian spirit of mateship. The men and women of MTF3 are doing an incredibly good job in the face of difficult challenges. They are providing the essential framework for civil society to be born in Afghanistan. In doing so, in providing security and in enabling the Afghan people and particularly the Afghan National Army to provide their own security, they are providing that essential ingredient that will see this nation change eternally for the better. It is now more viable-and it will continue to be more viable due to the work of MTF3 and the ANA-for locals to be part of a proactive, prosperous and peaceful civil society. It will be more viable for them to be part of that than to pick up a weapon and continue to do what they have done for generations. This would not be possible without the work of MTF3 and soldiers like Private Lambert. It is incredibly encouraging to see on the ground the changes that are taking place in this country. These are changes that will not easily be eroded. When I was talking to members of MTF3 I said to them, ‘If we don’t get this right, is this like putting our hand into a bucket of water, only to withdraw our hand and see these changes go away?’ They assured me and then showed me some of the tangible gains that we are making. Because we have a safe security environment or a better security environment due to the work that MTF3 has done with the ANA, we have seen the opportunity for economic development to take place. A perfect example that they showed me was a short bitumen road that had been laid between two towns, providing the ability for economic development. They said that in the town at the end of the road the cost of an average commodity dropped by seven times when it was connected by this bitumen road. One of the great assets of a bitumen road is that you cannot lay IEDs underneath it. It continues this cycle of further security and further economic development. The Afghan locals I met are forever grateful for the work that MTF3 has done and the work that soldiers like Private Lambert have done. As a nation we mourn his loss, but we should be rightly proud of what he and the Australian soldiers are achieving in Oruzgan Province. Today we rightly honour Private Matthew Lambert, a man who proudly upheld everything his battalion stands for-duty first. the family and friends of Private Matthew Lambert. It is also a difficult time for the MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Condolences
257,Mr Clare (Blaxland,"Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:54): This is a terrible time forAustralian Army and the wider Australian community. Matthew joined the Australian Army as a reservist in 2005 at 20 years of age. When he first enlisted he joined the 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, the Fighting 9th. After 18 months he transferred into the Regular Army and was posted to Townsville with the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, in February 2007. He deployed to East Timor in the second half of 2009. He deployed to Afghanistan just two months ago as part of Mentoring Task Force 3. The Mentoring Task Force’s role is to train the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army to protect the people of Afghanistan. It is an important job. It is what ensures that the Taliban cannot just wait out coalition forces. When we leave Afghanistan we will leave an Afghan army and a police force able to protect the Afghan people. We are obviously now in the middle of what is a very deadly fighting season, and moments like this bear very heavily on the Australian people. It is important, at moments like this, to remember why we are in Afghanistan and the progress that we are making. As I have said in debates like this before, we are in Afghanistan because it is in our national interest to be there. It is in our national interest to be there because of the threat posed by an unstable Afghanistan. An unstable Afghanistan poses a threat that reaches far beyond its own borders. It affects its neighbours and it affects us. September 11 and the Bali bombings are proof of that. We are not in Afghanistan alone. We are one of 48 countries that are contributing to the same effort under the mandate of the United Nations. We are all there for the same reason. The threat posed to all countries by an Afghanistan where malign forces take root again is a significant one. We cannot pretend that what happens in Afghanistan does not affect us here in Australia. It does, and because it does it is right that we are there. I visited Afghanistan last month. Our soldiers told me of the progress that they are making. Our soldiers told me that where a few years ago they were at the head of a patrol, Afghan soldiers are now leading many patrols with Australian assistance. The work that we are doing in mentoring and training the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army is bearing fruit. Areas where fighting was taking place a couple of years ago are now relatively stable and we are expanding our footprint into new areas of the province. Khas Oruzgan is a good example of that. The district where Matthew sustained the injuries that killed him is a very bloody, very dangerous part of the Oruzgan Province where in the past insurgents have intimidated and murdered members of the local population. That the Mentoring Task Force and our Afghan partners are now patrolling in more districts like this is proof of the progress that is being made in Afghanistan. There is much more work to do, but the strategy that has now been adopted is the right one and we are on track to transfer responsibility for security in Oruzgan to Afghan authorities in 2014. We are making progress, but if we hand over responsibility to the Afghan army before they are ready to take over we will not leave a stable and secure Afghanistan. That is why the work of Matthew and his mates is so important. I visited the team that Matthew was part of three times in the last few months, first in Townsville in March to make sure the kitting system at Lavarack Barracks was working and that they have the equipment they need. I met with them for a second time in May this year at High Range in the Townsville Field Training Area to see their final training activity before they deployed to Afghanistan and I talked to them about the preparations they had made. The third time. I met them was four weeks ago in Afghanistan. They are a dedicated and professional group of men. They are led by a good man in Lieutenant Colonel Chris Smith MAIN COMMITTEE and they have lost a very good soldier. Matthew is the first member of 2RAR to be killed in action since the Vietnam War. I know his loss will be a huge blow to Lavarack Barracks and to the wider Townsville community. Brigadier Stuart Smith, the commander of 3rd Brigade, which includes 2RAR, said on Tuesday that Matthew was widely respected for his professionalism and commitment to duty and ‘his death has been felt deeply within our Army family’. In addition, he said that 'a family has lost a son and a young woman has lost a partner'. Like many young couples, Matthew and his partner, Ellesse, had just bought their first home and they had planned to live a life together. None of us in this place can ever properly imagine the grief that must be consuming her at this time or his parents, Chris and Vicki, or his sister Jess, but what we can do is honour him. Private Matthew Lambert is the 29th ADF member to lose his life in Afghanistan since 2001, the eighth since the beginning of this year. His CO, Lieutenant Colonel Chris Smith, said that he was a great Australian soldier, an ANZAC. He is a sniper, which says it all. He is an elite marksman. His soldiering skills are above all others and probably pound for pound one of the toughest and best soldiers in the battalion. Our responsibility is to be worthy of Private Matthew Lambert and the sacrifice that he has made. His father, Chris, said in a statement earlier today: He was an extraordinary young man with everything, including incredible physical and mental agility. Matt had a great enthusiasm for living life, generously sharing his time, thoughts and ideas and inspiring us all by walking the talk. It is our job to do just that, to walk the talk, to honour his memory with deeds not just words, and ensure that the job he went to Afghanistan to do is completed. Lest we forget. Two fresh-faced young adults joyfully posing for a social picture published in the Age newspaper yesterday. Her arm was around his shoulder and both had broad smiles. The photo portrayed just how much they enjoyed each other’s company. Ellesse Stronach, sadly, lost the love of her life when Matthew Lambert died on Monday. Matthew was a private in the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. He was the 29th Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan. Severely injured by a roadside bomb in Khas Oruzgan district of Oruzgan Province, the 26-year-old sniper was flown to the Australian base at Tarin Kowt but succumbed to his wounds shortly afterwards. 2RAR lost its first member of the war. Australia lost one of its finest, the bravest of the brave. Ellesse and Matthew’s family and wide circle of friends lost someone they cherished, someone they will never again be with or laugh with. Matthew gave up his life for the greater good of this world. Until recently Australian soldiers were rarely seen in the Khas Oruzgan Province, the farthest flung part of the province from Tarin Kowt. This is an area where the American Special Forces Base Anaconda is established. Khas Oruzgan was a violent place with tribal disputes. It has been the scene for appalling Taliban atrocities. In 2004, the Taliban killed 16 locals who were on their way to vote in national elections. In June last year Afghan police discovered the bodies of 11 Hazara, an ethnic minority persecuted by the Taliban, who had been beheaded. In November, the Taliban murdered seven Afghan police at a checkpoint in the district. However, in the past six months Australian troops have pushed east into the district alongside the Afghan National Army troops they are mentoring. According to sources, MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Wyatt Roy Longman 11 49 I Rise To Honour The Memory Of Private Matthew
258,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (12:01,"It was the happiest yet saddest of photographs.the fact regular troops as opposed to special forces are in the district is proof they and their Afghan allies are taking a tighter grip on the province. Private Matthew Lambert was patrolling in Oruzgan Province with Afghan soldiers at 2.30 am when what is believed to be an improvised explosive device went off. It is dangerous work that he and his colleagues were doing. The insurgents have learnt to reduce the amount of metal in the bombs to a minimum, making traditional mine-searching devices useless. An elite sniper, Private Lambert is originally from Kogarah in New South Wales and he would have been at the head of the Australian, US and Afghan troops out on foot patrol in those early hours of the morning. Private Lambert, sadly, tragically, is the 29th Australian soldier to die in the war on terror and the eighth soldier to die this year. Private Lambert was a member of Mentoring Task Force3 from 2RAR based in Townsville. He joined the Army in southern Queensland, enlisting in the 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, in August 2005, transferring to 2nd Battalion RAR in February 2007 and being posted to Townsville. It was there at 2RAR where Private Lambert was enlisted as a sniper, and he is the first member of 2RAR to be killed in action since the Vietnam War. Private Lambert did two tours of duty in East Timor in 2009 and was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Australian Service Medal, Australian Defence Medal and Timor Solidarity Medal. Private Lambert was on his first mission in Afghanistan and had been deployed in June 2011. The men and women who serve so bravely for us in Afghanistan are people of whom we can be immensely proud. They are working to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan and to the world. Australia is there to help them because we are not immune from the terrorist acts planned from Afghanistan for so long. Australians have been killed at the hands of terrorist activity, and our soldiers are directly protecting our freedom to move unencumbered by the threats of terrorist activity. Their work is of great importance and the sacrifice of Private Lambert is such that, whilst we mourn his death, we should also be very proud of his colleagues’ and his efforts both now and into the future. Our thoughts are with his partner, Ellesse, parents, family and the brave Australian men and women who are carrying on the work Matthew did so well in Afghanistan. They will miss their loved one dearly. It is during these sad times that we are reminded of the sacrifice these men and women make in order to bring peace and stability to a country so they may live a life as good and as democratic as ours. We must count the cost of staying in Afghanistan, but we must also recognise the great cost of what would happen if we withdrew. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition’s sentiment that we best honour the dead by remaining true to the cause. Private Lambert was a well-respected soldier who excelled at any task assigned and was looking forward to serving his country further in Afghanistan. Serving in rough areas barely accessible by vehicle, he patrolled the valleys by foot, manned the battlements and mentored the Afghan soldiers he loved and fought with. In the words of the Defence chief, General David Hurley: ‘They are fathers, husbands, sons, brothers and mates. They are soldiers and Australians. We will not forget their selfless sacrifice.’ As the member for Riverina, where Wagga Wagga or, more specifically, the Army recruit training centre at Kapooka is known as the 'home of the soldier', may I say: lest we forget. MAIN COMMITTEE family of Private Matthew Lambert. Tragically, Private Lambert was the 29th Australian to die in Afghanistan and the eighth this year. He was only 26 and on his first tour of Afghanistan. A New South Welshman by birth, he enlisted in the 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, in August 2005 and was later posted to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, in Townsville. He had served with distinction in East Timor and together with the Timor-Leste Solidarity Medal had also been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the Australian Defence Medal. He will be sadly missed by his colleagues in uniform who had a great deal of respect for this very fine soldier. The Chief of the Defence Force, General Hurley, said, ‘His colleagues describe him as a man who excelled at any task he was assigned and a soldier who was proud to serve his country.’ Despite this tragic loss, Australia must continue with its important mission in Afghanistan. Having visited Oruzgan Province and Kandahar earlier this year, I saw first hand the real progress that our military is making in Afghanistan. Training the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police is the first priority, for they will be the future protectors of their country from the insidious influence that is the Taliban. In addition to the military angle, local development projects are also critical to Afghanistan’s future. Australia’s involvement in building a school, a mosque, trade training facilities and other important initiatives are all making lives better for the ordinary Afghani. Our deployment in Afghanistan is not getting any easier, but this should come as no surprise for the stakes are high. Stability on the Afghan-Pakistan border and progress in the global war on terrorism is what is in play. Were Australia to leave Afghanistan precipitantly, hard-fought gains would be compromised and the objective of our mission set back. Today our nation mourns the loss of Private Matthew Lambert, a family man and a soldier of the highest order. Our country will never forget his sacrifice, and our thoughts and our prayers are with his family at this difficult time. Lest we forget. associate myself with the fine words that have been said in this debate. Private Matthew Lambert, tragically struck down at the age of 26 while serving his country in a theatre of war in Oruzgan Province in Afghanistan, is the 29th Australian to have died in that campaign and, as has been said, the eighth this year. The loss of any life in our armed forces is an absolute tragedy and one that is proper that we mark here in this place. Private Lambert was a highly decorated and highly regarded soldier who had served abroad on numerous occasions. He will be sorely missed by his comrades in arms and by his family. I would like to associate myself with the words that have been said by members on all sides of the House. Debate adjourned.

261,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (12:11,"I am delighted to join with others congratulatingFrance. I do so as a member of the Riders on the Hill group, who ride up hills a lot slower than Cadel does. Thankfully he rides a lot faster. In July 2006 I was standing in a queue at Charles de Gaulle with my wife and daughter when I heard a slightly high-pitched Australian voice behind me. Looking around, we recognised that it was the man whom we had watched finish fifth in the Tour de France on the Champs Elysees the day before. He was later elevated to fourth in that first post-Lance tour after the winner, Floyd Landis, was disqualified for drug use. It was the best result ever for an Australian at that stage, eclipsing Phil Anderson’s two fifth placings in La Grand Boucle, as the French call the famous tour. For the next few minutes we chatted to Cadel and his Italian wife, Chiara. He was looking forward at that stage to returning to his European home, having spent the previous 21 days riding more than 3,500 kilometres around France at an average speed, including going up mountains like Alpe D’Huez and Galibier, of some 40 kilometres an hour. Although he was obviously tired, he was relaxed and happy to talk to a few Aussies at the airport. Indeed, he enthused about returning to Barwon Heads over the Christmas and summer break. Before he left, Chiara offered to take a photograph of us, a photograph which I treasure even more since he has won the Tour de France. It was the first time that most Australians had heard of him. If an Australian cyclist was known it was more likely to be Robbie McEwen, who had stood on the podium in Paris as wearer of the green sprint jersey on three occasions, or Stuart O’Grady, the prolific winner of track and road races, including Olympic medals. Many people even had difficulty in pronouncing his Christian name when they first heard it. But in the next two years he would come tantalisingly close to winning the tour. Somehow his Belgium based Lotto team did not seem to have the right support riders. Other teams seemed to protect their climbing stars, helping them over the high passes in the Alps and the Pyrenees. Cadel often seemed alone fighting odds beyond his control. But it did not affect his easygoing personality. At the following year’s Jayco series in Victoria, he participated in Amy’s Ride with thousands of recreational cyclists. Amy’s Ride, of course, commemorates the life of Amy Gillett, who was tragically killed in a training accident in Germany. The Amy’s Foundation works towards doing two things, addressing safety on our roads, particularly for cyclists, and assisting upand-coming female cyclists. On that day, after assisting legendary commentator Phil Liggett, Cadel chatted with fans, signing autographs and having his photo taken with many of them for an hour or more. I remember another occasion when we were fortunate to meet him and how he chatted away for about 10 minutes encouraging my youngest son, who had just taken up racing. The high hopes of an Australian winner crashed the following year when Cadel finished 30th. Something clearly troubled him in that tour, but apart from some cryptic comments he kept it to himself. He also had bad luck in Vuelta a Espana, the Tour of Spain, losing valuable time with a puncture at the foot of a steep climb, yet he fought back to finish third in a tour he thought he could have won. Interestingly, at that stage many critics wrote off Cadel and said he could not win the Tour de France-he could only ride at one pace, he did not have the brilliance of Lance Armstrong or Alberto Contador and he had not won a major one-day classic. Indeed, prior to the 2009 World Championships, the Swiss champion Fabian Cancellara dismissed Evans’s chances in the road race. MAIN COMMITTEE Much of that criticism was put to rest in five kilometres at Mendrisio, Switzerland, in September 2009. Approaching the last hill in the 262-kilometre World Championship road race, Cadel simply rode away from some of the best cyclists on the globe and in doing so he became the first Australian winner of that prestigious world championship event. Michael Rogers had won the time trial three times and Stephen Hodge, who rides with us here in Canberra, had twice won the amateur race which was regarded previously as the unofficial world championship for time trialling, the Grand Prix de Nations. Then, of course, we had Robbie McEwen’s second placing, which was the closest otherwise in coming to wear the rainbow jersey in the road race for any Australian. It was a very fitting outcome for an understated champion who conducts himself with modesty and humility. In 2010 Cadel had more bad luck. He crashed, he had a hairline fracture in his elbow and he finished a disappointing 26th in the event. All that turned around this year. He won one of the first races of the season, the Tirreno-Adriatico. He then followed that up by winning the Tour de Romandie. He finished second in the Criterium-du-Dauphine. Of course, as we all know now, he came out and won the Tour de France. Australians have dreamt of winning the Tour de France for a century. Of all the world’s great individual sporting contests, it has remained outside our grasp. Edwin Flack claimed gold on the track of the first modern Olympics. Our swimmers regularly beat the best in the pool and our track cyclists have often dominated on the velodrome. But cycling’s greatest challenge has escaped us. Ever since Don Kirkham and Snowy Munro contested the 12th running of the Tour de France in 1914 Australians have returned to France in search of victory. This year they have found it, and I am sure that Cadel’s victory will encourage the many hundreds and thousands of young cyclists in Australia to seek to emulate him in coming years. I am sure that the Australian victory and that great occasion when he was on the podium on the Champs Elysees with the Australian Tina Arena singing the national anthem will not be the last occasion that we see an Australian win the Tour de France. Congratulations, Cadel. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12:18): I congratulate Cadel Evans on his wonderful achievement. I am not a bike rider, which is obvious to everybody here, but my alter ego is a fit person and I am an Australian who is inspired by the efforts of people like Cadel Evans. I congratulate him as well as his team, BMC, who were all active contributors to Cadel’s win. I congratulate also SBS on its wonderful coverage on the Tour de France each year. Cadel does epitomise the Australian story. Born in Katherine in the Northern Territory, he spent his first four years growing up in the Indigenous community of Barunga, 80 kilometres outside Katherine. I am sure that when he began at the age of two riding a 16-inch BMX bike he never imagined the heights he would achieve in the cycling field. To go from that little boy of two in Katherine to the man standing on that podium on the Champs Elysees is a dream that again says Australians can achieve whatever they want with the right courage, conviction and support. The Tour de France this year covered more than 3,430 kilometres in 21 stages. I confess I only watched 11 nights of it continuously. It was arduous for the riders and a little arduous for federal members of parliament as well, who were quite addicted to it. It is the world’s most competitive cycling race and Cadel Evans is the first Australian to win the Tour de France. He is also the oldest first-time winner at the age of 34. MAIN COMMITTEE Starting that last full day of the tour almost one minute behind the leader, Cadel finished second in the time trial and secured his victory in the tour overall. I think we also feel very proud that Cadel was very gracious in victory. Not only did he pay tribute to his team and to the other competitors; he dedicated his win to his late mentor, Aldo Sassi, who died of cancer in 2010. His career has been a most interesting one. Going from 1998-99, the first overall in the Mountain Bike World Cup, second in 1997 and 1999 in the under-23 World Championships, and he won the young riders competition of Australia’s very own Tour Down Under in the Adelaide Hills before converting to road racing full time in the summer of 2000. But then, of course, he made that wonderful transition to Tour de France-type events, going away from mountain bike riding. He achieved high placings in the Tour de France in 2005, coming eighth; in 2006, fourth; in 2007 and 2008 he came second; and in 2007 he was named Australian Cyclist of the Year. In 2009 he won the World Championship road race in Mendrisio, Switzerland. All of us wanted him to win. He has come so close so many times. To watch him make that additional effort this time was quite amazing. The ABC termed Cadel the thinking man’s champion after he wore a T-shirt in support of Tibet and the Tibetan people’s struggle with mainland China during the 2008 Tour de France. It was a gutsy thing to do. At the time Cadel commented that trying to bring awareness of the Tibet movement is something someone in his position can do. It is good to know that he is also associated with causes that he believes in and has the courage to be a well-rounded person rather than just a single-interest cyclist. Cadel is currently competing in the US Pro Cycling challenge. Cadel finished the first stage in fourth place, 17 seconds behind the leader, Levi Leipheimer. We wish him well in this ongoing event. I would also say to Cadel Evans, thank you on behalf of all Australians, cyclists and noncyclists for the pleasure you gave us, and to SBS. The viewing is a pleasure. As a member of parliament, I am sorry but I can see such parallels in the clever tactics that have to be used to win such races. It is not always about speed and skill. It is a tactical game. I get a bit hooked on that sometimes too. We would like to see more of that perhaps here in this place. I would also not so much thank Cadel Evans but acknowledge that because of him and a little contribution from the coverage of the News of the World investigations and the committees in England, in the UK parliament, I did suffer jetlag for at least a week after going to sleep at 2 o’clock for 10 days. I agree with some of the things that have been said and published about Cadel. An editorial published in the Age said that his victory in the 2011 Tour de France entitles him to a place alongside the world’s leading cricketer Donald Bradman; billiards wizard Walter Lindrum, swimming legend Dawn Fraser and the crew of the America’s Cup winning yacht Australia II on the list of Australian sporting heroes who have taken on the world’s best in their field and prevailed. An editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald likewise described it as one of the greatest wins in Australia’s illustrious sporting history. Congratulations, Cadel. May your career deliver to you the satisfaction and success that you have achieved so far, and may you continue to bring great pride to the Australia people. electorate of Flinders in relation to the victory of Cadel Evans in this year’s Tour de France.

262,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (12:12,"It gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of myto yield’, and that is the story of Cadel Evans’s career as well as his victory in this year’s Tour de France. The lessons are very simple for Australians. It is that sense of the joy of participation, the commitment to the long term, determination and then graciousness in defeat and graciousness in victory. All of these are qualities that have been embodied by Cadel Evans’s career and Cadel Evans’s victory in this year’s Tour de France. I am delighted that, if not a Victorian by birth, he is certainly a Victorian now. Indeed, he comes from the Bellarine Peninsula, which is opposite the Mornington Peninsula. We can almost claim him as one of our own. The most significant thing to come out of it is that sense of participation, joy and purpose from pure activity and pure commitment. That is a lesson which hopefully will inspire young people to pursue their dreams, to seek that which they aspire to. It is something that I have seen talked about in primary schools. I visited primary schools in the week after the Evans victory and the kids were very excited. I think that was a great thing for an Australian but a greater thing still for young Australians. There will be debate in coming decades, and it will be joyful debate, whether Evans, Bradman, Lindrum or Fraser is the greatest of our athletes. But I think one thing that will probably emerge is that in terms of individual sporting achievements, as great as the America’s Cup was, as great as other events, Phar Lap’s victories, as great as Bradman’s 1930 tour of England was, this will probably rank as the single greatest sporting achievement of the period up until now. Careers will be defined and it will be hard to go past Bradman’s career. But in terms of individual sporting achievements I think I would probably put my money on this one. That is for tragic sports historians, such as most of the members of parliament, to debate in years to come. Returning to Tennyson and Ulysses, it really is the case that the lessons we learn from this will be used to inspire and to elevate Australian schoolchildren in decades to come and we will remember that the lesson of Ulysses is the same lesson of Evans-to strive, to seek, to find but not to yield. acknowledge extraordinary efforts by Australians. When one looks at the Tour de France it is notable that success requires a remarkable combination of fitness, skill, tactics, ability and just a dash of luck. There are so many things that can go wrong, often through no fault of your own. The task of a true champion is not only to master the physical and mental challenges that come with such a long event but also to take every step to minimise the chances of an accident. Cadel Evans has done that and so much more. In a sport that has been beset by scandal in recent years, Cadel has stood out as a rider who has achieved his results on merit. He has demonstrated a commitment and tenacity that has allowed him to overcome adversity and to take his losses and turn them into victory. Like most Australians, I do not know Cadel. I have observed his achievements through the media. As I watched, I saw him fall short of outright victory on so many occasions. But he never gave up. His result in the Tour de France this year was a remarkable achievement. That result provides inspiration for so many others, particularly in Australia. Why? Because Australians share the ride with our sporting heroes. We share the pain of their defeats and the MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Statements On Indulgence
263,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (12:28,"I believe that it is important that we in this placejoy of their victories. That is the stuff of being Australian. Indeed, a friend of mine, Mr Phil Kesby not only shares those sporting successes with Cadel Evans but he fixes his bike in front of the TV and he actually rides his bike during the length of the Tour de France. This year because of Cadel’s success he even rode during the replays, so you can imagine he was probably just as exhausted as Cadel by the end of it. In Cadel’s case, sharing his Tour de France victory is so much sweeter because he had to work so hard, so much sweeter because he had lost before but had never given up. It is a comment on sport that coming second is seen to be a loss, but there is nothing like victory. This great victory will resonate throughout Australia. It will put more people on bicycles. My local retailers are telling me that this is the case. Bicycles continue to outsell cars as they have done since the year 2000 in Australia. Importantly, the more people we see on bicycles the better the health outcomes for our community. A bit of fitness reduces the risk of heart attack; we all know that. This is what Cadel has done, because his inspiration puts more people on bikes. In Ryan and in Brisbane there has been a concerted effort by the Brisbane City Council to build the infrastructure for safe cycling. With the leadership of then Lord Mayor Campbell Newman and the current Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Cr Graham Quirk, they are committed to helping ordinary people get on bicycles. As the then Chairman of Public and Active Transport, I was responsible for planning and constructing $100 million-plus worth of bikeways and enhancements throughout the city. The great achievement that we were able successfully to deliver was invariably the difficult missing links that had been left undone by previous administrations so that we have a connected network throughout the city. The other great advantage we have is that Cadel Evans is an outspoken supporter of cyclists wearing helmets. On his website Cadel made the point: Physically I am completely unsuitable for almost all Australian school sports. Nearly all Australian school sports require speed and/or size. WhilstI am sure that things have changed since Cadel was at school, it is important that we bear in mind that sport is not just for a small group of physically advantaged children. Finally, let me say a simple well done to an ordinary bloke but in part because of that a genuinely great Australian. The image of Cadel Evans on top of the podium in front of the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs Elysees draped in the Australian flag will forever be etched in Australia’s history. Debate adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Gilmore Electorate: Steel Industry BlueScope Steel in the Illawarra. Many of the workers live in the Shellharbour area of the Gilmore electorate and I would like to read a letter sent to me yesterday to show how a steelworker views the situation. Mr Michael Grogan of Shellharbour writes: MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Statements On Indulgence
264,Mr Stephen Jones,I move:,160,Adjournment
265,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12:33,"Much has been said about the tragedy of job losses atI am writing this letter to you all as a lifelong resident of the South Coast and Illawarra. I am married with 2 children that I have great hope for. I have been employed at the Port Kembla Steelworks since leaving school in 1983. In that time. I have seen a vast number of changes take place both inside the works and in our community in general. Until now, I have not seen one that has had the potential to be as devastating to the community as the one announced yesterday regarding the removal of 800 plus jobs. As a citizen of this community I am calling on you to change the way you think. As our elected representatives the time has come for change. Rescue packages, bailout packages, relocation packages are all after the fact results. When I watch the news and hear the Prime Minister and Industry Minister address what happened yesterday with political spin and rhetoric I wonder what the future is for my country as a whole. Growing up and being educated as a child and young man, I was regaled with stories of the growth of this country. The Snowy Hydro scheme, the irrigation of the Riverina, even the building of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. All symbols of the growth and prosperity of our great nation. PerhapsI was naive and idealistic to believe it could continue. But why shouldn’t it? We need to look beyond the ends of our noses. Bureaucracy needs to disappear. Like our forefathers, as a nation we need to start to make things happen. In our area alone a number of initiatives could go ahead that could create employment and long term growth opportunities. The raw material that we are digging out of the ground and sending to China is doing just that. They are building solid infrastructure. We should be doing the same. What is stopping a second airport being built near Goulburn with a fast train that services Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne? A percentage of the material involved could be sourced from Australian suppliers such as BlueScope. It would certainly be a faster journey than catching the train from Sydney Airport to Oak Flats. We built the SeaCliff bridge, why don't we have a fast train that services Sydney from the Illawarra? It would drastically reduce road traffic, while again creating local jobs. The Shellharbour Marina must occur. Why spend $100 million relocating displaced steel workers? Spend it building something that will employ them in their local area. Whether or not the residents of Shellharbour oppose it based on their own personal wants is no longer valid, it is a growth opportunity for our area. Housing estates are not long term employment options. Long term decisions need to be made We have a fantastic port that is under utilised. The Illawarra region is a prime candidate for processing plants that are being sent overseas, provided transport infrastructure is up to scratch. Again, an opportunity for BlueScope, local fabricators and the people of the Illawarra. Business will be encouraged to invest in the area if the correct facilities are in place. Getting these facilities is going to take bi partisan support and some extra attention being focused on our region. You all need to remember that the Illawarra doesn't have the same sized coal and viticulture industry to fall back on that the Hunter region had. The floods in Queensland and Victoria are another example of the potential for infrastructure and growth. I understand the need for environmental conservation as much as anyone, but a lot of the natural flora and fauna of these areas is no longer there. Building dams and causeways, trapping water so that we do not have periods and extreme between drought and flood, piping water to regional Australia can only benefit us all in the long run. It will also allow our native flora and fauna to flourish. There is even a tourism potential in these areas with houseboats, introduced fishing etc. The list is endless. Lastly, the level of youth unemployment in our region has been too high for too long. Current events aren't going to help that. The Steelworks once trained hundreds of apprentices who have since gone on to all sorts of vocations. That opportunity hasn't existed for a long time. The disaffected youth of Great Britain have shown what can happen when people don't have a reason to get out of bed in the morning. MAIN COMMITTEE What is to stop any school leaver that is unemployed for more than 6 months spending time in the armed services to learn either a trade or a job specific skill such as driving heavy equipment? They would then be able to go and work in these regional and mining areas that have a shortage of skills. They don't have to go to war, they just need to enhance their skill set. If they find employment whilst training they should be free to leave so they can take up the offer. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope it has provided some food for thought with some of my ideas. Being a government in surplus due to holes being dug in the ground shouldn't be our sole focus. I urge you to look to the visionaries of the past. Seize upon their ideals and beliefs so that we can make this country grow once more. We are the envy of the world in so many ways, and we have the opportunity to remain that way through your leadership. I await your non politicised replies. I could not agree more with Mr Grogan, and I ask that my colleagues-and I note the member for Throsby is in the chamber-to take heed and lobby the RDA for some of those projects to take place, especially the marina at Shellharbour, which would create 1,000 jobs. I thank Mr Grogan for his views and respect the fact that he is asking for bipartisan support. I assure him that this side of the politics will not make matters any worse by the introduction of a carbon tax. Greenway Electorate: Maltese Community Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (12:38): TodayI rise to pay tribute to the considerable Maltese community in my electorate of Greenway. I want to specifically mention a few events: firstly, the 50th anniversary of the Maltese Herald newspaper; and the 92nd anniversary of the Maltese uprising. Greenway has a long and valuable history of Maltese settlement, from the market gardens in the north, which are now being built out into houses as we speak, and Pendle Hill in the south, which for many years was-and still is in some areas-known as Little Malta. On 30 JulyI attended the 50th anniversary of the Maltese Herald newspaper in Blacktown. Since its inception, the Maltese Herald has made an enormous contribution to the success of Australian multiculturalism by promoting Maltese culture and, most importantly, providing a voice for Maltese Australians. In so doing, it continues to encourage participation in the life of our community and strengthens the very deep and special ties that bind our two countries. I congratulate the newspaper’s editor, Mr Lino Vella AM, for his long standing and continued commitment to the Maltese Herald. Mr Vella has been the newspaper’s editor since 1971 and was recognised for his service to the Maltese community in 1999 by being made a Member of the Order of Australia. It was a very appropriate tribute dinner with hundreds in attendance to honour his very fine contribution. I would also like to mention a very special anniversary, the 92nd anniversary of the Maltese uprising, on 7 June of this year. It is a very important day in the Maltese calendar, and I was privileged to attend those commemoration activities in Pendle Hill. The Maltese uprising signalled the end of the British Empire’s hold on the small island of Malta and the birth of a nation. During this violent uprising, four Maltese citizens were shot dead by British troops. The victims included Giuseppe Bajada, Emmanuele Attard, Lorenzo Dyer and Carmelo Abela. The 1919 riots impelled the country to establish the first responsible government in Malta in 1921, the first time Maltese citizens could actually elect Maltese members of parliament. MAIN COMMITTEE Greenway, as I have said in this place many times, is an excellent example of the multicultural fabric of Australia and is something that I am extremely grateful for. There are some 4,640-strong Maltese community members in the electorate, which continues to growand I am sure we will see that in the latest census results. A big part of this multicultural landscape are the many Maltese friends who are great contributors to our local community. The Maltese community in Australia is a proud and passionate people, and they will tell you that themselves. They have enriched the Australian cultural landscape with their customs and beliefs and our society is strengthened by their contribution. I also acknowledge the work of an individual, Fred Fenech OAM, who is the President of the Maltese Community Council of New South Wales, and his tireless efforts in a range of areas including settlement services, welfare, aged care, education, the teaching of the Maltese language, advocacy, business networking, entertainment, sport and recreation and, above all, youth. Over the years the council has taken the initiative in many issues affecting the well-being of the Maltese community in Australia, including dual citizenship for migrants, for children of migrants and more recently for grandchildren of migrants. The campaign for dual citizenship was started by a call to all members of the Maltese parliament in 1974. Various other approaches and media campaigns followed until the grant to migrants in 1989, to children of migrants in 2000, and to all applicants of unbroken Maltese descent only in 2007. I pay tribute to the special and lasting contribution of Maltese Australians to our nation’s story and particularly the local story in Greenway. The links between Malta and Australia are almost as old as Australian settlement itself, beginning with the first Maltese convict arrivals in 1810. Around 60,000 Maltese settled in Australia during the two decades following World War II, and others followed in subsequent years. All have made an exceptional contribution to Australia through their hard work and faith in the future of their new nation. I feel very strongly about multiculturalism and the role it plays in our society and the diverse range of cultures that contribute to the vibrant nature of our own lives. Without the Maltese community in Australia. I am sure we would lose a very important aspect of our multicultural identity. In conclusion, I thank the Maltese community for their ongoing contribution to the local community in Greenway, reaffirm my commitment to and support for multiculturalism in their country and its ongoing contribution from the Maltese community themselves. McPherson Electorate: Manufacturing Industry businesses within my electorate of McPherson. Manufacturing as a whole has been struggling across the nation, and over 100,000 jobs have been lost over the last three years from that sector alone. Many of the issues that are being experienced across Australia are also reflected in my electorate of McPherson. The Gold Coast economy has long been considered dependent on tourism and construction, but there is also a significant manufacturing and education presence on the Gold Coast and we need to develop those sectors to support employment, particularly when there is a downturn in tourism and construction as there is at present. Unemployment is an issue in itself on the southern Gold Coast. The most recent ABS figures for July this year show that unemployment on the southern Gold Coast was 6.4 per cent. This compared with a Queensland average of 5.4 per cent and a national average of 5.1 per cent. On the southern Gold Coast our unemployment rate is one per cent higher than the MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment
266,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (12:42,"I rise to speak about the local manufacturingaverage Queensland rate and about 1.5 per cent higher than the national average. However, I am not convinced that the data represents the actual unemployment rates and circumstances that we are experiencing currently on the Gold Coast. The hidden or forgotten statistic applies predominantly but not exclusively to women. This is the part-time and casual workforce. Many businesses have reduced or stopped completely engaging casuals and part-time employees, and this situation is not captured entirely by the ABS statistics. Arguably, the unemployment statistics for the Gold Coast are much higher than reported. However, it is not all doom and gloom on the Gold Coast, because there are opportunities for us there. I recently visited a local manufacturer, the Rockcrush Group in Burleigh Heads. Rockcrush manufactures marine winches, mining winches and general winches as well as dredges. Rockcrush prides itself on the export of these dredges, which are equipped with the latest technology and are designed for modular containerisation, which allows for easy transportation, handling and assembly overseas. I thank the CEO of Rockcrush, Peter van den Berg, and his staff for welcoming me and the member for Indi to their site. Most of the staff at Rockcrush are skilled boilermakers and so on. Mr van den Berg explained to us that there was capacity at that site to increase the number of skilled boilermakers, but he has had issues finding quality, skilled and experienced boilermakers on the Gold Coast as many of these workers are seeking employment in regions with major manufacturing industries. There is clearly an opportunity for the Gold Coast. We do have the capacity to increase our manufacturing and to bring more manufacturers into the Gold Coast, and we have a number of industrial estates within my electorate, including Burleigh, Burleigh Waters and Currumbin. I recently hosted a manufacturing forum with the member for Indi at the Gold Coast, and we invited along representatives from various manufacturing industries in my electorate, and also the surfboard industry, to talk about the issues that were of concern to them. During the discussion the issue of imported surfboards was raised. Our manufacturers realise they need to compete with international manufacturers and that is not an issue for them. What is an issue is the incorrect labelling of the boards that are being imported for sale in Australia. The ‘Australian Made’ logo has been identifying local manufactured products for many years. However, alternative versions of this logo including the Australian flag or the words ‘Made in Australia’ can deceive consumers into buying goods which they believe will benefit our local manufacturers and stimulate our economy but are not necessarily made here. According to the fact sheet titled ‘Labelling requirements for surfboards’ from the Australian Customs Service, imported surfboards: … require a trade description with the name of the country in which the goods were made or produced … I note that the trade description must be in the form of a principal label or brand, and there are various other requirements. Local manufacturers say this is not always the case, and the boards imported from overseas are not necessarily correctly labelled. This becomes an issue for our local surfers who want to purchase local boards and are often deceived and lured in by incorrect labelling. We call for correct labelling to assist our surfboard manufacturing. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Shortland Electorate: Broadband Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (12:48): The Hunter and Central Coast Boards of Regional Development Australia have made a joint submission to the National Broadband Network Company, NBN Co, outlining the case for the two regions to be included in NBN Co’s list of regions for a priority rollout of the National Broadband Network. The National Broadband Network is essential in this country. Regions that are successful in being allocated an early rollout of the NBN will benefit enormously. It is like the development of electricity was at the turn of the 20th century. It has the ability to transform regions and our economy. It is the ability to link in to the latest knowledge and the latest technology, to be able to work from home and your region and to be able to do so many more things locally. Government members of parliament in the Hunter and on the Central Coast are being very supportive of the RDA’s submission, as have all levels of government. The local councils in the Hunter and the Central Coast have joined together in support of this submission, local businesses have supported the submission and state members of parliament have supported the submission. It is fairly unique to have across-the-board support for a proposal. I might add that not all the councils are Labor-held councils. I would say the majority of them are not Labor-controlled councils. This shows that those regions and those local government areas can recognise how it will benefit their areas. I have been particularly involved with the proposal with the RDA on the Central Coast. They have been very active with the business community in promoting the NBN and the benefits to the Central Coast. This has been driven by the local business community. The local business community on the Central Coast has said, ‘We want the NBN.’ This has the potential to change our local economy. This has the potential to link the Central Coast to any part of the world. It is cutting-edge technology. This is the technology that is so important for us to develop as a region. I pay particular credit to the Central Coast RDA Board, led by the Chair, John Dawson, a man who has previously been the general manager of Wyong Shire Council; and the wonderful CEO, Anthony Dow, who is an example of the type of CEO that should be employed by an RDA. He engages with the community on all levels. He engages with all levels of government. He engages with people of all political persuasions, and of course, very importantly, he engages with the business community. For the NBN to be successfully integrated into a local economy you need to have the support of all the people, all the levels of government and the business that I have already mentioned. I have to pay particular credit also to Wyong Shire Council and Gosford Council, particularly Wyong Council’s general manager, Michael Whittaker, and Bob Platt, the chief information systems officer. They have put in a lot of hard work to pave the way for the NBN network to be rolled out early on the Central Coast. Early rollout is an advantage, as I have mentioned, for business, e-education, e-health and the community generally. I acknowledge the hard work of local businessman David Abrahams, who has contributed to his local community on a number of levels. He has been an enthusiastic and passionate supporter of the National Broadband Network. Federal members are pleased to have been able to lead a delegation of business leaders, council and RDA to brief Ministers Conroy and Crean and to work closely with NBN Co in the Central Coast’s preparation for this early rollout. MAIN COMMITTEE Sovereign Wealth Funds able to see an opportunity until it had ceased to be one.’ It is a warning the Gillard government would do well to heed. On the back of China and India’s historic industrialisation, Australia is enjoying a once in a generation mining boom. Our terms of trade are at a 140-year high and the Australian dollar is at levels not seen since the floating exchange rate was adopted in 1983. Treasury estimates that the mining boom will produce a windfall gain of $30 billion for the government in the current financial year, on top of the $65 billion that has already flowed to Labor since its election in 2007. What is more, these so-called rivers of gold show no sign of abating. In a speech earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Dr Martin Parkinson was at pains to emphasise that we are seeing not a temporary appreciation, but a sustained shift in the exchange rate. The terms of trade may come back slowly over time, with Treasury estimating a fall by around 20 per cent over a 15-year period. Such a prediction will see the Australian dollar, in Parkinson’s words, ‘remain consistently high for some time’. This is both a challenge and an opportunity for Australia. Ensuring the competitiveness of our manufacturing base and other important exchange-rate-exposed sectors, like tourism, will not be easy. Workplace reform and productivity gains will be key. But at the same time Australia has a unique opportunity. We must save the proceeds of the boom and invest it for a time when it is needed most. International experience would indicate that a sovereign wealth fund for a commodity-driven economy like ours could be an appropriate vehicle towards this end. Sovereign wealth funds are not new. Kuwait established theirs in 1953, Abu Dhabi in 1977 and Norway in 1990. Owned by the government, these funds and others like them in Chile, Russia and Qatar hold, manage or administer a diverse set of financial assets in the pursuit of commercial objectives. They are distinct from state-owned enterprises whose remit often includes the ownership and operation of commercial businesses. It is estimated that today around $4 trillion in assets are held by sovereign wealth funds. While other mature assets classes like pension funds are significantly larger, it is expected sovereign wealth funds will grow significantly over time and could surpass $6 trillion by 2012. In other words, they are here to stay. A sovereign wealth fund can perform a number of different functions. It can be the source of long-term wealth creation, otherwise known as intergenerational equity, or have a shorter term objective to stabilise revenue cycles. In the case of the former, when the finite resources run out, future generations will still benefit from the wealth created. In the case of the latter, when commodity prices take a downward turn there will be money available for governments to call upon when it is needed. In both instances, countries that use the significant reserves of a sovereign wealth fund to invest offshore may see downward pressure on the exchange rate, providing welcome relief for the non-commodity export sector, which constantly lives in fear of catching the Dutch disease. In terms of determining the best fit for Australia, Chile’s sovereign wealth funds are quite instructive. In 2006, Chile morphed its existing copper stabilisation fund into two funds, the first of which is a pension savings fund which they seeded with $600 million and contributed 0.2 per cent of the previous year’s GDP to on an annual basis. In the event the fiscal surplus is greater than 0.2 per cent, the fund can receive a maximum of 0.5 per cent of GDP. Significantly, no withdrawals are allowed from this fund for the first 10 years.

Given Chile’s strong commodity based economy, both these funds are designed to provide the government with fiscal flexibility should the commodity cycle turn. This is the key point the Assistant Treasurer, Bill Shorten, fails to understand. We are talking about commodity cycles. Domestic superannuation is not a sovereign wealth fund, as he likes to tell us. It provides no insurance against a downturn in a commodity cycle, nor does it impact the exchange rate in the way a sovereign wealth fund potentially can. The minister, like the rest of the Gillard government, is deaf to the calls for a sovereign wealth fund from senior business leaders like Mike Smith at the ANZ, Ralph Norris when he was at the CBA and the Fairfax chairman, Roger Corbett; nor does he hear the words of the IMF and even Australia’s own Reserve Bank Governor, Glen Stevens, when they raised this issue. There is no excuse. Treasury’s own briefing to its ministers, released under FOI earlier this year, detailed how the Secretary General of the OECD, Angel Gurria, called for a countercyclical Chilean style fund to smooth macroeconomic fluctuations. Maybe the minister does not read his brief. On our side my colleague Malcolm Turnbull has made a very considered speech on this subject and Joe Hockey suggested that it is the Maserati of public policy. They are much more attune than the government is. There are many issues that need to be fully fleshed out; least of all is paying back the $100 million of Labor debt and returning that budget back to surplus. However, Australian policymakers have responsibility to play the long game, and a sovereign wealth fund is part of that decision making process. understanding order 64 he is to refer to other honourable members by their titles or by the names of their electorate. National Disability Insurance Scheme comprehensive safety net for our citizens. Medicare is undoubtedly one of the world’s finest health care systems, with universal access to quality and affordable medical treatment. We do not regard it as a luxury; we regard it as a right for every Australian citizen. Unfortunately, however, there are people that are falling through the cracks. This is highlighted with the need for long-term care and support for Australians that live with a disability. Every person in Australia knows someone affected by a disability. Those with members of their family suffering from long-term disability understand the emotional, physical and certainly the financial impact it has. There are too many Australians who, as a result of their disability, feel disempowered and unable to live independent lives. Compounding this lack of autonomy, disabled people are often disproportionately likely to face economic hardship, social problems and, very disturbingly and most unjustly, those suffering with intellectual disabilities or mobility impairment are more than likely to be unemployed, welfare dependent, live in public housing, and many you will find in our jails. Currently, people with disabilities tend to be reliant on the love and commitment of parents and the extended family, assuming that they will provide all the necessary support and care.

269,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (12:58,"Australia boasts having such an advanced andAs horrible as it may seem to mention, what happens to these people when their parents pass on? That is something I am regularly asked in my electorate. WhatI am advocating for is for social and economic justice. I am talking about the government finally introducing a national scheme that provides insurance for every individual who has been dealt such a hard hand in life and suffers long-term disability. I speak, of course, of a national disability insurance scheme. The scheme has recently received the attention of the Productivity Commission in the production of its recent report. In addition to being an equitable and just arrangement, this new initiative contributes to the productivity and sustainability of our nation. The commission has reported that by providing an insurance scheme the growth in employment for people with disability will be 100,000 people by the year 2050. That is certainly a boost for national GDP. Furthermore, 4,200 carers who have had to give up their work will have the opportunity to re-enter the workforce. The initiative requires $13.5 billion to be set aside each year by the federal government. However, given the potential economic gains to be made it seems to me that the benefits certainly far outweigh the costs, particularly if we describe ourselves as a caring nation. As the National Disability Service points out, increasing disability employment has a microeconomic implication specifically addressing Australia’s ageing population. I regularly get to meet with and consult with disability groups in my electorate, no doubt as every other member does. The message that I have received is rather clear and unambiguous. They see a need for more support to be provided. I recently met with the staff, carers and clients of families during my DisabiliTea that I had with the Australian Foundation for Disabilities, known as AFFORD. This foundation provides employment skills, development and accommodation, and supports over 1,400 people with disabilities and their families. Within my electorate I also hosted a disability forum to engage with families about the issues that affected them on a day-to-day basis. One of the main issues that was raised at the forum was the need for a national disability insurance scheme, and that is what I communicated to Parliamentary Secretary Jan McLucas, who also attended that forum with me. I am proud to be a part of the Labor Party that has taken this issue that has historically been committed to the periphery and brought it to the front and centre. I, along with my colleagues, see great opportunities for areas such as schooling, housing, jobs, and essentially basic areas that we take for granted to be accessible to all. Australia is one of the few Western nations that has ratified the United Nations rights of a person with a disability and now it is our responsibility to act on that commitment. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 13:04 MAIN COMMITTEE Australian Defence Force: Housing Assistance (Question No. 447) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, in writing, on 4 July 2011: In respect of rent payable over the last ten years for personnel living in (a) married quarters, and (b) all other living quarters: how many times has the amount payable changed; in what years; and by what proportion (as a percentage). Mr Snowdon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Group Rent Scheme (GRS) (including rent allowance, Service residence and living-in accommodation) member contributions are reviewed annually and adjusted in line with the increase in the cost of Defence housing assistance. It is a long standing policy that Defence should subsidise 50 per cent of the national cost of housing for Australian Defence Force members and their families with members meeting the remaining 50 per cent. In past years the level of subsidy provided by Defence has increased due to greater than expected fluctuations in the Australian housing market and in 2009 the Defence subsidy was at 56.53 per cent. In the same year, the CDF and Secretary committed to a subsidy correction program to return the Defence subsidy to 50 per cent. In 2010, Rent Bands4 and 5 1 were adjusted to achieve the 50 per cent subsidy and in 2011 Rent Bands2 and 3 achieved 50 per cent subsidy. It is anticipated that the final subsidisation for Rent Band1 (currently at 53.32 per cent) will be corrected in 2012. The GRS updates broadly reflect the annual market rent cost changes faced by the wider Australian community. (a) The amount payable for Service residences (married quarters) has changed once every year since 2001. The proportion of change as a percentage for specified contributions for: (i) Service Residences for Members with Dependants; (ii) Service Residences for Members without Dependants 'not sharing'; and (iii) Service Residences for Members without Dependants 'sharing' are provided in the table at Attachment A can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office. (b) The amount payable for rent allowance has changed once every year since 2001. The proportion of change as a percentage for specified contribution for rent allowance for: (i) Members with Dependants; and (ii) Members without Dependants are provided in the table at Attachment B can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office. The amount payable for Living-in Accommodation has changed 12 times since 2001. The contribution is based on rank, sharing arrangements and the level of accommodation. The proportion of change for these figures are set out in the table at Attachment C can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office. __________________ 1 Rent Band1 – PTE to LT (excluding WO2 and WO1) Equivalent Rent Band2 – WO2, WO1 and CAPT Equivalent Rent Band3 – MAJ and LTCOL Equivalent Rent Band4 -COL and BRIG Equivalent Rent Band5 – MAJGEN and above Equivalent",167,Adjournment
