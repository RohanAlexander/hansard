The question is as followsis the Minister aware of the following facts, and, if not, will he cause inquiry to be made into them and communicate the result to the House before a vote is taken on the duties to be placed on pianos1. That the Customs returns for the several States show no appreciable decline in the average invoice value of German pianos imported, except in New South Wales? 2. That the decline as shown for New South' Wales amounts to about £ y per piano, i.e., from £ 2 3 in 1901, to a little more than j£x6 in 1906, and is accompanied by an exceptional increase in the number of pianos alleged to have been imported ? 3. That on these facts being pointed out to the Acting Comptroller-General, this officer unhesitatingly expressed the opinion that a blunder had been made, and . that the return for New South Wales was erroneous. the' information for which the honourable member is asking, might very well be ascertained on the item in Committee of Ways and Means. It is anticipated that that item will be reached to-day, and the question can be discussed then. is necessary to enable us to discuss the item. the honourable member has readI do not know what is to follow-h e appears to be going bevond the ordinary form of a question. finished. It will be seen that I am referring to erroneous statistics that have been furnished, and which ought to be corrected before we go into Committee on the item. My question proceeds4. That on investigation this was confirmee!, and that the Customs Department has now ascertained that no decline has taken place in the average invoice value of pianos imported in New South Wales, and consequently that no decline has taken place in the average value of pianos imported .into the Commonwealth as a whole orable member must see that he is going beyond the ordinary form of a question. with the question on the ' item "" in Committee of Ways and Means. orable member for Coolgardie asked a question in reference 'to this matter some four or five days ago. and this morning I forwarded him a reply to the effect that a mistake had been made-as stated by the Acting Comptroller-General of Customsin that only an estimate had been given of the number of pianos imported into New South Wales, instead of the actual number. I have requested the officials in Sydney to furnish me with the most definite particulars'that it is possible to obtain, and immediately I receive these, I will supply the information to honourable members. But, undoubtedly a mistake has been made, so that honourable members need not base their remarks in reference to the duty upon pianos upon the figures which have been supplied.",14,Order Of Business

Does the Government intend to allow the men to lose this money ? 6. What are the intentions of the Government as to reimbursing the employees in the agricultural implement trade, who have incurred heavv expenses in defending Commonwealth legislation ? 7. What steps are the Government taking to see that the law is being carried out? swers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. The policy of the Government will be the subject oif a memorandum to be laid on the table immediately. Ministers are not yet aware of any defiance of the law. 2. Yes. 3.

The authority for detaining officers until s-3° p.m. is contained in the Public Service Regulations. Only time worked after 5.30 p.m.. is regarded as ""overtime"" under those Regulations.

Is it intendedhere to stop the 'delivery of catalogues or trade jprice lists when posted from other countries to persons in Australia? I hope that the Treasurer does not intend to do that. It would be very unfair in view of the fact that the catalogues and price lists of our business men receive such different treatment from other countries. sore straits for revenue when it proposes to collect a duty of that kind. It is reallyhampering trade. from the propriety of the proposal, I think that the duty proposed is excessively high. It ought not to apply to price lists and trade catalogues sent here by outside persons who, of course, could not get their printing done here. Such persons should not be treated, even from the Minister's stand-ipoint in the same way as persons who are carrying on business within our territory Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.27] -Does the honourable member for North Sydney approve of a firm which is doing business in Australia getting its printing done in another part of the world ? ing with that question, except that I hold that the duty is too high, even for that purpose.

LYNE that they shall be free. It has been represented to the Comptroller-General that the catalogues which are posted from other countries give a great deal of information to our business men, and it is not intended that they shall be dutiable. It is intended, however, that every person who does business in Australia shall get his printing done here. Complaints have also been made regarding the printing .of supplements to Australian newspapers in other countries. Suppose that the proprietors of a newspaper get their supplements printed in England or elsewhere, it is not fair that they should be admitted free. The object of this item is to prevent firms which are doing business in Australia from getting their printing done in other parts of the world, and securing free admission of the printed matter.

Therefore, if the Tariff is not made to discriminate as I have suggested between matter with advertisements and matter without advertisements, it will pay better to import them wholly finished.

I do not know why we should be at such pains to make people do so, and I say this with no desire to belittle our own printeries. On the contrary, I hold that we ought to suoport them: but I do not think that we should eventually help them by completely shutting out this material, representing, as it does., the skill, enterprise and up-to-dateness of the world. come in blocks. lithographed.

Magazines and periodicals would certainly be covered by the words ""unframed, having advertisements thereon,"" unless we took steps to exclude them. If our people insist upon going to the other end of the world for some particular article or paper, we should not prevent their [ 53] 2 doing so, provided that they are prepared to pay a reasonably heavy penalty. But is not a duty of 100 per cent, altogether too high? I have no sympathy with those who seek abroad what can be reasonably done for them here. I have no patience with those who patronize every one but their own people; but my experience is that a good, stiff, hide-bound protectionist always reaches out with both hands for a cheap thing wherever he can get it . That being so, this proposal will f a l l quite as heavily upon the protectionist I presume that section of the community as it will upon any other. Those who clamour most loudly for duties upon foreign goods are the first to use them if they find it to their advantage to do so. Only the other day, when we were discussing the confectionery duties, it came out that manufacturers of confectionery in Melbourne, who were clamouring for high duties, were using Nestles milk, and not Australian milk, in their manufacture. That should only be allowed in regard to the other fellow. Without the slightest desire to encourage the sending away to othei parts of the world for anything which can supplements be reasonably done here, it seems to me we should impose a sufficiently high penalty if we adhered to the old duties. I intend to propose that we should substitute the duties under the old Tariff for those now submitted. not think that anything created more irritation in connection with the administration of the old Tariff than. did the influx of these price lists. As honourable members are aware they accumulated in tons in the Post Office. The position I take up is very much that which is embraced by the concrete amendment suggested by the honourable member for Bendigo. We should prevent local firms sending abroad to get their advertisements printed for them, since we can command sufficient skill and ability in the Commonwealth to meet all reasonable requirements in this direction. But to impose a heavy charge upon the admission of trade catalogues which reach us from all parts of the world would be to restrict the information required by the ordinary trader, the need for which has been felt so very much.

I would rather adhere to my own wording than go past the established or acknowledged houses here. I think we go quite far enough when we go as far as that. From that point of view, I should like the honourable member for Bendigo to think over the matter, and see what his amendment means, because it is extending my proposal very considerably. not see why the Treasurer should abuse the indent agents.

Sir abuse on them. I have always said that they do no good to Australia. here and engages in a legitimate industry is of some good to the community. Nevertheless, I think the Treasurer is right from his point of view. If these people have establishments in Australia, they can very well get their printing done here. their printing specially for Australia. It would be printing for the whole world. catalogues are not printed here, there is no reason why they should not pay a small duty on those which come here from outside. mostly through the post. other articles which come through the post. These catalogues arrive here in large quantities. [253]a tries take ours through the post, free. We should not treat them differently. honourable member. We are not in a position to give exact reciprocity to other I do not think countries, in which manufacture is highly perfected, and which are in a better position to capture our trade than we are to capture theirs -Therefore, it is useless at this stage of development to talk of reciprocity. It is curious that the relogues would not necessarily involve an office. catalogues might come in at a small rate of duty. I wish to draw the Treasurer's attention to the fact that calendars and almanacs, n.e.i., appear in item 353, under a 30 per cent. duty. They are practically the same as the articles included in paragraph A of item 352. Many patent medicine proprietaries send out what are virtually their price lists in the shape of calendars and almanacs. There is really no difference between calendars and almanacs of that kind, and the other articles enumerated by the Treasurer. They are out of place in section 353, and ought to be treated in the same way as are the price lists of foreign houses. Sydney) [12.8] I notice that included in bags and cartons.""

The object is to make the duty on those articles the justification for the subsequent duty on strawboard.' That is really the process that is going to be worked. These cartons are to be made practically unimportable, and then the strawboard maker will say, "" The makers be of cardboard boxes have been given a high protection, and therefore yi»m can give me the increase of 150 per cent, that I ask If the whole of their for on the old duty.""

But the latter are told: "" Although you do pay this increased price, you cannot 'be competed with,, because you are given a duty of 6d. per lb. on your manufactured article, and this absolutely excludes competition."" What is the effect? These strawboard boxes are used only when they can be sold at a price verynear: to that of the paper wrappings or packages previously used, and immediately the price is raised the demand will be decreased, with the result of loss of employment.

However, I leave the question of intention aside, and merely point to what will be the effect.

The Treasurer would be well advised to accept my suggestion, .which, I feel sure, will commend itself to the common-sense of honourable members generally. I am certain that if the Minister would fake expert advice, every unbiased and impartial printer would admit that a duty of 4d. per lb. on printed matter of this kind would give ample protection, and would be all that could reasonably be expected by those concerned in this industry.

Dr. Maloney, M.P., Farliament House, Melbourne. Dear Dr. Maloney, I was under the impression that you were reworkmen if you dare. I believe that manhood turned as the member for Melbourne as a protectionist. You therefore very much surprised me yesterday when you said that you would oppose the proposed duty of 25 per cent, on surface-coated board. J. said no such thing. At present the duty on plain and coated Boards is the same. We now only ask for a protection of 15 per cent. We have invested a large sum in up-to-date plant, occupying one whole floor of our factory, and employ a large number of men in the production of _ these boards, and have continued their production in the hope that when the Tariff should be revised we would get .the protection that we are entitled to. Should we not receive that protection we will be compelled to close that department and throw all those hands out of work. It is sad to think that that result should be brought about by you, a supposed protectionist. How can you justify your action? Yours faithfully , JAS. McDOUGALL. Perhapsi f I ' read my reply it will be clearer than anything I can say. wish it to be understood that I have respect and regard for any man who is a free-trader, so long as he honestly holds that opinion, and if I use the term in what I write, I only do so in the course of my answer to the insult and slur that has been thrown upon me as the honourable member think this incident ought to be allowed for MelbourneSir, Yours of the 7th inst. to hand.

You care nothing about information from interested parties, and them. Gain is your object. To put money in it should not have been necessary for the your purse you try to frighten me by conjuring corridors of Parliament to be crowded with before my eyes workless men and hungry children. You want money only, and I am to be persons desiring to make representations. but a tool in your hands-and you threaten men This sort of thing has been going on and women and children to influence me to vote throughout the discussion of the Tariff, ss you desire. OughtI not admire you? Noble character, disinterested humanitarian ! Mr Maloney. Yet you are the man-yo u lover of protection and of workmen-wh o did your utmost, who hesitated at no expedient, to oust me from Parliament House and put in-who , a protectionist? Noa free-trader. Yes-wealt h went to wealth. The wealthy McDougall supported the. wealthy SirM . McEacharn. Where was the poor workmen then? Now carry out your threat to dismiss your and womanhood in this country will say you are not the master of their lives-that you are not as God-that to you they need not pray "" Give us this day our daily work that we may earn the bread of sweat."" It proves conclusively to my soul's satisfaction that the policy .of the Labour Party is the right one-the right of the man to live without being at the beck and call of his fellow man, because that man has money. With tenfold earnestness will I advocate a policy of nationalization of industries, so that the McDougalls may become as Dodos-extinct . The fact that SirM . McEacharn was one of the four who voted against ""White Australia,"" and who was then an acknowledged free-trader, shows me it is not of your workmen you are thinking-blac k or slave does not signify to you. To you your men are machinery-instrument s of money-making. To me they are men with God-created souls and ""rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" When the duties are considered, you may rest assured I will think of my duty to my fellowButI men and to my country, Australia, and your threats will not operate' on my mind.

We have determined thatShow-cards or pictures issued by or referring to the goods of any manufacturer or producer not having a special place of business in Australia The honourable shall be free. So that nearly all the advertisements which appear in these magazines are specially allowed to be admitted free under the last item we dealt with, when they are sent out as advertisements only through the post. The Treasurer in his rather remarkable speech seems to have quite misunderstood the .point at issue, or has been incapable of stating his case in such a way as to commend it to honourable members who are accustomed-in spite of the fact that he has been permitted to be in charge of. this I have seen the Treasurer Tariff for a considerable time-to have cases presented to them in a logical I try to buy manner. The honourable gentleman says that it is desirable to foster art and literature. No doubt it is ; but if that be the object which he has in view, I ask: What. earthly connection is there between a numH e has not even read his ber of advertisements which he declines to be allowed to be'attached to Munsey's I get ouite Magazine and the fostering of literature and art?

As to the honourable gentleman's remarks lobbying-which , of course, are made rather late in the day, and when the precincts of this chamber are f u l l of exhibits of various kindsI remind him that not very' long ago he came down to this House with a sheep-shearing machine, the driving gear of which occupied the lobby and which he said was made in Australia when, as a matter of fact, it was imported. We have not heard the Treasurer taking exception to men coming here day after day and stating their case -to honourable members. A hundred of them have tried to speak to me, but few have been successful. should be very sorry if I could not present a case better than the Treasurer has done on this occasion. which he has exhibited is an American magazine Munsey's. magazines, without exception, differ from the English magazines in the number of advertisements which they contain. I take up half-a-dozen English magazines, and find hardly any advertisements in them. Now, I am perfectly prepared to listen to a proposal in favour of excluding the literature and art of all foreign countries, on the ground that it is desirable to foster literature and art in Australia. But I am not to be influenced, by foolish fulminations against advertisements contained in foreign magazines, and which come in merely in cidentally. enjoy reading the advertisements in magazines. There is no greater evidence at once of the ingenuity and the credulity of mankind than can be found in reading the advertisements in the American magazines. But the literary men of Australia do not want to exclude magazines because of their advertisements. They want to exclude them-if they have any such desire at all-becaus e they have their own brains to sell here. But the Ministeri n charge of this Tariff does not want to exclude American magazines for that reason. They are to be permitted as magazines to come in ; but their advertisements are to be cut out. That is an illogical and senseless position to take up. The Treasurer seems to think that literature"" and art can be dealt with on the basis of so much per pound-that works over a certain weight ought to be excluded, whilst those under a certain weight should be admitted free. He appears to think that literature is a thing that is capable of being weighed and measured. about to tax paintings on the square foot of canvas. honourable member I the contents of some magazines are very trivial and foolish, but I should be sorry to think that we are guilty of the intolerable assumption that we do not require all that the intellect of foreign countries can give us. Half-a-dozen magazines which I have in mind have, perhaps, only half-a-dozen pages of advertisements as I against thirty or forty pages of general reading matter. The Treasurer has said a great deal on the question of preference to The magazine Great Britain, but this is an opportunity which I am sure he will not avail himself The American of to grant a preference to the Old Country, because according to him advertisements alone are anathema. If he excludes only those magazines in which advertisements preponderate he will allow British magazines to come in at a cheaper rate. I hope that tbe Committee will determine that magazines shall come in free.

The search for material suitable I do not think we could for the manufacture of printing papers of this class has been the business of busy brains in every part of the world. So far the greatest quantity has been' derived from soft-wood forests. Canada has almost a monopoly of woods suitable for the purpose.

I understand that if larch and spruce were planted here, it would take twenty years before they could be used for this purpose. Another difficulty is that these trees are found in countries in which there is heavy frost and snow, and it would appear that intense cold is necessary for their proper development. To import pulp is almost out of the question.

There is a paper combine at all events in Victoria, if not throughout Australia. Sands and MacDougall make a certain printing paper-thi s paper was invoiced prior to the Tariff at 25s. per ream duty. The duty of 20 per cent, was not, of course, operative on such a paper. They were asked for some 35 reami to be delivered immediately, and answered this way :-25s . old price, 5s. per ream duty; 30s. a ream new price, and you must wait a month for the delivery of the order, as since the Tariff our mills are overworked. is that? paper that Sands and McDougall manufacture, but such is the power of the Combine that the duty is being charged even where it has not been paid. I feel that I am perfectly justified in voting against the duty, so that the paper which we cannot manufacture here should be admitted free, but I trust that this or some other Government in the near future will take steps to encourage by a judicious bounty the production of suitable wood pulp.

503,Mr Joseph Cooki Am Speaking,"are, therefore, very small indeed. This newspaper problem is becoming a very serious one all over the world. There is no doubt that the supplies of pine wood, from which the pulp is made, are becoming exhausted, and already the industry is in the hands of one or two individuals. Eveni f we impose a tax upon printing newspaper we shall not stimulate enterprise in the direction of finding an efficient substitute for pine. It will be a tax pure and simple, and we ought not to impose a burden upon newspaper proprietors for the sake of levying taxation. I think that printing paper ought .to be admitted free, inasmuch as it is tlie raw material of the printer's finished product. proposed duty is undoubtedly a revenue duty. A number of items have been included in the Tariff for reasons which have never been explained, and this is one of them. I sympathize with the proposal of the honourable member for Coolgardie, but cannot see that there is any justification for proposing a tax upon newspaper. shall vote in favour of the item being made free. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [5.20] I think that the Government are quite justified in challenging the opinion of the Committee upon this item, because no less than seven out of eight members of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty upon this class of paper. There is no reason, however, why that recommendation should be accepted by the Committee. I should like to remind the honourable member for Coolgardie that, in voting for the free admission of newspaper rolls, honourable members will not be voting solely in the interests of the great metropolitan newspapers alone. In Sydney there are twelve newspapers and other publications using these rolls of that statement. Sir JOHN QUICK there are six, in Adelaide there are six, in Perth four, in Kalgoorlie two, in Launceston two, in Hobart two, in Brisbane six, in Townsville two, in Charters Towers two, and in Victorian country towns six. I give James Spicer, a Melbourne merchant. There is no reason to doubt that they are substantially accurate. very grave doubts whether the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie would have the effect of taking a single penny out of the pockets of the large newspaper proprietaries. All of these firms are in a position to pass on the duty. That is their policy. As is well known, the mere cost of the paper actually used in the production of a big daily newspaper exceeds the price which the public pay for it. But it must be recollected that the city newspapers can command larger prices for advertising space than can country journals. The latter cannot obtain anything like the same rates. Any tax that we may impose upon printing paper will be passed on to the advertisers, who in turn will pass it on to the consumers. For these reasons I hope that the Government proposal will be defeated. I am sorry that this item is not the first or second item in the Tariff. Had it been, we might have been in a position to take to heart the injunction of the honourable member for Bendigo. He has told us that seven out of the eight members of the I Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty upon printing paper, but that that was no reason why the Committee should accept their recommendation. H is words should be written up. in large letters. Again and again he has urged that the recommendations of the Tariff Commission should be upheld. Yet here is an item upon which he advises the Committeeto vote against its finding; the imposition of this duty. member's own showing seven out of eight members of the Tariff Commission recommended it. I feel that it is in the public interest that printing paper should be admitted free. Country newspapers are deserving of every consideration, because they are working under great disabilities. I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta. gret that so many honourable members are apparently oblivious of the fact that under my amendment the paper required by country newspaper proprietors would be admitted free. newspaper offices which can well afford to pay the extra impost which would be touched. able member's statement is entirely wrong.",49,Quick I T Is A Go As You Braddon Blot So Fa R As Is Known At Pre

If the duty of 10 per cent, were retained the Treasurer could, if he chose, vote to knock out the whole item, and then some other honourable member could move that on and after such and such a date the goods be free.. MrS IN C LAI R ruling, Mr Chairman, as to whether it is competent for a private member to move to increase a duty? the original item was 10 per cent. The honourable member for Coolgardie has merely moved a fresh form of words. He is not proposing to add to the duty. that under the original item a preference is given, whereas the proposal of the honourable member for Coolgardie is to wipe out that preference, and thereby to increase the duty. in the second column. member for Coolgardie proposes to wipe out that degree of preference. must confess that after the Treasurer's about it when the matter was introduced long explanation I am still unable to to-day. [254]2 discover where his difficulty lies. He has stated clearly that he is against' the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta, who wishes to make this paper free.

If the honourable member for Parramatta is defeated the Treasurer can move for a higher duty if he likes.

If we do not give some encouragement to the local manufacturers of paper we cannot expect any development of that industry, although, as we make greater progress in forestry, we shall probably grow timber from which pulp can be obtained for the manufacture of paper: The proposed new paragraph would cover every kind of paper except that specially mentioned in paragraph w-writin g paper and paper for typewriting.

I believe the proposed paragraph would be found to be too much of a drag-net, and the honourable member has given excellent reasons why it should be opposed. We have paper mills, in which paper used for these purposes is at present being manufactured. I think the Committee has gone very far already in allowing printing paper to be admitted free. This is a serious matter for those who have established and are carrying on the manufacture of paper in the Commonwealth. I think the Committee should be prepared to give them encouragement and support. Proposed new paragraph agreed to. Paragraph E. Writing (plain), cut less than proposed by the Government in this Tariff. 16 in. x 13 in., ad. val., 15 per cent. think the Government might just as well eliminate this paragraph. The quantity of this paper imported in 1906 amounted in value to only ^308. There is an anomaly in this division to which I should like to direct the attention of the Treasurer. It will be found that, although this paper is dutiable at 15 per cent., writing and typewriting paper identical with it is dutiable under paragraph (w) at only 5 per cent. Some of this paper is used for the printing of the better class of circulars. I-do not know how the Customs officials are to administer a Tariff of this kind. It seems to me that they would require to have an expert constantly at hand, and even then 1 should say there would be great difficulty in deciding what paper should be admitted at the lower duty and what at the higher duty. I suggest that the Treasurer should postpone this paragraph until we reach paragraph (w), and then deal with the papers contained in both at the same time. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [7.58] -The object of this paragraph is to secure that the cutting of the paper shall be done here. all. The cutting would be done by machinery. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -That is why it is proposed that this paper should be dutiable at 15 per cent. it refers to paper 16 in. x 13 in., and the same paper is referred to in paragraph w, where it would be dutiable at 5 per cent. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I was going to say that I think the paper included in paragraph w should also be dutiable at 15 per cent. Colonel FOXTON -In one case the reference is to paper ""cut less "" and in the other to paper ""not less"" than 16 in. x 13 in. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -That is so. would this give in Australia? Sir WILLIA M LYNE I suppose thai it would give a considerable amount of work. I know the intention is to secure that the cutting of the paper shall be done here. TheA section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 15 per cent., which is the same as the duty under the-old Tariff, and that is also the dutyThere is, therefore, no alteration in this case.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [8.16] I move That after the word "" Paper,"" the following words be inserted :"" Candle (blue and grey) Paper, Candle Carton Paper."" I submit the amendment because these papers are of the. same class as those already in the item. The alternative rate is proposed to deal with light-weight papers. In 1906 the imports from the United Kingdom amounted to 12,000 cwt., and from other countries to 78,000 cwt. [8.17] I should like to see carpet-felt paper included in this paragraph. with in paragraph K. papers in paragraph K are not so high as the duties imposed in the paragraph under discussion. This paper is made here in large quantities from any sort of pulp, and its manufacture ought to be adequately protected. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [8.18] One reason for not including carpet-felt paper in this item is that the papers already included, and those proposed to be added by the Minister, are largely the raw material of the paper-bag manufacturing industry. Carpet-felt paper, so far as I know, is not the raw material of any industry. The carpet-felt paper is simply used as imported, whereas the papers which are included are closely related to those comprised in paragraph j . I call attention to the fact that the duty on paper bags is considerably lower than the duty on raw material; and I should like to move that the duties be reduced to 3s. 6d. and 3s. as in the old Tariff. In order to preserve the paper-bag industry, which employs a much larger number of people.than is employed in the making of the paper itself, it is necessary to leave a margin of at least 2s. per cwt. in the duty. I have a letter here from a firm which is largely engaged in the manufacture of paper bags, and as it is short, and puts the case very clearly, I shall read itI t is So far as we are concerned, we have been working quite satisfactorily under the old Tariff of 3s. per cwt. duty on paper, and 5s. per cwt. on bags; and we think any addition to the duty unnecessary. There are, so far as tralia, employing, on a liberal estimate, perhaps 100 hands. A -fair price for paper, such as is used for sugar bags, which form a considerable portion of their output, is 7s. per cwt. f.o.b. London: The freight and charges, exclusive of duty, average about 4s. G. Browns, and Sugar (grey, per cwt., so that, with the old duty of 3s. per cwt., the total charges amount fo 7s., giving the local mills a protection of too per cent. If the duty is made 6s., as proposed, the protection will amount to 143 per cent. In the paper-bag business alone, there are a far larger number of hands employed than in the two paper mills. According to the proposed Tariff, our raw material, paper, is to have its duty doubled-thoug h a large portion of it must be imported in any case-in order to give an unnecessarily high protection to the papermakers. That it is unnecessarily high is shown by the fact that a paper mill was run for many years in New South Wales without any",60,Pairs

We hope, therefore, you will see your way to assist in having the duty on paper, -'Brown sugar (grey, blue and other tints) and Fruit Bag Paper,"" reduced to the old rate of 3s. per cwt. Far more serious to us than the increase in duty on paper is the alteration of the duty on paper bags. 5s. per cwt., which allowed us a margin of 2s. per cwt. over the protection of 3s. on paper. This is now altered to 25 per cent, on English manufactured bags, and 30 per cent, on foreign. What is the result? Grey and brown sugar bags, which form the larger proportion of our, and many other, manufacturers' output can be bought in London at from 8s. to ios. per cwt,; 50 that the duty on these will be reduced from 5s. per cwt. to 2s. to 2s. 6d. less than half, while the duty on paper, of which they are made, is to be doubled, viz., raised from 3s. to 6s. per cwt. The result of this w ill be to do away with the present protection both to the paper mills and the paper-bag makers; as, unless the mills reduce their present prices, which they say they cannot afford to do, it will pay the makers of such bags better to stop making and import, thus throwing a large number of hands out of employment. We should suggest that, as the present Tariff has worked satisfactorily, the duties on paper and bags should be as before, 3s. and 5s: per cwt. respectively; but if this cannot be secured, at least the duty on bags should be at a fixed rate per cwt., as that on paper is, not ad valorem; and that the same proportion should be maintained between the two as under :Paper.

My proposal would give continued employment to a large number recommendation. in the bag-making industry, and would, I imagine, though, personally, I do not per cent. know, give some protection, at all events, to the paper-making industry. From the reason that if we increase the duty upon point of view of the employment given, the the paper we must also increase the duty paper-bag industry is much more imupon bags. The proposal that I have proportant than the paper-making industry; mised to submit is rendered necessary by and it is necessary, therefore, that the the fact that we must preserve a margin former should have this modicum of proin favour of those who' desire to manufactection. There is a further passage in the ture bags in the Commonwealth. letter, as followsIt is important to note in this connection, that crease the duty upon paper so enormously ? 6s. per cwt. on paper was the rate of the old Victorian Tariff previous to 1901, and that in that Tariff the duty onpapeT bags was ios. per cwt., the same as we now suggest, in the little bit prematurely. Let us first insert event of the 6s. duty being retained on paper. If it is necessary to raise the duty in the case of the paper-making industry, it is duties -' . also necessary, in the interests of the general community, and of a large number of workers, that the duties in connection with the paper-bag making industries should be proportionately raised. This was formerly ought to have more information to justify the doubling of the duty on the raw material of the paper-bag maker.

Committee has already rejected a .proposal to extend any protection to paper manufacturers in respect of certain other lines. This class of paper is being made here under the pperation of a duty of 3s. per cwt. Yet the Government now propose to increase that rate to 6s. per cwt. without assigning any reason whatever for their action. able member a reason. is not the Treasurer. To say that because the duty upon paper has been raised to 6s. per cwt. we must necessarily increase the rate upon bags to ios. per cwt., is no answer to my question I should like to hear the honourable member for Bendigo, who was Chairman of the Tariff Commission, throw some light upon this subject. To me it does not appear that any reason has been assigned for increasing the duty upon paper from 3s. to 6s. per cwt. that 6s. per cwt. is rather a high impost to levy upon this class of paper. If the first amendment be defeated I shall be prepared to move that the duty under the general Tariff be 5s. per cwt., and under the preferential Tariff 4s. 6d. per cwt. It is only right that all industries should receive a fair amount of protection. Amendment. agreed to. think that the duties proposed upon the paper enumerated in this paragraph are too high. In this connection we have to consider the interests of the small shopkeepers. I know that in Victoria the industry of bagmaking has been a remunerative one under the old rates. But confectioners have complained that they are unable to sell their goods at a reasonable profit on account of the increase in the duty upon bags. lollies. ment proposal the duty upon paper-bags will be far heavier than that upon sweets. Consequently, if confectioners weigh the basis with the sweets they will lose money. get lollies for 6s. 6d. per cwt. ? this class of paper weigh very heavy. By agreeing to the Government proposal we We are not shall be placing upon the retailers a charge which they will not be able to pass on to their customers. Consequently it will f a l l very heavily upon the small men. I would further point out that very few paper-bags are imported. The total value of our imports under this heading is only about £ 3 , 0 0 0 annually. If we increase the duty upon bags to 4s. 6d. per cwt. under the general Tariff, and to 4s. per cwt. under the Tariff for the United Kingdom-a n increase of 50 per cent I am sure that I will give the honorthat will be sufficient. [8.39] I would point out that in 1906 we imported 4,542 tons of brown sugar paper of the value of .£65,920, and during the first six months of the present year we imported 2,419 tons, valued at .£34,853. It will thus be seen that we annually import nearly £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 worth, of this paper. That fact in itself-seein g that we have mills in every State of the Commonwealth capable of producing this particular paper-demon strates that the existing duty is not sufficiently high. Of course, if we increase the duty upon paper it will be necessary to increase that upon bags. In New Zealand the duty upon brown sugar paper is 7s. 6d. per cwt., and that upon bags n s . 3d. per cwt. The Treasurer's proposals, therefore, are less than the New Zealand rates. In view ""of the fact that this class of paper can be manufactured in every State, the Committee may very well assent to those proposals. The question of the duty upon paper-bags is one that seriously affects a large number of deserving persons throughout the Commonwealth. It affects shopkeepers, confectioners, grocers and others who have to give away these bags with the goods that they sell. away; they weigh them in with the goods. not. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has argued in favour of absolute prohibition. Because paper-bags are imported he declares that we ought to raise the duty upon them to such a point as would exclude them. That is no argument for the advancement of the country. It is a positively ridiculous statement. We must permit a certain amount of competition, otherwise the industry, will be injured.

I agree with honourable members that the relationship of these duties is not fair to the manufacturer of bags; and although I am a free-trader I object more to a protection that protects the outside manufacturer than to a protection which protects the inside manufacturer. This duty is a protection to the outside manufacturer. Under a duty of 3s. per cwt. the mills have been turning out a large quantity of these papers, and no reason has been given why the duty should be increased. I shall vote for the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Brisbane, and try to get the duty on the paper brought as nearly as I can to the old rate. After that I shall vote proportionately as regards the duty on the paper bags. We ought to recognise, as in New Zealand, that it is only the coarser paper for bags which is made here, and that there is a certain quality which is not even made in America or Great Britain, but is imported largely to those countries for making bags. received a copy of the circular which in October last wasaddressed to the Minister of Trade and Customs by the South Australian Master Printers' and Allied Trades' Association. Thev point out that "" white sulphide"" and ""krafft brown"" papers, which are largely used in Australia, are not made locally. sugar paper' in grey blue and other tints costs about £ 9 per ton in the ""Old Country, suggest that a duty of 6s. 6d. on the Home cost is unreasonable, and show that a duty of 3s. per cwt. gives a protection of 33J per cent, to the mills. They further state that the Australian mills make only a few grades of paper, and that there is a large quantity of paper which must be imported in the interests of the makers of paper bags. 3s. per cwt. is ample in the case of fruit bags, sugar bags, or brown bags. They allege that the old duty gave ample protection. If the Committee impose a duty of 6s. 6d. per cwt. on material which costs from jQZ to j£g a ton, it will be prohibitive, and do considerable injury to the manufacturers of paper bags. On the other hand, if the Committee increase the duty on the bags it will penalize the users of them, especially so if the material cannot be made, or is not Zealand and lower than the old Victorian being made, in Australia. It will become a revenue duty, which must be passed on. The only sensible plan is to reduce the duty on the first item, and leave a fair margin to the bag-makers. ber mean to say that this paper cannot be made in Australia? made, not by me, but by the South Australian Master Printers' and Allied Trades' Association, who surely should know what they are talking about. It must be patent to honourable members that a reduction of the duty is necessary. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [8.58] -In 1901 the original duty imposed on this item was 6s. per cwt In Victoria the duty was 6s.; in New Zealand it was 5s., and pretty well the same proportion was maintained in Canada and the United States. I intend to propose that the duty on brown paper be 5s. in the general Tariff and 4s. 6d. in the preferential Tariff, as suggested by the honourable member for Bass. And when we come to deal with bags, I intend to propose an addition of 2s. per cwt. on each item, in order to give about the same protection ;is is given in New Zealand. That will reduce the duty on each item to that which was intended or proposed. After listening to the debate, it seems to me that a proportion should be maintained. The duty of 6s. 6d. per cwt. as proposed was, perhaps, a little too high. in the paragraph at 4s. 6d. and 4s.

In Sydney there is a large' paper mill in Moore-street, at which blues, greys, and wrapping paper are very largely made. .A witness, representing the mill, appeared liefore the Commission, and informed us that it was an established fact that, notwithstanding the duty of £ 3 per ton on wrapping paper, it could be landed in Sydney from Germany, Sweden, and other foreign countries at about £ 2 per ton cheaper than the cost existing prior to the formation of the present Tariff. The witness consequently claimed consideration against this fierce competition. He particularly drew attention, to the fact that this printing paper, which we have made free, and which is made free under the character and in the name of printing paper, is often brought into use as wrapping paper. I should like the Minister to consult his officers about this question, and to see whether some strict definition of.printing paper cannot be introduced into the Tariff. I think that it is possible to provide that free printing paper should not be allowed to be used as paper for wrapping purposes. I also think that the manufacturers should receive consideration for their wrapping paper. In the meantime, I am disposed to think, on re-perusing the evidence, that 6s. per cwt. for these papers is too high. I am disposed to accept .the Minister's suggestion, and to bring it down a little. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [9.15] -The evidence just read by the honourable member for Bendigo supports my proposition. It shows that the imported paper can be sold at £ 2 per ton less than the price of the locally-manufactured paper.

That information is given in answer fo question 93,689 of the Tariff Commission's evidence. facturer, said that in some instances the duty was equivalent to only 12 per 1 cent., but he can have referred only to strawand yet we are asked to give from 22J board lined on both sides with glazed paper.

That must have a serious effect on the users of this material. It represents' a very considerable increase on a line which is the raw material of an industry which must supply its manufactures at a cheap rate if they are to be used at all. They are used as a substitute for paper wrapping, and they will not be used unless they are sold at a rate which will bring them within measurable distance of the price of paper. The Broadford mills, which are the only mills manufacturing strawboard, are in the hands of a combination consisting of two companies who pooled their assets, and who have a monopoly. I allude to that not as an attack upon them, but in order to show that the company has every opportunity to take full advantage of any"" duty that may be imposed. I do not object to a monopoly properly conducted, but I object to passing a duty for the benefit of a monopoly, which, because it has no competition to contend with, is able to take full advantage of that duty, when ho good reason can be shown for its imposition, and when it is clear it will injure another industry. Those interested in the Broadford mills form part of a paper mill combine. I am assured that they have formed a combine, can fix their own prices, and in that way also take every advantage of any duty imposed. I understand that sales of their papers, not strawboard, in Queensland and New South Wales are allotted to one company, and sales in Victoria and"" South Australia to another, and they have agreed as to the prices they shall give for their raw material. There might be no objection to such an arrangement if it were reasonably conducted, and without: State The old rate of duty assistance, but when we are asked to give this industry assistance by means of the Tariff we have a right to ask whether it is needed, and whether it will be good for other industries. The' statements I have made will be found to be borne out by the evidence submitted by the Tariff Commission. Freight and charges on the imported article amount to over 50 per cent. That in itself is surely a large protection, per cent, to 37 per cent. more. In this 1 case we have not to ask whether the price will be raised as the result of the imposition of the duty, because the price has already been raised by 30s. a ton, and advantage has therefore already been taken of the increased duty. It is true that if some of the duties on the raw materials of tlie industry were reduced they would hot raise their price. much higher than it was. before the Tariff Commission. risen since that time. . of the concern made a very stupid promise to the Tariff Commission which has not beenfulfilled. He said that if they got an increased duty they would agree not to raise the price. without any qualification? was pointed out to him that it was a dangerous promise to make, because the price of his raw material might go up, and he said he would take that risk and give the promise. The promise has not been fulfilled. There has been no increase in the duties upon the raw materials of the industry which would justify the increase in the price of strawboard, whilst the duty has been taken off dextrine and has been lowered in the case of other materials. The effect of the proposed duty is shown in this way. I have here a carton for a candlemaker which would be dutiable at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent.

Surely a protection of 85 per cent, under the old Tariff is enough. If we are to consider the number of employees, we ought to give greater weight to the claims of the boxmakers, who employ a much larger number of hands than the strawboard-makers do. It looks as if we were to starve a big in' dust'ry in order to keep a little local combine going. This firm have had orders on hand for months past, and are unable to execute them. Yet they want a higher duty. There is not a duty proposed in this Tariff that is less warranted, and the Minister knows it. If a duty which, plus the natural protection, amounts to 85 per cent., is not sufficient, then, in all conscience, the industry ought to go under. If it is a question of whether that or the box-making industry, which employs between 3,000 and 4,000 hands, is to go under, then the strawboard-making industry ought to go under. There are ten times as many hands employed in making boxes in South Australia, which is only a part of the Commonwealth, as there are in that industry. We ought also to consider those who use the boxes. The duty has already put the price of the boxes up by from 15 to 20 per cent. What firm, who were so positive when before the Royal Commission that they would not 'increase this Committee should give them all they ask for, especially in view of the fact that they have increased their prices twice since they made that statement? Their price now has exactly absorbed the whole advantage of the increased duty. it was £ 7 ios., it is now £ 9 . If we were to put on another 50 per cent, duty they would increase their prices proportionatelyThey knocked out all the other small makers, and it is not the function of this Committee to bolster up combines of that kind, which have no concern about any other business man. This firm would crush any other firm if it got a chance. It has done so already. did not speak in that way in regard to the Standard Oil Trust, which has been trying to crush out the British Imperial Oil Company. He supported it. ber is just about as correct in that allegation as he was when he asserted positively that I was wrong in saying that discs were not made in Australia.

This strawboard-making firm has increased its prices in face of its own sworn evidence, and the only excuse it gives is that the cost of its raw material has been increased. I defy the members of the firm to point to an increase of more than 3s. 6d. in the value of a ton of their raw material since this Tariff was introduced. ber mean t'o say that straw has only increased in price by 3s. 6d. a. ton ? it is the increase in price of the straw that has led them to raise their prices.

785,Mr Spence (Darling) [10.7],"I doa reason. as one of the principal reasons. ""We are not here to base our consideration of proposed duties upon statements made by individuals. We should dismiss them altogether. A statement of that kind did not bind the company if they did not wish to keep to it. Nor have we been, so far, in this Tariff, legislating out of considerathem; but the Committee might fairly action for the numbers of persons employed in particular industries. It is said that there is only one factory concerned in this case; but' it is reasonable to assume that if there were large profits in the industry a number of other strawboard factories would have been started in the Commonwealth, because the raw material is obtainable anywhere. There have been other cases where there was only one concern in an industry, but some of us appealed in vain to the Committee for consideration of the much greater number of other people who would be affected. I therefore take it that we might dismiss the argument about the statement which was made and not kept, and a? to which they possibly have an answer, and also the fact that there are not a very large number of hands employed in the industry. What we have to consider*is what is a fair amount of protection to give to the industry, so that it may be carried on at a reasonable profit and in such a way that there may be a fair chance of encouraging competition. I think the 2s. 6d. proposed by the Government is too high. At the same time we have to consider the strawboard makers. accept is. 6d. compromise. I am informed that prior to the last Tariff the condition of the industry was such that the men in this factory offered voluntarily to work for twelve hours a day in order to keep the thing going. That helped their -employers through, and when the last' Tariff was adopted the employers gave them a forty-eight hours' week without any reduction of wages. I believe those are the facts. duty was sufficient. viously without Ihe duty tbey were unable to carry on. It does not prove that when the duty was imposed in the last Tariff the employers made big profits. We have no evidence as to how much profit they have made, but I take it that there cannot be a great deal in the industry, or there would have been other competitors. There could not be a monopoly in an industry with the raw material so plentiful in every State, but the fact is that there has not been enough in it to induce others to take it up. We have also to consider the"" box-makers, for I am sure that the 2s. 6d. duty first proposed would have been too heavy a burden upon cept a duty of is. 6d., and give the strawboard industry the same encouragement as we are giving the other industries. Broadford factory is in my electorate. . I know something about it, and it is only due to the proprietors that I should state a few facts. The number of employees in the factory is seventy-five, so that it is not a small concern. In addition to those directly engaged in the factory, a large number of people are employed in carting wood and .straw, and the company buy straw, from the farmers. The product is entirely the -result of labour at every point. The honourable member for Lang stated that the firm had recently imported 500 tons of strawboard from.

I did not go back for three years, because the honourable member did not mention that term, but simply made a broad statement which conveyed to the Committee the impression that the firm-, within a period pertinent to the case, were importing foreign strawboard and selling it to their customers. that they are importing hundreds of pounds worth. statement that they have done nothing of the kind. the Sydney box-makers. but, like many others, it is not correct.",72,Pairs

I am assured by the honourable member for Riverina, who has just inquired, that at no time has strawboard been imported for the Broadford Mills. I merely give the information as it is given to me by people who are in a position to know that the statement made here to-night is not correct ; and I may say, further, that it is not true that the Broadford Mills cannot execute orders. After the last Tariff was settled, the question was whether, under the low duty, the Broadford Mills could be carried on; and I am informed that the employees agreed to work longer hours in order to tide over the trouble, and that no dividend was paid by the company for several years. I have no personal knowledge of these facts, but give them as they have been related to me. article the cheaper? now, though I do not know. I am assured, however, that the supplies are ample for present requirements. nTe. of course; certain kinds of strawboard, which are not produced at the Broadford Mills, and which must be imported whatever duty be imposed. It is only fair that the case for the other side should be laid before honourable members, in view of the many incorrect statements that have been made. I visited the Broadford Mills some time ago, and found that they were largely the support of the town. The employees, who, of' course, reside there with their families, were ready to help their employers in difficult circumstances; but I hear to-night that since the imposition of the new duty the hours have been made forty-eight instead of sixty per week, the latter being the number which the men volunteered to work in the time of trouble. Sixteen thousand I think the proposal of the Government is a fair compromise, and I intend to support it. [10.20] -The question of strawboard is like "" King Charles' head "" it is always cropping up. This is the third time this session that we have had a discussion relating to this particular commodity. Whether this is because those interested hope to ultimately arrive at what is substantially prohibition, I do not know; but so sure as any interference with the Tariff is proposed, up comes the question of strawboard. On the two previous occasions, the discussions resulted in the maintenance of the duty of is., which has always been regarded as fair in the case of an article which ought certainly to be easy of manufacture in a place like Australia, where there is plenty of the raw material available at a very cheap rate. Honourable members talk about the price of straw having gone up lately; but I venture to say that it has not gone up to anything like the extent to which it has in the older countries of the world. I have been wondering why the Government have reintroduced this question. On the last occasion, the then Treasurer himself gave the best of all reasons why the proposed duty should not be imposed, and eventually withdrew it on his own motion. It may be, however, that a new Treasurer has promised that the increased duty would be proposed. Reference has been made the imported by the honourable member for Mernda to the fact that the Broadford mill has not been doing particularly well.

859,Mr Johnson,"There is no othernumber of industries employing many hands-man y more than those employed in the strawboard industry itself Are not these people to have any consideration? Are not the people who use strawboard boxes for the purpose of enclosing their wares not to have consideration either? Is the consumer always to pay the piper, and grin and bear it? He is the one individual in the community whose interests do not seem to enter into the consideration Of protectionists for a single moment. There is only one other point to which I wish to refer, and that is the case of those who have to import strawboard for the purpose of manufacturing the finer kind of boxes. I amcredibly informed by those in the trade that the locally-made strawboard, although it is useful, cannot be used for all purposes. It is not useful for the manufacture of the better class of boxes which are required for the more delicate articles of manufacture. We have therefore to consider first that the local strawboard, although it is improving in quality,, is not equal to the imported article, and secondly that the works of the manufacturers of the local strawboard are not sufficiently large to supply all the requirements of the Commonwealth. The suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta for an ad valorem duty, even as high as 25 per cent., as preferable to the fixed duty of is. 6d., or even is., is one that should commend itself even to high Tariff protectionists in the Committee. rise principally on account of a remark made by the honourable member for Mernda, who observed that the making of strawboard was almost entirely a manual labour industry. As a matter of fact, the himself, in his evidence-questio n 80,768 -whe n asked, "" How many hands do you employ in the strawboard mill?"" reIn this letter Messrs. Fuerth and Nail, pliedI should think that we have between fifty and ney, show that every one of the reasons of strawboard is almost all automatic. orable member for Mernda that this is a could not be released from the promise manual labour industry. The honourable that he made when before the Tariff Commember for Lang has quoted from the evimission that he would not, under any cirundertook, after due consideration, not board. The only other point with which 1 to raise the price of strawboard if the desire to deal is that relating to the natural duty were increased. The honourable memprotection enjoyed by the local manufacber for Darling urges that we ought not turers. It is true that for a short time a to pay much consideration to such stateman to speak lightly of such things. He is not the man to make a promise of that kind without consideration. He knew what he was talking about when he gave that promise. One is almost forced to the conclusion that he made it with the reservation that he would break it as soon as he got an opportunity. His explanation of the increase in the price will not, to my mind, hold water. In writing to the saidWe have a perfect right to increase our price until such time as the duty is determined upon, because we have now to pay heavy duty on felts, wires, lining paper, and dextrine, etc., that were heretofore free. Should the increased duty be passed, we will at once reduce our price to the rate that it was -when I gave evidence before the Commission plus the extra cost that we will have to pay consequent upon the increased duties-if carried-o n fells, wires, lining paper, dextrine, etc. now to read a reply to which ' Mr McDougall has not seen fit to answer.

920,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"can make surface coated paper. sure that it can be made here, arid made well too. A duty on the finished article is essential, because the majority of t'he raw materials are liable to duty. But as I understand that the Treasurer has another propositionto make in connection with this matter I shall resume my seat. this matter I have a statement from the Master Printers' Association of Victoria, the Associated Press of Tasmania, the paper manufacturers, the cardboard box makers, the paper bag makers, the manufacturing stationers, and the paper merchants of Victoria, asking that these articles shall be. made duty free, because, as they say,-a tax on surface coated papers in almost endless varieties would press unduly on the printing and bag making industries. presume that ithe trade is not yet in a position to supply the endless varieties which are required. I desire to elicit from the Treasurer how he proposes to deal with paragraph R, which subjects paper shavings and waste paper for paper making to a duty of 5 per cent., except when imported from the United Kingdom, whence they are admitted free. I also desire to know how he intends to deal with paragraph T, under which pulp for manufacturing paper is dutiable at 5 per cent., except when it is imported from the United Kingdom, whence it comes in free. It seems to me that if surface coated paper is to be made free, the articles embrfaced in paragraphs R and T should be dealt with in the same way I presume t'hat if the United Kingdom is incapable of supplying the finished article it will not have much of the raw material to supplyto the Commonwealth. Treasurer does not intend to reply to my inquiries on these heads. But there is another question on which, perhaps, he may be able to give me some information. I understand that certain weeklv newspapers use a-surface coated paper, which of course is superior to the news paper that has been made free. I desire to ascertain from the honourable gentleman what paper in the past has been imported under the designation of surface coated paper. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the articles embraced in paragraphs R and T free. ther in the past any news paper used in proviso before voting on the original item. [255] I am the production of weekly newspapers has been imported under this head. honourable member without reference to the records. sume that in the event of this item being made free it will cover the whole of the news paper that is used throughout the Commonwealth. A certain kind of paper for printing newspapers is to be free. But my information is that some newspapers use surface coated papers. trations. those who use surface-coated papers be made free? If the Minister will give me a decision on that subject. I shall be satisI fied. papers are produced in the country, will the honourable member vote for the duty? honourable member can satisfy me that these papers are produced in satisfactory quantities I will vote with him. But I am unable to get an opinion from the Minister as to whether or not the item covers the whole of the papers required by the newspapers, and whether the proprietors have been clearing under this item in the past. I understand that the papers dealt with in this, paragraph are to be made free with the proviso that coated boards shall be dutiable. Surface paper is undoubtedly produced in the Commonwealth. But the manufacturers of it will be prepared, if they receive a sufficient protection on coated boards, to forego a duty on this particular class of paper. ber say that it is imported in rolls or folios, and coated . within the Commonwealth ? is imported as printing paper and surfacecoated by the local manufacturers. The. honourable member will therefore be able to vote for this surface-coated paper being made free, but it must be understood that it would be unfair to take from the manufacturers their protection on surface-coated I intend to make paper, and then refuse to give them the protection they require on surface-coated boards.",83,Thomson Th E Papers £5 000 In This Department Under The Protection

The object of this new paragraph is to make a margin between the duty on the goods dealt with in paragraph L , and those included here. poses a margin of 5 per cent. Sir originally proposed to me that the duty should be 30 per cent, and 35 per cent. I have been guided largely by what we have done in regard to other items. The position, as I understand it, is this : Under paragraph K we have imposed duties on the raw material of 20 per cent, ami 15 per cent. give a margin of 5 per cent, for the surface coating of boards. understand that that is not nearly enough. A margin of 15 per cent, is asked for. I have here a letter on the subject. orable members have been inundated with letters.

Will the Treasurer agree to submit all these printing inks to one uniform duty ? gather, I do not think the inks ought to be under one uniform duty. 'They are altogether different classes of inks, and those subject to the lower duties are used mainly by the country newspapers. Treasurer makes the mistake. I have received numerous appeals from country newspaper proprietors in this connection; and I may say that the honourable member for Wimmera, who is a newspaper proprietor himself, asked me, before he was obliged to go away, to represent the case on their behalf. for Wimmera has changed his opinion. for Wimmera came to me the day he left, and showed me requests from the Country Press Association that a uniform dutyshould be imposed, because the country newspaper proprietors had to . use the dearer inks.

I submit that the same principle should be observed here. The objection urged by the honourable member for Darling to the Government proposal is based upon the difficulty of accurately ascertaining the value of printers' ink. But I would point out to the honourable member that that objection applies equally to the proposed duty, which is part fixed and part ad valorem. I trust that the Governmentwill not adhere to .this double-barrelled duty. The Treasurer himself has' confessed that he does not like it. The duty proposed upon some of the inks amounts to more than 100 per cent: That is a very heavy impostupon an article, the production of which does not require an expensive plant, but merely a knowledge of a recipe, and the making of fluids from certain solubles.

1017,Mr Joseph Cook,"Nobody has been-for Capricornia spoke of the ink which is specified in the next item to large quantities of inks? iber desires all printing ink to be admitted at an ad valorem rate he has his remedy. It must not be forgotten that the manufacturers of ink in the Commonwealth have to pay a duty upon their raw materials. They are required to pay 6s. per gallon upon their resin oil, which is equivalent to an ad valorem rate of 60 per cent, or 70 per cent., and they have to pay a -similar amount upon their linseed oil. 4he Government ad valorem proposal as it -appears in the schedule. the retention of the old rate of duty. I ask the Treasurer to adhere to a fixed -duty, especially as there is a heavy duty upon most of the raw materials used in the manufacture of printing inks. Is.14 a.'m.] I should like to add a few words to what has been said by the honourable member for Capricornia and the Shonorable member for North Sydney upon this item. My information is that the duty proposed by the Government is equivalent, in some cases, to an ad valorem rate of 200 per cent. „3£d. per lb. it must be. ferior ink upon the country newspaperssis we shall do by the imposition of high duties-it will be at the loss of their readers. These journals should not use the ink that is used by the large newspapers with bad results to the eyes of theii readers. For the sake of their readers we ought not to force country newspapers to use cheap inks. The Postmaster-General is referring me to -an article which was prepared under special -conditions. of the ink. out that an ink which may be perfect in the Age office may be of scarcely any use in a small country office. If their ink is taxed to the extent of 200 per cent, it can only tend to drive the proprietors of country newspapers to use an inferior ink. We ought to see if we cannot make the article a little cheaper to them so as to give them the same advantage as the large newspapers enjoy with their cheaper ink. This is essentially a tax on country newspapers, and as such ought to be discouraged. a.m.] I assure the Committee that there is no more difficulty in differentiating between the varieties of printers' ink than there is in distinguishing between the varieties of any other imported article That statement is corroborated by inquiries which I have just made. There can be no doubt that the Treasurer is proposing an extraordinary duty, being practically equal to 100 per cent. Is the Committee prepared to vote that high tax? It has been stated that one of the reasons for keeping the fixed duty was that it was practically impossible for the Department to. distinguish between the values of the ink. But I can assure honourable members that that statement is absolutely wrong, as they can ascertain by reference to the officers of the Department. Is it desirable to place a high duty on these inks? In my opinion it is not. A duty of 25 or 20 per cent, is practically the proposal of the Tariff Commission. or 25 per cent. Tariff is 30 and 25 per cent. to impose a duty of 30 and 25 per cent, that is going farther than the Tariff Commission recommended. If honourable members give at the Department the option of levying a fixed or an ad valorem duty if will put those who have to use the dearer inks at a decided disadvantage. have really been engaged in discussing two items. Of course I know that stencilling ink is different from printing ink, but what the difference between them is I am not in a iposition to state at the present time. I do not see why there should be any limitation. If a man wants 50 lbs. of cheap ink he should be in a position to get it just as readily as a man who wants a ton of the article. I trust that the Minister will remove that limitation. that item I will alter it. A great injustice is sought to be done. It is most objectionable that when strong representations are made from this side the Treasurer and his supporters should merely interject and deny our statements.
