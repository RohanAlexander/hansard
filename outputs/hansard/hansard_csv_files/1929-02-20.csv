Minister propose to make any announcement to the House regarding the proposal that this Parliament shall adjourn on the 8th March to suit the convenience of a conference that is to meet in Canberra, or are honourable members to be dependent upon the newspapers for announcements of Government policy? not propose to ask the House to adjourn on the 8th March. In September last . I was informed by the leaders of Rotary that it was proposed to hold an interstate conference of Rotary clubs this year, and as it was necessary to make arrangements' a long time in advance, they desired some information as to the possibility of making Canberra, instead of one of the State capital cities, the venue. pressed my opinion that it was most desirable that such a representative conference should be held in Canberra in order to help the people of Australia to realize that. the National Capital is the most suitable place for all great gatherings of an Australian character. ""When I was asked whether Parliament would be sitting in March, I said that it was impossible to say what would happen after the appeal to the people; but that if, after the election, I was in a position to facilitate the holding of the conference, I would be glad to do so. Honourable members will agree that, in normal circumstances, they would not be inconvenienced if the House adjourned for a week to make accommodation available for the holding of a conference of this character.

Neither Rigby nor Powell heard Johnson utter the alleged words at the meetings, and the affair at Montana House was very dubious. Walsh, Longmore and myself were in the habit of taking tea together. As far back as last July, whilst taking morning tea, Longmore said to Walsh, "" Andresen and I will get him out to Long Bay aud then you will have a clear run with your new union."" Longmore, Walsh and I used to draw up our plans in a tea room situated in Macquarie Place. Longmore also sent me to get information concerningTudchope and Kavanagh. I intend to blow this prosecution.

How manj' houses have been built in Canberra by the Federal Capital Commission ? 2. In what localities have the houses been built? 3. What is tbe cost of each house? 4. How many, if any, are unoccupied? I am now in a position to supply the following answers to the honourable member's questions:1.

The cost of each individual house cannot be given, as most of them were erected in groups under large contracts and at different times. In order to arrive at a fair rental or sale figure the Commission has valued each type of house on the basis of costs as they are to-day when conditions are fairl y settled. A schedule showing the value of each type of house and the number of each type has accordingly been prepared, and is attached hereto. The valuation of each type has been shown to save the labour involved in setting out each house separately, which would apparently not afford any advantage. 4.

Another cause 10 has been the fact that leases have been taken up by some persons as a speculation, whicli, owing to the conditions mentioned, has not proved advantageous. The largest number of surrenders was made by an investment company, which took up a great number of leases in the hope that development would have proceeded much more rapidly than has been the ease. In individual cases changed personal conditions, such as removal from the district, death or insolvency, have been the causes of surrender. D r .

56,Mr Gullett,"of influenza between the months of September ancl December last. taneously, there was a number of outbreaks of influenza amongst the Pacific Island groups. For the most part these outbreaks were mild in character. A t Eotuma, however, which missed the influenza of 1918-19, there was a higher mortality with 31 deaths in a population of 2,400. In New Zealand there was no appreciable increase in the notified cases of either influenza or pneumonia during tbe year. In the middle of October there was a sudden rise in influenza prevalence in California. November and had ended by Christmas. The middle west and the Eastern States suffered at a later date. The infection was of the usual influenzal type without any undue mortality. On the Continent influenza Avas prevalent, especially in Germany and France. Cabled advice received from the Commonwealth Medical Officer in London reported the type of infection as "" benign "". In England and Wales there was only a very slight increase in the deaths from influenza by the new year. The last winter of 1927-28 was a light season for influenza. B y the new year the deaths fro m influenza ancl the notifications of pneumonia had not reached the figures attained during the corresponding week of last year. The figures quoted in press reports are ambiguous, but however interpreted do not show a prevalence comparable to that which obtained, for instance, during the winter of 1926-27. It may be added that experience shows that prevalence of in fluenza in Australia has no time relation with prevalence in England.

I found, when travelling through the electorate of Hunter, that Mr Mathew Charlton had won the confidence of his constituents. No man was ever , held in higher esteem. He is recognized, not only by the electors of Hunter, but also by the whole of the workers of Australia, as one of the ablest men that has ever entered this Parliament. The work that he has performed w ill stand to his credit for all time. He was always reliable and his word was his bond. I am opposed to this bill because it has been introduced solely in the interests of the privileged classes of society, and it is aimed at, the degradation of the working classes, being the forerunner of an onslaught on their standard of living. The Government is preespecially the coal miners' organization, which for years I had the pleasure of nization w ill be directly concerned because tion is made possible.

59,Mr James (Hunter) [3.36],"IHow can it be expected to achieve that object when it compels men to take ""nt licences and work alongside persons who, although called loyalists, are really strike breakers? Some honourable members opposite strongly object to these men being termed scabs; but they are worse than scabs. A scab covers a certain amount of corruption whilst they cover -all corruption. Those honourable members opposite who take exception to the use of the word scab, and encourage scabs in their scabbery are worse than scabs. In the event of a general upheaval in the coal industry, I suppose persons such as those to whom I am referring will be placed in the mines; but surely the people of Australia do not want a repetition of what happened in the mines in 1917, when a sum of Â£25,000 was paid to one coal-owner aloneMr John Brown--for the destruction caused by the employment of inexperienced men. There is also incitement to trade unionists when driven desperation by seeing other men taking the bread and butter from the mouths of their wives and children to take the scabs by the neck as they did in 1917. The miners will become desperate; and opportunities to men who are desperate do happen underground. more on that point; but I leave honourable members to judge what may happen if men of the type to which I have referred are again placed in the coal mines. The unionists employed on the coal-fields are fighting only for the observance of a federal award, but apparently nobody cares to intervene on their behalf. The Prime Minister( Mr at the expense of the many, are termed Bruce) on the one hand says it is a matter which comes within the jurisdiction Premier of New South Wales( Mr somewhat to this effect: "" If wealth, Bavin) Eederal matter. Where do we stand ? The facts of the case are known to both. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) is acquainted with the award under which the unionists employed in the coal mines are working to-day. A deliberate attempt is being made to disregard an arbitration award, and I definitely and emphatically assert that the Prime Minister is behind the coal' owners in the attitude they are adopting. Eor a number of years the Mr James. coal-miners have accepted the principle of arbitration; but some of the awards under which they are working are of such a nature as to shake their faith in the principle. In connection, with the Stockton Borehole dispute the proprietors agreed to allow the Minister for Labour and Industry in New South Wales to preside and hear evidence; but after the evidence had been taken, they objected to Mr Farrar making an award. The miners had to accept the situation. Yet we are told that they are never satisfied. They had to return to work on the terms of the coal owners, who, for a number of months, had been filching from them conditions which had been fought for, and paid dearly for in the past. Concessions which were granted as far back as 1893 have been deliberately withdrawn by the proprietors' organizations, which will not now obey arbitration awards. Such conditions cannot continue indefinitely, and although the miners may be defeated to-day, they will not be broken in spirit. They will regain their former strength and will see the futility of the present system of organizing. You are forcing them. I shall say no into one big union, whose members will recognize that their interests are identical. Although they may be defeated for a time they will ultimately achieve victory by bringing about a change in the present system of production, which is for profit instead of for use.

If tlie lionorable member for Dalley( Mr happiness and prosperity would be Theodore) had spoken in Sydney in such terms, I believe that it would have done much to bring about peace in industry. We are hearing every clay of attacks being made on honest citizens who desire to accept work under the laws of the country, and those who make such attacks are being encouraged by the utterances of the accredited leaders of the Labour party. The workers in this country should realize that they cannot take out of industry more than they put into it. The relations between employers and employees are very different in the TJnited States of America from what they are here, as I observed when I was in that country recently. America are not so much politicians as ours are. They recognize that in order to get big returns for themselves they must Iu Canada the same spirit prevails, though perhaps to a lesser extent. The workmen there are receiving wages at least as high as those paid in Australia, and yet the manufacturers are prospering, and are able to compete successfully against their rivals. By bolstering up industries with tariff duties we are only increasing the cost of living, and having less to put into our business, there is less to be taken out. If men apply to the Arbitration Court for awards and then refuse to accept them, they cannot set themselves above the law ancl the rest of the community. They may refuse to sell their own labour at the price awarded by the Court, but they cannot deny the right to anybody else to work within the law. The unionists already in employment have a preference, if they will obey the laws which they themselves brought into being. It is idle to talk about the starvation of women and children, and to describe men who accept work under the awards as Mr Prowse. munity must be continued at any cost, and no section can claim to be greater than the whole. That is why I can conscientiously support the original Transport Workers Act and the amendments the House would agree unanimously to them when they become law, greater enjoyed by every section of the community. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) said that a man who breaks a law that he helped to make is more a scab than the man who helps to break a strike against that law. Honourable members on this side of the House have. contended for years past that the workers have not helped to make the existing Commonwealth arbitration law, and they will have nothing to do with the industrial legislation which the present Government has placed on the statute-book. The Arbitration Act is a travesty ou arbitraLabouring men in tion; it is merely a criminal code designed to make felons of men who have done more to develop this country than the honourable member for Forrest is work for a large output. ever likely to do. Because arbitration has been degraded into something that decent people cannot touch, we on this side of the House are opposed to it. Because of the injustice that has been done in the name of arbitration, there is actual and threatened industrial turmoil Australian throughout Australia. The honourable member said that certain services must be maintained at any cost, and last week we heard one of his colleagues gloating over the fact that coal can be imported from the United Kingdom more cheaply than it can be produced locally. I suppose that, so long as essential services are maintained, the starvation of women and children in the coal-mining areas of the Old Country, the industrial hells of Europe, female labour in mines, children operating dangerous machinery, and flogged by brutal bosses if tired nature asserts itself, and they fall asleep at their jobs, are, in the opinion of those honourable members, a reasonable price to pay for them. Perhaps the honourable member for Forrest would",26,Transport Workers Bill
61,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [4.2],"welcome a revival of the conditions that existed in Australia in 1888, when two men were jailed in Victoria for conspiring to raise wages! That is the sort of price that the honorable member thinks should be paid for the maintenance of services, and that is the tendency of the legislation placed on the statute-book by the present Government. The Labour party opposed the present Arbitration Act, and will oppose the measure now before the House to the last ditch. We have been asked why, if we do' not like this bill, we do not attempt to improve it. Our reply is that the bill is essentially bad. It is founded on inequity, and is designed for a malicious purpose; therefore, it is entitled to nothing but continuous and unqualified hostility. We shall have nothing to do with it. The Prime Minister pretended to explain the genesis of this legislation; but its history goes back much further than the strike of the waterside workers. It originated with the hatching of that political infamy, the Composite Government, whose legislation has been designed to create industrial upheavals, so that with catch-cries of "" bolshevism,"" "" revolution,"" "" the Reds,"" and "" law and order,"" the pact parties might retain their hold on the reins of government. The industrial turmoil is the product of the political necessities of honourable members opposite, and their destitution of statesmanship great enough to l if t the country out of the economic slough of despond into which it has been sinking as a direct consequence of the war. They have progressed from industrial turmoil to industrial turmoil in order to deceive the people. Three days after the announcement of the Prime Minister that the elections would be held on the 17th November, the Beeby award was made. To some honourable members and sections of the general public, that may appear only a coincidence; but to my mind it suited too well the political ambitions of the ministerialists to be so regarded. Mr Justice Beeby had been considering his award for months, and I cannot regard the announcement of it on a date so opportune for the Government as an accident. The awarding of two pick-up places was not the mistake of an arbitrator, but the deliberate decision of a judge. Irritated by the new conditions that were imposed upon them, the men refused to work. The Prime Minister shed crocodile tears of sympathy for the poor men who, he said, were misguided by their militant boss leaders. He knows quite well that, on this occasion, the men acted in defiance of the advice of their leaders. Both political and industrial leaders counselled the men to return to work and swallow the Beeby award. They were actually at work again on the Sydney waterfront, and it seemed certain that the trouble would be at an end within a week, when the Prime Minister introduced the Transport Workers Bill, which was obviously designed for the one purpose of keeping the men out on strike in order to create a political atmosphere favorable to the Government. A strong supporter of the Nationalist party who resides near my home admitted to me one evening that he believed the Prime Minister wanted the strike to occur, ana tliat a lot of Nationalists were of the samv opinion, and were getting tired of such tactics. Perhaps that is one reason why the Government majority shrank so much at the last election. Honourable members opposite cannot continue to engineer these strikes always; people are getting tired of the incessanttalk of industrial warfare. It is a remarkable fact that, during the six years the present Government has been in office, there has been incessant industrial warfare or rumours of warfare. This is a proof of the failure and ineptitude of the Government to bring peace to industry. Even the employers who are -meeting the workers in conference say that they did not want this legislation, which is calculated only to irritate the men. The Prime Minister expressed a lot of sympathy for the poor misguided men who were misled by the industrial leaders. He had not a word of sympathy for the unfortunates who were cajoled by the employers to accept work on the. vessels, where they were murdered as deliberately as if they had been shot with guns or knifed. Being inexperienced, they could not do this work work without sacrificing their lives, and many of them were added to the large number of people who have been murdered by the industrial machine. The Prime Minister posed as a strong man, who would protect women and childre^ from the terrorism of the bombers. methods of industrial warfare are being introduced into this country very rapidly, and that investigation -would prove that the bombs were thrown by criminals hired by the shipping companies who support the Government, in order to create a helpful political psychology. Such tactics are common in America, and the workers have to face them in every strike. Organizations exist for no other purpose than to hire members of the underworld to hop in when there is big industrial turmoil, and, by violence and murder, provide an appearance of justification for the use of But, under the present system, Avise legisthe military forces to shoot down the workers and break their spirit. The history of American industrialism shows that this policy has been adopted What purpose could the throwing of bombs serve? Our industrialists are not madmen. They would not deliberately hire bomb-throwers to go out on their behalf, for they would know that to do so would stir up public opinion and a press campaign against themselves. They know too well that that kind of thing only assists their political opponents. then, this bomb business was not instigated by the industrialists-and no intelthat the object of this bill is to increase ligent person could think it was-it must have been instigated by our opponents, who desire to see the industrialists crushed and overwhelmed. The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) quoted with approval certain statements made in a. manifesto issued by the Australian Workers Union, which has just concluded its conference at Coolangatta, Queensland. This manifesto declared that the problem of unemployment was vexed and complex, and could not be easily solved. We have never suggested that a fairy wand could be waved, and all the difficulties banished. It was also stated in the manifesto that unemployment was universal. The veriest tyro in economics realizes that, so long as the present capimember ought to knoAv a good deal about talistic system prevails, unemployment must continue to be universal. It is as necessary to the capitalistic system as breath is to the human body. The honourable member also drew attention to the reference in the Australian Mr Ijazgarini. Union manifesto to the necessity for the I believe that American social control of industry. He seemed to think that he had made a great discovery. The fact is that, from the earliest days of the Labour movement, long before the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) Avas associated with it, the social control of industry has been advocated. The old formula might have been a little different from the present one, but the substitution for production for profit, of production for use, has always been the objective of Labour. Unemployment can be completely abolished only Avhen industry is socially controlled. lation and efficient organization could reduce unemployment to a minimum. Whenever Labour gOA'ernments have administered the affairs of. the country, in on innumerable occasions. the Eederal or State sphere, unemployment has been reduced. It is a matter of common knoAvledge that, immediately the Lang Government Avent out-of office and the Bavin GoA'ernment tppk charge of the affairs of NeAv South Wales, unemployment increased. Whilei t is undeniable that a government may,"" by care and f oresight, reduce * unemployment, it is If, also true that it may by indifference or design intensify it. I contend unemployment. The Government is endeavouring, at the request of vested interests in this country, to bring our economic standard doAvn to the level of other countries. The honourable member for Eawkner( Mr MaxAvell) observed, in the course of his speech, that, in his experience, the only persons in the community who objected to the Crimes Act were those who contemplated crime. That is a direct and unAvarranted reflection upon the trade unions of Australia, Avhich have consistently opposed legislation of the class which we are noAv considering. By inference the honourable member for FaAvkner has accused our trade unionists of being criminals. Of course, the honourable criminals, for he frequently makes strenuous efforts to prevent them from being punished for committing breaches of tie law. I have no doubt that, if any persons Avho may commit breaches Workers of the industrial laAv, have sufficient money to engage the honourable member to defend them, he will do his utmost to keep them out of gaol. We have been asked to make suggestions for stabilizing industry in Australia. easy enough to indulge in destructive criticism, but hard indeed to propose a constructive policy. However, I have a few suggestions to offer the Government. If it desires peace in industry I suggest that it should scrap the whole of the present legislation and introduce a comprehensive measure which would provide for the fixing of profits as well as wags; by arbitration. An exhaustive inquiry should also be made into our economic position. This work should be done not by conservative and judges, but by impartial persons who would see that the fair thing was done by 1 all interests. Steps should be taken to reduce the overhead charges in industry, by cutting away many industrial hangerson. It often happens that the son or the father, or some other relative, of the proprietor of an industry, who contributes nothing whatever to the prosperity of the concern, draws substantial dividends from it. Frequently several guineas are drawn byfigureheaddirectors for attending so-called board meetings. All this adds unnecessarily and unfairly to the cost of industry. It would be wise also to institute an inquiry into the efficiency or otherwise of the plant at present in use in many industrial concerns. Methods of marketing should also be investigated. I firmly believe that if a means were evolved of preventing wages from chasing prices, with wages always a good distance behind, the situation would be wonderfully improved. If the Government would take steps to give effect to these suggestions it would receive substantial support from honourable members on this side of the chamber. It cannot be denied that from its very beginning, industrial arbitration has been designed to press heavily on one class of the community. Twelve thousand coal miners are to be thrown out of work in a few days. Will the Government call Employers' Federation, to show cause why he should not be penalized for inciting the mine owners to lock out their employees? This man has been breaking our industrial law for the last month, but not a word has been said about it by honourable members opposite. I realize that it is often agitators in Australia. is it that it is impossible under our industrial law to prove that a lockout has been caused? We have challenged the Attorney General( Mr Latham) to show how this could be done under the existing law, but the challenge has not been accepted. The whole trouble with our arbitration system is that it is applicable, in its penal provisions particularly, only to employees. I suggest that if it is reasonable to fix a basic wage, it is reasonclass-conscious able to fix a basic profit. This basic profit should apply to every necessity of life and industry. Just as we allow a margin for skill in industry so we could allow a margin for luxury; but the ratio between wages and profits should always be maintained. If such a system were brought into operation we should have peace in industry. It should not be possible for employers to request the Arbitration Court to declare that an industry cannot be carried on without an increase in hours of work and a decrease in wages. This measure was conceived because the political .bankruptcy oT the Government was imminent. It was the gambler's last throw of the dice for another three years of power. It is one of those devices to stampede the mob which this Government has used ever since it has been in ofiice, and by which alone it has lived. It is a deliberate declaration of war against trade unionism, and all representatives of industrial organizations must aud will oppose it to the last ditch. A considerable amount of heat has been imparted into the debate by honourable members opposite. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat ( Mr Lazzarini) made special reference to certain regulations promulgated under the Transport Workers Act, to . which, in this measure, the Government seeks to give the effect of statute law.

65,Mr Gardner (Robertson) [4.31],"Parliament, indicated that time did not permit of the Government giving f u l l legislative effect to its proposals to deal with the then existing dispute on the waterfront, where a serious crisis had been precipitated. The bill now before honourable members honours the promise which the right honourable gentleman then gave to the House. I was particularly struck with certain remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa. He suggested that, since the Transport Workers Act had been passed by this Government, it was hardly reasonable to expect a certain section of the community to obey it. This, I submit, is a serious statement, coming as it does from a representative of the people. Under our democratic form of Government no legislative proposal can be passed unless it has the approval of the majority of the members, and no Government can command a majority unless its supporters constitute the majority of the electors of Australia. It is a dangerthat, with the exception, perhaps, of the ous doctrine to preach that in certain circumstances one section .of tbe community whose representatives in Parliament are in the minority, need not obey laws which were the legislative proposals of the. Government in power. There would be just as much justification for honourable members on this side of the . House to argue along the same lines in respect of measures that might be passed by a future Government representing, possibly, honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Werriwa contended, also, that the amendments made to the Arbitration Act were largely responsible for much of the present industrial unrest in Australia. Surely he forgets the serious industrial trouble that was responsible for that amending legislation, which was evolved as the most effective instrument to bring about industrial peace. But the first essential in every dislocation dustrial unrest in Australia. We all know of industrial relations, is that the laws passed by this Parliament shall be obeyed by all the people. Only in this way can we expect to ensure peace in industry, and a fair deal to all sections of the community. I was interested in the remarks of the affairs of industrial organizations. As honourable member for Hunter( Mr the result the rank and file do not get a James) ancl I congratulate him upon his fair hearing, though, as experience has evident sincerity. It is but fitting that he shown, industrial disturbances bring 31r. Gardner. should be sincere, because he has taken the seat so long held by Mr Charlton, one of the most sincere gentlemen we have ever had in the public life of Australia. I noted that the honourable member, referring to the bill, described it as anti-working class legislation. I was under the impression that it was anti-strike legislation. The honourable member would almost have us believe that there is only one class of workers. I remind him that there arc other sections and that one in particularI refer to the primary producer workers-wa s very seriously affected by the action of the transport workers towards the end of last year. This measure is the outcome of that industrial tipheaval. In introducing it the Prime Minister is honouring a promise made with, I am sure, the full support of all honourable members on this side of the House, that the primary producers would be fully protected in future. No one can gainsay favoured few who may be working the larger holdings and who, with them, carry big financial ancl other responsibilities, our primary producers, and particularly our dairymen and fruit growers, are workers in every sense of the word. The suicidal policy of the transport workers last year wrought a great deal of harm, not only to all the workers in Australia, but also to their wives and children. It is as well, therefore, that honourable members opposite, when they are discussing legislative measures affecting one section of industrial unionism, should remember that in the community there are other workers who are worthy of consideration, and that these industrial disturbances affect them disastrously. I approve of the bill. It is absurd for honourable members opposite to argue that this Government is responsible for the inthat those who really are responsible are certain executives of trade union organizations whose interests, by reason of their positions in the movement, are not identical with the welfare of the people of Australia. These glib-tongued persons carry altogether too much weight in the disaster upon them. I challenge honourable members opposite to cite one instance in which the workers have gained any substantial benefits from a strike. They must know that in nearly every instance devastation and ruin are the lot of the workers when they become involved in a strike; but they will not take a definite stand against this movement in the ranks of trade unionism. Possibly the explanation is to be found in the fact that a certain type of individual, of the agitator class, has altogether too much power in the affairs of the different organizations, and altogether too much power in pre-selection ballots for parliamentary candidates. said since the establishment of trade unionism. true to-day, and I feel sure that if honorwool, that we can hope to maintain the able members opposite would take a definite stand against the agitating element in trade unionism, the whole of the workers in Australia, constituting 90 per cent, of our population, would benefit materially. To illustrate the utter powerlessness of even strong organizations in the face of these industrial agitators, I need only mention that at one stage in the trouble on the waterfront last year, Ihe Waterside Workers Federation did make an attempt to persuade its members to obey the law. As a matter of fact, prior to the making of the Beeby award, it gave an undertaking, in the following terms, that the award of the court would be obeyed:Tliat the committee of management of the Waterside Workers Federation hereby undertakes to advise its members to carry out the existing awards and agreements covering the work of our members. It also undertakes to exercise all the powers conferred upon it ; the federal council of tlie union to enforce strict compliance on the part of members with their wives and families. A threat of any future award made by the court and/or agreements arrived at from time to time. Unfortunately, the federation was powerless to enforce its decision on individual members. In the circumstances, how can it be suggested that the Prime Minister was negligent of his public duty because he did not persist in calling a conference to consider terms for the settlement of that dispute? What a ridiculous figure the right honourable gentleman would have cut if he had attempted to do anything like that. industrial disturbance was the outcome of engineering by the agitator section of the industrial organizations concerned, and even the Waterside Workers Federation was powerless to take effective action. Fortunately better counsels prevailed in the Sydney branch of that organization. Let me remind the honourable member for Werriwa that the law applies only to those who attempt to flout it. Those who obey it have nothing to fear. ' I am glad that the Prime Minister emphasized that full protection would continue to be given to the volunteer workers. The leader of the Opposition, and other honourable members opposite, made reference to our present unsatisfactory trade situation. Surely they are aware that it is only by the uninterrupted export of our principal primary products, notably our balance of trade, and on this point I remind honourable members opposite, of the statement of the Prime Minister, that as the result of thedispute on the waterfront last year, there was a loss in the wool export trade of about Â£2,000,000. f t is significant that in this discussion they had nothing to say about that phase of our industrial trouble. During my election campaign I made it clear to my constituents that I thoroughly endorsed the undertaking given by the Prime Minister to fully protect the volunteer workers. If it were possible, I should like this protection to be extended to the wives and families of all the volunteer workers. That this is desirable is evident from the statement published in the Melbourne newspapers a week or two ago, crediting Mr Bodsworth, who, I understand, is president of the Timber Workers Union, with threatening not only volunteer workers in the timber industry, but also that nature should not be tolerated in a free country like Australia. It is a pity that the gentleman mentioned is not a member of the Waterside Workers Federation; because he might then be dealt with under some of the provisions of this measure. I am sure that honourable members opposite do not endorse the statement to which I refer. It is useless for partisans in industrial disturbances to emphasize the rapacity of capitalism in view of the fact that in the ranks of trade That unionism itself threats are issued against",30,Transport Workers Bill
66,Mr Fenton,That has always been,32,Transport Workers Bill
67,Mr Gardner,"Nevertheless , it iseven the wives and families of volunteer workers who merely do their duty to this country in a time of industrial strife. It is time for the people of Australia to take stock of the position. This is a national parliament, and it has no right to legislate in the interests of one section of the community only, whether it be the transport workers' organization or any other body of men. The people of this country returned this Government to power, believing that in times of financial and industrial unrest it will endeavour faithfully to represent all sections of the community. In assisting the Government to pass this legislation I feel that I am. acting in the interests of the community as a whole. I fully expected the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Gardner) to support the bill, because he always obeys the Government. He has never been known to give an independent vote in this House. Never once has he voted against the Goverument. able member that at one time he supported an amendment which I moved .in this House, contrary to the wishes of the Government. ber is always with the Government. He now says that he stands for arbitration. The Prime Minister last week tried to trace the history of arbitration in this country and its application to the waterside workers. I intend also to trace the history of arbitration so that honourable members may know what changes have taken place and how those changes have militated against the workers. Arbitration was first instituted to prevent sweating and to improve the conditions of labour. The workers of this country, when obtaining increased wages and improved conditions, have always had to stand by their organizations. The idea of arbitration was conceived about 30 years ago by some statesmen of New South Wales. An act was passed, and the workers were induced to register under it. The Government appointed a judge of the Arbitration Court, and the employers and employees were allowed to appoint a representative each, to sit with him. The judge was there to represent the public and to give legal force to auy awards that were made by .the court. I had the honour to be the employees' represeutative on that court for three years, and when cases were before it I had the same right, as the judge to cross-examine witnesses and to call for an examination of the books of employers. In one case, which concerned the shop assistants and drapers of Sydney, the employers swore before the court that they could not afford to pay increased wages. When the case had been heard the judge said in camera that it was evident that the employers could not afford to pay increased wages. I smiled, and he said to me, "" Do you doubt the evidence of these men ?"" I said, ""Yes, and I should like the court to examine their books."" That was done, and notwithstanding the sworn testimony of those men the judge's award provided for increased wages, amounting to Â£70,000. Despite that large increase in wages, none of the employers concerned have yet become insolvent. including the workers, paid for that increase. everything. The Government of New South Wales subsequently amended the act to prevent an examination being made of employers' books. Later the act was again amended to allow the court to be constituted of one judge only. The system of arbitration has completely changed; it is not arbitration, but argument among lawyers, whose main object is to lengthen the cases before tbe courtI t is an expensive method of arbitration, and the unionists have become utterly tired of it. Disputes have arisen in Australia. I have a relative who is an employer in the timber trade. He has informed me that the statement that the employers are making only 2 per cent, profit is absolute nonsense. two sets of books. thing because we have no power to examine their books. In the timber case, the judge before making his award public, asked both sides to the dispute to place suggestions before him. The employers gave certain information to the",32,Transport Workers Bill

Mr PAitKHJXJ. -In that case, the law was deliberately broken. people present at that meeting. What action could the Government take? It could do nothing; therefore the act as it stands is useless. This Government is always saying that the law must be obeyed, yet last week it endeavoured to upset an award made by the Public Service Arbitrator. The Prime Minister snid that the award was a mistake and, therefore, should not operate. The timber workers say that Judge Lukin has made a mistake and, therefore, they do not intend to obey his award. to refuse the award is given by law, but in the other case that is not so. ister has the right to say that the Public Service Arbitrator has made a mistake, surely the timber workers have the right to say that Judge Lukin has made a mistake. The timber industry has been working for six years under the 44 hours' award Both parties agreed to and worked under it. The court then decided that the employees must work 4S hours a week. Those employed in the building trades throughout Australia work 44 hours a week, and do not work on Saturdays. If the timber workers were employed on Saturdays they could not cart material to the builders, because tliere would be no one to receive it. TheI am speaking of alteration of the award is absolutely unthe Government say that we must have a working week of 48 hours. What does that mean? Does it mean that men must work eight hours a day from Monday to Saturday inclusive ? eight hours on Saturdays. with the advent of machinery in rural occupations, the number of labourers employed on farms is rapidly decreasing. To-day there are in. this country 40,000 fewer persons employed on the land than there were ten years ago. That is mainly due to the greater use of machinery.

Honourable members opposite repeatedly refer to the necessity for the maintenance of law and order, hut they disregard the fact that the award in the waterside workers' case was made by a judge appointed by a partisan government for past services.

In New South Wales the men have to' present themselves for employment at 7.30 a.m., and again iu the afternoon, although the shipowners who are acquainted with the movements of incoming vessels are able to tell the men in the morning when their services will be required. . Owing to tidal and other factors it is impracticable to make one award to govern all ports; but in this case one judge determined the hours during which all men were to be engaged. I am surprised that Judge Beeby, who has had considerable experience in industrial matters, should give an award in which provision is made for two pick-ups, as it is unusual for an arbitration judge to make an award which interferes with conditions which have been acceptable to both parties. waterside workers' case has not brought about industrial harmony on the waterfront, but has engendered such feelings of bitterness and hostility between the shipowners and the men that the men will retaliate at the first opportunity.

The Government is desirous of passing a measure under which men who do not agree to work under certain conditions will be treated as criminals. It is bringing about a state of slavery, and such a policy as the Government is pursuing was not supported by the people at the last elections. The industrial situation was side-tracked by repeated references to the Empire, the flag, and the maintenance of law and order. The members of the Labour party believe in arbitration, and contend that the present act can be amended in such a way that it will be acceptable to both parties. To-day it favours the employers, many of whom say they cannot pay decent wages, whilst at the same time they are amassing tremendous profits. The Australian worker of to-day is an educated man. He' knows the value of the raw material, and is able to determine the discrepancy between the manufactured cost and the selling price of an article. We frequently hear that men engaged in The award in. the rural pursuits are unable to pay their employees a living wage; but when their estates are sworn for probate purposes it is disclosed in some cases that their worth is as great as Â£50,000 or Â£100,000. It will not be long before the workers will be instrumental in the introduction of an arbitration system under which they will have representation in the Arbitration Court, and possess the the profits being made in an industry before an award is made. If such an Honourable investigation had been conducted in the timber workers' case a strike would have been averted. I am personally interested in the timber business, and I was informed by a man engaged in the industry As many of the men who that it was scandalous to say that the timber merchants were making a profit of only 2 per cent.

89,Mr E. Riley,"I will not say that I wish to take this opportunity of saying a few words for the large number of wharf labourers whom I represent. What is the position of the workers on the waterfront in Hobart and Tasmania .generally during about eight months of the year? They work very short hours for about eight mouths in the year, and in more men than are able to make a fair the busy four months make up an average living wage. During five of the past six years they have, owing to strikes, been robbed of even that chance. Industrial disturbances have been caused by stewards, cooks, seamen, engineers and coal-miners. During the strikes caused by these men the ships trading to Tasmania have been held up and the waterside workers have been unable to earn a shilling. During the last two strikes a special concession was made by allowing the steamers trading to Tasmania to carry mails; but the waterside workers were not allowed to place a single ton of cargo on the vessels. Is it not time that something was said on behalf of these men ? Year after year the waterside workers in Tasmania, and particularly in Hobart, have been crucified by strikes for which they were not responsible. In most cases they knew nothing of a cessation of operations by certain sections of industrialists until the announcement appeared in the newspapers that the ships were tied up. The waterside workers of Melbourne were butchered by their leaders. I was in Melbourne when the trouble on the waterfront occurred last year and when the men were informed by their leaders that in no circumstances were they to accept the award. They had to come out on strike. They were then told to return to work, but not to take out licences. When nearly 4,000 licences had been issued to other workers, they were instructed to take out licences. When landing in Melbourne the other morning, I witnessed a most pitiable sight. Hundreds of men were being marched to work with mounted troopers in front and behind them and foot police lining the route they were taking. After these men had commenced work several hundreds of men, many of whom had been employed on the waterfront for years, came forward to take what employment was left over. These unionists were butchered by tha vacillation and incompetency of their leaders. The waterside workers in Tasmania are not licensed because they declined to come out on strike; but the licensing system should ultimately be an advantage to waterside workers generally, because licences should not be issued to living on the waterfront. Further, licences should not be issued to aliens whilst there is a Britisher-unionis t or non-unionist-seekin g work. Looking over the ship's side the other morning, I saw Britishers idle whilst Southern Europeans were at work, and I felt that an alteration of the present system was essential. As honourable members are aware, I have been fighting the shipping combine for years. Unfortunately, .the whole of our coastal shipping is now in the hands of the Inchcape combine and for that the Federal Parliament is responsible. We should permit more competition on the Australian coast. If honourable members will refer to the debates in this chamber, when the Navigation Act was under consideration, they will see that I prophesied exactly what is happening. In Australia we are building up a shipping combine such as was in operation in the United States of America at the outbreak of war, when 75 per cent, of the American troops had to be transported to Europe in British ships. If the waterside workers are to have a fair deal we must devote more attention to the shipping combine. I hope to be able to give it with the help of our friends opposite. I look upon the Arbitration Act as being on its trial. That act was born in travail. Three Governments went down trying to get it through the committee stage in this Parliament, and no other measure was ever surrounded by so much political wreckage. For the first few years, the Arbitration law did a great work, but now, so far as I can see, it creates more strikes than it prevents. giving effect to the Government's policy. the Government should have nothing to do with the Arbitration Act, or with the working of the court, which is supposed to carry on according to rules laid down by act of Parliament.

92,Mr Mowilliams,"The policy ofor workers will not obey an award that is given, tbe Arbitration Act ceases to have any value. In. this connection, I am reminded of the admonition, of the old Irish cricketer to his son, who was about to play in his first match: "" My boy,"" he said, "" if the umpire says you're out, then you're out, whether you're out or not."" When an award of the court is given, it should be obeyed, whether it is right or not. While admitting that, however, let me say that, in my opinion, the insertion of the second pick-up provision in the last award was a mistake. It has a demoralizing effect on a man, to make him hang around the wharf all day on the chance of being picked up. In the interests of every one concerned, and especially of the morale of the men, I hope that the second pick-up, which is quite unnecessary, will be abolished. It is just one of those pin-pricks which do so much to make men rebels. I should like to see it done in the proper way, if it ""between the two subjects.' These remarks is possible to get the ship-owners to consider anythingfairly and reasonably, seeing that they are controlled by the Inchcape combine on the other side of the world. As a peace offering on the part of the ship-owners, they might well make a voluntary offer to' the court to have the second pick-up provision withdrawn. In that way they would do a great deal to bring about goodwill and peace on the water front. .1 do not think that this bill is nearly so dangerous as some members of the Opposition think. The chief objection to it appears to be the provision for licensing workers; but that, I think, will turn out to be of distinct advantage to the waterside workers themselves. experience. We know how it has worked up to date. to discuss what has already taken place in connection with the recent strikes. I was in Melbourne during the recent disturbances, and it is my opinion that the men werd unwisely led. . In Sydney and Tasmania, where the workers obeyed, the award, the licensing provision was not introduced. I believe it would be to the advantage of the workers if just sufficient numbers were licensed to do the work, and further applications were refused. E say, with all the emphasis at my command, that not a single licence should be issued to an alien, while one of our own. race was looking for a job. usual, I understand, for a new member to refer to his newness, and to ask for leniency from the Chair should he happen to wander from the subject. I have no intention this afternoon, however, of speaking of terraces of houses that I do not own, nor of income derived from coal mines which I do not possess, but I do wish to say a few words about the Transport Workers Bill. You will realize that, being a teacher, I have been properly trained in the art of correlation. If T, as a teacher, were speaking to children about the cultivation of cabbages, and. introduced some remarks about the rule of three, you would understand immediately that; there was some correlation I make by way of introduction, so that we may understand each other as I go along. I was very much struck by the speech of the honourable member for Franklin agreement with what he said about the operations of the shipping combine. 1 remember that in 1925 this same combine of ship-owners was responsible for the strike to which the honourable member refers; the strike which had such a detrimental effect upon the workers in Tasmania. That trouble was referred to as a strike, but, as a matter of fact, it was a lockout. At that time the banks refused to finance the marketing of Australia's wool ancl wheat. In other words, they went on strike, but we did not hear of any bankers being rail-roaded to gaol, or of any act being passed to deal with them. They asked the Note Board of the Commonwealth Bank for a special issue of Â£60,000,000 worth of notes to finance the wool and wheat crops. The chairman of the board refused, but said that the board would grant Â£15,000,000 worth of notes to do the work. After consultation the banks decided to accept the Â£15,000,000, and the remarkable thing was that they did not draw a single note of that"" Â£15,000,000, but were able to create Â£60,000,000 worth of credit on the",36,Transport Workers Bill

96,"( Mr Mcwilliams), And I Am In Thorough","strength of the arrangement. It was then that the shipping combine, associated' with the bank, brought about the strike to which I have referred, and blamed the men for it. The ship-owuers said that the waterside workers were not in their places when the call for labour was made. As a matter of fact, the men were iu their places every day, but when they stood on the left side of the street, the pick-up men were sent to the other side. right hand side the pick-up men went to tbe left. That is one instance in which Tasmania has suffered injury from the shipping combine. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin that the present waterside trouble has been caused by the two pick-up provisions. The two pick-up system has always been in operation in Sydney, but when it was sought to introduce it at other ports, there was trouble. ""Who are the workers who have been thrown out of their jobs by the newcomers to Australia? Ninety per cent of them are returned soldiers. Rightly or wrongly these men went on strike, and later found their places taken by men from overseas. that by the shipping combine. I do not know how it was worked, but by some means or another the two pick-up provision was got into the award for the purpose of stirring up trouble. The ship-owners who are at the bottom of this trouble are the same persons who had their ships commandeered by the Government after the war had been in progress for eighteen months, because they were trading in contraband goods to the Continent. They had made Â£300,000,000 by carrying such things to Denmark as cement, from which the German pillboxes were made, nickel for bullets, and cotton for explosives. These interests now deal as they like with the Australian workers, and they are backed up by the Australian National Government. I admit, at once, that the principle of the strike 13 barbaric, but the obvious answer to that is, that the capitalistic system of industry is also barbaric. Many pages of history might be quoted in proof of that. Even this very act which we are now amending exudes barbarism from almost every sentence. The Peace in In dustry Conference now meeting in Sydney is a monument to the futility of this very legislation. The dice are loaded against the workers of this country, and I regard it as my duty to explain to them how financial and commercial interests combine against them. I remember that when the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill was introduced into this House by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), ""When the men waited on the he said that it was to give the rank and file of the unions control over their executive. That was accepted. According to the statements that appeared every clay in the press, the rank ancl file did not have control over their executives, and the Arbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act would give it to them. A little later, when Mr Bruce was introducing the Transport Workers Bill, he said that the object of the measure was to give the executive of a union control over the rank and file. This contradictory attitude reminds mc of a criticism that appeared in the Melbourne AgeThere is no doubt FACING BOTH WAYS . the trouble was engineered A t one time Mr Bruce speaks as a wholehearted Australian, with a knowledge of the efforts that have been made for many years past to entangle us mischievously in the affairs of Europe. A t another he expresses the longrepudiated sentiments of the old Imperial Federationists, who favoured a supreme Imperial Parliament, directing the national progress of all the far-flung Dominions, and enforcing a policy of Free trade within the Empire. One day the Prime Minister wishes to give the rank and file control of the executive, and the next day he wishes to give the executive control of the rank and file. The Government has made it a crime for the workers to strike, but the capitalist can strike whenever he chooses, and be immune from punishment. When a capitalist refuses to sell his goods below the price he asks for them, he goes on strike, but he is not rail-roaded to gaol; no special law is passed to make n criminal of him. In the fixing of a minimum wage the worker is asked to account for every penny of his expenditure; he is even asked to economize in the food and clothing provided for his wife and children. But never in my acquaintance with arbitration has the owner been questioned Concerning the number of motor curs lie owns, or the amount he spends on cigars and champagne. It is well known that in the universe there is sufficient of the necessaries of life to maintain everybody in comfort, but if one man lives iu luxury, another must go short. There is sufficient for all only if all receive their just share. It would be futile for me to speak at great length, because even if I had the rhetorical powers of Demosthenes and the political sagacity of Higginbotham, I could not prevent the passage of the bill.' In conclusion, I draw attention to the vicious principle, which is becoming far too general in industrial legislation, of throwing upon the accused person the onus of proving his innocence. That is a subversion of one of the principles of British jurisprudence. It has made ""its appearance in the laws of some of the States as well as of the Commonwealtli, but the time has arrived when lionorable members sliould take a stand i'gainst it. It is not just to charge a man with a crime and require him to prove his innocence. Yet that is what the Crimes Act and the Arbitration Act do, and what this bill proposes, but I trust that, even if the bill is passed, this vicious provision honourable member for Franklin that only will be eliminated. -The honourable member for Warringah sought to draw an analogy between the licensing of waterside workers and the licensing of electricians in New South Wales, and he made the broad, general statement that no person could get employment as an electrician in that State unless he held a certificate signed by me. The statement is not correct. Eirstly, the present Government of New South Wales, some time after assuming office, took care to remove me from the position of chairman of the Electrical Licensing Board. is no analogy between a licence certifying the fitness of a person to engage in a technical occupation and a mere permit to work on the waterfront issued to any person who pays a shilling. To demonstrate their hostility to the law introduced by the Lang Government, the employers in the electrical trade of New South Wales withdrew their representative from the board over which I had the honour to preside. That body was created for the protection of life and property by ensuring that only qualified persons should engage in electrical work. A similar law had been in operation in other States for many years, and it requires no justification from me. Almost every month we hear of men and women being electrocuted because of faulty installations. The licensing system was introduced for the protection of the general public and of electrical workers themselves by requiring that those who engaged in this dangerous ancl skilled occupation should know their job. It was necessary for them to have passed an examination at the technical college prescribed by the board, or to produce their indentures showing that their apprenticeship had been sufficiently long to give them efficient training. In the licensing of transport workers, the competency of the worker is not taken' into consideration; he is not even required to be able to speak the English language. petency be taken into consideration? competent men should be allowed to engage in waterside avocations, because of their dangerous character. Owing to the inefficiency of a large number of men who accepted employment during the strike, many persons were maimed or killed. The honourable member for Franklin must know that the Government does not propose to restrict in any way employment ou the waterfront. The policy of employers in all sections of industry is to keep available a surplus of labour, ancl consequently the ship-owners are not anxious to restrict the number of licences to be issued to waterside workers. For similar .reasons the Secondly, there electrical employers in New South Wales were opposed to the licensing of electricians. They realized that their choice of men would be restricted to those who held licences and they would not have as big a labour market in which to operate as they previously had. They were not concerned about the protection of life and property; their only desire was to get as much profit as possible out of their industry. The Licensing Board was designed to be representative of all sections of the industry-the fire under-",37,Transport Workers Bill

99,Mr Beasley,"I agree with thewriters, public bodies supplying electricity, employers, tbe electrical trade union ancl licensed electricians ""who may not be members of the union. This body, composed of representatives of all sections of the industry, bad the right to determine upon what conditions and to whom licences should be issued. That is not the position with the licensing of waterside workers; the licensing authority does not include any representative of organized labour. Honourable members who compare impartially the facts I have related with the conditions that the Government, has applied to the waterside workers, will recognize that there is no analogy between the two. On several occasions the electrical employers in New South Wales waited on the responsible Minister in opposition to the licensing law, but he refused to accede to their requests. Finally, however, an intimation was conveyed to the Bavin Government that the financial support of the electrical employers would be withdrawn unless their demands were acceded to, aud under this pressure the Minister yielded and the licensing system was sacrificed. Now all that is required is that the man iu charge of an electrical installation must be licensed. Much electrical work is concealed, and for that reason the man in charge of a big job cannot possibly supervise every detail of it. However, the employers in New South Wales are now able to engage any class of labour that, suits them, thanks to their ability, by financial pressure, to force the present indicated clearly that it is necessary, in State Government to destroy the system of licensing electricians. members, will, I am sure, agree that the facts I have mentioned are a complete answer to the arguments of the honourable member for Warringah. Many disputes occur which, if wisely handled in their initial stages, would never reach serious dimensions. In illustration of this, I mention a dispute to which the State Government was a party, affecting the electrical workei's at Port Kembla on the south coast. Members of my organization when returning to the power house from their work one evening on a lorry, the property of the Public Works Department, were seen by the District Engineer, who happened to be passing, indulging in what he regarded as horse play. I m mediately he reached his office he' directed that all the men on the lorry should be dismissed. No inquiry was made into the facts of the case. An apprentice who happened to be on the lorry was not dismissed, for his dismissal would have involved an inquiry by the Board of Trade, according to the terms of his indentures. My organization took the matter up ancl earnestly requested an inquiry. The Minister for Public Works appreciated our point of view, but said that he could not grant the inquiry, for to do so would mean taking the side of the workers against his officer. We pointed out that his duty was to hold the scales of justice evenly between the parties; but he said that he had to stand by his officers. He observed that some time previously he had reinstated a man who had been dismissed, ancl it would not do for him to reinstate these men, because it would appear that he was always taking the side of the men. The union unsuccessfully used every means in its power to obtain an inquiry. It was then forced to use the strike weapon. It solicited, and secured the sympathy of every trade union which had members employed in work on the south coast, and then issued an ultimatum that unless an inquiry were granted all the members of the unions concerned would cease work. It was only after that action was taken that an inquiry was granted. After the inquiry all the men were reinstated. This the interests of the workers and of peace Honourable in industry, to have upon the Treasury bench members who will not be unduly influenced by persons who are out of sympathy with the working man. There is no doubt whatever that the present Government and its supporters are antagonistic to the trade union movement. The introduction of this bill shows that very clearly. During this debate our whole system of compulsory industrial arbitration has been brought under review. Reference has been made to the timber workers' strike. In this connection I draw attention to an inquiry made in 1920 by the late Mr Justice Higgins intoan application for a general 44-hour week in Australia. For the purposes of this case evidence was gathered in every country in the world where industries of any magnitude were operating, and it was demonstrated beyond all question that the world-wide tendency is to reduce the hours of labour. In these circumstances one would expect that a Government which claimed to be sympathetic with the aims and objects of the workers would not oppose a reduction of hours of work. I had the privilege of representing Australian Labour at the International Labour Conference in 1926, and was able at the conference to test the sincerity of the employwas resolved that it would be desirable ing class as a whole in its expressed desire to elevate the conditions of the workers. The preamble of the convention under which the International Labour Office was established sets out that in order to establish peace in industry it is necessary to consider international economic relations. It also sets out that it is useless for the League of Nations to attempt to abolish war unless it makes an effort to place the economic conditions of the various countries on a fair and equitable footing. One might have expected that when the conference was giving consideration to the differences between the economic standards of the various countries the representatives of the Commonwealth and of the Commonwealth employers would have attempted to bring the conditions of the backward countries into line with Australian but instead of endeavouring to level up things they consistently in favour of a levelling down process. Sir Joseph Cook, who represented the Government at the conference, invariably voted in. favour of a policy which tended to reduce the standards of Australia to those of the backward countries of Southern Europe. In the face of this, honourable members opposite cannot expect us to believe them when they say that they believe that the people should have the highest possible standards of living. It will be remembered that at the conference held in Washington in 1919 a convention was agreed to in favour of a universal 48-hour working week, but it was reported at the 1926 conference that only four nations had ratified the convention.. hypocrisy for the nations who agreed Ifr. Beasley. to this convention at the 1919 conference, but failed afterwards to ratify it, to talk about desiring peace in industry. In my opinion the Arbitration Court as at present constituted is deliberately endeavouring to give expression to the policy of this Government, and consequently its work is meeting with the strong disapproval of the workers. Ever since 1921 Labour has felt that the Arbitration Court has been only partially fulfilling its true functions. At the Labour Conference held in that year it to replace the court by industrial councils on which both the employers and employees would be adequately represented. We were not unmindful, however, that the Arbitration Court guaranteed to certain large bodies of workers an economic standard which might be lost if the court were abolished. Some employers in Australia would not hesitate to sweat their employees and reduce them to the lowest level. Consequently we felt that before the court was abolished some other and better method of dealing with industrial troubles should be set up. We feel that it is not fair to permit the Arbitration Court to make a searching inquiry into the quality and quantity of the clothes we wear and the food we eat, or into the Government class of house we live in, or the general circumstances of our lives, seeing that it makes no effective inquiry into the general conditions of an industry. The conditions; whole thing is too one-sided. If the Government is sincere in its desire to imvoted prove industrial relations, let it give more attention to the demands of the working class and much less to capital, to prevent a large section of the employers from forcing my class down to the lowest level. The Government has shown that it is out of step with modern industrial developments. It is not keeping abreast of the times or it would take into consideration the altered conditions of life. Instead of endeavouring to make criminals of working men who are trying to improve their standard of living it should be seeking to replace our present antiquated system of dealing with industry with one more in accordance with modern ideals. Pacts brought to light during the timber workers' dispute have shown conclusively It is rank that the demand for an inquiry into the timber trade is thoroughly warranted. Honourable members have doubtless read the letters which have appeared in the Sydney press over the signature of E. B. Warren, timber merchant of Newtown. His firm has publicly refused to be associated with the efforts that are being made to decrease wages and increase hours in industry. It has been proved beyond all question that the figures published with the object of showing the smallness of the profits made in the timber industry will not bear investigation. In view of all the facts I intend to support the amendment, for I feel that the Transport Workers Act should be repealed. The object of this bill is to incorporate in the Transport Workers Act certain regulations which have heen proclaimed by the Government. The main argument advanced by the Prime Minister and his supporters in favour of the bill has been that the workers and their industrial organizations are not prepared to abide by the decisions of the Arbitration Court and other industrial tribunals. The Prime Minister has deplored what he has described as a tendency on the part of the workers not only to repudiate industrial awards but to refuse to obey the law. We, on this side of the House, and the trade union movement outside are -willing to admit full responsibility for any breaches of the law that may be committed. There have been many such breaches already. Let me cite as an illustration the mass meeting of workers in the Sydney Town Hall on Monday night last. Under laws passed hy this Government every man and woman who attended that meeting was an offender ngainst the law, as indeed was every speaker on the platform. Every man who is acting as a picket in connection with the present dispute in the timber industry is breaking the law, and every article that is published in the Labour newspapers is a breach of the law. Such laws as those passed by the Bruce-Page Government dealing with industrial matters are unworthy of observance. I now tell this or any other Tory Government that may attempt to compel the people to observe iniquitous laws, that the thing is impossible. There is not sufficient accommodation in all our gaols to hold the people who are committing breaches of the industrial laws passed by this Government. The Prime Minister, as well as all those members who are supporting the Government, have a very grave responsibility in regard to this provocative legislation, with its savagely penal provisions that enact punishment for breaches which the industrial movement does not and will not regard as offences against the law of this country. bringing the law into contempt. ment also. In its attempt to destroy the trade union movement in Australia, the Government has seriously over-stepped the mark. Ministers, to use a colloquialism, have ""bitten off more than they can chew."" Whilst we on this side of the House are being importuned by various speakers supporting the Government to obey the law, Ministers in their turn are breaking it themselves. They may be doing this in a strictly legal manner, but their action, nevertheless, is immoral. The Government embodies penal provisions in legislation under which men may be gaoled for industrial offences, but when it suits Ministers, they take action in another chamber to disallow an award that does not meet with their approval. The judges of our Arbitration Court have been criticized ou many occasions. I have done that myself in this House, but always I have been ruled out of order by the presiding officer, although my only offence has been to intimate that in my opinion a judge had made a mistake in a particular award. If we may judge from what has happened recently, the Prime Minister of Australia, the chief citizen of the Commonwealth, a man occupying a high and responsible position may, with impunity, come down to this chamber and declare that Parliament must disallow an award of the Public Service Arbitrator. How different was it when an organization of Sydney wharf labourers, for example, dared to criticize Judge Beeby's award with regard to pick-up places. Actually men have been gaoled for doing what the Prime Minister and his Government are now doing under the cloak of parliamentary procedure. Their action to disallow an award for the payment of certain allowances to postal officials transferred to",39,Transport Workers Bill

Erom time to time there appear articles in the newspapers indicating a sense of disquiet amongst the capitalistic class of this and other countries. The Prime Minister is fond of warning Australia .about the danger of the Red menace. Many Government candidates in the last election campaign relied mainly upon the raising of these bogys to frighten the people of this country. They endeavoured to show that there was in Australia a number of political agitators who had no respect at all for the constitution; men who were lawbreakers themselves and who were being subsidized by the Bolshevists to break down our present social system. They waxed eloquent in their denunciation of this grave danger which, they assured the people, was to be apprehended from the Red menace. If the Ministry expects the people to obey its law it must see to it that those laws are neither iniquitous in their conception nor unfair in their incidence. Legislation that aims at the breaking down of established customs and institutions, such as a trade union movement, must go the way of earlier iniquitous laws-it must go by the board. The legislative field of Australia, both Eederal and State, is strewn with the bones of legislation, of the character of the up I ancl many others in the union had Crimes Act, the amendments to the Arbitration Act, and the Transport ""Workers Act. All such legislative measures have been abandoned because the people resolutely declined to obey them. This bill, with its penal provisions that are at once provocative and vindictive, cannot and will not be accepted by the workers. This Government, which is so desirous of acting as the tool of mean employers Groom) -Order! I must ask the honourable member to withdraw that statement. Speaker.

It has been ruled repeatedly that a member may criticize any judgment of a court, and may point out what ho considers to be faults or mistakes in such a judgment; but it is the rule of Parliament that there must be no reflection upon the personal character of the members of the judiciary. ruling, Mr Speaker. I say that by the appointment to the Arbitration Court of men who, it knew, desired a reduction in wages and an increase in the working hours the Government has done great harm to the industrial movement in Australia. I do not propose, iu this debate, to trace the history of the present judges of the Arbitration Court. I am hoping that a better opportunity will be available to me later; but I say that the Arbitration Court judges in their judgments have done things that were never contemplated under our industrial laws. To illustrate my point may I cite my personal experiences ? About 20 years ago in Sydney it was customary for members of the Waterside Workers Union to present themselves at all times at any of the wharfs from 6 o'clock in the morning until G o'clock in the evening. To be available for the first pickto rise at 4 o'clock in the morning so as to be at the wharfs by 6 o'clock. Thousands of other unfortunate workers were in the same position. At that time the shipowners were very firm, and acting together they were in a position to insist upon the men hawking their labour from wharf to wharf. If men failed to be picked up at the first call they had to wait until the 9 o'clock call after breakfast, ancl if not picked up then, would have to wait until later in the day. They were obliged to walk backwards and forwards on the wharfs and pay frequent visits to the post office to ascertain what boats I do so, Mr were expected, ancl at what timo they were scheduled to arrive. I am not a little proud of the humble part which I played in bringing to a successful conclusion the movement to abolish the 6 o'clock start. As a result of continued agitation the union decided that the 6 o'clock pick-up must be abolished, and",42,Transport Workers Bill

But tlie movement was too strong to bo checked. By their logic and force of numbers the men attained their objective. They won their case in the Arbitration Court before that tribunal came under the evil influence of the tories in this country.

Recently the A.C.T.U., a body which is truly representative of the trade unions of Australia,' decided to sever all connection with the Bruce-Page Government's Arbitration Court. Were it not for the questionable appointments of Judge Lukin, Judge Dethridge, and the other judges, whose recent mistakes have completely demoralized the court, the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, representing as it does some 600,000 unionists, would not have taken the extreme step of leaving that judiciary. Responsibility for the extreme action taken by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions rests solely with the Government aud its supporters. ber says that, but he knows better. and sincerely, believing that that judiciary is being used to smash trade unionism. member's remark is highly improper, and I ask him to withdraw it. The honorn.ble member must not suggest that the judiciary is being used for any purpose other than that for which it has been appointed. Prior to 1917 the Arbitration Court was in the hands of capable and honest men, but because Mr Justice Higgins was not doing as the Goverument desired, because he was coquetting with a working week of 44 hours, he was swamped. The Government decided that Mr Justice Higgins was a menace to the capitalists and the employers of this country; and not long afterwards he had to resign from the Presidency of the Eederal Arbitration Court. sons for his resignation. he gave was political interference by the Government. The Government then appointed to the highest industrial tribunal of this country the president of the Employers' Federation. tainted justice. honourable member not to proceed ou those lines, and to withdraw those words. deference to you, Sir. but I submit that when a man, who has been the president of the Employers' FederationI ask that the honourable member for Darling be called upon to withdraw his observations about tainted justice. ber for Darling has already withdrawn his remark.

Those appointments have been criticized by our political opponents, but let me say that the decisions of those gentlemen have been based upon honesty and equity. At no time have they departed from the established hours and wages which have always prevailed in the State of Queensland. But this Government uses its power and influence to select men whose political views appeal to it, to control the destiny of the Arbitration Court. The Bavin Government of New South Wales did likewise. Mr Piddington was appointed Industrial Commissioner by a Labour Government, but because he did not suit the Tories and employers of New South Wales and the members of the Nationalist organisation, including the honourable member for Warringah, he had to be swamped, and therefore two other Talk about gentlemen were appointed, and I have not the slightest doubt that their views and ideas were well known to the Bavin Government before their appointments were made.",44,Transport Workers Bill

The Minister for Trade and Customs was quite in order in raising the point that, although the honourable member for Darling had withdrawn certain remarks, a certain portion of his speech was directed against the judiciary, and the honourable member has been told not to continue in that strain. Beeby, in the language of the Prime Minister, made a mistake, and turned a complete somersault, of the inner history of which I should like some informationhonorable member for Darling has suggested that the judge, for some improper reason, reversed his decision. That statement, I maintain, is out of order. ber for Darling is still referring to the fact that after the parties had spoken to the minutes, the judge changed his opinion, which he describes as turning a somersault. To say that a judge changed his opinion is not to suggest anything against his integrity. If the honourable member for Darling intended anything sinister, his remark was distinctly out of order. honourable member for Darling did not suggest a motive when he said he would inner history of the change of opinion. the humiliation and indignity heaped upon the wharf labourers of Australia by the judge's extraordinary mistake, at a conference of the whole of the branches of Australia, held in Melbourne, the men were recommended to accept the award. The waterside workers in some of the Australian ports .did so; but in others, particularly Melbourne, where they had enjoyed the privilege of one pick-up instead of two, they naturally resented the decision of the judge. The men who refused to recognize the award did not have a parliament to which they could go, and, as it were, stifle the judge, and could not sack him for making mistakes. The action of the judge responsible for breaking down the conditions which had been so long established ancl which had been so hard to win, calls to my mind thoughts which you, sir, would not allowme to express. The members of about 50 per cent, of the branches were at work whilst the remainder were on strike against this iniquitous award. We asked the Prime Minister, as the first citizen of Australia, to convene a conference to see if it were not possible to overcome the difficulty, as Judge we desired probably mare than the Government and its supporters did, that there should be peace in industry.

When we asked the Government, through the Prime Minister, to convene a compulsory conference, instead of offering the olive branch, the right honourable gentleman produced the big stick in the shape of legislation providing for the issuing of licences to wharf workers.

The Prime Minister, his Government, and honourable members supporting it, are responsible for the position in justification of the licensing system, which has arisen on the waterfront.

That is why the strike was kept going, and in my opinion that was the real reason why the judge somersaulted. member to withdraw that remark. orable member not to disobey again the ruling of the Chair, otherwise it will be necessary for me to take action. He has received the clear direction that he must not reflect upon the judiciary, and he now knows that in doing so he is violating the rules of the House. Prime Minister expressed the pious hope that the Peace in Industry Conference would be successful; yet he immediately proceeded to place upon our statute-book this freakish and stupid legislation iu an endeavour to bring about peace in industry. It is impossible to have peace in industry while the present Government occupies the Treasury bench, as the real intention of such legislation is to ensure anything but industrial peace. A penal clause provides that if an unlicensed person engages in work on the waterfront he is liable to a penalty of Â£10. The bill provides that workers who refuse to produce a ticket will, under the penalties imposed by the Government through the Attorney-General, be fined Â£10. Unauthorized persons in possession of a ticket, persons trafficking in licences, those guilty of payment to employers, of obstructing a licensing officer, or of making false statements, may also be fined Â£10. As a sop to the workers the measure provides that any employer who engages an unlicensed person may be fined Â£100. Such penalties are provided in this measure which the Government seeks to place upon the statute-book; but which, in a few months, will be relegated, to the same place as similar stupid freakish legislation passed from time to time by Tory Governments has been relegated. It is absurd to think that this legislation can be of any lasting benefit to the country, or that it can even endure for any length of time. Much has been said and both on the public platform, and in this House since we have come back, honourable members opposite have stated that after all there is nothing wrong with the licensing system, that doctors, lawyers, auctioneers, fish purveyors, and many other estimable, citizens have to be l i censed, so why not wharf labourers? The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) laid particular emphasis on this point. The Attorney-General stated that much benefit had already been derived from the licensing system, claiming that it has been responsible for increased efficiency, and for a higher standard of honesty on the wharfs. I forget now whether he said that the standard of honesty had improved by 100 or 200 per cent. Of course it is so much foolishness on his part to try to make us believe that. He might be believed if he told it to the Employers' Federation, or to the Women's National League, or some other body, the members of which know nothing about these men. If the Attorney-General had ever worked on the wharfs, or had had any experience of the work, he would know that a good deal of the dishonesty of the employer is blamed on the employee.

Older men were available, but the authorities purposely selected young men of eighteen, nineteen, and twenty years of age.

I members opposite criticizing the procedure adopted by the Government, and attacking it for having initiated certain legislation; but surely it is out of place to attack men occupying honoured positions in the life of Australia, particularly members of the judiciary, as has been done during this debate. Honourable members opposite even go so far as to make the extraordinaiy statement that there is no such thing as honour on this side of the chamber. Reference has been made to certain appointments. One might, with equal justice, attack certain appointments made by the Labour Government in Queensland. I contend that the Commonwealth Government has always endeavoured to do the right and honest thing in all the appointments it has made to the Arbitration Courts of the Commonwealth. In any case, our judiciary should be beyond criticism in this deliberative assembly. The Leader of the Opposition and others on his side of the chamber try to make out that the Government has been unwilling to do anything to bring about industrial peace. Surely their memories are short if they fail to remember the attempt made ' by the Prime Minister a few months ago to promote an industrial peace confer-' ence. Did he not issue invitations to the employers' and workers' organizations to send delegates to such a conference! Was it not suggested that the expenses of these delegates should be paid and that they should receive a daily allowance? Was not every inducement offered to bring these people together at a roundtable conference, with the object development of Australia? It was an important step towards industrial peace, but unfortunately the unions refused to send delegates to the conference. honourable members opposite have misrepresented the desire of the Prime Minin the community. It will be remembered in connection with that conference, that it was suggested that if the Government would abandon its proposed amendments to the Arbitration Act the conference could well understand honourable might be held. The Prime Minister deliberately placed the Conciliation and zVrbitration Bill at the bottom of the business paper in order to meet the desires of certain people at that time, but evidently that was not considered sufficient, because the further suggestion was made that the bill should be taken off the business paper altogether, which of course would have placed the Government in a humiliating position. It might reasonably have been expected that the Government would keep its word in connection with the matter. As further evidence of the desire of the Bruce-Page Government to bring about better relations between employers and employees, an industrial delegation representing all sections of the community was sent to America, at great expense to the taxpayers of Australia. After spending Â£10,000 or Â£12,000, the delegation returned and submitted a very interesting report, but so far there have been no practical results from it ; the delegation might just as well have remained in Australia. In the belief that certain militant leaders of the unions had no desire for industrial peace, the Government introduced amendments to the Arbitration Act in an attempt to restore the control of the unions to the members of the",49,Transport Workers Bill

It is true that some of the unions are now represented on a peace conference, which is being held in Sydney at the present time, but it is very significant that threats have been made that the delegates of certain unions may be induced to withdraw from the conference unless as a preliminary to the proceedings ithe volunteer labour is taken off the wharfs, the amendments of the Arbitration Act are repealed, the Crimes Act is repealed and the ban is removed from the importation of certain Labour literature. seems to me that these demands are put forward by militant labour leaders, who have not at heart the interests of Australia. It should be the desire and ambition of every honourable member of this House to endeavour to do ail that is possible to make the Sydney conference a success; because only by co-operation in industry can we hope to make progress in the development of Australia. But I am strongly of opinion that the leaders of industrial Labour in this country have no intention of co-operating for the purpose of securing peace in industry. make no secret of the fact that the objective of the Labour Party is the nationalization of industry, and every attempt is made to hold up industry in order to bring about the day of socialism. Every attempt is made to cause the employment of labour to be unprofitable; hence the unemployment now exists. with the fact that, quite a number of people, small capitalists they might be called, prefer to put their money into Commonwealth loans and accept a small rate of interest, rather than invest it in industry and run the risk of the militant unions bringing about industrial trouble. Every strike is regarded as a step nearer to the goal of socialism. Has not every age had its experience of socialism? far off to-day as ever it was, because the average working man cannot be induced to sink his individuality and sacrifice his principles to bring about a state of affairs such as exists in Eussia to-day. Can the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr to do for Australia. The Bruce-Page GoLazzarini) Afr. Mackay. statements about the benefits to be achieved by socialism, quote any instance in which it has been a success? Every State of the Commonwealth has had its experience in this direction. In Queensland, which has been governed by Labour for the last thirteen years, experiments in State enterprises have been made involving the expenditure of millions of pounds without a single success. have put Labour back into power in Queensland time after time. ber knows perfectly well why the Labour party in Queensland has been returned to It power time after time. Loan money has been deliberately held back pending an election for the purpose of swamping electorates likely to be dangerous to the Government, and the boundaries of other electorates have been so fixed that it is almost impossible for Labour candidates to be defeated. Although Queensland has been governed by Labour for thirteen years, unemployment has steadily increased until last year Â£400,000 was spent in payments to unemployed persons. If that can come about in Labour-governed Queensland with all its wealth, surely it They is a lesson to the people of Australia that it is quite impracticable to make a success of nationalization. Unable to induce the leaders of the militant unions to meet the employers and discuss their troubles with them and thus assist iu the peaceful development of in which dustry, the Government found that other ""We are all familiar action was necessary. But first of all it stands definitely for peace in industry. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) scoffed at the past efforts of the Prime Minister, but no fair-minded person would be convinced that the right honourable gentleman has not been strictly honourable in every attemot he has made to bring about industrial peace in Australia. As a matter of fact the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) paid him Yet socialism is as the compliment of saying that at one period he believed he was honest-a n admission, though slight, that there is some merit in the work done by the Government.

183,Mr Mackay,"The honourable memand the best conditions that industry in Australia can provide. A man must be wilfully blind who pretends that things are all right in this country. It is impossible to consider the unemployment that exists without seeking the cause. Honourable members opposite may try to dazzle their supporters outside by oratorial fireworks in this chamber, but the people who are unable to yet work will eventually want to know the reason why; they will find it in the excessive interference with industry, which disheartens people who could invest money and provide work. It is time that honourable members realized this fact and took the proper course. The Prime Minister had no desire to introduce the Crimes Act, the amending Arbitration Act or the Transport Workers Acti f he could have avoided doing so; he stated definitely on the floor of the House and during the elections that he was prepared to consider any alternative that might be suggested. What suggestion emanated from honourable members opposite? Nothing but abuse of the Government, particularly the Prime Minister, and the judges of the Arbitration Court. Talk of revenge and the enunciation of vicious principles will not help us. During the election campaign and in the course of this debate the Prime Minister was accused of attempting to smash the trade unions. That is a ridiculous and unfounded misrepresentation of an honourable man. Many times the right honourable gentleman has attempted to bring about a. better understanding between labour and capital, and when this false charge was levelled against him at a meeting in Queensland, he saidI am not trying to destroy the trade unions of this country. WhatI am trying to do is to protect them. I am convinced that unions are part of our social system, and are essential to the welfare of this Commonwealth. Unionism must stay, but it has to be a trades unionism controlled by the workers themselves, and not by a few extremists. The secret ballot, in my opinion, is the charter of liberty for every decent working man, for it protects him from the extremist minority which is seeking to ruin both him and this country. ballot now? in Queensland on at least one occasion, and I believe that when the arbitration legislation introduced by this Government is studied intelligently by the workers they will discard those bogus representatives who pretend that the Government has not been sincere and honest in its attempts to improve the industrial situation. WhatI have said about trade unionism is the opinion of every honourable member on this side of the House. We are willing to help the unions within reason, but we have also a responsibility to the general community. No longer can we tolerate union leaders who, pretending to speak on behalf of the workers, call men out on strike on little or no pretence, hold up industrial development and transport by land and sea, defy the laws of the land, and act to the detriment of the public interest. The actions of the waterside workers particularly have made this proposed legislation absolutely necessary. There have been so many strikes for whicli there was no justification that no self-respecting government could sit idly by and allow lawlessness and chaos to continue. If the legislation now before us has the effect of securing a period of uninterrupted peace on the waterfront its introduction will have been fully justified. At any rate, it cannot be said that the Government has not exercised the greatest possible patience and sincerely endeavoured to do what Ministers believe to be in the best interests of the people of Australia. Taking a leaf from the book of the new honourable member for Barton( Mr Tully) I propose to address myself fairly closely to the bill. I do not intend as a result of listening to the breezy and useful address of the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) to make any reflection upon the judges; in a mixed community one never knows when and from whom he may not have to ask a favour. This bill arises out of a measure which was passed in this chamber on the motion of the Prime Minister in the closing hours of the last Parliament, and was subjected rightly to severe and searching criticism and condemnation by honthe secret orable members on this side of the chamber. Amongst our objections to the bill on that occasion was one that it sought to. invest the Government",51,Transport Workers Bill

That criticism remains sound and unanswered. The conduct of the Government in arrogating to itself power-to legislate when Parliament was not sitting was a disastrous throwback to the monarchical tyranny which was common enough centuries ago, but has happily fallen into desuetude. It was no excuse for the Government that it was gambling on the possibility of its irregular legislation being ratified by the people and possibly by a new Parliament. The Prime Minister laid great stress upon the fact that he benches, from which not many months had promised the people that he would ratify by a bill the regulations made by the executive under the Transport Workers Act. In other words, the right nonorable gentleman claimed to have received a mandate from the electors to introduce this legislation. We of the Opposition question that claim, and the position of the ministerialists was stated succinctly by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Hurry), who does not often offend by interjection or otherwise, in the phrase, "" But we are here! "" Presumably, he meant by that remark that the Government has a. majority and is able by force of numbers to pass this legislation. Some of its supporters in the last Parliament are still here and some of them are not. The honourable member for Darling referred to the Government's Pyrrhic victory. PerhapsI may remind honourable members in greater detail of the victory won by King Pyrrhus nearly 300 years before the Christian era, in order to give them a corof the House, but not by nominees of the rect orientation towards the rising tide of labour. The"" ambitious and highly successful King of Epirus casting covetous glances towards Rome, at last led an army across the frontier and engaged the Romans on their own soil. After an heroic conflict Pyrrhus was victorious, but looking about him at the mass of his fallen men and noting the dejection of his reduced and dispirited generals he said, when congratulations reached him, "" Such another victory and I must return alone to Epirus."" the honourable member, besides being disorderly, reminds me of the fact that he boasted last week of having been re-elected unopposed. If he accepts that good fortune as a confirmation of the principles of the Transport Workers Act, I do not read it in that way; rather do I interpret it as meaning that very serious subjects were being discussed in the country before the last election and not surprisingly the honourable member for Warringah was momentarily overlooked. The Prime Minister claims to have received a mandate, but when he looks upon the vacant spaces on the Ministerial ago came the radiating smiles of Ms chivalrous supporters who are politically no more; when he reflects that up to November last he controlled a party which in turn controlled this House, whereas to-day he lives politically by the reluctant votes of those who suffer him sadly, well might he say in words similar to those of Pyrrhus, "" Such another victory and I must return alone to Elinders-lane."" There were two significant features about the last election: One was the striking and growing confidence manifested in Labour and its aspirations, and the second was the lack of confidence manifested in this Government and the Nationalist party. The two things do not necessarily go together because even when the right honourable gentleman has noted the vacant spaces about him and the increase of members on this side the whole story is still not told. Other places have been filled on that side Government. What are the Prime Minister's thoughts when he turns his eyes towards Franklin, which not so long ago was represented by a most enthusiastic supporter of all the anti-Labour industrial proposals of the Government, but is now represented by a gentleman who recently crossed the floor to vote with those who sit on this side, obeying the dictates of his conscience rather than those of his party?

It has beeu hard, unskilled labour, but I have made my bread out. of it by the sweat of my brow. As a member of an industrial organization I made my bargain with my employer. The one thing upon which I can congratulate myself is that, as an independent worker and a son of Australia. I have given honest toil for the remuneration that I have received. To me it is a humiliation which I cannot endure, that at this time of my life I should bo asked to line up before a man who is not my employer, who is a governhe started the wheels of industry revolvment official and an understrapper, side by side with cut-throats of either bad reputation or no reputation, in order to obtain for myself a licence to do the work man has brought forward again and inI have done all my life."" Such an objection is worthy of respect. The act which was passed last year immensely aggravated the ""trouble and led to its continuance. Tbe Prime Minister spoke about the war being carried into the homes of the wives and children of the volunteers. He appeared to a have a superabundance of sympathy for them. I am not without sympathy, though I do not address myself to the question in the manner chosen by the Prime Minister. But they were not the only persons into whose homes the war was carried. At the time'that the election was being fought and the Prime Minister was touring Victoria, hundreds, probably thousands, of women and children were reduced to the verge of starvation. They were perfectly innocent participants in this war; they were involved in it, and suffered by it, because of the passage of that act and the licences which were required to bo issued under it. While this claim that the Prime Minister settled the strike and qualification to do a particular service. turned the wheels of industry again might be justified on the ground of the dire political necessity which immediately preceded the election, it can hardly be justified now. It might have been justified at those hectic meetings at which the Prime Minister held his audience enthralled save for an occasional pointed interruption by the wives of dispossessed wharf labourers. It might have been in place at those meetings which the Prime Minister addressed during the course of his semi-royal tour through tbe country-meeting s that, were sometimes attended by five school children, the local policeman, six pressmen, and a dog, at which he received unanimous endorsement from everybody except the dog. But at this time, after the election is over and the good ship of Nationalism has been brought back into port, with leaky ribs ancl a mutinous crew it is true, but still, brought back into port, I suggest that as an antecedent to embarking upon a new voyage, he might procure some new kind of putty other than the story of how ing. However, with that lack of humour for whicli I suppose he should be excused the right honourable gentlesisted upon this grotesque contention that ou the one hand he received a mandate to introduce this legislation and ou the other that the legislation has been justified by its results in the past.

We shall allow him to rest. But I desire to take seriously the speeches of these gentlemen upon this bill. There was no evidence in any one of them that they had read a single line of the measure. They said that it was desirable and, indeed necessary, that men should obey the law. I agree with that. They said that the laws that were passed by the Parliament of which we are members should be respected. Up to a point I agree with that, but I do not go so far as to say that it means that demning and criticizing those laws in the discharge of our public duties. These honourable gentlemen told us that it was particularly our duty, as the representatives of the people, to respect an award made by the Arbitration Court. The Labour party accepts arbitration as part of its policy. Its criticism of the awards of the court runs along the line of condemnation of the Government's policy and not of the system or principle of arbitration. Let me say to these honourable gentlemen, who invite us to show respect for the awards of the Arbitration Court, that we championed the cause of arbitration, not with their assistance, but in spite of them and in spite of those who preceded them. We stood for arbitration iu other days as the direct political successors of the men who saw that mere organization was not sufficient-that mere trade-unionism was not enough unless it could be translated into effect through political I also listened to a speech action and machinery created by political have respect for the principles upon which we have founded our policy in the pa3t, and upon which we outline it at the present moment.

198,"Mr Breistnan""","I was speaking cer, whose position will be created by theof all, that the cancellation of a licence to work cuts away from a man for six months the right to live. It may be said that he would still be free to engage himself elsewhere than on the waterfront. Every man, of course, is free to the extent that he may choose, within limits, where he will work, and what work he will do. But every sane and reasonable man knows that a worker Avho is flung out of employment in his usual avocation finds it hard, if not impossible to place himself in employment elseAvhere. Indeedi t is hard enough, heaven knows, for a man to find work these days in his ordinary avocation under the conditions induced by this Government. A man may have his licence cancelled if he refuses or fails to comply with any lawful order or direction given him in relation to his employment by bis employers. I point out that a laAvful order is one which does not violate either the civil or criminal laAV. Any laAvful order must be obeyed, it matters not how Onerous, cruel, unreasonable or humiliating it may be. If a man refuses to carry Out a lawful order he is liable to be cut off for at least six months from the right to work on the Avaterfront. It may be said that if a bitter and cruel order is given, the worker has the right to appeal against it. If that is not grim irony in' this bill, I do not know what is. After he has been struck off the list of Avorkers he has the right to engage counsel to appeal against the decision of the licensing officer! The Prime Minister says he will get a decision Avithin 24 hours, but, in the Avords of Dr. Johnson, "" That is ignorance, pure ignorance."" He must apply Avithin 24 hours, but whether he will obtain a decision is another matter. Eveni f he succeeds in getting his appeal heard, it is not too much to think that at least, on general lines, the court will administer the laAV from the bench along the lines intended by the legislature, seeing that that is a sound principle upon which courts move. Then, again, supposing if a worker on wharf, in a manly but unlawful way, the Avharf ""having offered for work or settle their differences by means of a fight engaged to work at the port in respect of or some kind of assault, the laAV of the Avhich he Avas licensed, has refused to State is available to deal with such a work in accordance with the terms of a case.

There are already Mr Brennan. months it Avill not be possible for him to be re-engaged. Nobody would dare engage him. Not only Avould the Avorker himself be subject to a heavy penalty for daring to work;, but anybody engaging him would be liable to a fine of Â£100 or imprisonment for six months. Already, under the Arbitration Act, too severe and drastic penalties have been provided to deal Avith breaches of awards, and, with the making of strikes and lock-outs. The Arbitration Court already deals with these matters, and imposes punishments so seA'ere that they have vitiated the Arbitration Court. One Avould imagine that the Government would be satisfied with this, without imposing further and even more drastic penalties upon the man on the Avharf for the same offence. Why duplicate the penalties and punishments? Is it not enough to punish him drastically under one act without piling up penalties under another act for the same class of offence? I urge these pleasant-spoken gentlemen opposite to read this bill before it goes into committee, and to ask themselves not Avhether they believe in strikes or lock-outs, not Avhether they believe in essential services being carried on, or aAvards respected, for these matters are not in dispute, but Avhether they believe in piling up against a certain class of.

Again, take the case of a Avorke' 1who has been convicted of "" an offence against any other Commonwealth laAV or against any State law committed upon a Avharf, pier, jetty, hulk, barge or ship."" If he has committed an offence against any State laAv, so long as it occurred about the Avaterfront, he, too, is subject to these additional penalties, but why should he be subject to penalties greater than those applicable to any other member of the community . offending in the same way? Supposing two men on the ample ways of dealing with breaches of the law of this kind, but they are nor enough for the Government. The petty despot, whoso business it will be to issue licences, may recall the licence, and, in addition to all the other penalties, the worker may be deprived of the right to live. Do the honourable aud amiable gentlemen opposite believe in that kind of treatment? credible ""that they could have understood the bill when they promised to give it their support. I suggest that it is not yet base purposes of this bill, which is one of too late for them to read the measure. In committee they will have opportunities to read and perhaps at least amend it. I am not inclined to move amendments, because I think that the bill is vicious ab initio, or, to employ an appropriate metaphor, it is vicious from stent to stern. The honourable membei' for Forrest( Mr Prowse) said that at all costs the essential services of the community should be carried on. I challenge that statement. There are some costs that would, be too great. There are more important considerations even than shipping the produce of the farmer and moving passengers from State to State. There arc more important things than commerce-importan t as that is-and they have taken longer to build up than commerce has. I refer to the principles of the administration of elementary justice. In the Law Courts are inscribed the wordsI think I have Seen them in almost every law court, although at times they may seem ironical enough"" Let justice be done, though the heavens should fall."" Let justice be done though the heavens may fall, and essential sendees, so called, may remain Undone till wrong is redressed. I ask honourable members opposite to examine their conscience and this bill, and consider whether they feel justified in supporting all its clauses, to some of which I have ealled attention. At a time when we are invited to take concerted action in order to bring about peace in industry-the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) made reference to this invitation-the Government is is endeavouring to put on the statute-book this iniquitous measure, which penalizes so unfairly branch, of industry. It debases labour, it incites to retaliation and violence, it humiliates and degrades honest men by equalizing them with men of low or no character, and it places on them a stigma of servitude. The bill is certainly industrial conscription and martial law in industry. I do not recommend violent opposition to the law, but, short of that, To me it seems hardly I cordially invite the workers of this country to exert every means, by loyally organizing one with another, to defeat the the most tyrannical and ill-considered measures that it has ever been my lot to speak upon since I have been a member of this Parliament. [9.50] -The regulations under the Transport, Workers Act, which was passed during the closing hours of the last Parliament, conferred on the Executive Council the necessary powers to meet the existing conditions during the time between the expiration of the last Parliament and the election of the new one. This bill is in no way designed to interfere with the proper functions of trade unionism, but is merely intended as a safeguard to the general public. T do not propose to discuss the merits or demerits of compulsory arbitration; but so long as there is such an institution as the Arbitration Court in which the trade unions have the right to have their claims considered, in which evidence is taken and judgments given and awards varied from time to time, then both parties must be prepared to abide by the decision of the court. If any union or group of unions, having appealed to the court, dissent from the decisions of the court, anddecide to hold up the essential services of the country, then it behoves the Government, which represents every section of the community, to take the necessary action to ensure the maintenance of those services. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) told us that this measure is not acceptable to the people of Australia. I do not claim to know very much about the conditions under which the last election was fought in States other than New South Wales, but as the honourable member particularly referred to that State, I sliould like to the workers in one remind him of a few facts of which I",56,Transport Workers Bill
199,Mr Graham Pratten (Martin),"know lie is aware. member, director for that State, adopted the tactics of dragging the political fight out milking such matters as the basic wage u very big issue. A great appeal was made to the electors in my constituency by the statement that a vote for me Avould mean a reduction of wages. The honourable member for Dalley also realizes that tlie present Government in New South ""Wales has. a heavy task iu cleaning up the affairs of that State after three years of Labour misrule, waste and extravagance, and, in order to square the ledger, it has had to impose extra taxation, which nobody likes. The honourable member did not hesitate to make that extra taxation an election cry. Many other vote-catching schemes were launched by him and his party, and impossible promises were made with, I will admit, some success. I maintain, therefore, that the loss of Government support in New South ""Wales had nothing whatever to do with the passing of the Transport Workers Act, but was entirely due to the misleading statements of the party opposite. The honourable member for Dalley referred to the reduced Ministerial majority in Parramatta and Martin. I would remind him that, in spite of the fact that many thousands of .electors have been transferred there from his own electorate, the vote polled by me in Martin was Avithin 500 of that obtained in 1925 by the late Honourable H. E. Pratten, and 2,000 more than I received at the by-election in June Let us suppose that the honourable member is right, and that the Government did lose support owing to the passing of this act. deference to the honourable member for Batman, Avho spent ten minutes just UOAV trying to explain that supporters of the Government are not here, that Ave are here. Our presence on this side of the chamber should be evidence that the people of Australia endorsed the legislation passed by this Government in the dying hours of the last Parliament. I entirely agree Avith the statement of the Attorney-General that the attitude of the honourable member for Dalley when he came back to this House was that of a Prime Minister returning Mr Graham Pratten. The honourable to Parliament after having Avon nn as the Labour campaign election, instead of a member of the party which had lost an election. It is incomprehensible that honourable members of the Eederal arena and opposite should continue their obstructive tactics towards this bill, in vieAV of the fact that the Government has just been returned with its policy endorsed by the people. The Leader of the Opposition declared that the act antagonized the Avorkers-that it incited them to revolt and hold the laAV in contempt. Honourable members oppoosite knoAv very Avell that it Avas not the Transport Workers Act that antagonized the Avorkers or incited them to revolt or hold the laAV of this country ""in contempt, but as the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr G. Erancis) ably remarked the other day, their "" misleaders."" We all agree that, the Avorkers of this country are a fine type of men, and are not responsible for the tactics of their so-called leaders, AVIIO drag them so often into strikes and industrial disputes. It is not right that a small section of the community should be alloAved to dislocate industry and hold the people of Australia to ransom simply because they do not approve of the findings of the Arbitration Court. What would be our position if Ave allowed this state of affairs to continue? Exactly Avhat the Opposition Avould have done to meet the situation under the circumstances Avould be interesting to knoAv. The right honourable the Prime Minister stated only on Thursday last that the GoA-ernment would be pleased to consider any suggestions for an improvement last. on its proposals to ensure peace in industry, but Ave have not yet had any constructive criticism AA'hatsoever from the Opposition. Honourable members. I Avould remind him, Avith all opposite, instead of considering the AYCIfare of the people as a whole, appear disposed to support the action of a small section of the community in evading the laAV. There has been a great deal of discussion on this issue. I regret very much incontrovertible that the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) should be so bankrupt in argument as to consider it necessary to cast slurs upon our judges. Nearly all honourable members will agree that, if there is one thing upon Avhich Ave in Australia pride ourselves, it is that the members of our judiciary, at least, are beyond reproach. The Government having been called upon to deal with an industrial situation last year, deemed it necessary to bring in emergency legislation. It now proposes to embody in the bill the regulations made under the Transport Workers Act, which has been endorsed by the people. Speaking as a representative of the primary producers, I am impressed by the extent to which industrial problems engaged the attention of the last Parliament and affected legislation passed. by it. We have had an animated debate to-day upon this measure between representatives of organized labour and honourable members representing the employing interests. The industrial issue has been in the forefront for some considerable time. During the last two election campaigns it was the most prominent question before the people. Consequently, many t important national problems which, m other circumstances, would receive considcration in Parliament, have been more or less obscured. Industrial probloins having been made a battle cry at 'the last election, the issue is being fought again upon the floor of this House, The last Parliament passed a number of industrial measures, including the Crimes Act, and' the Transport Workers Act, under which regulations were made to deal with organized labour and organized capital. In the last Parliament these issues overshadowed many other questions. The manner in which such legislation affected the primary producers' interests has not yet been effectively stated. Although some primary industries are not directly involved, all of them are more or less affected by industrial legislation. Indeed, it is not a mis-statement to say that, generally, the primary producers have to ""pay the piper "". In some instances, awards of the Arbitration Court directly affect their industry, and very often they are the innocent victims of industrial disturbances-strikes , lockouts and other developments arising out of a dislocation of industry. victims of increased taxation. member for Riverina has said, legislation of the kind referred to concerns them in that way too. Let me cite one or two instances to indicate how directly Arbitration Court legislation may concern our primary producers. I refer honourable members to the position of the dried fruits industry. I am well aware, Mr Speaker, that, in this 'debate, you will not p e r r n it m e to disouss the ramifications of that industry. I do not propose to do so The dried fruits industry is worki TJ g directly under Arbitration Court a w a v < j . jjot only the harvesting and the s p a c k i g f the crop, but all the operan 0 t j; o n so n t n e u fc0( } as ploughing and prll n in g , and the labour of those engaged j jj n t e sec0 n d a r y industries in the packi n g s t e d a are governed by industrial legisi in . The unfortunate grower has to a t 0 meet fixed costs in every direction, whereas n is r e t u n is a r e based on what he can re ceive for his produce in the markets of he w o r l d . The r e s u l t j th t s a t l i e industry is i u a i l a i m o s t desperate position. The growers have petitioned the Government for assistance in the form of bounties, q ; Government has replied by appointae in g a Development and Migration Commission to inquire into conditions in the iudustrv, and introducing certain legislat i o n dealing with the marketing of the c r o p . Those actions indicate the Governm ent's recognition of the necessity t 0 n e i p t i x e fruits growers i u t he diflicult position in which t h. y e a r e p l d by reason of other legisa c e i i . The canned fruits industry is in a to n m u c u t he same position; the conditions of employment both on the blocks and in the canneries are governed by arbitration c o u r t awards. In the Melbourne Age0 f r e c e r it date, au account is given of a v i i by the Premier of Victoria, Sirs t William McPherson, to the canned fruit a r e as l t week. Mr W. Jukes, the presia 3 dent of the local branch of the Returned Soldiers' Association, read a letter addressed to the Premier in which the position of the settlers in the Kyabram dist rict was set out. As the report is SO mewhat lengthy, I shall quote only a portion of it are also the If the Government cannot settle the matter satisfactorily, we ask that soldier settlers be compensated to get out of the industry, which is undoubtedly suffering acutely from overproduction. We are only claiming what we have earned-ou r right to live. Failing the",58,Transport Workers Bill

The present insecurity of the position of soldier-settler fruit-growers is mentally affecting a large number of the men and their wives and families. No genuine attempt at a solution has beeu made to overcome tlie several problems which have arisen in connection with soldier settlement. I. quote tliat as typical of the conditions in the industry in Victoria, South Australia and New South ""Wales. Almost similar conditions obtain in nearly every othor primary industry.

209,Mr Gbegoby,"I s there?if 10,000 sailors or otlier organized workers had given notice to their employers that they intended to stop -work we should have had the Bight Honourable the Prime Minister expressing regret at that action, and hoping that the men would re-consider their contemplated holding up of industry, at the same time dropping a -very astute hint that if they failed to do so it would be tbe duty of the Government to keep the wheels of industry going. I reiterate, however, that I agree that it is the right of this or any other Government to protect the interests of the body politic. This hill has been regarded with suspicion by honourable members of the Opposition, and I believe that it will be so regarded by the great bulk of the workers of Australia. I admit frankly that that is not so much because of what the bill appears to contain, but because it is inintroduced by a Government that introduced the Crimes Act and other unfortunate measures and which, at two successive elections, obtruded and made the only battle cry upon which it was returned to office the very contentious subject of industrial strife. The measure is a very simple one; its main object is to licence workers on the waterfront. ""Without such a licence wharf labourers will not be able to obtain employment. The Government claims that that is the best way to ensure peace on the waterfront. It goes farther, and asks honourable members of the Opposition to suggest a better method, if they can. I admit, in fairness to the Government, that honourable members of the Opposition have not accepted that invitation. make any suggestions. would very much strengthen the case of the Opposition to do so. I listened attentively to the speech of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), in which he compared the granting of these licences to the issuing of a diploma to a doctor or a certificate to a plumber. I am sure that no honourable member accepted that comparison seriously. Obviously, there is a vast difference between the granting of a diploma to a doctor of medicine and the granting of a licence to a wharf labourer. There is an examination in competency before the diploma is awarded-the honourable gentleman who is a shining light in the medical profession, passed such an examination, but no examination is to be held before the proposed licences are granted to wharf labourers. It is immaterial, apparently,-whether a person knows what a sling is. The question is merely ""Do you want work?"" Nothing is asked as to character, past experience, or as to how long an individual intends to make .the work his means of livelihood. questions before accepting members? the moment, with the comparison made by the Treasurer, which, in my opinion, is a ridiculous one. Apparently the examination comes after and not before the licence is granted. The bill prescribes certain offences and penalties. It is prescribed that a licence may be suspended for six months. Why six months? period. period. Why should it not. be three months? To an impartially-minded person that penalty savours very much of undue severity, and makes one wonder what is the motive behind it. As I recognize the necessity to use restraining action against any section of the community that unfairly ' infringes the rights of others, I shall vote for the measure, but I hope that the Government will exhibit the same readiness to curb the activities of those unrest amongst wharf and other labourers. adjourned. warrant nominating Mr George Hugh Mackay to act as Temporary Chairman of Committees when requested so to do by the Chairman of Committees.
