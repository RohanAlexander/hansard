the House of Representatives assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned, all being of or above the age of 18 years as follows: 1. Your Petitioners oppose and seek the deletion of those provisions of the Family Law Bill 1974 which supplant the existing grounds by the introduction of the sole ground of irretrievable break-down, which remove any consideration of fault, and which will weaken the family unit while causing more widespread injustice because: (a) it imposes on society a radical alteration of divorce law far beyond identifiable requirements or desires; (b) it lowers the status of marriage by permitting people to 'drift' into divorce, reduces parental importance and leads to increasing institutionalisation of children with consequential delinquency; (c) it will not reduce the 'in-fighting' in a divorce suit which mainly occurs over matters of property and custody; (d) it will not encourage maturity in acceptance of marital and parental obligations and responsibilities. 2. Your Petitioners commend the divorce legislation introduced in Great Britain in 1973, which acknowledges the importance of the family unit, mirrors community requirements, secures justice for innocent people and establishes a realistic definition of irretrievable background, and call for similar legislation to be provided in Australia. Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will make provision accordingly. by Mr Hayden, Mr Bonnett, Mr Kevin Cairns, That a husband should normally be responsible for mainMr Donald Cameron, Mr Drury, Mr Hodges, taining his wife and children within marriage.

Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House our humble Petition respectfully showeth: (a) That the present matrimonial laws are archaic, unrealistic and cruel and the cause of so much distress, bitterness and injustice as to make their continued operation intolerable to the vast majority of fair minded citizens of Australia and that the Family Law Bill at present before Parliament should be passed without delay. (b) That the ground of Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage determined by a maximum of twelve months' separation, embodied in the Family Law Bill already passed in the Senate, be the sole ground for divorce. (c) That there is widespread dissatisfaction with the enormous discretionary powers given Judges in the present legislation and that the non fault maintenance concept (according to need) based on specific criteria, as enunciated in Clause 54 (2) of the Family Law Bill 1974 No. 2, should be tried and we humbly pray Members of the House will restore this concept fully by deleting Clause 75 (n) from the new Bill ""as read a third time"".

Your Petitioners oppose and seek the deletion of those a far reaching change in the nature of our society. provisions of the Family.Law Bill 1974 which supplant the existing grounds by the introduction of the sole ground of irenvironment in which to grow up. This stability is upset by retrievable break-down, which remove any consideration of divorce. A high proportion of criminals come from broken fault, and which will weaken the family unit while causing homes. Consequently any law which makes divorce easier is more widespread injustice because: (a) it imposes on society a radical alteration of divorce law far beyond identifiable requirements or desires; (b) it lowers the status of marriage by permitting people to 'drift' into divorce, reduces parental importance and leads to And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. increasing institutionalisation of cluldren with consequential by Mr Lynch, Mr Gorton, Mrs Child, Mr Erwin, delinquency; (c) it will not reduce the 'in-fighting' in a divorce suit which mainly occurs over matters of property and custody; (d) it will not encourage maturity in acceptance of marital and parental obligations and responsibilities. 2.

Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That the 'Family Law Bill 1974' fails to give the family the protection guaranteed it under the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, for rather than promoting the stability of the family unit, the Bill deals solely with its destruction through divorce and the legalizing of the evasion of responsibiUty. 2. That the Bill legalizes the breaking of a signed and witnessed agreement to remain faithful for life; and at least one clause unjustly favours the wealthy partner in the granting or withholding of a decree absolute. 3. That in cases where legal 'separation' is interrupted by cohabitation, both parties have thus evidenced their change of heart, and yet the BiU still counts the period of'irretrievable breakdown' as from the date of thefirstdeclaration of 'separation' regardless of the attempt at reconciliation in the interval. 4. That in the dissolution process, the Bill refuses to recognize guilt, yet it ignores this 'no-fault' clause when making a wife prove fault against her husband in order to obtain custody of her children. 5. That after the dissolution of a marriage, the wife may be forced to work to support herself and her children, and in some cases her ex-husband, as well as being liable for legal costs. 6. That under this Bill the loose term 'irretrievable breakdown' could be used as an excuse for a divorce of convenience or for financial gain in various ways, including increased pensions. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in ParUament assembled will do everything possible to promote and preserve the permanency of the married state, and not admit into the law of this land any S revision for such easy divorce that will jeopardize family fe-for although the present divorce system has weaknesses, it cannot berightedby an even weaker and more unjust 'Family Law Bill'. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Kevin Cairns. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of AustraUa respectfully showeth: That the purpose of legislation should be to serve the common good. It is true that legislation that is intended to promote the common good may be frustrating and even harmful to some individuals. In the Family Law Bill however, the process seems to be in reverse. In this Bill the law is intended to help some individuals, but it undermines the common good of society by not giving adequate protection to the family, which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House wUl reject the Family Law Bill. by Mr Erwin. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in ParUament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That there is great urgency to preserve the family as the basic unit in society and therefore the stabUity of family life requires the urgent attention of ParUament. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that: (1) The present grounds for divorce should not be changed. (2) The present requirement of seven days waiting period after notification of intention to marry should be extended to thirty days to provide adequate counselling and education. (3) Marriage counselling services to further the cause of reconciUation should be more readily available. (4) Continued social research into the causes of marital instabiUty should be fostered by the Parliament. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hunt. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parhament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we are opposed to the Family Law Bill for the following reasons: (a) It wUl result in many more divorces and broken families; (b) It rejects the traditional Christian idea of marriage as a permanent union, in favour of marriage being a temporary union; (c) The provisions regarding maintenance and custody of children are no longer based on responsibihty and the duty to care, but on 'need' and 'ability', and (d) Such drastic and dramatic changes should not be made without the widest possible community debate. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will reject the Family Law Bill in its entirety. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Nixon. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parhament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we object to the FamUy Law Bill for the following reasons: (a) It will lead to the ruination of family life; (b) It offers no protection for the wife or the cluldren, and (c) It will affect the whole of civilization. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House' will not pass into law the Family Law Bill. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Nixon. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we strongly support the Family Law Bill, 1974, which has been passed in the Senate. We believe that its immediate passage through the House of Representatives and subsequent proclamation by the Governor General are essential to the relief of the sufferings of many married couples and their families throughout AustraUa. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the House will proceed with the Family Law BUI. by Mr Berinson. Petition received. Family Law Bill To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of AustraUa in ParUament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: That we support the concept of no fault divorce in the Family Law Bill because: 1. Marriage is not merely a contract it is a relationship. 2. That if a party withdraws from that relationship for whatever reason there is no good to be achieved by insisting on a continuance of a contractual shell. 3. That where a marriage relationship has demonstrably broken down divorce should be as quick and simple as possible. The interests of the dignity of the parties and the emotional well being of the cluldren. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Family Law BUI be debated and passed as soon as possible. And your petitioners as in duty bound wUl ever pray, by Mrs Child. Petition received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of AustraUa respectfully showeth: That whereas uranium found in vast quantities in AustraUa is the raw material for the nuclear fission reaction, And whereas presently assured reserves of uranium in AustraUa represent a potential production of over 340,000 kilograms of Plutonium 239 if utilized in Light Water Reactors overseas, And whereas the Maximum Permissible Inhalation of Plutonium 239 is 0.00000025 gram, And whereas Plutonium 239 is one of the most dangerous substances human society has ever created, causing mutations and cancers, And whereas there are no methods of safely and absolutely confining Plutonium from the biosphere for the requisite quarter of a mUlion years, And whereas Plutonium coming in contact with the air forms an aerosol cloud of micron-sized particles, its most dangerous form, And whereas the expon of uranium may return to us an import of Plutonium particles dispersed in the global environment via the circulation of the atmosphere, And whereas there are no sure safeguards against the military use of nuclear fission, and the nuclear proliferation represents a prime environment threat to all forms of life on the only earth avaUable to us, And that it is therefore an act of self-preservation to demand a halt to all exports of uramum except for bio-medical uses, Your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: 1. That funher mining and export of uranium from AustraUa except for bio-medical purposes be banned, 2. That the AustraUan Atomic Energy Commission be transformed by the rewriting of its charter into an AustraUan Energy Commission to further the understanding of energy flows through our society and to promote national economic independence and self-sufficiency. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Petition received. Petroleum Products: Taxes and Excise of Representatives in ParUament assembled: The Humble showeth: 1. That the need for the Government of New South Wales 2. That the Premier of New South Wales has given a solemn undertaking that his Government will withdraw its harsh Petrol Tax immediately he can be assured of an equivalent additional revenue from Commonwealth Funds raised from New South Wales residents. 3. That such additional revenue can be provided by the Australian Government if it returns to the New South Wales Government all moneys raised by way of taxes and excise on petroleum products consumed in New South Wales. 4. That the New South Wales Government has available to it sufficient skilled personnel and equipment to undertake a continuing intensive programme of highway construction but is unable to fully use these resources through a lack of adequate funds. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the AustraUan Government will forthwith do all things necessary to return to the States of the Commonwealth all moneys raised by way of taxes and excise on petroleum products. And your petitioners as in duty bound wUl ever pray, by Mr Cadman. Petition received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in ParUament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free donated, particularly to the opponents of the at all and will cost many citizens more, particularly single people and working wives. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalisin front of me an article from the 'Australian' of ation of health services which will lead to impersonaUsed and mediocre standards of medical care, the creation of a huge new bureaucracy, and will limit the citizen's freedom of choice.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Killen. Petition received. the Minister for Urban and Regional Developdidate for Macarthur is planning to spend ment.

I have 12 February 1975 which states that $400,000 has been donated to the Liberal Party campaign funds. Part of the article states The Liberal Party wUl run an extensive radio and television advertising campaign to improve its public image, aiming at a $400,000 outlay. The Liberal Party National Campaign Committee is planning the move, which is designed as a mid-term effort to boost its standing. That indicates that $400,000 is coming from anonymous sources. The public does not know who is putting the money in, whether the money is coming from sources at home or abroad or just what sinister influence it enables the people who give these funds to have over the Liberal and Country Parties.

6,Mr Daly,"It is true that the Government hasSo this candidate is saying that the campaign will cost $40,000, which is what the Liberal candidate in the last Federal election spent in an endeavour to defeat the sitting member-and he wasted his money. The article goes on to say that the money will be raised from donations and free advertising space. In addition to that, $14,500 will be spent on Press, radio and television and $3,000 will be spent on the publication of an election newspaper. Here is a Liberal candidate who has funds coming to him and nobody knows the source of those funds. He is telling the public aware of what the industry is asking the Governthat although he is allowed to spend only $500, he will spend $40,000. This Government will not stand for Watergates in Australia. Huge amounts of money are being put into the funds of honourable members opposite in an endeavour to mislead the people into putting them into Government again. Within a few days in this Parliament those who are collecting these funds can stand up and say whether they are prepared to tell us where their ill-gotten gains come from or whether they wish to keep hidden their sinister controllers and the faceless men who provide their funds. I thank the honourable member for the question. The public should know that funds are being poured into the finances of the honourable members opposite from sources that are opposed to Australia's best interests and that even Liberal candidates are prepared to spend $40,000 to try to defeat Labor candidates and to defy the law because those behind them want government at any price. BEEF INDUSTRY to the Minister for Northern Development in his capacity of representing the Minister for Agriculthe coffers of the Bass Strait and Barrow Island ture. As a brief preamble I point out that although 2 questions concerning the beef industry were asked yesterday of the Minister for Northern Development, I regard the crisis in the industry today to be of such a magnitude that I would expect the Minister and his colleagues to the present weighted price of Arab Middle East have made important decisions within the last 24 crude the tax take of some 7 to 8 US. dollars per hours. I hope that some member of the House barrel for crude oil and to compare the true cost will ask the Minister every day the Parliament is of crude with the price that is being received by sitting a question on the industry until we receive the respective producers. As a matter of fact, the a more definite answer than that the Governprofit on Bass Strait oil is about $1 a barrel. ment is keeping a close watch on the situation. Another factor which is universally disregarded, My question is: As short term liquidity is the particularly by the advocates of this consortium, major difficulty facing the beef industry, is the is the production and export of about 1 A million Government considering assistance other than tons a year of liquid petroleum gas at a current the completely inadequate $20m at an interest price of a $A80 a ton. That would add another rate of 11 Vi per cent which is now offered? well knows that a large number of reasons are responsible for the deteriorating economic conditions in the cattle industry in Australia. It is a world-wide problem. As far as liquidity is concerned, the Government acted after a request from the Australian Cattlemen's Council to provide finance at commercial rates of interest. As a matter of fact this question will be discussed shortly as a matter of public importance. Apparently the honourable member is completely unment to do. It is not asking for further finance at present. In fact it is asking now for a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission. Minister for Minerals and Energy. Has the Minister examined the cost of the recent suggestions that the wellhead price of crude oil should be increased by 40 per cent? Can he give a comparison of the price for crude oil received by producers in Australia, the Middle East and elsewhere? honourable member for Evans is particularly felicitous in view of the last question answered by my colleague the Minister for Services and Property. The interest of the Leader of the Australian Country Party in this perennial question of crude oil pricing waxes and wanes according to the financial fortunes of his party. I would not be so uncharitable as to suggest that due appreciation would not be shown to party funds for an appropriate increase. His particular suggestion of a 40 per cent increase in the wellhead production costs of crude oil in Australia would amount to 88c or 89c a barrela little matter of a golden handshake of about $140m going directly into oil producers and having precisely no effect whatever on oil search and production in Australia.

In respect of their integrated profits, in the case where they do not sell to a third party but actually refine and retail, their profits can reach US$1. In the case of the United Kingdom and in respect of the North Sea oil production a profit of somewhat less than US$ 1 a barrel will be permitted. I would say that these figures completely debunk the persistent and consistent advocacy of the Leader of the Country Party. The matter is an obsession with him. I am sure that his constituents in farming areas will be duly elevated and titillated by his continuous insistence on adding to the present costs of rural production his concept of oil pricing with particular reference to party funds. State whether he believes that the Government should ultimately be responsible for protection policies or whether he believes that the Industries Assistance Commission should have that responsibility. Does he accord with some parts of the philosophy which his colleague the Minister for Minerals and Energy has just expressed to this House that cost increases are of concern in country areas? Is he aware that over the past 2 years since the Australian Labor Party has been in office, whilst superphosphate prices in Australia have risen from $17.25 to $53.45 per tonne"", in New Zealand-on e of our principal competitors in agricultural exporting markets around the world-the increase has been from $18.25 to only $24.75 a tonne? Is he aware that the eUmination of the superphosphate bounty represents a significant part of that cost increase, granted that in addition there has been an increase in phosphate rock? Accordingly, will he now ask his colleague the Minister for Agriculture whether the Government should introduce, in the intervening period, until receipt of the first interim report from the IAC on the superphosphate general inquiry, which is expected on 31 July, a bounty to make the price of superphosphate at least the same as the price in the past, in order that sowings of farm products in the period up to 1 August may be accelerated? In other words, for the period in which most farmers are sowing their crops in the 1975 agricultural year will the Minister consider the reintroduction of a superphosphate bounty in order to stimulate production instead of waiting the Attorney-General. Will he inform the House until after the sowings have been made and the of the constitutional provisions for the filling of IAC has reported? question but the answer will be relatively short. The matter has been referred to the Industries Assistance Commission, which obviously the honourable gentleman applauds. The other point about whether the subsidy should be continued in the interim period is a matter for Cabinet decision. Let us look at the facts which the honourable gentleman glossed over. The price of phosphate rock is the present world price. The honourable gentleman is always in favour of free enterprise when it comes to what people should charge. The present subsidy is provided by the taxpayers and I think it is about $60m. The thing that has never been recognised by the Opposition is that we get rock from Christmas Island at cost. It represents about half the phosphate supplied to Australia and costs about one-fifth of the world price. So the present subsidy to farmers in respect of the Christmas Island rock is now worth about $70m. In other words, if farmers had to pay the world price for Christmas Island rock they would have to pay an additional $70m. Therefore some recognition should be given to what the Australian Government is doing through the Phosphate Commission. This rockhalf the amount used-is being provided at cost, which is about one-fifth of the world market price. It is important to consider primary industries that are making substantial profits at present as against those that are not making any profits. The amount of subsidy suggested by the Opposition would not make an industry such as beef profitable because there is no market for beef. There never will be any market for beef until honourable members opposite do something like the Prime Minister did when he negotiated agreements across the world. Unthinking country farmers who consider that they will have a viable industry if they get a phosphate subsidy of $7 or $8 although they still have no markets are living in a vacuum. The real issue is to get markets for the produce. Then we will not have so much trouble with the phosphate subsidy. It is no solution to say to the farmers that they will be all right as long as we give them a subsidy. The question at the moment is whether there should be a subsidy and that is a matter for determination by the IAC. I am convinced, however, that the future of rural industries lies in a healthy overseas trading position. casual vacancies in the Senate?",24,Price Of Crude Oil

13,Mr Armitage,"My question is addressed tomember's question is motivated by newspaper reports of the decision of the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Lewis, about the filling of the Murphy from the Senate. Section 15 of the Constitution contains the relevant provision and it is probably well known to honourable members. But beyond that other factors are involved about which we should constantly remind ourselves. One is the role played in the Australian Constitution by conventions. All honourable members who have done any reading on the subject would know that the role of conventions in the British tradition of constitutional law is very great indeed. It is true that in the AustraUan Constitution which is in a written form, unlike the British Constitution which is in an unwritten form, the role of the conventions is not as great as it is writer on the subject has pointed that out over in Britain. But there can be little doubt-ou r High Court has said so-that the whole basis of responsible government rests on conventions. It is the existence of conventions that gives certainty and assurance to the conduct of government. Without the rule of law reflected in conventions, as well as in the written form, we would have chaos and anarchy. There can be little doubt that this convention is in existence.

Public opinion is the sanction behind conventions. One hesitates to use the word 'illegal'. Indeed one cannot use the word 'illegal' about the act of Mr Lewis, but the whole spirit of his reported decision savours of illegality. The spirit that lies behind the breach of that convention is the same spirit as lies behind an illegal act. One can only hope that with this new qualitative change in the level of irresponsibility that is being introduced into Australian public life by the New South Wales Liberal PremierMr WentworthI rise on a point of order. The Minister has spoken of irresponsibility. He is saying things which are untrue and which are totally irresponsible. The honourable member will remain silent. with this new qualitative change in the level of irresponsibility in public life introduced by the hope that public opinion throughout Australia and the listeners of this parliamentary broadcast Murphy to the High Court? name him if he persistently interjects each day.",25,Casual Vacancies In The Senate

Of course, part of our problem lies in the returns to growers in Australia and elsewhere complete failure of the Government in the mararound the world. The marketing crisis is real.

162,"Sumption, The Problems That Flowed Through Minister For Northern Development (Dr Patter","of cattle. The market has already slipped alarmingly. Those who are selling calves at anything like the rates that have been received in the yards in the last few weeks will know that today they are receiving about one-seventh of the price that they received 12 months ago. If they are selling grown bullocks and grown steers they will be flat out receiving 25 per cent of the price they received last year. Yet this is occurring at a time when the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has assessed that costs have moved against the cattle man by 27 per cent in the last 6 months. If this situation continues and thefigurereaches 54 per cent over the 12 months period, the industry will be in a disastrous plight. A significant part of that 27 per cent in escalated costs in the last 6 months is a direct product of measures introduced by the Labor Government. There is not only a marketing crisis but also a prospective seasonal fall factor which will prejudice the ability of cattlemen to realise their stocks in a rational way. This situation is compounded by the cost impact that has been imposed, significantly as the result of Labor measures. There is, of course, the suggestion by the Minister for the Northern Territory and the Government that they have been most sympathetic. They say they have talked to the industry and have an understanding of its problems, that they are trying to do something about the situation. There are 3 solutions. The first is the submission to be made in 2 weeks. The second is the proposed allocation of $20m from the Development Bank. But the interest rate has been increased from 6V4 per cent to 11V4 per cent. The Government expects those in the industry to borrow money to keep cattle on pastures and to be able to survive when the prices available for those cattle have been reduced to 25 per cent down to approximately 10 per cent of last year's values. Despite that development, those in the industry are being called upon by this Government to pay nearly double the interest rates, if they are to be able to carry on at all. The final prospect given to us by this Government through the Minister for Northern Development this morning is that really all the industry wants is a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission and, therefore, all will be well. A number of actions need to be taken. WhatI wanted to do this morning was not just to run through the difficulties faced by the industry of which I know something, as I know the Minister knows something; my concern is that this Government should do something about those problems. It is not much use saying: 'Yes, we are concerned', and pouring forth crocodile tears while the Prime Minister stomps out of the Chamber. What it is necessary to do is to take action and that is not very characteristic of this Government. The only action that it has taken in the last few weeks, fortunately, is to reverse gradually some of its economic policies so that it might give perhaps some incentive to the producing groups of this community who have been so adversely affected. been given. The tenure of the action that has been taken is to be short, if one reads the pronouncements of the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) at Terrigal and elsewhere. The change will be very short term indeed. Let us look at things that can be done. I refer, first of all, to the positive main markets-Japan, the European Economic Community, the United States and Canada. It is of no use this Government leaving the matter to the Australian Meat Board. This Government needs to do something about it. Prime Minister Tanaka came to Australia and the Government, having advocated a resource policy, refused to do anything about implementing one. They spoke about minerals such as uranium and coal but failed to do anything about beef. There were no hard negotiations. It was just a matter of an after-dinner chat. This is no way, in this hard marketing world, in which to secure access to countries which place political barriers against receiving the commodities which we must sell them. This Government has to start doing something about marketing. It is of no use sitting around and talking about it. We have the occasional markets of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Middle East. I understand a mission is in the USSR at the moment. I am most concerned to learn that there have been some problems about the prices that have been negotiated and the contract that supposedly has been arranged with the Russians for the sale of 40 000 tonnes of beef with a 20 000 tonne option. I am told that the result is likely to be that the price payable to Australian producers will in fact reduce the already deflated prices now available in saleyards in Australia. Consequently meat exporters in Australia are not likely to accept the contracts being offered. Many will remember that in 1970 the Australian Meat Board was hit with a bill of some $300,000 in supplementary charges for demurrage caused by wharf disruptions. As a result, one needs to look at the deductions from the price that has been negotiated in order to work out what will be the",36,Australian Beef Industry
163,Mr Hunt,But with no long term assurance.,37,Australian Beef Industry
164,Mr Sinclair,"No long term assurance hasfreight component of what I am told is a c.i.f. contract entered into with the Russians, and the impact of that on the Australian industry. If it is true that the result of the Russian sale is eradication. If the Government accelerated the not to improve prices to the Australian industry but is just to dispose of beef and to deflate the market, the Government needs to be prepared to come in and bolster returns to the industry so that the industry will not be prejudiced. There are a few very simple ways by which this can be done. The export levy of 1.6c per lb introduced at a time when the industry was buoyant can be suspended. There is no need for it to be maintained. We accepted the principle that when the industry is sound it is not unreasonable to expect the industry to contribute towards export expenses, but when the industry is deflated, when it is in a critical position, why should approximately 15 per cent of the price that exporters receive be taken off by the Government and so penalise those producers further? The export levy should be removed. Let us look at the whole field of tax. We can of abuse of the Australian Government for its alsuspend periodic payments of private companies leged inaction and has attempted to blame the tax. We can increase the tax averaging limit from Australian Government for the whole financial $ 16,000 to something like double that amount. If crisis in the cattle industry.

We could restore the petrol price subsidy. We could restore the tariff compensation measures referred to in the Green Paper. There are a number of programs on which the Government can and must act. The beef industry is in a serious position. Inaction and rhetoric are no longer sufficient to offset the critical problems. The Opposition calls on the Government not to talk but to act.

Apparently it is all right now to get up and say that the Government should provide more money, but when I was a member of the Opposition I moved many urgency motions and the parroted response of the government of the day always was: 'We will not bulldoze decisions through the Parliament. We will wait until the industry has consulted us. We wiU make decisions that are based upon what the industry wants'. It was the industry that asked for the $20m. It was the industry that asked for commercial rates of interest to be applied. honourable member for Hume does not know the first thing about what the industry asked for. It asked for commercial rates of interest. The Government provided $20m at commercial rates of interest, with the promise to review the position in 3 months time if more money were needed. At present 448 specialist cattle producers throughout AustraUa have appUed for loans. The number of appUcations received is 448. The sources of the applications are as follows: Direct from producers, 129; through the trading banks, 234; referred by pastoral houses, 63; and 22 others.

The letter continues: In offering the initial $20m loan to cattle producers, the Australian Government has recognised the need and justification of assistance.

The letter from the Australian National Cattlemen's CouncU continues: As an organisation, representing a large number of cattle producers in all States, we are constantly receiving suggestions and proposals that are all intended to assist the industry in various forms. Many of these proposals are obviously not feasible, but others do require specific and critical analysis. It is for this reason that the Australian National Cattlemen's Council is requesting that you seek a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission so that these proposals can be examined in a formal and rational manner and so that specific recommendations can be made to the Government on further assistance.

There is no question about stabilisation scheme, whether it be an income scheme. The Deputy Leader of the Country Party ible to find markets for our beef. It has sent be sold. The Government has taken action under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with respect to Japan and the EEC in an endeavour to get those countries to remove the barriers they have placed against Australian beef. The Government has undertaken surveys in underdeveloped countries to ascertain their capacity, if any, for buying Australian beef. We must remember that refrigeration is one of the great problems in selling beef overseas. Certainly there is scope in a limited way for gifts of canned beef to some countries. The Government is working on proposals to provide finance to export meat works, particularly in the north, which may not be able to open because of liquidity problems. The Katherine meat works in the Northern Territory is such an example. In regard to the stabilisation schemes, as I said before, the Government is waiting for the Australian catde industry to put forward proposals. Perhaps it will do so to the Agricultural Council. In the Northern Territory one has been put forward and it is my hope that a floor price scheme will be in operation before the killing season commences. The basic problem that worries me greatlyI do not beat around the bush-is what will happen to the cattle throughout Australia starting from the next two or three months, because there are all the earmarks that we will get dry conditions not only in southern Australia but in northern Australia. We have had good conditions in the past 18 months or 2 years and cattle have been able to hold on, but practically every catde property in Australia today is overstocked-the y are overstocked with breeding catde, their carrying capacity has been stretched, calf survival rates have been high and they have too many fat cattle. There is a limit to how long people can hang on to fat cattle. When they have to sell, or when there are dry conditions or a drought, they will be facing a serious problem. I have heard nothing from the Opposition about any proposal about this problem. honourable member'stimehas expired, this debate started there was one Minister and 7 basic deficiencies in Government policy, both of backbenchers in the chamber on the Governwhich are covered by the Opposition's rural polment side and there were 11 members on the Opicy. Firstly, every day that passes emphasises the position front bench, and 32 of their supporters. need for a rural bank tofinanceprimary industry Immediately the debate started the Prime Minisin Australia on terms appropriate to the particuter ( Mr Whitlam) showed his contempt for the lar difficulties and differences experienced by priissue being discussed by walking out of the mary producers. If we were in government we chamber, having spent half an hour'quibbling would establish such an institution. Secondly, the about a word in Hansard. A year ago ihe Prime enormous fluctuations in the incomes of beef Minister and other Ministers were telling the primary producers of Australia that they had never had it so good because of actions taken by the Labor Government. Now the actions of the Labor Government have caught up with it, but it is the beef producers and primary producers generally who are being called upon to pay for them. Unfortunately there has been no improvement in the position of the beef industry since this matter was raised in a debate on a matter of public importance in October last year. This is partly due to the similar worldwide circumstances applying now as applied then but it is also largely due to the procrastination and ineptitude of this Government. At the time of the last debate I made 3 positive suggestions, in addition to many made by my colleague the honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair). First was this question of carry on finance. It was clear even at that time that a substantial amount would be required but the response was typical of this Government; it was hopelessly inadequate. The sum of $20m was made available at 11 '/2 per cent interest. No wonder there has been no improvement in the situation. It is worse because there has been a decline in confidence within the beef industry. There are signs that the Government is now realising this, but as usual its recognition is belated in response to a desperate situation. I suppose it is possible that the Government will make the right decision eventually but by that time, as in the case of its disastrous policies for manufacturing industry and private enterprise generally, the damage will have been done. Hundreds of producers will have found it impossible to carry on. SoI make this plea to the Government: Make a clear statement that more carry onfinancewill be available at less than the current 11 Vi per cent interest rate. How can a producer accept carry on finance if he has no income to pay the interest on the money he receives? Another suggestion I have made to the Government relates to deferment of income tax, interest free, for taxpayers the majority of whose 1973-74. The present financial situation of the",39,Australian Beef Industry

180,Mr Street (Corangamite) (11.45),"When beef industry provides a classic illustration of 2producers between 1973-74, a year of record high prices, and thisfinancialyear, a year of record low prices, have shown the urgent need for farmers to have some means of stabilising their incomes. Again, the Opposition has spelt out in detail its farm income reserve fund whereby primary producers could pay into the fund in years of high income, the contributions being non-taxable and earning interest at the short term bond rate, and withdraw funds in years of low income, the withdrawals being treated as income in that tax year. How much sounder the beef industry would have been today had such a fund been in existence during the period of record high prices. The Opposition is committed to establishing this fund and the sooner we are in a position to do so the better it Soviet Socialist Republics and Eastern Europe. will be for primary producers and the Australian economy. I also suggested last year suspension of the beef export levy. AgainI put that proposal forward today. At a time of high prices it was reasonable to expect producers to bear this cost. Now, since this cost represents approximately 15 per cent of the value of a beast it is quite unreasonable to expect producers to bear this cost. It is an absolute disgrace that the Government has done absolutely nothing about this quite simthe volcano being represented by a failure of the ple suggestion which was made months ago. We pressed last year for negotiations to open up new markets. Again, the Government response has been typical. Having been warned of an impending crisis and what should be done the Government waited months before doing anything. Now a delegation is in Europe trying to sell Ausimpossible task to open up new markets. I would tralian meat. That should have been on the move before Christmas. These were all suggestions made 4 months ago. Since then I have advocated a further series markets. Certainly the price has not been all it of moves the Government could take. We all know that the present situation is due largely to and adopting an aggressive marketing approach the 3 major markets-the United States of America, the European Economic Community and Japan-al l cutting down or eliminating imports of beef simultaneously. Therefore, we must move with determination and speed to open up new markets and develop new products. I have suggested to the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) that encouragement should be given by the Government to meat companies to diversify their methods of processing beef, such as salting, dry salting and dehydration. Next, I doubt whether sufficient effort has been made to use canned beef as a food aid. I know the problems of distribution and diet, but I find it hard to believe that since 1971 we could not have disposed of more than 1300 tonnes of canned beef, which I am informed is the actual amount disposed of over the last 3 years. There are also possibilities of using beef in domestic welfare programs. What about a small entidement to beef for those on unemployment benefits? Thanks to the disastrous policies of this Government this country has a surplus at the present time of both beef and unemployed. Could not something be done to help both problems? I am not suggesting this as a permanent feature of policy but we are in a crisis situation and unusual and imaginative policies are required to deal with it. I refer now to the sale of beef to the Union of There are disturbing factors relating to the recent announcement of the sale of 40 000 tonnes to Russia. It was originally announced some time ago, which was obviously premature. Now there are considerable doubts whether the prices will allow meat exporters to fulfil the order. It is absolutely essential that this sale goes ahead. The overriding priority in Australia today is to convert cattle on the hoof into consumer beef. The industry, as the Minister for Agriculture himself has acknowledged, is on the edge of a volcanoseason. If this happens with catde numbers at the present high levels it is difficult to predict the seriousness of the consequences. I am personally convinced that it is not an like to quote the experience of the Co-operative Farmers and Graziers Meat Company in Victoria. Through energetic management and export initiative this company has found new could hope for but the point is that by going out it has got markets. If that company can do this others can do it, and we must do it. At the recent Agricultural Outlook Conference some disturbingfigureswere given in relation to United States cattle numbers. It is anticipated that cattle slaughterings in the United States willriseby 8 to 10 per cent in 1975. But it is also expected that the total number of cattle in the United States, which is now 133 million, willriseto 137 million by the end of this year despite the increased slaughterings. Our beef industry is frighteningly dependent on the United States market. More than 50 per cent of our total exports go there. We must reduce this dependence. It is not only a task for the Government but government must give a lead. It will take more than a public relations tour of Europe by a Prime Minister, totally illiterate in the problems of primary industry, to solve this problem. I have suggested a whole range of measures the Government could take to stimulate the industry. I have put forward several proposals which the Opposition would put into practice on our return to government. On the Government's performance to date it looks as though the hardpressed beef industry will have to wait for the return to power of the Liberal and Country parties. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of producers cannot wait. The Government must do another about-turn. That should not cause it any difficulty. It should take our advice on this issue, as it has on so many others, and act on it, not just talk about it. The Government should at least call the industry together to try to evolve a coherent approach to the problems of the industry. Last year the Opposition did it. We have taken all the initiatives so far. Let us see a bit of action from the Government. I wish to put the record straight. In the debate on this subject last October the Government reviewed the action which had been taken to that date in regard to the serious crisis in the beef industry. I will not go over that ground; I will take the matter up from that point. The position so far as the industry is concerned is that we stand without blemish. This Government has worked in complete co-operation with the cattle industry. Once again in this debate we find how far out of touch the Australian Country Party in particular has become since it has occupied the Opposition benches in regard to requests made by the industry. We have already heard the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) refer to a letter from the Australian National Catdemen's Council. Let me refer to a letter that I received from that Council. It is dated 5 December 1974.1 might mention to the House that the Council speaks for organisations such as the Graziers Association of New South Wales, the United Graziers Association of Queensland, the Graziers Association of Riverina, the Graziers Association of Victoria, the Stockowners Association of South Australia, the Pastoralists Association of West Darling, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia Incorporated, the Tasmanian Farmers, Stockowners and Orchadists Association, the Northern Territory Pastoral Lessees Association, the Centralian Pastoralists Association and the United Stud Beef Cattle Breeders Association of Australia. It is a representative group. We heard the Opposition claim that the Government has not been in contact with the industry. I quote from the letter which is addressed to me as Chairman of the Resources Committee of the Government. That Committee established close liaison with the cattle industry as soon as the crisis started. That liaison has continued from that date. I quote from the letter: The announcement made by the Government yesterday . . . This is in respect of the $20mis in general accord with the requests made earlier by the Australian National Cattlemen's Council and supported by the other producer bodies. Your interest in this issue. . . That refers to the Committeeis appreciated and I also wish to thank you for permitting me to have an opportunity to present a case for the cattle industry to your fellow members of the Resources Commitiee of Caucus. It is signed by the Executive Secretary. I make the point that the Council says that the decision to allocate $20m to the cattle industry on the conditions on which those funds were made available was completely in accord with its request of 5 December 1974. We find that the Opposition is not only out of touch with the requirements and requests of the catde industry but also it is completely misinformed about the negotiations between the Australian trade mission-no t the Australian Meat Board-representin g the Australian Government and the Russian buyers. The contract is not fictitious. It was signed on 7 February. It has nothing to do with a previous negotiation between private companies in Australia involving 10 000 tonnes of meat which created difficulties last year. This contract for 40 000 tonnes has been negotiated at commercial rates. Considering the announcement that the terms of the contract are confidential, in exacdy the same way as any meat importer would respect the confidentiality of such a contract, it would be very interesting to know how the Opposition parties derived this information that the prices which were negotiated are at an uneconomic level. The Opposition parties are making great play once again of some myth which they create and float to scare the people whom they are supposed to be representing. They cannot survive unless such myths are created. They cannot survive unless they create fear among the people in the community. The proposition that the prices negotiated in this contract were too low is yet another example of the use by the Opposition of fear tactics in the primary sector of the community.",41,Australian Beef Industry
181,Mr Whan (Eden,"Monaro) (11.55)-Firsdy,Let me now turn to the facts as they have been recorded by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics in a report in Occasional Paper No. 25. Once again this report gives the lie to the Opposition's claim that the Government shows no interest in the beef industry. Let me read to the House an extract from the foreword of this report. It reads: The Government requested the Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the Treasury, to formulate proposals which may be necessary to assist the beef industry in the immediate months ahead. The report is dated December 1974. All the opinions were considered. Let me refer to this report in more detail to put the matter in its proper perspective. In its analysis of the market the BAE pointed out that, although beef is produced in a very large number of countries, less than 10 per cent of world output is traded internationally and usually about 80 per cent of world imports are accounted for by the United States of America and the European Economic Community. I repeat that 80 per cent of world imports of beef are accounted for by these 2 markets in which Australia has already established a very firm base and in which the present crisis is politically motivated in order to protect the interests of the domestic meat producers. The second point that the BAE makes and to which I should like to draw the attention of the House is that the marked decline in saleyard prices in Australia during 1974 was mainly due to the dramatic turn-around in the supplydemand situation on world beef markets. It was an international phenomena which created this difficulty for the domestic market. One might comment here that the domestic consumers have done a sterling job by increasing beef consumption by almost 50 per cent on previous years. Australians are now eating more beef than ever before and if this were not so the situation would be extremely serious indeed. In this report the BAE makes the point that the developing situation of increasing beef production, in some cases rising stocks of beef, and falling producer incomes led importing countries to take increasingly severe action to restrict imports. The EEC and Japan have virtually banned imports, Canada has restricted them and the USA. has issued warnings against large increases in supplies to that market. Those are the predisposing factors. It is reductions are part of a package of measures interesting to observe that the man who will be aimed at stimulating sales of motor vehicles with drawing $40,000 from the slush funds of indusa view to avoiding retrenchments in the motor try to oppose the honourable member for industry, Other proposals involve the repeal of Macarthur ( Mr Kerin) has been going around the provisions imposing tax on the net standby the countryside claiming that the United States value to employees of the use of company cars of America, the EEC and Japan are closing off their markets in retaliation for some political position adopted by the Australian Government. How absurd and how typical of the Opposition that is in its analysis of such a market. Obviously we need to consider the BAE's assessment in analysing the position if we are in fact to find some sensible solution to the problems wbich confront the beef market in Australia today. The BAE report goes on to define ways in which Government action may be taken. Would any member of the Opposition dispute the fact that these policy options lie in these areas? First, that viable producers need to be assisted to remain in the industry. Second, provide assistance to non-viable producers either to leave the industry or to reconstruct their production units. Third, provide protection for the resource basethe breeding nucleus and the farm infrastructure of the beef producing properties and also expand market outlets for beef. On all counts this Government has taken action. On all counts this Government has had the matter constantly under review almost from the day just 18 months ago when the Opposition and leaders in the beef industry were saying that they did not want the Government to involve itself in the beef market in Australia. Order! The discussion is concluded. Bills presented by Mr Stewart, and together read a first time. Second Readings and Recreation and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (12.5)I move: That the Bills be now read a second time.

Following a statement by General MotorsHoldens Pty Ltd in December that it would retrench 5000 of its employees in mid-January, negotiations were held with that company and with the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler AustraUa Ltd. In response to a package proposed by the Government for the industry, General Motors-Holdens said that it would hold retrenchment action and review its position at the end of 90 days. Ford, which intended to retrench 1650 workers, and Chrysler, which intended to retrench 1000 workers, agreed not to take any action to retrench workers for at least 30 days when they would review their positions. The Government beUeves that in view of the very generous assistance it is providing to the industry it is entirely reasonable to expect the vehicle companies to defer any retrenchments for 90 days. During thistimethe Government, the companies and the unions wUl continuously review the position and examine how best to adjust to the circumstances prevailing at the end of the 90 day period.

187,Mr Stewart (Lang,"Minister for TourismHonourable members will recall that the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) and the previous Treasurer announced on 4 December 1974 that the Australian Government would seek an initial appropriation of $20m in these sittings to augment the resources of the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia to enable the Bank to broaden its lending to seriously affected beef producers. The purpose of this Bill is to appropriate $20m for lending to the Bank. Under the Commonwealth Banks Act the funds would be advanced to the Bank as required and on terms and conditions to be agreed between the Treasurer (Dr. J. F. Cairns) and the board of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. As honourable members will be well aware, the Government has taken a number of measures over recent months to increase bank liquidity and requested banks to increase their rate of lending. Trading banks have been responding accordingly and in the 3 months to 8 January 1975 the rate of new trading bank lending approvals more than doubled that for the previous 3 months. Information available suggests that the rural sector is sharing in the general try in its present difficulties. Other measures, such increase in lending. Trading banks are now generally in a position to meet demand from beef producers able to meet normal commercial banking criteria. However, the sharp decline in catde prices meant that a number of specialised beef producers would be unable to satisfy the normal borrowing criteria of the trading banks. The Development Bank in normal circumstances does not provide carry-on finance but the board of the Corporation has . welcomed the Government's initiative and agreed that, in the case of catde producers whose income is wholly or preponderantly derived from cattle, the Bank would stand ready to provide assistance by way of medium or long-term loans to those producers whose capital structures have been seriously affected by-recent trends in catde prices but who, in the opinion of the bank, still remain viable. In accordance with its banking charter the Development Bank would have regard primarily to the prospects, of the applicant becoming, or continuing to be, successful rather than the value of the security available. The funds so provided by the Bank to producers would, in the normal course, flow back to the traditional carry-on lenders to the industry enabling them to provide greater assistance to their clients. The former Treasurer and the Minister for ting for 2614 hours a week. This will enable a Agriculture on 4 December 1974 stated that the fairly extensive coverage to be given to the matDevelopment Bank stood ready to provide ters that are to be discussed. There are very good additional loans to eligible cattle producers reasons for the changes that have been made to immediately, in anticipation of the appropriation the hours of sitting. Firstly, 11 February is the being approved by Parliament. In line with this policy the Development Bank had already approved loans of $2.4m up to 5 February 1975 to assist specialist beef producers. According to the Development Bank the eastern mainland States are obtaining the bulk of approvals, and Queensland has had more money approved than any other State. Furthermore, where applications have been received from persons who are involved in the industry but who cannot be accepted as specialist beef producers, the Development Bank is looking for ways to assist within its normal policy and a further $ 1.5m has been made available to these producers. In addition, over the past 2 months, the Development Bank has deferred loan repayments aggregating nearly $800,000 on accounts of existing beef producer borrowers. In little over 2 months, therefore, the Development Bank has provided direct or indirect assistance to beef producers totalling $4.7m. Honourable members will recall that the augmentation of the Bank's resources was but one of a series of measures designed to assist the indusas negotiations aimed at re-opening and developing overseas markets, are being pursued as a matter of urgency in conjunction with the increased Development Bank activity referred to above. In addition, as previously announced, the Government has the beef situation under close scratiny and stands ready to review the needs for further assistance and to provide additional funds if necessary.

189,Mr Daly (Grayndler,"Leade r of the House)earliest date for 10 years on which the Parliament has met. In addition, the legislative program is fairly heavy. A number of public holidays occur in March this year. Canberra Day falls on 12 March, and honourable members might recollect that last year the Parliament sat on Canberra Day, not only causing inconvenience to those employees of the Commonwealth who desired to celebrate the holiday but also incurring considerable expense. The Easter period this year also falls during March. In view of these factors, it was felt that a break of one month would be more convenient for all concerned and would meet the convenience of honourable members. As Leader of the HouseI have had requests from members on both sides for a readjustment of the sitting days. I do not say that what is proposed is perfect; the fact of the matter is that there will undoubtedly have to be change in respect of the sittings as time goes on. We are not tied hand and foot to the system of 3 weeks on and 1 week off. These things can be varied and ought to be varied to suit circumstances. There should also be an appreciation of the fact that at the same time as getting through the business of the House honourable members from both sides have commitments in their electorates, and they can certainly do more during a month's break than they could during a week. The same argument applies to the fortnight's break that is to come later. It will give honourable members more time to circulate in their areas and meet their commitments. These proposals have no sinister purpose at all. They are based on the convenience of members and on what we consider to be appropriate in view of the difficulty in regard to holidays in March. Adequatetimewill be given for discussion. As portunity of fulfilling their obligations before honourable members know, there has always coming back for the remainder of the session. As been a grievance day debate and general busiI instanced in the circular I sent out to honourness items and private members' Bills have able members, the 30-day period is not mandaalways been debated. We have always given the tory. If the Parliament has notfinishedits busiopportunity for these debates to take place since ness at the end of that time we will extend the sitwe came to office. I do not offer any criticism at tings. I hope it will not be necessary, but these this stage of the previous government's intenthings happen. For instance, we have on the tions. However, I would say, without any egostocks the Family Law Bill. As there is such tism, that honourable members have had more interest in this legislation it may be necessary to opportunity to debate matters of that nature than sit on a Friday to finish it, because it is legislation they have had for some years. I would hope that on which people are requesting a decision one even more opportunities will be provided, but way or the other. The 30-day sitting period this can be done only when we come to some which has already been decided is well up with mutual arrangements in relation to sitting times any previous autumn sitting period. When the which are in keeping with the size of the Parliapresent Leader of the Opposition was in the Parment. The Standing Orders of this Parliament liament as Leader of the House, the most he had were geared to a Parliament of 75 members the Parliament sit in an autumn session was 31 whereas now the Parliament is made.up of 127 days and on one occasion it sat 28 days. In 1973 members. The rules that applied in the days when the Parliament was 75 strong are still applied to a Parliament with almost double the number of members, and this does present problems. Honourable members opposite may say that the purpose of introducing this proposal is other than what has been stated. The Government has no desire to stifle discussion. Instead of the usual 3 weeks honourable members will have an additional week in which to criticise whatever they might desire. All in all, I think that the proposed sitting hours will be satisfactory to honourable members. I do not want to delay the House but the Government is entided tofixsitting hours. In doing so it tries to meet the wishes of members on all sides of the Parliament. I know that honourable members have commitments such as Party meetings and the discussion of legislation in the Party rooms. I do not have to tell the House that I had long experience on the other side of the fence trying tofitin with government programs. Our Party meetings now take place on Tuesday mornings, and we get a fairly good run through when the House is sitting. The sittings of the House are meant to suit the convenience not only of members but also of the staff that work here. I refer to the Clerks and others who have to compile the records of the Parliament. Except on very odd occasionsI would say on every occasion-w e would not sit past 11 p.m. I think this is a good rule and one to which we should try to keep. But within the confines of what has been decided on this occasion I hope that ultimately we will be able to find even better sitting hours. I think that the month's break that is proposed on this occasion should be welcomed by honourable members because it will give them the opthe Parliament sat for 34 days in the autumn period. Last year, because of the elections, we sat for only 16 days. This year it is proposed at this stage to sit for 30 days. So, all in all, we do not propose any curtailment of debate. Therefore I submit the proposal to the House for its consideration and I hope that it will be accepted by honourable members. Opposition has some concern with the sitting hours, although it does not propose to reject the proposal submitted by the Government. It is necessary that we consider the impact of the proposal which the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) is now debating with us before we hastily accept the changes as being worthwhile. As I explained yesterday, our first concern lies not in the substance of the motion but in what seem to be changes introduced in the program of sitting weeks. These changes were intended not to meet the convenience of members nor, I suspect, to meet the convenience of the Government but peculiarly to meet the travel inclination of the man who leads the Government, the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam). Yesterday we had before this Parliament his recitation of achievement during his 6 weeks absence over the Christmas recess. One must be even more apprehensive if that is the sole reason for the change in the parliamentary timetable. The result seems minimal. assures me that that is not true, so I am delighted to hear that the Prime Minister will be staying in Australia. I gather that the Japanese are not that willing to conclude the NARA Agreement. Therefore perhaps the Prime Minister may not be leaving the country in the immediate future. However, it is certainly true that as far as the parin office. If that is so it is vital that this Parliament liamentary schedule is concerned the program is significantly different from the original draft which was sent around to honourable members. I am concerned that honourable members who have committed themselves in advance-as most of us need to do-wil l to some degree be prejudiced because of the change. But that is not really the concern. The Leader of the House mentioned the number of sitting days. The significance is not just in the number of days we sit; it is that the House continues to sit. I am of the view that our House still does not sit sufficiently. Given the tremendous significance of national issues and of the importance to Australia of matters debated in this chamber and of matters which take place outside this chamber which should be debated here, I am of the view that this House should sit pretty well the whole year round. If that were so it is true that a number of honourable members fromtimeto time could not be present. But I am concerned in this instance because we have resumed after a fairly long break. It is proposed that we will sit for 4 weeks and then we will have 4 weeks off. That4 weeks off is a long period within which the national Parliament will not be convened and therefore it will not be able to comment on matters which affect the very vitality of this country. It is of no use the Leader of the House saying that last year we did that and that the year before we did something else. Even the Leader of the House is aware that Australia'sfinancialcircumstances today are as bad as they have been at any time since 1930. Mr Donald Cameron-Worse. they are worse. The reason the Opposition is concerned is that it is the Government's policies which are making thefinancialcircumstances so. We will sit for 4 weeks and then we will be off for 4 weeks. Having seen the changes in Government policy over the last 4 weeks, in those 4 weeks off we could have a totally different economic policy. We could have totally different attitudes within the Government on a range of matters and this Parliament will not meet to consider them. So it is not just a matter of statistical performance. It is a matter of the comparison of the real situation as it exists in Australia in 1975 and the Government's demonstrated incompetence to cope with that situation. It seems that the leadership given by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) and the policies of the Opposition Parties are the only hope that the average Australian has that the Government might learn what to do meet and that the Opposition have an opportunity to explain to the Government what it should be doing so that the Government can go off and implement some of those measures. In considering this motion I think that everyone needs to recognise that we are concerned not just about the hours of sitting. We are concerned that the Parliament continues to meet and then, within that context, with the hours of sitting and that there should be an adequate opportunity for honourable members to debate the issues wbich are of such tremendous importance to this nation and to its very survival. Given the deterioration of economic conditions and the whole climate of where we are going, I see it as quite imperative that over the next few months this Parliament",46,Hours Of Meeting

193,Mr Sinclair,"Indeed, in some respectsmeets continually. The Leader of the House has said that March is a difficult month. He has explained some of the peculiar problems that exist during March. I do not think that any month is a very easy month and the way this Government is going they will become worse. He suggests that there is an extensive legislative program. He has very kindly given me some general indication of areas of legislation. But even the Leader of the House, for all his astuteness, finds it difficult to extract from his ministerial colleagues the volume of legislation in detail which we need and which he needs to know that is to be in the program. Even the day before this Parliament sat the Leader of the House was not sure of the detail of the legislation that we were to consider. He is still in a position where he is dependent without our 2 parties having had an opportunity on his Ministerial colleagues-regrettabl y all of to debate our attitude towards them and then them have not the astuteness which he posbeing prepared to come forward with a consesses-and he is dependent on the Parliamensidered and determined point of view. tary Counsel who, for perfectly legitimate and valid reasons, find it extraordinarily difficult to match the changes that the Ministers require in their legislation. It makes it impossible for this changed hours reflects in part the character of side of the House, when the Government does the Party that is today in government and the not know what is in its legislative program, to parties that are in Opposition. It is very easy for have the opportunity to consider it. We are conthose who live in Sydney and Melbourne to get sidering extended hours of sitting on certain days to this Parliament on a Tuesday morning in with a legislative program that is uncertain and order to attend a party meeting at 9 o'clock or in an economic climate that is at crisis point. We 9.15 a.m. The frequency of flight times, particuare not really looking at ways by which we can larly from Sydney, is such that honourable memmake the program succeed; we are really looking bers can easily do it. But our parties on this side at the circumstances of what might meet the of the chamber do not represent only those two Government's convenience in its legislative prometropolises; we have many members, as the gram. We believe it is necessary, if there is to be adsome who live relatively close find it even more equate consideration, that there be adequate difficult to get here than those who live a long notice of legislation and that from the time the way away. My colleague the honourable memBills are introduced we on this side of the House ber for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) for example, who have an opportunity to examine them in our lives in an electorate relatively adjacent to the Party rooms and committees and to come forAustralian Capital Territory has the extraordiward with a Party view which reflects not just narily difficult position either of having to drive what we as politicians want but also what people 300 miles to Melbourne and then come here by outside this Parliament-thos e whom we plane or as the Leader of the House has kindly represent-wan t in the legislation. It is for those permitted him to do, take a charter aircraft to fly reasons that I am concerned about the content of over the mountains to get here. But if he uses northis motion. The Leader of the House .proposes mal commercial aircraft he either drives to Melto change the commencing hours on certain days bourne or drives on a fairly difficult route across of the week. One of those is Wednesday. The the mountains to get here, and it is not easy for Leader of the House has said that in future the him to get here in time other than, by leaving his Labour Caucus will meet on a Tuesday .rnorning, home early on a Monday morning. implying that therefore we can do the .same. One of the big differences between the Government and the Opposition, as he would know.frbm his honourable members have several responsibililong experience in Opposition, is that,we.'do not ties. An important responsibility is our attendget the legislation until it has been m'ttoduced in ance in the Parliament but an equally important this House. We believe it necessary that there be a period of examination by our committees and by our shadow Ministers and then reference to our party room. If we have our meetings on a Tuesday morning that will mean that the legislation introduced on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday of the preceding week will be the only legislation that can be considered in our Party room on the following Tuesday morning. The practice has been that, given the need for early debate on quite a range of matters that emerge from time to time,if there is a party meeting on a Wednesday morning measures can reasonably be introduced on a Wednesday and debated on a Thursday. That opportunity is being denied the Opposition. I believe that the Government needs to recognise that. From our point of view we are not prepared to debate matters of importance The second thing that is important about these Government has a few, who travel great distances and find it difficult to come here. Indeed, The point I am trying to make is that we as responsibility is our availability to our constitutheir constituents wish them to canvass. That at ents. We need to be available in our electorates. We need to be able to talk to our electorates. We need to be able to be interviewed by those who wish to see us. All of us have good secretaries who maintain our offices but it is not the same as the member himself being available, and for most members of this House Monday is one of the few days of the week when they can reasonably be in their electorates. Members of the shadow Cabinet henceforth will obligatorily be here to meet and talk about problems they will need to have ready for their Party meetings and every member who lives out of Sydney and Melbourne will find that he will be away from his electorate on Mondays. He is away on Fridays now and he will be away on Mondays. The Leader of the House says: That is why we are giving you moretimeoff in between times. Our argument is that Parliament should continue to meet and that there should be within the sitting hours time for members to attend to their electorate responsibilities each week and to their parliamentary responsibilities. But on the time schedule that has been presented today to the HouseI do not believe that that is adequately being provided for. The Leader of the House commented on the adequacy of time for private member's debates. I pay him full credit for the fact that in adjournment debates and in Grievance Day debates he has generally maintained a reasonable opportunity for back benchers on both sides of the House to raise matters that are important to them. I think he would have hoodwinked the Australian public, for he would not be able to hoodwink those of us in this Parliament, if anyone thought that there has been a greater time for back bench participation in parliamentary debates particularly on legislation that has been introduced by the Government, and controversial legislation at that. It is true that on matmy life than I have heard from the honourable ters such as the Family Law Bill, where there is a conscience vote and such marked division within the Labor Party, there will be adequate time for debate but I wish to goodness that the precedent the Leader of the House is setting on the debate on the Family Law Bill were to be followed in other matters of significance where those of us on this side of the House, representing as we do half the Australian electorate at least and I believe a good deal more than half at present, would be given an opportunity-no t just the principal spokesman in our Parties but those who are on the back bench representing their electorates-to get up and canvass the views and matters which the moment is not being permitted. If we agree to these extended hours I only hope, and knowing the general approach of the Leader of the House, I think it is a pious hope that the additionaltimethat is to be made available will be set aside for those members of Parliament who deservedly should be given a greater opportunity to talk on important legislative changes which so demonstrably have been wrong for this country, which we on this side of the House have rejected, and which only now the members of the Government are beginning to see should be reversed. I am disappointed that 1 have not time to go through some statistics that I had taken out by the Parliamentary Library. The Leader of the House very kindly yesterday suggested that the absence of members of the present Opposition from the Parliament needed to be taken into account in any debate on parliamentary sittingtimes.I went to the trouble of finding out how often members of the Labor Party in the last Parliament attended the House and it is surprising how many of them were away for so long. Even the honourable gentleman at the table enjoyed a few sojourns abroad. He did for a time have that pseudonym Dilly Dally Daly. I believe it is appropriate to take into account that the Government has a responsibility to maintain the numbers in a House. The Opposition has a responsibility to debate issues that are before the Parliament and the Government and the Opposition have a joint responsibility to ensure that there is adequatetimefor debate. We do not believe that these extended sitting hours will provide that opportunity. We reluctantly accept the changes but we urge the Minister to ensure that any extended hours that will be given will be accorded to back bench members of the Parliament. have never heard a greater load of rubbish in all member for New England( Mr Sinclair). He can talk under water. No matter what is put up, even if it was suggested that we turn the lights down, he would talk for a quarter of an hour about it. The honourable member put up a lot of spurious arguments which for the life of me I could not understand. Somehow or other he maintained that the Opposition represented more people from distant States than the Labor Party. I did a quick analysis of the situation. From Western Australia we have 5 members in the House of Representatives and 5 senators; the Opposition has the same number.

When I entered Parliament there was an Office of Education but nothing for tourism or housing. The present Government has added many new departments. It has created departments for the environment, recreation and the media. Name a field and it has a department to deal with it. This creates additional work for members of Parliament. Those of us who represent rural areasI cannot speak for those representing city electorates-fin d that we are expected to deal, in consideration of the Regional Employment Development Scheme, with the merits and demerits of kerbing and guttering in villages, the eradication of noxious weeds, the construction of horse stalls and toilet blocks, to name but a few of the many works that we must consider. The load is increasing tremendously all the time. I turn to the committee system and refer to an undesirable practice that has developed. Some committees are being forced to meet during the sitting hours of the House. I cannot simply suggest that we abandon the idea of additional sitting hours, as proposed by the Minister. However, I want to put the issue in a light in which it can be considered in conjunction with all the other work required of members. I think it is getting to a stage where it is impossible for members representing the bigger electoratesI highlight that problem-to get here on time. If the Government intends to force this motion through-whic h I feel it has the numbers to doI would like the Leader of the HouseI think he would be the appropriate person to respond to this suggestion-to consider providing additional staff for members. The Government intends taking members away from their electorates for four weeks and three weeks at a time. Unless further staff is provided, we will have to cease these longer sittings. I ask that consideration be given to the provision of additional assistance. I thank the Minister for what he has done already in this regard. I have availed myself of the temporary assistance that he has made available to us. However, the degree of assistance has to be increased, particularly if we continue to impose longer sitting hours and more sitting weeks. None of these changes will come about quickly. My wish was to place on record the constantly increasing workload. If this motion to extend the sitting hours is pushed through, more consideration must be given to the flow of work in our electorates. Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading and Propeny) (12.55)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, which the Government regards as a key element in its overall program of electoral reform, relates in the main to the limitation of electoral expenditure and to the public disclosure of the sources of funds made available to political parties and to candidates. Included in the Bill are provisions which-requir e the appointment of party agents by political parties and the registration thereof by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer; require the maintenance of a register of party agents by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer; require lists of all party agents and official agents to be kept in electoral offices in each State and Territory; require the filing of returns relating to electoral expenditure by registered party agents and official agents with the Chief Australian Electoral Officer within 12 weeks after an election; require returns to be open for public inspection; require the certification of returns by a registered company auditor; enable the reimbursement of auditor's fees up to a limit of $200; prohibit electoral expenditure by any person except a registered party agent or official agent, without prior written authority of the respective agent; prohibit the making of gifts, including donations, to a party or candidate except with the written authority of the registered party agent or the official agent of the candidate; require the disclosure of particulars of all gifts, including all donations, made to political parties or candidates through or with the authority of the party agents or official agents; limit the campaign expenditure of a political party, including electoral expenditure by a party's candidates in accordance with a specified formula. Under the formula the limit of expenditure of a political party in a House of Representatives election-hel d separately from a Senate election -woul d be based on 7.5c for every person enrolled for the division or divisions contested; that is to say, an amount of $593,740 on present enrolment for a party contesting all 127 electorates. In the case of a Senate election held alone, the permissible expenditure of a political party would be substantially less. It would be based on 1.5c for every person enrolled for the State or States contested by the party; that is to say, an amount of $ 116,578 on present enrolment for a party contesting the Senate election in all States.",52,Hours Of Meeting
203,Mr Daly (Grayndler,"Minister for ServicesIn the case of a referendum, the formula provides for a limit of expenditure of a political party based on lc for every person enrolled; that is to say, an amount of $77,718. Details of the formula in relation to conjoint Senate and House of Representatives elections are included in the Bill. The limits of expenditure presently imposed on candidates are also being varied. For the election of a senator the proposed limit is an amount of 0.2c for every elector enrolled for the State concerned, or $3,000, whichever is the greater. For an election of a member of the House of Representatives, the proposed limit is an amount equal to 5c for every elector enrolled for the division contested; that is to say, $3,250 in respect of a division comprising 65 000 electors, or $2,500 in respect of a division comprising 50 000 electors. Having regard to the importance of enforcing the observance of the proposed new expenditure provisions, the Bill prescribes penalties up to $10,000 in certain cases and up to $20,000 in other cases. Honourable members will note from the foregoing summary of the principal provisions, that this Bill seeks to lay down comprehensive provisions relating to the limitation not merely of expenditure by candidates, but also of aggregate expenditure by poUtical parties sponsoring those candidates. At the present time the provisions in the Act relating to maximum permissible expenditure by individual candidates are outmoded and unrealistic, and moreover the Act does not presendy limit expenditure by parties. This BUI seeks to rectify this anomalous situation. For the purpose of effectively controlling electoral expenditure by poUtical parties and individual candidates, including candidates not sponsored by a party, the BUPs provisions reflect a general reaUsation that unrealistically restrictive Umits on expenditure should not be imposed or be permitted to continue to exist. On the other hand, uncontrolled or undivulged expenditure opens the way to serious abuses of the electoral processes. As an indication of the kind of money that candidates are prepared to spend in an election campaign, let me quote from an article in the 'IUawarra Mercury' dated 14 January 1975. The article is headed 'LIBERAL PLANS $40,000 A Campbelltown solicitor plans a $40,000 campaign to win Macarthur for the Liberals at the next Federal election. The campaign includes $ 14,500 to be spent on press, radio and television advertising. About $3,000 would be spent on publication of an election newspaper. Under the existing electoral law and procedures there is no limitation or control on the expenditure by political parties and, whUe there are statutory limits on expenditure by candidates, the current provisions are quite ineffective. All honourable members would know that at the presenttimevery substantial donations are being made with the purpose of financing campaign expenditure by candidates and parties without disclosure of the sources of such donations. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. whereunder no adequate account is taken of expenditure by parties, and the artifically low Umits imposed upon electoral expenditure by individual candidates, are entirely unsatisfactory. The existing law stipulates that electoral expenditure by a candidate may not exceed $500 in a House of Representatives election or $ 1,000 in a Senate election. The existing law also requires all candidates to file a return of their electoral expenses within 8 weeks after the declaration of the poU. Yet, as honourable members well know, this requirement is generally ignored. In the electoral expenses field, unenforceable, unrealistic law is bad law. Most candidates, from whatever party, wish to observe the law in this respect, but they and the public they serve deserve a law which is reahstic, clear-cut and enforceable. Tbis proposed legislation follows an examination of the methods adopted in other democratic countries which have taken steps to reform their electoral procedures in these areas. Particular attention has been given to the experiences of the United States and Canada and in essence this BUI demonstrates the Government's wUlingness to benefit from recent legislative advances made by other countries in this field. The Government is, of course, particularly mindful of those happenings in the United States which have been characterised coUectively as the 'Watergate affair'. Under the USA. Federal Election Campaign Act 1971, laws requiring strictfinancialreporting of sources of campaign funds took effect on and from 7 April 1972. In Canada, the Electoral Expenses Act passed by the House of Commons on 3 January 1974 was welcomed by aU major political parties. This legislation contained provisions for the disclosure of the names and addresses of all donors contributing more than $100. Also a limit is placed on the expenditure of candidates and poUtical parties. Spending by national parties is restricted to 30c for every eUgible voter. A party exceeding this expenditure is liable to a substantial fine.",53,Electoral Bill 1974
204,Mr Daly,"The anomalous situationThe Canadian legislation also contains provisions restricting individual candidates' expenditure. Where appropriate the Canadian approach has been taken as a useful guide in the preparation of our legislation. Up to the present Australia has been most fortunate in that it has not suffered any serious electoral malpractices or 'Watergates' and as Australians we tend to pride ourselves in this regard. Nevertheless, there is a real need for legislation of the kind now proposed by this Bill, not only to keep our electoral system 'honest' but also to ensure that all candidates and political parties, irrespective of their financial standing, have a fair and equitable opportunity of being represented in this Parliament. Reports that multinational corporations and other powerful organisations have been making substantial contributions to political party campaign funds in Australia highlight the need for urgent remedial legislation in this area. The Government considers it vital that this proposed legislation, which will form a basis for the regulation of the conduct of future electoral campaigns, be placed on the statute book. The expenditure by political parties and candidates at the 1974 Senate and House of Representatives elections on broadcasting and televising time on commercial stations alone was in the nature of $ 1.5m and in this connection I quote from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board's 26th annual report on its operations during the year ended 30 June 1974. Paragraphs 181,182,190 and 191 read, in part, as follows: 181. Apart from policy speeches, S13 hours 33 minutes of station time were purchased at a cost of $301,154 for broadcasts of political matter on behalf of parties and candidates. 182. The total time occupied by broadcasting of political matter on commercial broadcasting stations during the election period amounted to 683 hours 45 minutes and the charges for thattimewere $316,739. 190. Apart from the policy speeches, 123 hours 48 minutes of stationtimewas purchased for a cost of $1,175,464 for the televising of political matter on behalf of parties and candidates. 191. The total time occupied by telecasts of political matter on commercial television stations and charges during the election period amounted to 196 hours and $ 1,334,680 respectively. In several overseas countries the burden of the cost of broadcasting and televising is partly met from the public purse and it is intended that the Government will give some consideration to this aspect before the next elections. I mentioned earlier that lawsrequiringstrict financial reporting in the United States took effect on and from 7 April 1972. Honourable members may be interested to know that it was reported in the Congressional Quarterly of 6 October 1973 that fund raisers for the 1972 Nixon campaign raised $ 19.7m before that date, the amounts being collected from contributors who believed their names would never be made public. According to the report, the records revealed that the 1972 Nixon campaign effort raised a record total of $60.2m.

A comprehensive explanatory memorandum was circulated at that time, thus providing ample opportunity for all members of Parliament to examine closely the proposed new measures and to be able to express constructive and considered views on these measures when the Bill was at the second reading stage. I would at this stage foreshadow an amendment by the Government requiring the disclosure of giftsincluding donations-onl y where such gifts, etc. exceed $100 in the aggregate, made by or on behalf of the same person in the one year. As every member of this House would know, the existing provisions relating to electoral expenditure are farcical and, in some respects, have come to be treated with contempt. How ridiculous is the situation when a serious contender for a House of Representatives seat is allowed only $500 to cover advertising, broadcasting and television, publishing and issuing posters and 'how-to-vote' cards, telephones and telegrams, committee rooms, places for public meetings and scrutineers. In the case of a senator the limit is $ 1,000. Yet this is the import of the law as it stands. The previous government was aware of this ridiculous situation and its attitude was revealed in a Bill introduced in 1971 by the then Minister for the Interior which, in effect, proposed that limitations on electoral expenditure be abandoned. The Government does not support this 'open gate' approach. Rather, it considers that the time is long overdue to restructure the expenditure provisions into sensiall Australians.

In the early hours of Christmas morninga time when children throughout the world are thinking in their sleep of a fatherly visit from Santa Clausa cyclone code named Tracy ripped through Darwin and the surrounding areas. That cyclone brought death, injury, devastation and heartbreak. It affected every citizen of the Northern Territory, every Australian. It affected friends overseas who, with every Australian, joined together in an outstanding effort to bring relief and assistance to the people of Darwin. The finest, highest attribute of mankind and womankind is their nobility. It is that nobility which enhances all other human values. In Darwin, throughout Australia and elsewhere, the men and women who got together to help, whether it was a child in Hobart breaking into his piggy bank so that he could give or an age pensioner on the devastated streets of Darwin consoling the shocked and dressing the wounds of the injured, took human nobility to its highest level. The City of Darwin and the surrounding area, which I have the honour to represent in this Parliament, survived in the aftermath of cyclone Tracy because thefinestof the fine of the citizens of Darwin and the citizens of Australia immediately got together and helped. That help fuelled a spirit which will never waver, a spirit that is summed up in the answer to the rhetorical question in the Bible: 'AmI my brother's keeper?' It is also summed up in the statement of a relief worker who, when asked why he volunteered for Darwin, replied: 'We must do all we can to help. 'It is summed up in the statement of the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) and of the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson): 'Darwin will be rebuilt.' Darwin has always held a special interest for munity. It is our only population centre which has suffered direct, sustained military onslaught.",55,Extract From The Congressional Quarterly Inc Of 6 October 1973

207,"203,000 Mr Calder (Northern Territory) (2.23)","Isignificance. Darwin is a city of which all Australians can be proud. By many AustraUans at the end of the war it was regarded as a frontier town. On Christmas Eve 1974 is was a thriving city offering good amenities to its citizens, beauty in its setting and a sense of identification that Darwin citizens were buUding Australians. On Christmas Day it was a city with its limbs badly broken but its heart still pounding strongly, fiercely and proudly. A city is not only a collection of buildings. It is a place for people where they can Uve and raise their cluldren, study, work and enjoy their leisure. The people of Darwin from Chistmas morning onwards to this date have been mangificent during the hours of their greatest need. They have faced great adversity in the past and, as they rebuUd the city, more adversity. All of us here, irrespective of our party political affiliation, wUl do all we can to reUeve that adversity. At this stage I would like to thank the people of Darwin for the co-operation and the help that they have given to each other. In relation to the people of DarwinI would like firstly to thank the chUdren. Throughout the devastating hours of Christmas morning when Santa Claus should have been calUng on them, the cluldren of Darwin remained calm and collected as they huddled with their parents whole their homes exploded around them. Those same chUdren remained calm and collected in the bewildering hours and days which foUowed, helping their parents and friends and never complaining. I would like now to digress and to thank the children of AustraUa who, on hearing of that disaster, gave up their toys and other Christmas presents so that the evacuated cluldren and the cluldren remaining in Darwin could have a Christmas which will be remembered by themtouched by horror but also by brotherhood. I would like also to thank the Darwin womenfolk who, with the men, displayed at alltimesgreat courage and perseverance. That courage was displayed in hundreds of ways, from taking steps to boost morale to cooking for hundreds instead of a few; from nursing a cluid to nursing many; fromfindingwater suppUes to rescuing people at great personalriskin coUapsed buddings. In Darwin everyone helped everyone else. lone took 49 Uves. Sixteen people are missing That is why Darwin survived. The spirit of Darfrom ships. To the bereavedfamUiesI know that win and its people is so great that it must survive. we aU would Uke to express our condolences. As In his speech the Minister for the Northern TerriAustralians we all share the loss of the bereaved tory referred to the people who deserve special famUies. Mr Acting Speaker, my thanks are not thanks. I wish to be associated with those confined to the people of Darwin. The people of remarks. I would Uke to thank in particular the AustraUa deserve special thanks. Unanimously people who without hesitation immediately went they helped whether by giving money, offering out and helped as the cyclone abated. accommodation, caring for evacuees or going to SpecificaUyI would like to thank the men and women of the Darwin Bureau of Meteorology who stayed at their posts as the cyclone intensified, plotting its course with a growing degree of certainty whUe their famines bravely faced the horror at home; the men and women of the Postmaster-General's Department who kept the communication Unes open as much as possible and then worked without rest to reopen them; the men and women of the radio and television stations who broadcast continuously advice on cyclone warnings and preparations and then, when the storm abated, immediately set about to restore broadcasting. In particular I would Uke to thank the amateur radio station operators who quickly established communications southwards; also the aircraft pilots who, using salvaged equipment, did the same. I would like to thank the men and women of the Northern Territory Police Force as weU as the civil defence workers who went out during the cyclone and again afterwards consoling the shocked, getting medical attention to the injured and comforting the bereaved; the men and women of the Darwin medical, paramedical and nursing professions and ambulance service who displayed at all times the highest dedication to duty, great compassion and efficiency in bringing kindly assistance to the injured and the sick; the men and women who worked at getting the public utilities such as water and electricity operating whenever possible, cleared the roads to allow the entry of rescue vehicles, checked homes for the trapped, the injured and the dead, organised themselves into working parties, helped in the distribution of food and necessary suppUes, such as medicine, and helped to organise evacuation; members of the religious profession who gave spiritual comfort; the airport and airline personnel who cleared the airport and rigged emergency flare paths. The men and women of the defence services-the Navy, the Army and the Air Forcewho whether on duty or off duty responded bravely to the crisis and displayed outstanding heroism in bringing practical assistance to their feUow Darwin citizens. Sadly, Mr Acting Speaker, I want now to turn to the human tragedy of cyclone Tracy. The cycDarwin. In expressing thanks to these people I would like to single out for special mention the Natural Disasters Organisation and its Director, Major-General Stretton. The organisation, confronted by its first major challenge, responded quickly, positively and efficiently, bringing relief efforts to a peak in a co-ordinated method of organising the rebuilding of the city of fashion which did so much to relieve distress. I would like to thank voluntary aid organisations such as Red Cross, St Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army, the Smith Family and the Australian Council of Social Service, which collected through too quickly without allowing it to be needed goods and arranged their despatching, cared for evacuees and are still caringforthem; government personnel in every area of endeavour from social workers to government carpenters, from PMG telephonists to information officers, from hotel administrators to drivers; the this debate but I wish, as the member for the medical and nursing profession who in the cities and towns to which evacuated people were brought worked unceasingly, as did their colleagues who went to Darwin, enhancing their already high reputation; the police forces who strove successfully to co-ordinate the movements of evacuees and in particular those members of the police forces who went to Darwin where they undertook hazardous tasks. I would also like to mention the defence serquarters, will be aware of those objections and I vices. HereI must pause and single out for would suggest respectfully to the Minister, who special mention the Royal Australian Air Force has the welfare of the Northen Territory at heart, aircrews and maintenance staff who kept their that upon reflection the validity of the points planes flying continuously; the RAAF medical made by the Opposition in this debate, as well as teams who did not falter in their duties; the Navy the objections put forward, should meet with disaster force which hurriedly assembled for Government acceptance and would make this a duty, brought needed supplies and swung better Bill. immediately into action bringing urgently needed assistance and undertaking unpleasant tasks often duringtimesof supplementary volunwishfirstto draw the attention of the House to teered duty; the Army which currendy is underclause 3-the interpretation clause-and the taking a similar task as that of the Navy in the interpretation of the term 'Darwin area', which same spirit of commitment; the journalists who is defined as a distance of 60 kilometres from the reported objectively the situation that Darwin Darwin Post Office.

The Opposition supports the setting up of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission as the best Darwin. It is grateful for the activities so far of the Interim Commission. However, I must stress that the Opposition is concerned that the Government wants to push this legislation considered in greater depth. This is because this Bill is of great national significance. There are aspects of it which concern us and which, on reflection, should concern the Government. The areas of concern will be carefully emphasised in Northern Territory, to canvass them in a non-political manner. I hope as I do this that the attention of the Government will focus itself on these objections. The objections I make here, have the great support of many people from Darwin living in Darwin and of Darwin citizens living outside that city. Those objections have arisen in the last 24 hours or so since this Bill was introduced into this Parliament. The Government, in certain I turn now to specific parts of the Bill and I 'to assist the Australian Government in determining the desirable extent, nature and purposes of the use and development of the Darwin area', the phrase 'desirable extent' is confusing. It can be interpreted as meaning that the Government and the Commission alone will determine the desirable extent of development. If that is the case, I believe that clause 6 (a) could be reworded and the following phrase added: 'bearing in mind the wishes of the Darwin community'. The Opposidon favours the insertion after clause 6 of a new clause which would set up an appeals tribunal to which parties affected by decisions of Australia and the Commission could appeal. Such an appeals tribunal I envisage would not necessarily hamper the Commission. It could ensure that justice would be available to parties affected by decision of the Government and the Commission. I would further envisage that the proceedings of the appeals tribunal would be relatively informal, that parties appearing before the tribunal would be eligible to representational aid at Government expense and that decisions of the tribunal would be binding on the Commission. However, there would be a right of further appeal to courts for all parties. In relation to clause 8 (3), I would like to raise the question of whether the Commission should determine the nature and extent of public investment. Surely that is a function of this Parhament and our colleagues who are members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. In relation to private investment, there could be excessive controls and there has been no indication that the Commission will be a reservoir of economic talent. I want the Government to spell out in detail its views on that clause. So far there has been no mention of the clause in the speech. I fear that clause 13 is too wide. Clause 13(1) states that 'any land in the Territory' belonging to Australia may be placed under the control of the Commission. This could be land throughout the Territory. The Minister must fully explain this sub-clause. I believe the Commission's land requirements should be confined to the Darwin area. Turning to clause 61 (1) of the Bill, I would make the same point. The regulation-making powers of the BUI should be confined to the prescribed Darwin area. With respect to clause 14,1 am of the opinion tween the private and Public Service members of that sub-clause (4) should be redrawn and the the Commission, facing constant lobbying pressprovision ended at the word 'section'. The ures and at times having execessive influence. 1 reason I make this point is that I believe that also believeI refer to clause 28-that the locally developed building ordinances, reviewed General Manager of the Commission should be in the Ught of the cyclone, and other knowledge appointed by the Commission. drawn up by the Corporation of the City of Darwin and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly should be appUed. Such a course I believe would be desirable. It would not prevent the Commission from making suggestions on buUding codes. Clause 14(5) would, of course, become redundant. In relation to clause 14 (6), there is a need for redrafting in order to ensure that Northern Territory legislation should not be overridden. I think that the Minister would see the wisdom of this suggestion. I turn now to clause 16, which refers to the Commission having the right to remove occupants by oral direction or to prohibit the entry of citizens into Darwin area premises. This provision raises the very important question of the subjective assessment of Commission officers as to whether premises are 'unfit for occupation'. I believe that this entire clause needs to be withdrawn, redrafted and resubmitted. Personally I beUeve that when a person is ordered to leave a building which he is occupying, the reasons for that order should be stated at the time of the order in writing. I believe that as a result of this clause there should be a right of appeal to the appeals tribunal which I have already mentioned and that possibly the Darwin Citizens Council could be given an ombudsman role in relation to orders made under this clause. I turn to Part III of the BUI, which deals with the constitution and meetings of the Commission. Before discussing the constitution of the Commission, I would Uke to draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that throughout Australia in the past week, there have been meetings of Darwin citizens, where the following resolution has been carried: That the Government be asked to amend upcoming legislation, giving overriding powers to the Reconstruction Commission and the Reconstruction Commission be restructured to give Darwin people more representation and therightto consult at all stages with the Darwin Citizens Council. I strongly beUeve that the membership of the Commission should include more representatives of the community of Darwin-a t least a member of the Darwin Citizens CouncU. I strongly believe also that the General Manager of the Commission should be a non-voting member of-the Executive. Otherwise he will constandy become the meat in the sandwich beIn relation to clause 22, it seems to me to be impracticable for the Minister to have the power to approve the appointment of a person to be the deputy of a member, if members of the Commission desire to have a meeting at short notice and an absent member wishes to be represented by means of a deputy. In relation to clause 27 (4) I believe that the quorum for meetings of the Commission should be five, and that a clause should be inserted requiring all members to be notified of forthcorning meetings. Referring to clause 36(1)1 believe provision should be made for members of the Northern Territory Public Service to participate in assisting the Commission and that the majority leader of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly also should have the right to participate in assistpowers of the legislation, which are contained in ance. I would like to state that within the envisaged 5 year period of the Commission's operation, there should be a considerable transfer of powers to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in line with the report of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. I would suggest that Northern Territory public servants should be required to play important roles in the functioning of the Commission. Turning to clause 45,1 would like to express my concern at the limitation of members of the Darwin Citizens Council to Northern Territory electors. As things stand at present, 2 members of the interim council are not electors but they postory Legislative Assembly still holds. However, sess talents useful in the functioning of the Counthe wilful misuse of paragraph (b) could mean cil. I believe the Commission should have the right to appoint its own committees as necessary, either from within its membership or from the ranks of the Darwin community. In relation to clause 51 (3), I believe that the procedure of adorder and good government of the Territory. I visory committees should not be subject to any direction by the Minister but be determined by that committee and I believe the direction powers of the Minister should be deleted. In relawhich I earlier spoke. I believe that the clause tion to clause 52 (1), I believe the Citizens Councould be redrawn in a form which would ask but cil should have the right, the same right as the Reconstruction Commission is given, to engage consultants. In relation to clause 53, I believe the clause should be ended at the date given-namel y 23 December 1974-and that there be inserted the words 'unimproved value' or 'fair form of valuation'. The purpose of this suggestion is to tidy up loose wording in this phrase and to ensure that people who possess land in Darwin will know that they will receive nothing less than the unimproved capital valued of their land as at 23 December 1974. As the clause stands at present, it could be argued that they could receive less. I believe sub-clause 2 of clause 53, referring to the application of the Lands Acquisition Act should be deleted so that the Lands Acquisition Act 1955-1973 in relation to the acquisition of land in the Darwin area should continue to operate and people who own land within the area will know where they stand in respect to acquisition. In relation to clause 55 which allows the nonapplication of the Town Planning Ordinance of the Territory, I believe the Government should reconsider its attitude. This type of legislation is common to any democracy and I believe it should be retained so that the town planning program can be developed by the elected representatives of the people of the Territory. I want now to turn to the regulation making clause 61. The width of these powers as prescribed in this Bill, could set back the progress of Darwin politically for as least 5 years. In discussing this clause, I want to remind the Minister that when he introduced the Northern Territory Administration Bill on 17 July 1974, he said that 'when the new Assembly takes office, discussions will be held with members of that body, concerning the future government of the Northern Territory'. Clause 61, particularly paragraph (b), gives the Government power which could result in the shrinkage of the rightful role to make laws for the order and good government of the Territory. That responsibility for the Northern Territhat the democratic elected rights of the people of the Northern Territory, in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, could see themselves without any responsibility to make laws for the believe that this clause must be reviewed and redrawn. Democracy is paramount in our society. To deny democracy is to deny the spirit of not instruct the Legislative Assembly to reconsider the appropriateness of a Territory law in view of the Commission's functions and activities and recommend that the Territory consider either repeal or amendment, so as to help the Commission but in no way impinging on the democratic rights of the people of the Northern Territory. Clause 61(1) (b) as it stands should be deleted and with its deletion sub-clause 2 of clause 61 should follow the same course. The Commission will have the co-operation of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I see no reason why the legislation making powers of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly should be made subservient to the Commission. Mr Speaker, I have attempted in this speech to thank the people of Australia. Words will not express the great and deep thanks that we of the Territory have for the people who helped us, but at least we can try and I would like to assure them that Darwin will be rebuilt. The people of Darwin made that commitment early in the hours of Christmas morning and that commitment has been strengthened by the support of every member of this House. I , in particular, would like in closing to thank the Minister for the Northern Territory for the outstanding work he has so far done in helping Darwin through its hours of greatest need. I would also like to stress to him that I seriously urge upon him the validity of the points I have made in relation to this Bill. The Opposition seeks not to quibble. We seek to make this Bill a better Bill than it is. We seek to preserve the democratic rights of the citizens who will be affected by the operations of this Bill. Consequently I urge upon the Minister seriously to consider the objections I have made to this Bill. Not to do so would be to bring into law an Act with obvious shortcomings-shortcoming s which could make the task of rebuilding Darwin even harder than it will be. In conclusion, I would ask the Minister in the be seen to be believed. I have seen disasters beoperation of this legislation to give the fullest fore but I have never witnessed the like of that in consideration and approval wherever possible to Darwin soon after that disaster struck. In a quite involve members of the Darwin community in literal sense it was a shocking experience.

This Bill will provide the introduced this Bill into the House. In the ordinary course of events legislation relating to the establishment of growth centres or the setting up of such organisations as the Darwin Reconstruction Commission would be my responsibility as the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. However, because of the special circumstances in Darwin and also in recognition of the special interests and responsibilities of the Minister for the Northern Territory we in Cabinet considered that the proposed Darwin Reconstruction Commission should be responsible to the Minister for the Northern Territory. The Darwin Reconstruction Bill should be seen as fundamental to the orderly restoration of a normal way of life for the citizens of Darwin. The Government has committed itself to rebuild the city of Darwin as a matter of national priority. As all honourable members will be aware, the cyclone which struck Darwin in the early hours of Christmas morning largely demolished the city. The problems this has raised, both of an immediate kind and for the future, are enormous. I joined my colleague the Minister for the Northern Territory in Darwin soon after the disaster had struck.

208,Mr Uren (Reid,"Minister for Urban and peopleGovernment with the mechanisms by which we can build the city to meet the needs of the people. establishment of a Darwin citizens council. This The Bill formally establishes the Darwin Reconstruction Commission as the body responsible -for the reconstruction, planning and development of the city of Darwin. The Commission will consist of 7 members to be appointed by the Government. There is a provision for two of those members to be drawn from the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and from the Corporation of the City of Darwin respectively.The Commission will have the authority necessary for it to effectively perform its functions of reconstruction, planning and development of the city of Darwin. On all major issues of planning and development policy the Commission will be required to seek the approval of the Minister for the Northern Territory. MightI stress that this arrangement under which authority is being given to the Minister for the Northwant open and honest discussion by the people ern Territory is no different from that given in relation to the development of Albury Wodonga, the development of Geelong or the development of any other major growth centre. Even here in Canberra that situation exists. The Minister for the Northern Territory will consult with me as is appropriate on all these matters. We will also involve the people before major decisions are made. It will be clear to honourable members that a task of this kind involves the interests of a number of governmental agencies and other bodies, including local representatives. The necessary co-ordination in reconstruction should not be left to a committee arrangement, as some people want. Our experience here in Canberra with the National Capital Development Commission demonstrates the virtues of a single development authority. I was disappointed in the speech made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. So many of his Country Party colleagues have been Ministers responsible for the National Capital Development Commission and he should realise what is required if a development authority such as that which we are setting up is to really carry out the functions that we in this national Parliaoutline their views clearly because they differ ment are giving it. We have followed this principle in Albury-Wodonga; it has been followed here in Canberra. We need in Darwin a single planning and development body with the necessary authority to co-ordinate and to plan in a rational and coherent way. While it is true that the urgency and magnitude of the task requires a strong executive body, we should not be distracted from the basic principles of community involvement and people's participation in the process of reconstruction and restoration. Part VII of the Bill provides for the Council shall consist of up to 20 members. It will advise the Commission on any matters likely to affect the interests of the people who are now, or become, residents of Darwin. Clause 45 of the Bill outlines the procedure which shall be followed for the appointment of members to the Council. The Commission shall publish advertisements in the newspapers inviting nominations from people and setting out the way in which nominations may be made. I should point out that the advertisements will appear in newspapers not only in the Darwin area but in each of the capital cities of the States. The Council will be provided with accommodation, secretarial back-up and other assistance which is necessary for the proper conduct of its business. Normally, the Council will meet in public. We on this body. The Council will advise the Commission and provide reports to the Commission on its meetings. The Commission will transmit those reports to the Minister. I want to make clear that the need for the participation of the people at all stages of the planning work is of particular concern to me and to the Australian Government. When I speak of the people I mean the present Darwin community, Darwin evacuees and organisations and individuals who may be interested in Darwin. As I have said, the need for a strong executive authority in Darwin to face the challenge of rebuilding this city should be obvious, but we must not override the people's interests and the people's involvement in that task. The city is being rebuilt for them, the people of Darwin. Through dialogue with the people we will build a city of human dimensions. In addition to the Darwin Citizens Council the Minister may establish committees to give advice to the Commission. There have been reports already of the feelings of women about the reconstruction and planning of this city. I have had dialogue with some of them. Their approach is a sensible one. I want to from those of the honourable member for the Northern Territory who seems to think that Darwin was good enough as it was and that is how it should be again. The women of Darwin say that they want a different Darwin. We must correct the mistakes that were made in Darwin in the past. Briefly, their view is that old Darwin was basically a city which was bent to the male population. They say that the new Darwin should bring equal opportunities for all. I have no doubt that when the Minister chooses the Citizens Council the interests of women will be fully represented. This is in line with Government policy. There will be the closest consultation between the Minister for the Northern Territory and myself. We will be able to draw on the background and experience we have had in other places such as Canberra, Albury-Wodonga, Geelong, Bathurst-Orange and Monarto. I do not believe anyone could deny that mistakes have been made in the past in the building and planning of Darwin. I think one could say that is an understatement. In fact it is probably not too much to say that many of the problems of our large cities are being experienced on a smaller scale in Darwin. Already this sort of thing can be experienced when one goes to Darwin. We have seen in Darwin, just as in every major capital city, insurance companies operating on speculative values. They are constructing high rise buildings in the central business district. The Darwin central business district is located in probably one of the worse positions because it is on a peninsula. The motor car is used as the major form of transport in Darwin and, of course, everybody goes into the city in the morning and leaves the city in the evening. No city can be geared to a peak load system. Unlike those single-minded individuals opposite who comprised that negative government in the past and who for 23 years did not have any involvement at all in cities but just allowed the laissez faire development of all the major cities to occur-the same sort of thing happened in Darwin-thi s Government does involve itself in human communities in the cities, where 85 per cent of our people live. We want to ensure that the social, environmental and cultural facilities are given to all cities. They certainly will be given to the people of Darwin. The sprawling suburbia, the over-concentrathe city of Gladstone, which is a great example tion of office employment in one centre and the for every honourable member opposite to look problems of transportation were all apparent in at. old Darwin. The growth of Darwin over the last few years has been very rapid. Its population increased from 21 700 in 1966 to 37 000 in 1971 pointed out that Darwin would remain a major and then to 46 700 in 1974. One of the main centre for government activities in the Territory. forces creating this rapid growth has been the As a government we will re-establish Darwin, expansion of Australian Government employbut we must re-establish Darwin on firm foundament in the city. The Australian Government tions-physical, social and environmental. I employees numbered more than 8000 in June would not be surprised if a Darwin, rebuilt and 1974. They make up nearly half the citizen work properly planned, ultimately attracted a popuforce. We know from our experience in other citlation much greater than that which existed beies how difficult it is to cope with rapidly increasfore Cyclone Tracy. That is one of the options ing populations. For example, Canberra has which the Government must keep in mind. The grown by 13 000 people each year over the past Cities Commission, which is within my Ministry, 3 years. This has been a massive increase and it has prepared a document entitled 'Planning had fully stretched the resources of the planning Options for Future Darwin'. I tabled it in the machinery in Canberra. There are 2 reasons, therefore, why we must be careful about the way in which we rebuild the city of Darwin and the rate at which we commit ourselves to rebuilding it. The mistakes of the past in Darwin must not be repeated. We know that we would be lacking in foresight if we simply re-established the Australian Government workforce overnight. We cannot afford to prejudice the future through lack of foresight now or through hasty short term decisions. To say all this is not to ignore the very important need to re-unite families and to restore communities. We must make the best use of the buildings and services still intact in such a way that every opportunity is taken to provide employment and to improve the urban environment. I recognise that it must be difficult for some residents to hear that we cannot commit ourselves to rebuilding the city exactly as it was and in as short a time as possible. Naturally many people of Darwin would feel an attachment to their old city; they would want to return to it. But the Government would be irresponsible to commit itself to an immediate rebuilding of Darwin to the same population and to the same proportions as previously existed. The consequences of such a decision must be to bring major social problems to the people of Darwin. Experience elsewhere demonstrates that a too-rapid rate of growth leads not only to a lack of adequate services and amenities but also to social problems within families and within communities. For an example one only has to look at cities such as Gladstone in Queensland where the previous Government allowed fast growth and allowed social problems to be created. It did not help in any way at all to alleviate those problems. It was only when this Government came to power that we started to look at the real social problems of The Minister for the Northern Territory House yesterday. That report basically examines the options available in the reconstruction of the city. It recognises the need to get reconstruction under way as soon as possible. It recognises that the town must return to as close to normal functioning as is possible and that families must be re-united with a minimum of delay. The report has been put forward to seek community comment and involvement in the planning process. We distributed 10 000 copies of it to people not only in Darwin but also in other capital cities so that they could have the opportunity to put forward their points of view. That has never been done in the history of Australia by any government, let alone an Australian government. The report provides the basis for the preparation of a second and much more detailed document. I expect that document to be available next month. Public involvement will be sought again in the discussion of the alternative courses which may be pursued in planning for the future Darwin. Meetings are being held already in all State capital cities between officers cluttered up with the red tape that is characterofthe Cities Commission, the Department of the Northern Territory and Darwin citizens. They are chaired by Darwin citizens. More meetings will be held in the future. In this way the Government hopes not just to fulfil a commitment to public participation in planning but to gain the best advice before it takes major decisions. If we are to succeed in rebuilding Darwin we this Bill which states that this work should not must work in a spirit of co-operation. The wishes have to run the gamut of a Public Works Comand needs of the citizens must be fulfilled. The mittee inquiry.

I commend the Bill and I commend the actions taken by my colleague, the attempts of the honourable member for the Minister for the Northern Territory. began with the Minister for the Northern Terrion his part. I thought that the honourable memtory (Dr Patterson) paying a tribute to a great ber for the Northern Territory performed his many people involved in this Darwin tragedy. task splendidly. He has a sense of responsibility. That was followed by another eloquent tribute He knows that we must have a different machine by the honourable member for the Northern for the task and he was looking at the way it was Territory ( Mr Calder). He not only paid a tribute put together through this legislation, as indeed to the heroism and self-sacrifice by the people he ought to. concerned but also had the grace to pay a tribute to the Minister for the Northern Territory. I would like now to pay a tribute to the honourthem deals with the way this legislation has been able member for the Northern Territory. I pushed through. I would have liked moretimeto understand that some attempts have been made to besmirch his performance in Darwin. I heard rumours to that effect in this House yesterday. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has been careful not to tell me of his performance, but there are a great many people in Adelaide who have been glad to pay a tribute to the work done by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, and I think that that ought to be recognised. I am sorry to see that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) is leaving the chamber because I think it is important that he hear what I am about to say. I was sorry to hear the uncharacteristic meanness of his attack on the honourable member for the Northern Territory who carried out what I think would be a proper function of a member of the Opposition. He had a look at the legislation in detail. None of us will deny that we need a commission. No one is arguing about the necessity for some machine to tackle the task that is not going to be istic of governments in general and the Northern Territory Government in particular. No one is arguing about the need for a commission. I should like to make my position clear. For many years as a member of the Public Works Committee I visited Darwin and the Northern Territory continually. I agree with clause 54 of To hear the Minister picking on the worthy Northern Territory to have a critical look at the way the machine is put together through this I want to raise two or three questions.

209,Mr Kelly (Wakefield) (3.13),"This debate legislation is to detect uncharacteristic meannesslook at it. I would have particularly liked more time for more local involvement, the theme that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development has been so keen about in theory but which does not seem to be eventuating in practice. I am sorry that the Bill was rushed through. I resent the speeches made yesterday by the Leader of the House( Mr Daly) who pushed it through in what I would call the brutal manner of a commissar. I have the feeling that when the Leader of the House hears the prayers in the morning he has an idea that the word 'daily' in 'give us this day our daily bread' has no' i ' in it. I think he has delusions of grandeur and expects us to dance to his calling. This is the Minister who denied assistance to one of the young newly elected members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly who went to Adelaide to try to help the establishment of the rescue operations and to try to follow the refugees down the track, helping where he could. The honourable member for Angas( Mr it to them. Having given it to them, in a matter as Giles) quite properly offered him the facilities of his office. He received a telegram from the Minister for Services and Property saying that he could not use Commonwealth property in that way. The person who was trying to help the citizens could not get the kind of help that in every other case would be agreed to. ReallyI cannot understand what came over the Minister for Services and Property. He must have had a rush of blood to the head thinking that perhaps some advantage was to be gained because a political person was going to use someone's rooms at atimelike that. It is not worthy of the man. Mr Les Johnson-Get back on to the Bill, Bert. Bill. One of the points I want to raise which has worried me about this legislation is that there has not been that proper degree of consultation or local involvement that we hear so much about. I speak with some concern about this matter. Under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), who has been following the proceedings with his usual breathless interest, I served on a committee whose task it was to advise the Parliament as to the proper system of government for the Northern Territory. The Government formed and encouraged the development of self government there. It said: 'We will give the Northern Territory self government'. It arranged for an election to be held at the end of last year, and an election was held. Then the Government appointed the Committee on which I had the honour to serve. We had to advise the Government as to what system of government ought to work in the Northern Territory. We made many recommendations. One of them was that the problems of urban development should be a function of a local executive. It was a matter of balance. I am not for one minute suggesting that in atimeof crisis such as this the situation ought to be under the sole control of the local executive, but we did state something which ought to be borne in mind continually. We said: The Committee wishes to formally record and stress its view that without close and responsible co-operation between the National and Territory Executives, this brave experiment in self-government in the Northern Territory is doomed before it even takes the vow. This legislation has been drawn up, I understand, without any consultation or co-operation between the Federal Government and the newly elected Legislative Assembly. It is of no good for the Minister for Urban and Regional Development to lecture us about the need for co-operation and local involvement. The Government promised these people self government and gave vital as this the Government did not go to them and say: 'This is what we have in mind'. My understanding is that the elected members of the new Legislative Assembly have not been consulted about the legislation which will govern their Uves for 5 years. They have not been consulted. The plea of the Northern Territory Committee was a heartfelt one, that unless there was active involvement and consultation with the local people this brave exercise in self government would be doomed before it even took the vow. Yet in a case Uke this, when the Uves of the people in Darwin will be under the control of the Commission, in the drawing up of the legislation to control it the members of the new legislature were not consulted. This is not good enough. It is no good talking about involvement unless one reaUy means it. This is an important piece of legislation. It gives the Minister the most unique control. I do not say that he should not have this control, but I am saying that to take this action without consultation with the Legislative Assembly that the Government encouraged to be set up seems to make a mockery of the effort for local involvement. My plea to the Minister is that from now on there will be closer links not only between the various citizen bodies-thi s seems to be clear in the legislation-bu t also between the Legislative Assembly members themselves. Only one member of the Assembly is on the Commission. I would have thought it better to have more. I hope the Minister will give us a reason why there is only one. Co-operation is indeed sought. No-one wUl deny that to have a new Darwin",64,Extract From The Congressional Quarterly Inc Of 6 October 1973
210,Mr Kellyi Will Indeed Get Back On To The,"there has to be a new spirit as well. There has to be a greater sense of co-operation than there has ever been, particularly when the people of Darwin will have their own self-government and a greater degree of responsibility. There must be a greater effort to have consultation not only with the citizens in general, but also particularly with the members of the newly-elected Legislative Assembly. I do not oppose the Bill in detail and I will not have been paid to him from both sides of the criticise it with the expert eye and responsible manner of the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I should have liked to have had a greater time to consider the Bill. I am anxious to get the considered opinion of the citizens of Darwin and particularly the members of the Legislative Assembly on this new machine that wDl govern them. They perhaps could make suggestions for its improvement. To suggest, as the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) has done, that because we are critical of some aspects of the Bill we are trying to tended, that should be the case. He does not rewrite it, is nonsense. There is no legislation designed by humans, and I presume Ministers would reluctantly admit to the soft impeachment that they too are humans, that is not likely to have faults in it and which could not be made better. The honourable member for the Northern Territory did his task in spelling out how it could be made even better but the Minister for Urban and Regional Development criticised him for, as the Minister put it, trying to rewrite the Bill. I hope that when the Minister for the Northern Territory replies he will show a greater degree of generosity and statesmanship than did his colleague. Housing and Construction) (3.28)I listened with interest to the honourable gentleman who proceeded me. Wakefield. popularising an opponent's name unnecessarily. In respect of most of the things that the honourable member said I find myself in considerable agreement. In saying this I feel I am right in conOf course that can bring about the need to retending that this also is the view of my colleagues who preceded me-the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) who introduced this Bill into the House and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren). Of course the Government acknowledges the need for democratic processes. So much happened to the people of Darwin that if one wanted to deal s fatai blow it would be to iuke awayihe-rser.se of citizenship and their right to participation and involvement. We believe that there is a basic need for the most intensive relating experience that it is possible to contrive in a situation of this kind. Of course the Minister has made provision for that kind of process in this Bill, which I support. The Minister is deserving of the tributes that House. He is a man who has risen to the occasion, and I believe that his determination to resist these overtures to delay this measure will restore the confidence of the people of Darwin who realise the necessity of the Reconstruction Commission getting on with the job with all the legality that it requires. Sometimes in crisis situations there has to be some oiling of the machines and operations have to be streamlined. Of course that is the role of the Commission. As the honourable member who preceded me conwant a bumbling bureaucratic organisation that will delay and frustrate. I agree with him and that is precisely the kind of reason that motivated the establishment of this new Reconstruction Commission. A lot of new things will have to be done in Darwin; there is a lot wrong with Darwin. Honourable members who have visited Darwin with the frequency of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly), the Minister for the Northern Territory and I would readily know that it has grown over the years. While it has a great deal to commend it and so many of its characteristics appeal to the people who live in Darwin, there are so many better things that can be done now that this opportunity has presented itself following cyclone Tracy. There is the whole question of re-arranging and replanning. There is the question of land use. We know that it is the view of many people that the locations of the airport and the defence establishments leave a lot to be desired. If a better city is wanted the opportunity to re-arrange things should be taken. arrange existing residential development. If these things are to be done, it is important that very effective weapons are at one's disposal to overcome the bureaucratic processes that often contribute to delaying matters of this kind. I say unequivocally that my concern in Darwin, as primary as the responsibilities I have in regard to housing and reconstruction matters, is to ensure that oeniocfadc rather than demagogic processes",65,Extract From The Congressional Quarterly Inc Of 6 October 1973

213,Mr Les Johnson,"I rarely make a point ofcome to bear. I for one, together with the Minister who introduced the Bill, will be watching these processes emerge. In the 7 weeks since the devastation of Darwin by one of the most severe cyclones in recorded history the Government has demonstrated its capacity to effectively help the victims and to ensure that they suffer as little as possible from the consequences of this tragedy. This Bill is the outcome of some of the major decisions taken in this short period of time. Its introduction in the first autumn sitting is indicative of the top priority the Government places on the reconstruction of Darwin, This Bill is the expression of the Government's firm commitment to the people of Darwin, which is given without any equivocation or ambiguity. The Government intends that Darwin be rebuilt as quickly as possible. In order to both co-ordinate and direct this mammoth task, it is necessary to create this flexible, temporary organisation capable of translating the wishes and needs of the residents into the concrete form of a new, better city. Urgency is the keynote of the reconstruction program, for without a rapid regrowth many of the former residents in both business, the work force and in the Public Service will continue to suffer both financially and emotionally. The city of Darwin, when all is said and done, carried out by the Darwin citizens, by the officers was home to almost 50 000 Australians.

There was the need to evolve a new building code to take into account higher wind velocities-15 0 miles per hour plus-the desirability of providing a better urban environment, the uncertainties about the population to be catered for, the difficulties of land ownership and many others. But the prime consideration had to be the sociological problems of re-housing a population which had suffered severe shock and which was now scattered around Australia. However, faced with a challenge more immense than anything in our peacetime history, the work of restoration has been amazing. The rate of opening up of roads, re-establishment of services, roofing of houses and general clean-up has far exceeded expectations. For this magnificent effort we can well be proud of the work This program covered work from 25 bution problems, mobile generators were used to were beaten primarily because of assistance from the Defence Services. Cabinet also agreed that 1000 houses be made weatherproof. By 29 January almost 1600 houses had been reroofed. Commonwealth Hostels Ltd, also part of my responsibility, played a major role in accommodating and feeding many of the homeless in Darwin. In addition to the Esplanade, Ross Smith and Arafura Hostels, Commonwealth Hostels took over the management of several motels, school emergency centres and now will be managing the accommodation in the liner 'Patris', nor was the company's action confined to Darwin. A total 5,079 evacuees were accommodated in Commonwealth Hostels throughout Australia. As we know selfless generosity of individuals and welfare organisations all over Australia was overwhelming. From this brief outline it is obvious that the Government's action was prompt and effective. While the emergency restoration went ahead, detailed investigations were made and long-term proposals drawn up of a provisional nature, it is true. The first released was the report of the Citpeople in Darwin. We are saying to them: 'Here ies Commission, 'Planning Guidelines for Future Darwin'. This report frankly discussed some of the possible planning strategies for redevelopment. Many of these strategies are highly contentious, and because of this 10 000 copies of the report are being circulated in order that the citilegislation-som e of them by the Reconstruction zens of Darwin can participate in deciding the future of their city. The opportunity for the local population to particpate in the planning and decision making of the Commission is protected in this Bill by both clause 18 and by Part VII. Clause 18 provides for a Commission consisting of 7 members, one of whom is nominated by the Legislative Assembly for the Territory, another by the corporation of the city of Darwin. The honourable member for Wakefield spoke any matter likely to affect the interests of about the need to consult with the Legislative residents. In addition, this body will play an Assembly. But I suppose the question concerns important role in keeping the citizens advised of the means by wbich this should be done. I am the activities of the Commission. The Council's sure the honourable gentleman acknowledges views will be heeded, because of the safeguard of the processes of delegated authority. When it is representation within the Commission.

These any need for apology on the part of the Minister experts were sent to Darwin to examine the for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory for his incorporation of that well-established process in this Bill. We are looking for the streamlined arrangements that the honourable gendeman talked about. No doubt the Darwin City Corporation and the Legislative Assembly will thrash our from time to time their attitude in a corporate sense and will formulate their views and, as problems evolve fromtimeto time, they will be effectively represented in the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. I add to that the important consideration, from the standpoint of community participation, that one of the most significant documents produced contains the basic proposals-that is what they are-concerning the re-development of Darwin. This publication of the Cities Commission is being produced in massive numbers. Its first edition is 10 000 copies. Doubtless, if more are needed they will be made available. These copies are being distributed virtually in a catalystic form. We are not dropping these pamphlets from great heights on subordinate is something which will encourage and stimulate your thinking and your conceptual approach to what your city ought to be like in the future'. After that, many committees will be established, as is set out and provided for in clause 51 of this Commission-to enable the voice of the people to ring out effectively in the decision-taking corridors and places of power, if you like. I think the situation required that sort of emphasis. A Darwin Citizens Council composed of a representative group of 20 members also is to be formed. Part VII of"" the Bill outlines the role of this Council but it can be briefly summarised as giving advice to the Commission in relation to impact of the cyclone on design, building planning and landscape. Incidentally, the effect of cyclone Tracy on the buildings and structures in Darwin can be best appreciated when one realises that the wind pressure is directly related to the square of the velocity. For example, the pressure from a wind of 290 kilometers or 180 mph is 9timesthat of 96 kilometres or 60 mph. Under these forces the magnitude of devastation can be better understood. This special study group also prepared a report which put several well-documented recommendations on the rebuilding program to the Interim Reconstruction Commission. A particularly important contribution by this group was the preparation of a draft building code for the Darwin area. It recommends that the Australian Model Uniform Building Code be adopted, with the inclusion of special engineering provisions, so that housing and major community facilities can be made safer. The recommended draft code specifies that a design wind velocity of 60 metres per secondabout 160 mph-be adopted for housing, with some variations for degree of exposure. The draft code also isolates specific parts of buildings or construction techniques which should be closely supervised and recommends that all structures be designed by a chartered structural engineer. The cost of that can be Umited by 'deemed to comply' clauses in the code. The most important recommendation in the draft code is the suggestion that each house contain a refuge shelter which is designed to resist the effect of wind loading and flying debris and which is capable of protecting the occupants in the event of any collapse of the surrounding structure. It is intended that this be part of the normal dwelling, such as a bathroom or laundry, and that it be designed specifically for these more severe load conditions. WhUst this draft buUding code is not yet mandatory, many people are anxious to pay regard to it. Therefore, to help the pubUc, I have set up within my Department's. Darwin office a building information group which is explaining the draft code in detail and telling people what designing for a cyclone entaUs. In addition, a team of architects and structural engineers is visiting individual homes and providing technical advice to the residents. The reconstruction of Darwin is the most word of complaint. My goodness, if ever there important individual construction and planning was room for at least some anguish it existed in project facing the Australian Government in the Darwin at thattime.We saw a remarkable exhinext 5 years. Through the estabUshment of the bition of not only endurance but also typical Darwin Reconstruction Commission, the hopes AustraUan reaction to adversity. I cannot put this and aspirations of the Darwin people for a safe disaster in any particular category because there and happy future can and wiU be realised. My is just no precedent for it. One senior pilot who coUeagues and I look forward to working cooperatively and objectively so that these hopes and aspirations can be fulfilled in the shortest possible time. opinion that when this matter came before the House for discussion it would be more a matter of the pooling of ideas-a n operation of cooperation-tha n a debate in the sense in which we understand the word 'debate' in this House. I think that that view has persisted with all speakers except, unfortunately, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren). I commence my remarks by paying a very profound tribute to 2 people. The first is my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) who, quite obviously, merely carried on in the tradition that he has buUt up in the area over a period of 30 to 40 years in his deep concern for all that happened on that Christmas Eve in Darwin. The second person to whom I pay a tribute is the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson). He wasted no time in getting to Darwin. I arrived in Darwin on the morning of or at mid-day on Boxing Day. He had been there overnight. So he was there just as fast as he could possible get there. We then estabUshed the foundations that led me to believe that this would be, I repeat, an operation of co-operation rather than the usual sort of debate. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden), the honourable member for the Northern Territory and I had a brief discussion with both the Minister for the Northern Territory and the Acting Prime Minister, Dr. J. F. Cairns, and it was agreed there and then that no political pressures would come into the orbit of the discussions, particularly in those early sensitive days. That is exactly what happened. I do not intend to repeat the tributes that have been paid to all who were involved in those terrible events. They have been clearly stated by both the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the Minister for the Northern Territory; so it would be quite superfluous for me to repeat them. But there was one thing that struck me in particular on that Boxing Day and the following day, and that is the fact that not one personchild, aged person or anyone else-offere d one",66,Extract From The Congressional Quarterly Inc Of 6 October 1973
214,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (3.47),"I was oftheflew over the area and who, as a very young man, hadflownover Hiroshima said of the scene of devastation that the only thing he had seen nearly as bad was the scene at Hiroshima after an atomic bomb had blasted Hiroshima pretty well off the face of the earth. SoI regard this as being an operation of co-operation. Having made that point-I hope that I will not give cause for bringing any vitriolic poUtical argument into this matterI would Uke to make just one or two comments. I congratulate the Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr Les Johnson) on his participation and the fact that he has been able to report to us that no fewer than 1600 houses had been weatherproofed by the end of last month-January. That, I think, again reflects the spirit of co-operation and the actual participation of the workmen involved in facing up to a task of such magnitude. They must have been wondering where in hell to start to rebuUd a house that had been almost devastated. So that was a splendid contribution. The Minister for Housing and Construction raised one matter that I think is hardly applicable, and that is the AustraUan representation at the United Nations. In my subsequent remarks I propose to have something to say about the composition of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. By the way, we have more than one delegate to the United Nations; actually we have 6. We have at least 2 parliamentary representatives. We have 6 voting representatives. But let us not get on to the representation at the United Nations, although I have been informed that people associated with the United Nations are terribly interested in just how we will reconstruct Darwin. We are creating a pattern, a prototype, for other devastations of this nature that may occur in other parts of the world. I attempted to tap the pipeline in the United States of America, through various sources there, and I was able to make what I think are some quite valuable contacts. The rather extraordinary reaction was that they have learned to look to AustraUa for methods of construction that will stand up to cyclonic disturbance and so on. I think that is a great not saying that they wUl be deprived of it, but tribute to our technology, our expertise and, to a lesser extent, our rather tragic experience in TownsvUle and places such as that. The Minister for Housing and Construction stressed with a good deal of emphasis that the people of Darwin have the right to participate and to become involved. Most of the substance of what I have to say wiU be on that very subject. They have been given the right to participate and mission has been mentioned during the debate. to become involved to a high degree. Let me say If an examination were made of section 12 of the at this stage through you, Mr Speaker, to the National Capital Development Commission Act Minister for the Northern Territory that we are not attempting in any way to obstruct the passage of this BUI, but we do believe that if these people are to have the right to participate and to become involved they cannot possibly-gettin g right down to the crunch-offe r a constructive opinion or a constructive observation if they have only received a copy of the BUI almost on the eve of the BUI coming into the House for debate. There was probably some good reason for that, as the Minister wUl explain, but we have to be realistic about this matter. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development raised the matter of the Albury Wodonga development and similar developments and, in passing, mentioned the National Capital Development Commission. I think it is perfectly obvious that, where there is a pattern of urban and regional development and where one is going to develop an already existing city which has suffered nothing at all in the way of destruction, one is developing and extending and opening new ground, which is quite different from a situation in which people who have had their homes blasted into non-existence and who feel that they want to reside on their own piece of land find a section in an Act which says that by oral direction they may be forbidden to do so. I do not have any great fears about the authority of the Minister for the Northern Territory. I am not suggesting for one moment that he would misuse that authority. But whUe it exists there must be some qualms. He could drop dead tomorrow or he could be motoring from Mackay to Rockharnpton and someone could take a potshot at him. Someone of lesser character than he may take over his job-I , for instance. We do not know just what could happen. So it is a matter of principle; it is not a reflection on the Minister. One cannot compare the extension or development of an area such as Albury-Wodonga with the circumstances that exist in an utterly devestated city. The fact that people have lost their possessions, I think, gives them a greater feeling of ownership of a particular piece of land. I am under this BUI it is possible. They could be deprived by oral direction of the the right to go on to that piece of land. If they say' I am going on to the piece of land whether you Uke it or not', they can be fined $ 1000 or sentenced to 3 months imprisonment, or both for good measure. So it is a matter of principle. The National Capital Development Com1957-601 am sure that the Minister's experts could do this-to strike some sort of compromise, taking into account the emergency of this situation and the fact that no one would argue that there must be a flexible authority in Darwin, I think that people would be much happier. At least they would have some access to appeal. Under the Darwin Reconstruction Bill there is absolutely no room for appeal. In my book of rulesI do not care what the circumstances areevery individual must have the right to appeal or some access to appeal procedure. I am sure that no one could realistically and conscientiously argue against that proposition. Let us look at section 12 of the National Capital Development Commission Act. Honourable members should keep in mind that I am arguing that there should be at least some restriction over the powers of this new commission and over the Minister's authority, without casting any personal reflection. I am also arguing that there should be some avenue of appeal. Section 12(1) states: The Commission shall keep the Minister informed of the decisions of the Commission with respect to matters of policy in relation to the performance of its functions. That is as it should be. After all, the Government is responsible and the Minister is its spokesman. Section 12 (2) states: In the event of a difference of opinion between the Minisparticularly the Legislative Assembly, extended ter and the Commission as to the policy which should be followed by the Commission in relation to any matter, the Minister and the Commission shall endeavour to reach agreement. That is fair enough. I do not see why that subsection in its entirely could not be applied to the newly established Darwin Reconstruction Comnecessity for urgent action. We fully support the mission. Section 12 (3) states: If the Minister and the Commission are unable to reach there is a great wealth of evidence to support the agreementHere is more or less the punchlinethe Governor General may, by order, determine the policy the honourable member for the Northern Territo be adopted by the Commission in relation to the matter. Section 12 (4) states: The Commission shall thereupon give effect to the policy telegrams stressing that there is not one section determined by the order and shall, if the order so requires, of the community that has not been involved in continue to give effect to that policy while the order remains this matter. I will not call it a protest. We do not in operation. No doubt while I am saying all this people are ment to understand that these people have every beginning to ask: 'Is this not a ponderous sort of right to look at the Bill, to analyse it and to orienoperation? How will we get into action and tate it to their own situation. They know it best. reconstruct Darwin and cut corners if we are to Surely they have the ordinary, normal right of have a process such as this?' This process may any citizen. The2 important bodies who have never be used. The occasion may never arise expressed a very clearcut opinion, the Legislative when the arbitrary powers of the GovernorAssembly and the Corporation of the City of General, or some such officer, may be used. More Darwin, should certainly be called into conferparticularly, I would Uke to see someone on the ence before this Bill is finally approved. As far as spot, perhaps a special magistrate assisted by a group of 3 citizens, or a body of this nature. Mr Deputy Speaker, I point out to the Minister that on this occasion we wiU not propose any amendments. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development mentioned that possibly we would have the opportunity at the Committee stage. That we will not propose amendments is in absolute accord with our attitude to this matter which is that the people who are involved, the people who have been stricken, should have the opportunity, through their elected representatives, of putting their point of view in relation to this BUI. That is what we propose. If we cannot delay the matter for a lousy three or four days, it wUl be delayed in another place when the amendments wUl be presented. They will not be drastic amendments. If anyone argues that this is an operation of obstruction I wUl say, with respect, that the greatest obstruction is that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has not been vested with responsibility and powers. The members of the Assembly were elected months ago. They still have a very Umited and nebulous idea of what their responsibUities and powers are. In one blow we could have put into action the machinery which would at least have taken up the slack and would have created some authority on the spot, which is to put into the hands of the Corporation of the City of Darwin, and more powers and responsibilities. I do not think that proposition can be argued against. So the Opposition has a very clearcut attitude. We are right behind the stand that there is a proposition that there cannot be ponderous machinery which will hold up action. Above all proposition that the people have every right to look at the Bill and to analyse it. My colleague tory, and no doubt the Minister for the Northern Territory himself, have received a great sheaf of want the word 'protest'. But we wish the Governthe Opposition is able to influence the matter, they most certainly will have a say. Not only will they have a say, but I am sure that others also will. I believe that Dr Letts will be coming to Canberra, if he is not already here. I am sure that the Minister will know more about that than I do. I have been assured that 'Tiger' Brennan, the Mayor of Darwin, is coming to Canberra. Who would know the realistic, on-the-spot requirements of this area more than they? They are not coming to Canberra to take over the Minister's authority. They are coming to offer cooperation. They have certain set ideas. They are disturbed about three or four clauses in this Bill about which we on this side of the House are very concerned. One of the matters about which we are concerned is the oral direction. It may only be a minor thing. The other matter is the definition of the Northern Territory which is the whole of the Northern Territory and the waters adjacent to the Northern Territory. One can read the clauses and see where the extreme power, the allpowerful authority of the Minister, applies to the Territory. We are concerned about the area of responsibility for Darwin. The definition of the Darwin area in the Bill means that part of the Territory within a distance of 60 kilometers from the Darwin Post Office. That is 20 kilometers beyond the area affected by the cyclone. Let us look at clause 44 of the Bill. The Darwin Citizens' Council and Advisory Committee sounds a pretty good title. I commend the Minister for bringing this desirable committee into existence. It will be a citizens committee not exceeding 20 members. Let us examine this matter more closely. Clause 45 (1) states: Members of the Council shall be appointed by the MinisParticularly I express sympathy to those who ter, after nominations have been called for in accordance with this section. That principle is wrong. The Minister for the Northern Territory has absolute dictatorial power in relation to every clause of this Bill. I do not think it is fair to the Minister. As was pointed out in a document formulated by one of the best legal authorities on the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly-uo t a member of our Party but an independent member-the Minister is not physically capable of coping with all these matters. What will happen if the Minister is not capable? If honourable members read this Bill they will find that the Minister can delegate authority to members of the Public Service who, in turn, can delegate authority to private individuals. What has this to do with the concept of civilrights?We have heard much about civil rights in this House. Is it little wonder that the people of Darwin, that is, almost every if not every responsible body and individual, including the Women's council-the Minister for Urban and Regional Development stressed the women's side, for some reason best known to himself-hav e sent telegrams asking for one simple thing, namely, that the passage of this legislation be delayed three or four days until next week so that the people concerned may come to Canberra to express an opinion about certain clauses in this Bill. We could delay the passage of the legislation in this House. I would think that the Minister would be showing himself in an even better light if he were to take the initiative in this matter and were to prevent this Bill from being finally passed through all its stages. The third reading of the Bill could be postponed until these people had come to Canberra and, in an ordinary democratic manner, had expressed their point of view. The Government may be assured that we will not propose amendments to the Bill in this House, but they will be proposed in another place. The Opposition does not intend to obstruct the passage of this legislation, but it would like to give the people who will be affected by this legislation an opportunity to express an opinion in a matter which involves them more than anyone else. intention to use the full time allocated to me in this debate simply for the purpose of hearing my own voice. As Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory I have shown considerable interest in the Northern Territory and its people. I join with other honourable members in expressing my deep sympathy to the people of Darwin in the tragedy caused by cyclone Tracy. have suffered and to those who have lost near and dear ones. I am proud of my Government's efforts since this tragic cyclone struck the doorway to Australia. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) came back to Australia to visit Darwin from an important visit overseas. The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) went to Darwin as soon as practicable. The Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson), who I think was worthy of the praise given to him by members of the Opposition for his enthusiasm and his interest, arrived in Darwin almost before the cyclone had finished. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) referred to this. It made me feel very proud, as an Australian, to see the reaction of the Australian people to",69,Extract From The Congressional Quarterly Inc Of 6 October 1973
215,Mr James (Hunter) (4.6),"It is not mythose who suffered in Darwin. I sometimes am disappointed with the attitude of some Australian people, but the response in this particular instance throughout AustraUa was magnificent. There was a terriffic response from my area of Newcastle. My telephone was ringing aU the time. People were offering their assistance and were offering to go to Darwin. I told them that they would have to wait because transport facUities were not avaUable The Lady Mayor of Newcastle immediately launched an appeal and there was a very goodresponse.The people of Newcasde raised about $200,000. The local television station, Channel 3, gave magnificent help. I sometimes regret that the whole matter has been a shade marred in the Parliament in the last 24 hours. Criticism has been levelled at the Government for attempting to pass the Darwin Reconstruction BUI expeditiously. I appeal to honourable member opposite; that criticism was not deserved. We must remember that a state of emergency still exists in Darwin which caUs for emergency action to be taken such as the passage of the Darwin Reconstruction BUI. I repeat that I do not think the criticism which has been levelled at the Government is justified. The Minister himself has put great thought and concentration into this matter. Apart from his own skill and knowledge he has had the advantage of the knowledge of efficient and senior public servants in Darwin, such as Mr any foolish appointments. I am sure that he Alan O'Brien and Mr John Hogan, who have spent many years in public administration. The Minister has had a team of advisers who have examined this BUI from stem to stern, if I may use that phrase, to see that there is nothing undemocratic in the legislation. It is true that the Commission is to be given wide powers. It certainly has to be given wide powers. The powers to be given to the Commission are virtually wartime powers. All honourable members are aware that in wartime the ParUament has emergency powers to deal with emergency situations. It is only to be expected that emergency powers should be given to this Commission to meet an emergency situation. I think all honourable members should reaUse this and should not try to make political capital out of this matter. Clause 17 (l)(d) of the BUI states that the son), who is seated at the table, was the Minister Commission may sue and be sued in its corporate at the table when we were discussing the Northname. I regret that this is the case. I think it ern Territory Lands Acquisition Bill. I had a feelshould be made more difficult for people to sue a ing on that occasion that the Minister probably Commission such as this which is acting in the privately supported our views but was overruled interests of the people as a whole. WhUstI would by other members in the Cabinet and I suspect not say that the Commission should be absolved that could be the position on this occasion. We from being sued I personally would Uke to have have not really had a proper opportunityI seen in the BUI a provision that special leave had think my colleagues have consistently made this to be sought to sue the Commission. I think it should be made more difficult for the Commission to be sued. Occasionally we will get a nincompoop in the community who wUl say that he wUl sue a commission. The honourable member for Kennedy leveUed some criticism at the Minister and at clause 45 (1) which states: Members of the Council shall be appointed by the Minister after nominations have been called for in accordance with this section. AgainI say that those who nominate no doubt would be screened by very efficient public servants, led by Mr Alan O'Brien, Mr Hogan and others from Darwin. I have met those gentlemen personally and I have been impressed with their efficiency and sincerity. Furthermore, I remind the honourable member for Kennedy that when he was the Minister for the Army he had certain powers which allowed him to appoint members to the Army Board. The honourable member for Kennedy had great powers in that capacity. It was never suggested in this Parliament that he or any other Minister for the Army had at any time misused these powers. It is generally agreed in this Parliament that a Minister should have these powers because he is answerable to the Parliament should he make any fooUsh appointments. I do not think that the Minister for the Northern Territory would make would carefuUy scrutinise the recommendations made to him. I wUl be watching with great interest the powers given to the members of the Commission under the Darwin Reconstruction BUI. I think this is appropriate legislation and I think it is a very good BiU. I hope that it is put on the statute book expeditiously. I congratulate the Minister for Northern Development and all those responsible for the drawing up of the BUI. I beUeve that this BUI wUl be to the benefit of the people of the Northern Territory as a whole and the people of Australia. take part briefly in this debate because I am concerned at the way the Government has acted on this occasion. It is interesting to note that the",72,Extract From The Congressional Quarterly Inc Of 6 October 1973

217,Minister For The Northern Territory (Dr Patter,"point-to examine this legislation and I do not believe that anyone on the Government side apart from the Minister himself has had any better opportunity. We received copies of the Bill late on Monday evening. The copy that I had and the copy received by my colleague the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) were so poor that we could not even read them. So really it was not until yesterday when the Bill was presented in the House that we were able to give any consideration whatever to this legislation. I am sure that the Minister will himself agree that it is very complex legislation and it is not the sort of thing on which we can arrive at a view in 10 minutes or indeed in 10 hours. We on this side have had a number of meetings concerning this matter, but we still have not completely resolved on every item what action should be taken to improve the legislation. It was only yesterday that the Government refused to allow the Opposition additional time to examine the measure by opposing a motion by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) to adjourn this debate until next Tuesday. So really my purpose in taking part in this debate is to record a strong else the Opposition with its numbers in the Senprotest at the way in which we have been treated. I would like to place on record my view on some aspects of the Bill. Dealing with the Bill very quickly, we on this side have reservations about the limitation of what is known as the Darwin area. We find it difficult to understand why the Government should select 60 kilometres to define 'Darwin area'. I know that under the Lands Acquisition Act the figure was 90 kilometres but it seems ridiculous to use 60 kilometres because not all of this area was subject to damage by the cyclone. We on this side are, I think probably more than anything else, concerned about the shabby way the Government has treated both the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the Darwin Council. I beheve that neither body has even been given a copy of the legislation. certainly did not have a copy of the legislation before we did. The Minister says that what I said is not true but I believe it is. Dr PattersonI am telling you that they all received copies at the sametimeas the Bill was introduced into the House yesterday. received copies at the same time as the Bill was introduced into the House yesterday. That did not leave them muchtimeto examine the legislation prior to its coming into this House. Let me remind honourable members that the Government announced that it wanted the Bill passed on the same day as it was introduced into this House. I think the Government admits that and certainly the Minister has confessed that members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory did not receive the courtesies to which we on this side of the House believe they are entided. Mr Donald Cameron-S o much for open government. expression which went out the window the day after this Government was elected and there are thousands of examples to prove it. We on this side are concerned about the lack of therightof appeal of the individual. Under the Northern Territory Lands Acquisition Bill there was absolutely norightof appeal for an individual whatsoever. Officers could go on to a person's property, resume the land, knock over a shed or do anything. Not even on the matter of compensation did the individual have the right of appeal to any higher authority. For that reason and nothing ate threw that Bill out. I suggest to the Government and to the Minister in particular that it is much better to talk to us and to co-operate with us in this place instead of using their numbers just to steamroll legislation through this place because fortunately there is still another place in which matters like this can be properly debated. The question of land use is referred to in clause 6 of the Bill. I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to paragraph (b) of clause 6 dealing with the functions of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. It reads in part: (b) to carry out planning in relation to development, construction and land use in the Darwin areaObviously this means this Commission supersedes all other authoritiesin accordance with any determinations of the Australian Government in respect of matters referred to in paragraph (a), and recommend to the Minister general planning and development schemes for the Darwin area; What happens after that? Like the Northern Territory Lands Acquisition Bill, there appears to be absolutely norightof appeal at all. Clause8 of the Bill deals with general planning and development schemes. They are to be approved by the Minister after considering recommendations of the Commission and public authorities shall comply with the schemes so approved. That is absolute power to plan and this would have an effect on the value of land. There is another point that I think should be mentioned. I do not know",73,Extract From The Congressional Quarterly Inc Of 6 October 1973

In any local government area in Australia where there is to be rezoning or any town planning which affect the people living in the area it is customary for the plans to be displayed publicly for a period before commencement of the program, but there is simply no such provision in this legislation. Under clause 9 of the Bill the Commission shall comply with any directions given to it by the Minister with respect to the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers. I am informed that such a provision is not even in the National Capital Development Commission Act because programs must go to the Cabinet. We believe clause 9 ought to be the subject of amendment. Clause 11 of the Bill deals with the powers of the Commission. It reads in part: Without limiting the generality of section 10 . . .the Commission has power, for or in connection with the performance of its functions(a) to control and administer land vestedI emphasise the words 'land vested -' in the Commission . . . What sort of land wquld ever be vested in the Commission? I hope that the Minister is making copious notes and will reply in due course because the only way that we on this side beheve that land can be vested in the Commission-thi s is perhaps as a result of the help that we have had from an officer from the Minister's Department, for which we are grateful-is in the event of some land being left to the Commission in a deceased's estate. Perhaps the Minister will tell us a bit more about that. There is another curious situation in clause 13 which deals with the placing of land under the control of the Commission. Clause 13(2) reads: (a) the Commission is, subject to this section, empowered to occupy and manage the land and to cany out such works on, and make such use of, the land . . . (b) the Commission is not empowered to dispose of, or grant a lease of, the land, but the land shall not be disposed of, and a lease of the land shall not be granted, by Australia without the consent of the Commission. Will the Minister tell us who is the boss? Who is the superior power-the Minister, the Commission or the AustraUan Government? We beUeve that there should be some higher authority. I reaUse there are difficulties in Darwin concerning the courts but it should not be too difficult to arrange for a magistrate to deal with appeals. Clause 15 of the BUT deals with entry to and work on land. This clause makes the need 1 have referred to imperative. Sub-clause (2) reads: For the purposes of public safety or sanitation, the Commission may, by its authorised servants, agents or contractors, enter on . . . in the Darwin Area and demolfeh dangerous or damaged structures, remove debris, goods and materials and perform work. It can do a whole lot of other things. Where is the right of the individual? What if an individual is not happy about this? These things can be done by oral direction. Some officer within the Department can enter land and teU the individual to get off his land. He can knock over the individual s house. In fact, I beUeve that has happened. A bulldozer apparently went on to some person's property up there and pushed the remainder of A house over a cliff. I believe this is factual. We do not beUeve this is the way to treat people. Theie should be some provision for a taxpayer, for ihe individual living on the land or using that land, to have the right of appeal to someone. One suggestion that we are making is that the someone should be a magistrate so that matters of this kind can be dealt with quickly. We are not happy with the constitution of the Commission. I believe that one of my colleagues dealt in some depth with that aspect. We are not happy that there should be a chairman who would appear to me to be nothing more than a puppet. On reading this BUI it certainly appears that the general manager is the chairman, the managing director and in fact, to use the Australian expression, the boss cocky. We see very great dangers in that appointment. I said that I would speak for only a few minutes, and I think it would be a good thing if a few more people in this place tried out this practice. I conclude by saying that we are all most concerned at the way in which the Government has treated the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and the town council. We are equally concerned that there is no provision for the rights of the individual. the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Northern Territory I would like to say a few words. I believe that the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson), will quite adequately answer some of the criticisms that have been directed at the BUI. As a member of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory it was my pleasure to go to Darwin on a number of occasions and to enjoy the hospitality and community spirit that was evident in that city. Like everyone else in Australia, I was deeply shocked when the news came through of the disaster and",74,Extract From The Congressional Quarterly Inc Of 6 October 1973

As the Minister mentioned in his second reading speech, the decision to evacuate Darwin was taken the day after the cyclone had struck.

224,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Leader of thecontributions that had been made by the AustraUan pubUc. I know I express their sentiments when I say' thank you * to aU of those people who helped at the time when their help was desperately needed. My visit to Darwin crystalUsed one point, namely, the concern of the people of the city about the Darwin Reconstruction BUI which is now before the Parliament. They are very concerned as to the extent of the powers of this BUI, and just how much the legislation wUl involve and perhaps interfere with their freedom and their daily lives in the Northern Territory. I do not think anyone criticises the fact that the legislation has not been prepared until now. It is a complex matter to estabUsh a commission to resurrect this large city which had a population of 40 000 people. But, by the same token, it is a fairly momentous piece of legislation which will be in operation for at least 5 years and the extent of whose powers may have a considerable bearing on political progress in the Northern Territory. WhereverI went I heard this general expression : 'Please give us, the people of Darwin, the people involved, the people who are going to be affected, time to analyse the legislation and to express points of view. We reaUse that in the long run the Government has to make the decisions and accept responsibUity for those decisions; but we, the living people of this city, who are deeply involved with it, do have opinions and do have ideas as to how new regulations wUl affect us'. I conveyed this sentiment to the Government and I made a public announcement to the same effect. It is with a great deal of disappointment on my part that the Bill is being pushed through this House so quickly. But I have given the people of the Northern Territory an assurance that the Opposition parties in the Senate wUl do what they can to delay the passage of this legislation at least untU next week-unti l the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the Corporation of the City of Darwin and other interested bodies have had a chance to make their comments. Doing that wUl enable detaUed amendments to be presented to the Senate for consideration. We have not had the opportunity, nor do we think it wise, to bring forward our amendments to this legislation without consultation with the people of the Northern Territory. But, as a mark of the feeUngs of the people in the Northern Territory, I have here a list of the telegrams that I have received in the last 24 hours. They are all expressed in the same tone. One reads: Protest at levels of opportunity given Darwin citizens . . . Another reads: Would you please use your influence to have copy of Darwin Reconstruction Commission Bill sent to us immediately for examination . . . The telegrams go on in that tone, and they are from organisations such as the Country Women's Association of Darwin, the Arts CouncU of the Northern Territory, citizen groups and different action groups of the city. They all express the same sentiment. I am sure that simUar telegrams would have been received by the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) and by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam). The people who sent these telegrams want to know just how much say their elected bodies will have. They want to know whether they wUl be completely dominated by this new Commission. They ask whether they wUl have any right of appeal. What does the present town planning ordinance mean there? It is not a slipshod sort of a document; it is their town planning ordinance. It was last brought up to date in 1972 and it is a very comprehensive document which deals with the city of Darwin. One would wonder why anyone would want it to be scrapped or overriden. I think that it probably provides a very sound basis which could be amended or expanded. But it is not made clear just what will happen. AU we know is that the BUI does give the Commission power to override completely this town planning ordinance and allow it to make its own. There is a great deal of concern as to what right of appeal an individual will have if he is told to get off his property. What right of appeal wUl there be in relation to the many things that are involved in the reconstruction of a city? I must say that when I heard some of the remarks of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) this afternoon a shudder went through me. Such a shudder must go through the people of Darwin who hear him say that this is the opportunity to buUd a completely new city, to get rid of all the old weaknesses and to have new buildings. That is more or less a bureaucrat's dream. It is very idealistic to want to do that, but there are people and people's properties involved and one just cannot build a new city overnight. One just cannot push people about and say: 'You cannot have this or that'. Certainly one should not be able to do that without some right to appeal, to protest and to put a second point of view. SoI say that there is concern about many aspects of this BUI, including the structure of the Commission and the powers given to the General Manager of the Commission in relation to the Chairman of the Commission. There is concern about the area of authority that this new Commission will exercise. Is it necessary for the Commission to have power over the area within 60 kilometres of the centre of the city? Already people have been protesting that the radius ought to be limited to 40 kilometres at the most. At present the Darwin area would extend to only about 20 kilometres from the centre. Why is it necessary for the Commission to be able to exercise power over any Crown land throughout the whole of the Territory? These are some of the things that need explanation. It is not our intention to make political capital out of this legislation or out of the disaster at Darwin. It is not our intention to delay the legislation. But a piece of legislation of this magnitude needs to be examined and to be scrutinised thoroughly so that what is actually put on the statute book is the best piece of legislation we can have for the redevelopment of Darwin and the well-being of the people of Darwin. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for dren at school, even though there was ample Northern Development and Minister for the warning. Those people who care about what Northern Territory) (4.41)-in reply-Firstly, I happened in Darwin know that the relatively thank all honourable members on both sides of small death toll is one of the remarkable things the House who have participated in this debate about the holocaust. Lessons have been learned and expressed various sentiments-sentiment s of of which the Government is very conscious. I am compassion and of understanding, all aimed, I sure those people affected in Darwin are also believe, at achieving the best possible result for conscious of them. Ever since Christmas DayI the people of Darwin and the best possible have been making arrangements for experts reconstruction plan for Darwin itself. Natural from Queensland to go to Darwin to examine the disasters, as has been pointed out, are things planning and the construction of buUdings and which apparently this country will experience in houses in an endeavour to learn from the Darwin the future just as much as it has in the past. In the experience. As everybody knows, the eastern last 6 years I personally have been associated coast of Queensland has suffered many times with 4 natural disasters3 cyclones and one disfrom cyclones and wuT suffer again. So we must astrous flood. There was the Proserpine and learn, plan and be prepared. Whitsunday Islands cyclone which destroyed islands, settlements and beaches and killed people. There was the Townsville cyclone, the floods of last year and now cyclone Tracy in Darpeople of Darwin are represented in actions win. Cyclone Tracy is the worse disaster I have taken during the next 5 years, during the planned ever seen. I hope I never see anything like it operation period of the Commission. The again. It has had a profound effect on me, as I am Government believes that the people of Darwin sure it has had on all the people who were in the are adequately represented on the Commission cyclone on that fateful day or who, immediately through the Legisaltive Assembly and through after or since, saw the ruins of Darwin and the the Corporation of the City of Darwin. These2 incredible suffering which many people must bodies, the Assembly and the Corporation, do in have gone through, including those whose relafact represent the people of Darwin on the tives were killed. What cyclone Tracy has revealed is that of the 3 departments vitally concerned in the AustraUa must always be prepared for natural reconstruction of Darwin-the Department of disasters. As I said in my second reading speech, the Northern Territory, the Department of the way in which the various committees and the Urban and Regional Development and of course Natural Disasters Organisation were able to the Department of Housing and Construction. function in Darwin as soon as was humanly possThe Chairman, Sir Leslie Thiess, is a man with ible must in itself have saved many lives. It tremendous experience in construction and a would have saved people who may have been man, I believe, who wants to get things done. killed, who may have been affected by disease. We do not know. Thankfully the known death toll of only 49 is remarkably small. When one sees the ruins of the northern suburbs it is just incredible and incomprehensible that only that relatively small number of people in fact perished. We can be extremely thankful of course that when the cyclone struck it was not at a time of high tide. Considerable areas of Darwin are susceptible to tidal or storm surge. The experts have told me that if the cyclone had struck at hightidethe death toll would have been very much higher. One of the reasons for the relatively small death toll, certainly based on what I saw in the Whitsunday Islands and in TownsvUle, was the fact that the great majority of people were indoors. God only knows what would have happened if the cyclone had struck in the middle of the day with people walking around and chilThe central theme of the speeches of the Opposition speakers, as I see it, is to ensure that the Interim Commission. In the Interim Commission the 3 government members are permanent heads The Bill provides also for the establishment of the Darwin Citizens Council. As I said in my second reading speech, the Bill provides for the appointment of other committees by the Commission, through the Minister, to advise the Commission on all types of matters which the Commission believes, or the people of Darwin beheve, the Commission should be told of. Let us have a look at some of the specific points of the Bill. There will be no debate at the Committee stage and I understand that no amendments will be moved here; they will be moved at a later time in another place. I shall deal with some of the points that were raised, firsdy, the definition of the area which will fall within the scope of the Commission's activities; that is, a radius of 60 kilometres. People have questioned this area but there is a reason for it. Put briefly, the radial area is based on the need expressed by the planners, the experts, to cover all land which might prove necessary for the Reconstruction Commission to operate. Those currently involved in planning for Darwin see the need for the Reconstruction Commission to have control over land uses in the area covering Cox Peninsula, Darwin River Dam and out to Adelaide River to give it as muchflexibilityas possible in determining public utility areas such as for the airport, buffer zones, water conservation areas, a need for which may arise during the program of reconstruction, and to allow for expansion. Of course there are other reasons. The Commission may not want to see buildings or construction taking place on areas continguous to a smaller area. It may not be in the best interests of planning. Consequently, it is essential that the Commission has that area of land, certainly when one takes into account buffer zones and the supply of water. The relevant clause with relation to appeals is clause 61 (1) (e). The Governor General may make regulations pertaining to the Commission. Clause 61 (1) (e) provides for appeals including appeals to the courts of the Territory in respect of matters arising under the regulations. I would expect the Commission to act accordingly. Of course the Governor General has the final decision through the Parliament and the Minister, but the Commission will make the recommendations in respect to certain actions. As regards public and private investment, which was raised by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, I point out that this is a programming provision and it only indicates without determining in the sense that it makes the final decision. I can assure the honourable member that this will be fully taken into account. Clause 11 deals with the powers of the Commission. The honourable member for the Northern Territory believes that they are too wide, but these powers are considered necessary to enable the Commission to carry out its functions properly in the light of experience elsewhere in AustraUa, and because of the emergency of this situation to get this job done within 5 years. It may take longer. Of course provision will be made to extend the legislation, but we are planning on the basis of a 5-year period. As regards land in the Northern Territory, the honourable member for the Northern Territory argues that clause 13 is too wide and should be restricted to the Darwin area. It is fairly clear that the Commission may want access to land outside Darwin, to hold land in reserve for construction purposes, or for stores or whatever it might be. That is the purpose of that clause. Clause 16.(1) deals with oral directions. I should Uke the honourable member for the Northern Territory to listen to this because he raised the point that somebody might give an oral direction for people to be removed from a dangerous place. I think he took objection to the inclusion of the word 'oral'. I personally have no objection to what he said. If it is to become a major issue I certainly shall not argue about it. But I point out to the honourable member that it may be that in cases of extreme emergency only oral direction wUl be avaUable. Let us take for example the present situation. There could be a blow tomorrow or a blow next week. We may not have time to go running around getting all types of orders and determinations. It may be that the poUce want to remove somebody out of a house in bad condition. I can assure the honourable member that plenty of people already are living in shattered houses. One has only to go at night to the northern suburbs and see the number of lights to appreciate this fact. In the case of extreme emergency, such as another blow with debris everywhere, it may be that there is onlytimefor oral directions to get action, especially if someone refuses to vacate a house that obviously wiU be blown over. That is a reason for the inclusion of the word 'oral'. However, if the honourable member for the Northern Territory has strong objections to its use, I will not argue but I think when he examines the situation he will see the reason for it. The honourable member referred to clause 18 which relates to membership of the Commission and specificaUy mentioned the general manager. The Government believes that the general manager must be a fuU time executive, must be part of the Commission and vote on the Commission. This is accepted practice with other commissions and I can assure the honourable member that this provision was well thought out and was discussed widely. The honourable member suggested that there should be greater local representation on the Commission. As I pointed out earlier, one member of the Commission will be nominated by the Legislative Assembly and another by the Corporation of the City of Darwin-bot h elected bodies. The Mayor of Darwin is a member of the interim commission and the Majority Leader of the Legislative Assembly, Mr Letts, is also a member, so both these bodies are represented on the Commission. The honourable member expressed the view that a representative of the Northern Territory Public Service, as distinct from the Australian Government Public Service, should participate in the Commission. I have no objection to that proposal and if the Opposition moves that as an amendment I do not believe there will be any opposition from the Government. The honourable member referred also to clause 45 which appears in those provisions relating to the Darwin Citizens' Council and advisory committees. He questioned the proposal relating to nominations for membership of the Council by, in addition to organisations listed, not less than 2 electors for the Legislative Assemtinue to operate outside Darwin but the Combly. There would certainly seem to be merit in what he said. Perhaps this provision could be altered to relate to residents of Darwin because, as he pointed out, there are people in Darwin who are not electors but who might seek to have representation on that council. It may be that some person aged under 18 years might seek to represent the youth of Darwin. I can see merit in the suggestion and if the wording were altered to relate to 'residents of Darwin' instead of'persons entitled to vote at elections for the Legislative Assembly for the Territory' that possibly would fill the bid. Clause 53 concerns compensation in respect of acquisition of land in the Darwin area. The Opposition seems concerned about the formula for determining the compensation to be paid. This is an important issue for the people of the Northern Territory, particularly those who have lost Order! The Minister'stimehas expired. almost everything. It may be that the Commission will have to acquire some houses and some land but the Opposition should not be frightened that the Government is seeking to acquire all the land, because it is not. In certain areas of Darwin no reconstruction will take place. Some areas are subject to tidal wave and forthwith. storm surge and it would be crazy for anyone to consider rebuilding in such areas. The Government has no wish to take advantage of any fall in land values which may be attributable to the cyclone and it has sought advice on the most equitable means of providing compensation for land acquisition. The value of the land is not to be less than its value immediately prior to the cyclone if the improvements on it had been the same as the improvements at the date of acquisition. In other words the Government is applying a fair valuation criterion. I am not surprised that the Opposition has objected to clause 55 which provides that the powers and functions of the Commission are not to be affected by the Northern Territory Town Planning Ordinance. This provision is necessary because this is emergency legislation. It is essential to get houses built in order to get the people of Darwin who are scattered around Australia back to Darwin and to house them as quickly as possible and to get Darwin operating most effectively. This clause is necessary to ensure the overall orderly planning and development of the future Darwin area. It is essential that the Commission, in exercising its powers and carrying out its functions, should not be impeded by local legislation relating to a Darwin town plan devised in 1966 and subsequently amended. The Town Planning Ordinance will, of course, conmission, in carrying out its functions of planning and reconstruction, must have the power to act quickly and to recommend to the Minister and the Government a plan of action. If the Commission is impeded by continuous argument about town planning, such as we have experienced in the past in Darwin and elsewhere, I am afraid there will be nothing but frustration in many areas. I am not suggesting that the people of Darwin would not be consulted. I have given my word that they will be consulted as much as possible about every plan and move the Commission proposes. That, of course, will involve the displaying of maps and plans and the explanation of policy to consultative groups and committees so that the people of Darwin can be fully involved in the planning.

225,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),"That the Bill be now read a third time. (5.3)-This Bill has not been taken through the Committee stage because we are trying to get it passed as quickly as possible. However, I think it would be of great interest to honourable members, in view of the debate which ensued yesterday, if i read to the House a telegram which has been received from the Majority Leader of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.

I do not know to whom that telegram was addressed. Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony). the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) said. I should have thought that the Northern Territory Majority Leader would have sent a telegram to me as Minister in charge of this Bill. If his action is not playing politics, what is? The second point I make in this respect is that this motion was moved by an independent member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Which independent member was it? There are only 2 independent members in that Assembly. It must be Mr Withnall who is the same person who provided the honourable member for Kennedy with a long screed of advice on this Bill. That independent member did not give that same advice to-me. I take a very dim view of this. If the majority leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was fair and independent, he would have sent me a copy of that telegram also.; Similarly, the independent member with legal experiencethere are only 2 independent members in the Assembly and only one of them has legal experiencetelegrams, you will find a telegram from him. Dr PATTERSONI have not received it yet. If i have received it, I will make no bones about saying so in the House. AllI suggest is that if this is the same person he could have at least given me that telegram and that advice too. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 November 1974 on That the Bill be now read a second time. one of the most discriminatory, ill-considered and badly drafted Bills ever to be introduced into this Parliament. It discriminates against women and against those men and women who do not want their marriages to be dissolved at the whim of the other party to the marriage. Many leaders in the community from the professions, among social workers and in the churches have pointed to the changes which will be introduced into the nature of marriage and threaten the stability of the family if this Bill is passed without amendment. The Bill proceeds on the basis that men and women are equal in the matrimonial situation. It is a fact of life that in marriage the longer it lasts the women's independence, and particularly her economic ability to fend for herself, become less. Tbis element is wholly overlooked by this Bill. It fails to give women the protection and support to which they are entided as wives and mothers of the future generation of Australians. It takes away from women the security and legal safeguards of the present law and, in the guise of enabling marriages which have broken down irretrievably to be dissolved with dignity, enables all marriages to be dissolved on the unilateral decision of either party on 12 months notice. Do the people of Australia want such a law that will reduce marriage to a purely temporary union with little or no protection for women and children? Let me highlight the effect of clause 6 of the Bill, which provides:",80,Extract From The Congressional Quarterly Inc Of 6 October 1973

232,Mr Stewart (Lang,"Minister for TourismFor the purpose of proceedings under this Act, a union in the nature of a marriage which is, or has at any time been, polygamous, being a union entered into in a place outside Australia, shall be deemed to be a marriage. This clause cuts all ties with the traditional view of marriage as a monogamous union according to law, of a man and woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. An Australian married man could go to a Moslem country that recognises polygamy and go through a form of marriage which would be perfectly legal in that country. His 'wife'I put that word in inverted commas-woul d thereby become entided to obtain entry into Australia and to enjoy all the benefits of social security, widow's pension and deserted wife's pension, the same as his first legal wife. This could be done without the consent of hisfirstwife and her only redress would be to seek a divorce herself and then only after being required to suffer the indignity of being a polygamous wife for 12 months. The Family Law Bill deals broadly with 3 aspects: The dissolution of the marriagetie;the resolution of ancillary matters between the parties either before or after the dissolution of the marriage; and the creation of a Federal Family Court. The dissolution of marriage is to be based on the one and only ground that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. There is no inquiry to be held on whether in fact the marriage has broken down, but the Bill provides that the ground shall be held to be established where it is proved that the parties to the marriage have lived separately and apart for a period of not less than 12 months. The fatal flaw in the Bill is not to be found in the counselling or reconciliation provisions or the maintenance and property clauses however weakening they may be. The Achilles heel of this Bill is found in clauses 48 and 49. Under the guise of enabling persons whose marriages have failed, this Bill provides, as the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) stated in his second reading speech on 28 November 1974 as reported at page 4823 of Hansard of that date: to have the marriage dissolved without having to be put to the additional distress of making formal, undignified charges against the other party that that pany's cruelty or adultery or There is no substantial difference between the wilful desertion was the cause of the breakdown, and because of it that pany deserves to be divorced. The whole nature of marriage is altered. Spouses become disposable at will. Deserted wives are supported provided they are not big, healthy, independent persons and the offspring become latch-key children. These provisions are deceitful in their glib disguise of a fundamental change of the philosophy of marriage and the family. No-one would dispute that there are areas of the law which ought to be reformed, but many reforms are just as readily achieved within the framework of the present BUI. It is dishonest to suggest that marriage remains unaltered by this BUI. The FamUy Law BUI turns marriage into a cheap, temporary union which may be dissolved on the unUateral decision of one party. It creates a climate which wUl lead to a light-hearted approach to marriage. I suggest that this ParUament should be doing more to instruct people in their responsibUities before marriage. Under the cloak of removing injustice, humUiation and indignity from divorce, new injustices, new humUiations and new indignities are being created. What could be more humiliating more unjust, or cause greater distress and hurt to a spouse than to be abandoned without cause by his or her partner merely at the whim of such partner as a matter of convenience on 12 months' notice? This is not divorce because the marriage has irretrievably or otherwise broken down; it is the destruction of marriage by abandonment. We have reached the ultimate in the disposable society in this BUI. The law wUl sanction the dissolution of marriage by abandonment for 12 months. The other spouse must accept it, whatever the frustrations or hurts involved. There are no defences. Marriage wUl become the only mutual contract the law sanctions which can be cancelled unUaterally. Claims have been made by ex-Senator Murphy and others that Part III of the BUl-the marriage counselling and reconciliation provisions-represent s a major advance in the law. The fact is that marriage counselling can be successful only if the 2 persons involved want then marriage to work. The BUI does not, and indeed cannot force an unwUling party to attend for counselling. Mr BasU Hogan, LL.B., a barrister with the widest experience in matrimonial causes and specialising in divorce, has said: I do not know of a single case where a marriage has been saved by the use of marriage counselling provisions contained in the present Act. My experience is shared by most practitioners who deal with divorces on a daily basis. provisions in the present Act and the proposed provisions. In any event, the ease with which a divorce can be obtained under clause 48 of the BUI undermines any serious attempt at the application of the proposed provisions. There is even less incentive under the BUI to achieve reconcUiation than exists under the present law. I predict with confidence that, just as the present system of marriage counselling has faUed where one party has wanted to terminate the marriage, so the system proposed in clauses 14 to 19 of the Bill will fail. How ludicrous it is to have such a procedure as that contemplated by clause 15 (1), where a party to a marriage can file in the Family Court a notice stating that he or she intends to seek the assistance of the counselling facilities of the Family Court. What would any husband or wife do if served with such a notice when the marriage was already shaky? It is an open invitation to terminate the marriage by notice. There is no sanction for refusing to participate in counselling and there is no way of obliging the other party to take any advice given by counsellors. Part IV of the Bill deals with the formation and constitution of a Federal court to be known as the Family Court of AustraUa. To this Court is to be entrusted the jurisdiction set out in clause 31, namely: (1) The Family Court has jurisdiction in(a) matrimonial causes instituted or continued under this Act; (b) proceedings instituted or continued under the Marriage Act 1961-1973, other than proceedings under Part VII of that Act; (c) matters arising under a law of a Territory concerning(i) the adoption of children; (ii) the guardianship, custody or maintenance of children; or (iii) payments of a kind referred to in section 109; and (d) matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by a law made by the Parhament. (2) Subject to such restrictions and conditions (if any) as are contained in the regulations, the jurisdiction of the Family Coun may be exercised in relation to persons or things outside Australia and the Territories. The Court wUl of necessity be located in the capital cities and wUl not have jurisdiction over the adoption of chUdren, guardianship, property matters and trustee matters relating to cluldren in the States which fall under State jurisdictions. It wUl be impossible for judges of the FamUy Court to get around vast areas of the Australian countryside on circuit as the State Supreme Court judges do. What is to happen to divorce petitions in KalgoorUe, Broken HU1 or Mount Isa? Are these petitioners to be required to apply to Perth, Sydney and Brisbane respectively to have theu: marriages dissolved? Or is it envisaged that there wUl be appointed a large number of additional judges, both big and small, with thenattendant entourages? How is the pubUc better served by a Federal court if it results in delays and extra expense and inconvenience in obtainexisting legal concept; somebody has to pay for it. ing divorces? There wiU be a dual system of We all know who ends up paying-the taxpayer. courts in any event and a large number of Federal judges wUl have to be appointed at vast exThe drafting of the BUI leaves much to be pense to the taxpayer and with no visible benefit desired; there are many instances of ambiguities, to anybody, to do work that could be done by the State Supreme Courts. What are the likely social and economic consequences for the community of this BUI? The first consequence wiU be an increase in the number of divorces in the community. The United Kingdomfiguresdemonstrated this very clearly. Secondly, the provision of support services and court structures wiU impose afinancialburden on the community. Thirdly, the parties to broken marriages wUl suffer financial and emotional burdens in making new homes and estabUshing new personal relationships. Fourthly, the consequences of broken homes on cluldren of such marriages wUl be increased in proportion to the numbers involved. They wUl suffer the psychological damage of famUy collapse, the loss of security, torn affections and both emotional and material disturbance. Socially, the commumty suffers directly as more of its individual components as recognised by the United Nations-the famUy-manifes t partial or total collapse. Indirectly, the community suffers as a fanuiy coUapse contributes to an erosion of those values which buttress marriage and fanuiy. Financially, the community is obliged to bear a substantial portion of the direct costs of famUy breakdown. They are: Firstly, the maintenance of those parties and their chUdren unable to support themselves without social security assistance; secondly, the administrative costs associated with increased demands upon either the existing legal system or the establishment of the Family Court of AustraUa; thirdly, the increased demands upon the AustraUan Legal Aid Office, as is provided for in clause 117(3) and (4); fourthly, the probable increased demand for child care centres; and, fifthly, the increased demand for services to deal with the psychological and physical Ul-health of disadvantaged one-parent famUies. Indirectly the community bears an even greater financial burden-the costs of the anti-social behaviour and the costs of the new generation of unstable marriages which become evident as the chUdren of broken homes reach adulthood. The Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, Senator James McClelland, summarised the situation succinctly when he said at a meeting of the Committee on 11 September 1974: After all, it is a drastic and quite dramatic alteration to the obscurity and meaningless clauses. Under clause 43 the judges of the Family Court are directed to have regard to a number of principles in exercising their jurisdiction. They sound like excellent guidelines but in practice they are meaningless since under clause 48 (2) the Court has no discretion to refuse a decree for dissolution of marriage where there is proof of 12 months separation. Clause 48 (3) is also meaningless because there will be no inquiry by the Court into the circumstances of the marriage. Similarly, the matters to be taken into consideration under clause 75 on maintenance proceedings are badly drafted. Clause 75 (2) (f) isridiculous.It provides that the Court shall take into account the eligibility for social security benefits when determining maintenance, regardless of the wealth of the husband. I can give further examples. All these meaningless clauses and drafting errors appear in a Bill which has been the subject of Senate committee investigations and over 100 amendments during debate in the Senate. The Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted by competent draftsmen. I think it is fair to add that my information and reading suggest that the Parliamentary Counsel's staff had little to do with the drafting of the Bill. In the evidence of the Committee tabled in the Senate on 24 October 1974 at page 135 one will find a quotation from Mr and the family most carefully when contemplatWatson, QC. I do not havetimeto read it. I appreciate that there is little prospect of a resolution to withdraw and redraft the Bill being carried, and I do not move that way. However, I also appreciate that there are many honourable members in the House who are greatly concerned with theflawsthat appear in the Bill. To give all an opportunity of expressing a firm and considered opinion I move: that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the totle believed that the originaal intention of the House is of the opinion that the Bill should give expression famUy was to supply man's everyday needs to the following principles: (a) that the fanuiy is the basic and stable unit of the Australian society; (b) that marriage should be buttressed; (c) that marriage should be permanent and secure; (d) that full and proper recognition be given to the status and rights of a woman as wife and mother; (e) that there should be full and proper protection of the wife and children in the event of the dissolution of a marriage; (f) that there is need for children to be reared and cared for by a present parent; and (g) that marriage should be dissolved only when a Court is satisfied on objective grounds that the marriage has irretrievably broken down or that the parties have lived separately and apan for not less than 2 years. Mr HowardI second the amendment and reserve myrightto speak later in the debate. strongly support this Bill. I am sure that the sentiments contained in the motion moved by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation ( Mr Stewart) are shared by all honourable members of this House, with the exception perhaps of the 2-year period specified, but in my opinion they are sentiments already adequately incorporated in the Bill. This Bill is a logical extension of a private member's Bill introduced by one of my pretice Joske. It is most desirable that legislation of this sort be passed by the Federal Parliament because it must be uniform throughout Australia. This Bill deals primarily with divorce and other aspects of family law which impinge upon divorce. It establishes a family law council which is to advise the Attorney-General on the workings of the Act and by that means and by general public comment the Act may well be extended over the years to cover other aspects of family law. I believe that legislators and their constituents ought to consider the relationship of the state ing legislation which affects the family. From Herodotus, the first historian, to current historians and anthropologists much has been said regarding the great diversity in the size and the structure of the family and of the laws which govern the conduct within and without the famUy. Irrespective of these diversities, however, mankind has always placed enormous emphasis upon the fanuiy, however formed or governed. The family has been the basis of other social groupings. Aristotle saw the vUlage as a union of families and the state as a union of villages. Ariswhereas the state had a broader and less intimate role in establishing beneficial conditions within which the famUy could function. The famUy unit produced stabiUty for the overall society and the state helped to create circumstances in which famUies could prosper and be protected. State interference with the famUy was, however, of a very Umited nature. This is a principle which all modern legislatures should well remember. The Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Trudeau, said a few years ago that the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation. In saying that he was recognising this historic principle. Therefore we must ensure that the law governing the famUy enables its members to cope with their",81,Family Law Bill 1974

When the church was more that continuous year of separation had expired. Even after the secularisation of divorce, ParthatI have seen great hardship, indignity and injustice result from the notion of a matrimonial More contentious than the fact of separation or its cause is the period of separation. The BUI provided originally for one year's separation The Bill contains a sensible provision allowing a period of reconciliation of up to 3 months duration and permitting an aggregation of the separation period before and after this attempted reconciliation. This will enable the parties to attempt reconciliation once more, whereas the absence of such a provision would deter them from breaking the separation period lest their reconciliation fail and they have to start the period afresh. Although the Senate supported the 12 month period and its attendant provisions, there was a minority view that 2 years would have been a more appropriate period. Having read the reports of the Senate debates, I could find no strong reason advanced in support of the 2-year period. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs merely records that 2 of its members-Senato r Durack and Senator Chaney-dissente d from the majority recommendation on the grounds that one year is an inadequate period. They proposed 2 years instead. This is essentially a matter of individual experience and judgment. My experience as a barrister and friend of persons who have been separated leads me to the conclusion that separation is such a major step for a couple who have committed themselves to each other publicly that there is usually a serious breakdown of the marriage before separation actually occurs. I believe that, given the various conciliation and reconciliation provisions and the faculties for counselling available to the couple before commencing proceedings for divorce, a period of one year is appropriate. I do not believe that the public interest in the institution of marriage or in freed from, outweighed the personal opposition the individual lives of parties to a broken marriage would be served by any longer period. Bearing in mind the major nature of the step and the thought that almost always lies behind it, 12 months provides a sensible cooling off period to guard against hasty divorces. If only there were some way of reducing the number of hasty marriages, we might reduce the number of separations and divorces. That, however, is a matter for the family and not the state. Let any who deny this principle ponder how they would have the state act. Next there is the question of a divorce application being strongly opposed by one spouse, even though the parties have been separated for the requisite period and, in the opinion of the applicant-and probably of many observers-the marriage has broken down irretrievably. Some people say, with great sincerity and with considerable force, that no person should be divorced against his or her will. This was a matter which this Parliament faced squarely in 1959. It is one of several reasons why this Bill is not as radical as certain vocal groups have claimed. Any social worker or lawyer with experience in divorce cases knows that many persons refuse to divorce their spouse even when the marriage is spiritually and physically dead. In pretending to support the institution of marriage such bars made a farce and a mockery of marriage. In addition, they caused misery to both parties and often led to a de facto union between the spouse who wanted the divorce and a person whom that spouse would have married had divorce been possible. The tensions created by such unions are well known as are the legal discriminations which then existed against de facto spouses and the children of de facto unions. Murders were even committed as a result of these frustrations, stemming from the refusal of one party to divorce the other. In this Bill, it is quite clear that once the court is satisfied that the parties have been separated for a continuous period of 12 months before the filing of the application, the court must grant a decree unless there is reasonable likelihood of cohabitation being resumed. The rather vague provisions of the 1959 Act have been removed but, in any case, I believe that a study of that Act only makes sense and legal certainty if one concludes that this Parliament, in expressly allowing divorce against the will of one spouse, considered that the individual life of each spouse, the prospects of a sound future marriage for at least one spouse, and the futility of maintaining a legal shell which at least one party wished to be of one person to divorce. Those holding strong religious convictions against divorce will consider this to be a harsh judgment by Parliament. But life in any society requires a constant balancing of rights and interests. It is the Parliament and the courts which must do this balancing. I recognise the embarrassment which such persons will experience in a divorce against their will but I can see no other way for the Parliament to act in accordance with itsregardfor the institution of marriage and the individual lives of most of those whose marriages are moribund and who wish to live a new life probably with a sounder marriage in view. All that the Parliament can do is to protect the interests of the opposing spouse in a material sense. I believe that this Bill empowers the court with sensible discretion to do this. The spiritual convictions of such persons must remain essentially their own concern. In the history of philosophy one of the most discussed matters has been whether marriage is a human institution to be regulated solely by custom and civil law, or a contract under the sanctions of natural law, or a religious sacrament signifying and imparting God's grace or a combination of the last 2 concepts. It is important for this Parliament to recognise that that range of views still prevails and to ensure that its legislation enables the maximum number of individuals possible to act in accordance with their own conscience. Thus, under this Bill, those who regard marriage as purely civil are catered for and those who do not recognise the civil decree absolute may still regard themselves as married in the eyes of God and may regard their spouse as transgressing the law of God if that spouse remarries. Most Australians in 1975 hold views in between these 2 extremes. The passage of this Bill will enable them to give greater effect to their wishes in the event of their believing their marriage to have broken down irretrievably. How they interpret or rationalise their actions is not the concern of the Parliament. It is the duty of the Parliament to provide laws to enable the courts to protect the interests of children and certain spouses. For reasons I shall give in Committee, I believe that this Bill does enable the courts to protect those women who have lost income as a result of spending years at home raising children and contributing to the professional and financial development of the husband. I have endeavoured to trace the history of family-state relationships and the past record of legislation of this type. Concerning the tradition of minimal interference in the Uves of the famUy, the ParUament has a pubUc interest responsibUity which takes 2 forms-that regarding the institution of marriage itself, an institution which is still most respected in our community, and that concerning the individual lives of the parties to the marriage. Those who have aroused the emotion of certain sections of our population and have urged persons to send standard form letters to members of ParUament claiming that the Bill makes a farce or a mockery of marriage have ignored the saUent points that, to preserve in law the appearance of a marriage when the spiritual bond has long evaporated, is to make more of a farce or mockery of marriage than divorce could do. Moreover, I am convinced from the experience of welfare workers that it is far better for children to a broken marriage to be reasonably content with one parent and to see the other occasionafly than to be tormented by the strain of Uving with 2 parents who find that they are not compatible. The organised opponents of this BUI have also ignored the statistical evidence that 75 per cent of persons who are divorced marry again and that very few people are divorced more than once. People do not tend to make a divorce a habit. On the contrary, they tend to raise the status of marriage by making a second successful marriage. They also imagine that because divorce procedures wiU be simpler, faster, less costly and more dignified, there wUl be an increase in the number of divorces. There may well be but that does not mean that there is an increase in the number of broken marriages as a result of this BiU. Merely because there are more parties to broken, farcical, mock marriages who will seek to end their legal union and make their legal and factual status conform does not mean that this BUI wUl contribute to more broken marriages. In this way, more people than dare now may realise and admit publicly that their marriage was a terrible mistake and may seek to be free to learn from that mistake and start again in a new marriage which they intend to be permanent. The people who say this BUI will lead to more broken marriages have little faith in the institution of marriage-the very institution they claim to be upholding. The BUI may lead to more divorces but it is unlikely to lead to more broken marriages. The causes of the increase in the number of broken marriages must be sought elsewhere. If the number of divorces increases because of the passage of this BUI, it wiU be, very largely, because an increased number of people wUl have welcomed a law which enables them to start again without the possibiUty of perjury, collusion or pubUc notoriety. The opponents of this BUI have also faUed to recognize that adultery and the other so-called matrimonial offences were more usually sympathetic of a breakdown of the marriage rather than causative. To the extent that they were causative, the genuine counselling and reconciliation provisions of this BUI wUl help save marriages where the couple have the appropriate maturity, willingness to compromise and desire to remain married. If they do not, ParUament can not obUge them to make their marriage a spiritual reaUty any more than it can legislate fidelity. In short, we wiU not preserve the institution of marriage by limiting the avaUabUity of divorce. This BUI pays common sense regard to the interests of the individuals and the institution of marriage. Other matters relating to the famUy, such as those set out in the Liberal Party's platform, must await later action. I support the Bill as introduced into this House. for Tourism and Recreation ( Mr Stewart) mentioned during his speech that at a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs held in Melbourne in September last year the Chairman of that Committee, Senator James McClelland, described this Bill as a 'radical departure from previous matrimonial causes legislation'. Senator McClelland was later to say at the same meeting that it was 'a drasdc and quite dramatic alteration to the existing legal concept'. Yet the Prime Minister( Mr Whidam) endeavoured to hurry this Bill through this Parliament 5 minutes before the adjournment during the dying hours of the previous session and, due to the acceptance of a motion to adjourn discussion on this Bill, people are now beginning to realise the full ramifications of this legislation as is being shown by the vast amount of correspondence protesting against this Bill arriving on members' desks daily. In my electorate of DeakinI would estimate that I have received some hundreds of letters opposed to the Bill compared with something less than 10 in favour of the Bill and then mostly printed matter emanating from outside the electorate. It has been claimed by the supporters of this legislation that it will help buttress the first place. Every marriage goes through maniage and the family. In some ways it may particularly in the area of maniage counselling and guidance and for this it is to be commended, but it also sets out in detail a pattern and design for the speedy demolition of maniage. This Bill, if it is passed, will allow a man or a we could see couples fleeing to the courts for a woman to walk out on his maniage partner, and quick divorce and then perhaps entering upon their children, move in with his or her fancy of yet another unsuccessful liaison. Where does all the moment and after 12 months demand a divthis leave the children? This legislation is unorce. They can even continue living together in necessary legislation. Under the present law the same house during the 12-month period. No there is adequate provision for a husband or wife court will be able to refuse such a demand. The to separate if their maniage is unworkable and views of the other partner, be he or she innocent to obtain adequate and speedy maintenance and or guilty, will be of no consequence. For those of custody orders. us who remember saying the words 'For richer, for poorer, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part' this Bill changes Government as the 'Family Law Bill'. It should the whole concept of marriage. In the future we be called the 'Divorce Law Alteration Bill' for could well see young couples, perhaps our own that is what it is. No one can deny it is essentially children, standing before some paid appointee of a Bill about divorce and how to make divorce this Government at a marriage ceremony, not easier and more readily obtainable. The effects entering marriage as a contract to be maintained of this Bill could be to transform and destroy the for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, Christian values upon which our family life has till death does them part. Will they not rather go been based in the past. Once the accepted Chrisinto marriage believing that if the going gets too tian principles of the family are eroded the end tough they can just opt out? Marriage could well result must eventually be a lack of respect for the become an experiment instead of a lifelong commitment which can be dissolved only if and when it is proved that one of the parties has engaged in conduct opposed to that commitment. This Bill could cause marriage to become a passing, temporary relationship which can be dissolved at the whim of one of the parties on 12 months notice. How absurd it is that what the law does not allow a person to do in respect of his or her financial contracts, that is, terminate them at will, this Bill will allow a man or woman to do in respect of a lifelong commitment or contract which he has made with his marriage partner. This legislation will alter the ideas, the decisions and the behaviour of future generations of Australians towards marriage. If the law says something is permissible and if young people grow up seeing people acting in a certain way they will tend naturally to accept this as the normal way to behave. Future generations of Australians will grow up under a law which treats marriage as a temporary liaison and little more. They will grow up in a society where speedy termination of such a liaison will be commonplace. They can terminate their marriage for quite insubstantial reasons. Marriage could even well become redundant. Despite marriage counselling, many marriages will break down which otherwise may not have broken down if more thought had been given to the commitment in difficult periods of adjustment at one time or another and all marriages require give and take and understanding on the part of both partners. Easy divorce could cause many not to persevere.

It will cause people to resort to divrepresent women's interests. The newssheet went orce lighdy and wantonly. The Prime Minister also said that the necessity under the existing law to prove fault on the part of the other party promotes indignity, bitterness and hostility in divorce proceedings. I believe these things will still exist under the proposed legislation whenever one party is hurt. The Prime Minister went on to say further that the courts should do everything in their power to avoid promoting continuing hostility between parties after divorce. I say to the Prime Minister that the first priority of the law should be to promote the continuity of marriage rather than legislating hopefully to remove hostility later on. Children need both parents, and people who enter into the marriage contract must realise that not only themselves are involved but also that the lives and future of their children are of paramount importance. People cannot afford to be selfish in marriage, either in regard to their partner or in regard to the children created by that marriage. As I have said, I applaud the clause of the legislation which relates to maniage guidance and counselling. This is a valuable service to a community, but should this legislation pass it will, I am sure, be struggling to cope with the ever swelling numbers of couples opting for the easy way out. The provisions which restrict the publication of evidence and details of divorce proceedings I also applaud.

237,"Able Member For Diamond Valley, Mr Mcken","Older women unable to adapt to changing atutudes will be protected by the fact that many judges are older too, and as much determination, passion and personal have protective attitudes towards women. What sort of logic is this to claim that judges, just because they may be older, will be protective to women? In view of the fact that this year is International Women's Year, it is sad to see a Bill before this Parliament which not only takes away rights to which every Australian woman has always been entitled but which also imposes upon them new obligations. It is an imposition on women of a legal and social duty to which they have never before been subjected in this country. The general majority of women cannot command an income capable of supporting a family, give them adequate housing and security, and then in addition face long hours of domestic work and supporting activities with their children out of school hours. It is all very well for the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) to say: 'Do not worry, we will retrain them. We have the NEAT scheme and we have the RED scheme'. My experience is that there are so many people out of work through the economic policies of this Government there is a waiting list as long as one's arm for assistance under these schemes. This legislation overlooks a woman's incapacity for job continuity and the psychological adjustment which a woman would face. It overlooks that for a lengthy period oftimea woman with children is unable to support herself. Men and women in marriage perform different functions. Their roles are complementary, not equal and interchangeable. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. marriage and special provision must be made by legislators to assist them to perform that function, not only for their own fulfilment but also for the good of their family and society. What is the situation of the older woman in herfiftiesor sixties who has raised her children? Is she suddenly to be told, after all those years of loyalty in raising her family, that she can now go out to work and fend for herself? It has been claimed that this legislation will eliminate the expense, conflict and bitterness presendy associated with divorce actions. The fact is that all this legislation does is transfer the questions of custody, maintenance and disposal of propeity from the divorce court to later court actions. It is not possible for this legislation to transform human nature, no matter how much it may try to do so, for when one partner to a marriage contract feels wronged and hurt he or she, despite the divorce laws passed by this Parliament, will dispute with just expenditure matters of money and property and, naturally enough, the custody of the children. It would appear likely that if this legislation became law even more extended litigation over such matters as these would be required than is the case under the present law. I am opposed to the passage of this Bill in its present form for a number of reasons. I believe that if this legislation is passed as it now stands it will undermine in the minds of many people the whole institution of marriage. I believe that it will create a decreased incentive for couples to overcome the normal difficulties which arise in marriage. The 12 months period of separation as proof of irretrievable breakdown is far too short. It becomes almost laughable that the couple can still go on Uving together in the same house during that period. Even the British law insists on 5 years separation where there is not mutual consent and 2 years separation where there is mutual consent. This legislation does introduce some good measures in the form of marriage counseUing and the prohibition of publicity for the parties concerned. But, in my opinion, the bad outweighs the good. I urge honourable members to oppose this legislation in its present form and to support the amendment moved by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation. the great concern about the FamUy Law BUI. I have, however, done my best to make some inquiries in relation to it and to read what I could on the subject. I must say in clear language that I do not find much foundation in the objections raised to the BUI. I beUeve it is most important social legislation and it isrightthat honourable members should be very concerned with it. It is certainlyrightthat it should receive much attention. Of course, it cannot solve every problem which arises between a man and a woman and their cluldren before, during or after their marriage. But it is necessary for us as members of ParUament to make a judgment on this very complex matter. No doubt during the course of this debate many references wUl be made to the views of people who have practised in the area of divorce. It wUl be seen that one person wUl say one thing and another person wiU say another. I have consulted a number of such people and I have come to the conclusion that those people who beUeve that this legislation wUl be of benefit are right. Therefore I support, in the main, the principles contained in this legislation. As I said, I have spoken to people who can claim to be experts. I",89,Family Law Bill 1974

239,Mr Garland (Curtin) (8.3),"I understandam aware that there is opposition to the legislation. Some of the people to whom I have spoken confidentially have been judges who have sat in judgment on many divorce cases. I believe that this Bill, if it becomes law, will be a social advance and, in brief, I beUeve that it will give practical reUef to those people whose marriages have already broken down. To summarise: I have said that the BUI is complex. I have said that there is a need for aU of us to take advice as to the pros and cons of the legislation and to weigh that advice. AndI have said that I am satisfied with the fundamental principles involved. I want to refer specificaUy to the amendment which has been moved and which is before us. I want to say 2 things about it. The first is that I beare talking about what should be the law of the Ueve that if this amendment is carried it wUl have the effect, if not of defeating the BUI, then at any rate of putting it in a position in which it cannot be debated in the way suggested. What does the amendment do? It makes certain statements with which, with the exception of the last paragraph to which I wUl come in a moment, every honourable member in this House could agree. The amendment begins with the words: 'That all words after ""That"" be omitted'. The words referred to are, of course: 'the BUI be now read a second time'.I know that the amendment goes on to say 'whilst not declining to give the BUI a second reading', but my advice is that notwithstanding the fact that those words are there the amendment has the effect of deferring consideration of the BUI or perhaps defeating it. I am not clear on that point. I suggest that when there has been time to hear more debate on the matter later speakers might make quite clear what the position is. I interpose that sometimeago I was given a paper on this subject. I regret that time did not allow me to get it in order to quote to honourable members from its content. I think all honourable members have to understand clearly that, because of the wording of the opening phrases of the amendment, in voting for it they may in fact be voting against the BUI or deferring it. But, even if that is so, what does the amendment do? It states certain principles with which, as I said, most people could agree, but not amendments to the Bui. Presumably the amendment is some sort of suggestion to the Attorney-General( Mr cases the marriage was over. Therefore I believe Enderby) that he might care later on to move some amendments, or a suggestion that somebody might like to move some amendments, to the BUI and embody the principles outiined in the amendment. It is all rather imprecise. For that reason alone I wiU not vote for the amendment. I have another objection to the amendment. The last paragraph of the amendment reads: (g) that marriage should be dissolved only when a Coun is satisfied on objective grounds that the marriage has irretrievably broken down or that the parties have lived separately and apan for not less than two years. I propose to deal with that point in a moment because I believe that the provision in the BUI which requires only one year's separation is adequate. BeforeI deal with that point I want to refer to the position of those people in our community who have deeply held reUgious beliefs, because I do think that a distinction has to be made. We are talking, surely, about secular marriage. We land which wUl affect all Australians. Many people beUeve that, except in extremely rare circumstances, a marriage between 2 people can never cease as long as they are both living. Of course, they are completely entitled to hold that view. But there is no established church in Australia. There is no Church of England or AngUcan Church estabUshed here as there is in Britain. There is no CathoUc estabUshed church. This is a country in which there is a distinction between what one may beUeve should be good lawI refer to secular marriage and I am aware of the limitation of that term-and the views of those people who have deeply held reUgious beliefs, as is their right. I understand those who have those beUefs. I respect them. I even value them but I say that that is not really what we should now be considering. I do not want to speak for very long but I want to refer to the 4 major criticisms of the BUI. Perhaps one could say they are those criticisms which are so weighty that if one held them-and I do not-on e would have to vote against the BUI rather than concern oneself with amendments. Firstly, there is the question of whether 1 year of separation between the parties is long enough before the end of the marriage. I judge that it is enough because I beUeve that when separation itself begins the parties have been through such a difficulttimebetween themselves-it is not something they have done capriciously, it is something which no doubt they have agonised over-that at thetimethey separated in the great majority of that for one more year to expire is adequate, and making it 2 years adds nothing but hardship. A second great criticism is that women would be disadvantaged by the proposed maintenance provisions. I say briefly that I beUeve that to be fallacious, that the courts will fairly assess the position. A third criticism is that the Bill somehow or other will make divorce easier. I think linked with that is the argument that since it is not necessary under the Bill to prove fault before a marriage can be ended it damages the marriage. I say again that that marriage is over already when itreachesthat stage unless the parties have a deeply held religious conviction, which is something people are entitled to have, and which will bind them together as individuals whatever the law says. I have recounted those criticisms briefly. I bebeen based on the existence of the family unit. lieve they are the main criticisms of the Bill.

AU our discussions must be based on the proposition that Clauses 15 and 16 seem to me to be clauses use of giving greater facilities if people have been encouraged not to observe the sanctity and permanency of marriage? The maintenance provisions of the BUI deserve There is another comment I should like to Whilst it is realised that this is Federal jurisdiction under the Constitution, there are some areas that have to be safeguarded. Following some recent public comment regarding the appointment of a certain judge, it would appear to me to be an eminently suitable argument to advance that the judges of the State family courts should be appointed subject to the approval of the various State Attorneys-General. It is to be hoped that although the Commonwealth is supplying the finance for the establishment and administration of State family courts the States will be in control of their own affairs. It is to be regretted that these natural and fundamental unit of society seems to family courts will be located in large and metropolitan areas to which people will have to go in order to obtain a divorce. People will have different views on these matters which are of great personal significance. But decisions are made in a democratic country and public opinion is moulded on the anvil of discussion and is the aggregate of composite opinion. On matters such as these which are the substance of life, we all, I believe, have the responsibility to express our view. Legislation which should be based on God's law should receive the absolute priority due to it. It is to be regretted that there is a trend running through the proposed legislation which seems to make a wife a trophy to be put on the mantelpiece for 12 months rather than having her occupy the place she so thoroughly and richly deserves on the altar as God's greatest gift to man. I oppose the Bill and support the amendment. Dr GUN (Kingston) (8.28)Iriseto indicate my strongest support for this Bill. By that I mean that I support the general concept of this Bill which I regard as a significant and progressive step. I believe that all those associated with its preparation are to be warmly congratulated. I hope the Bill will not be unduly delayed in this House because, in any case, it may be some time before it is finally given assent. As honourable members are to vote on non-Party lines it seems unlikely that the Bill which emerges from this House will be precisely the same as the Bill which emerged from the Senate. It is probable, therefore, that the Bill will have to be shuttled backwards and forwards between the 2 Houses until a consensus is reached. I hope that honourable members will not add to this delay unnecessarily and that some consensus can be reached on minor amendments to avoid a large number of divisions which could unduly delay the passage of the measure. AlthoughI support the Bill in principle I reserve my right to consider on its merits any amendment that is proposed. I have no legal training and no knowledge of divorce case law. Therefore, I am prepared to be influenced to some extent by those members who have. AllI can hope to do in my short contribution to this debate is to state my views on the concept of marriage and the philosophical basis upon which I support the general objectives of this Bill. The Bill states that the family is the natural and fundamental unit of society. To consider the Bill, I think that this concept requires some consideration. The statement that the family is the me nothing more than a truism, and it is therefore necessary to examine what this sentence is supposed to convey. To me, it seems simply that most adult people choose at some stage of their life to be married. It also means that most children are brought up by one or both parents. That is what this statement conveys to me. Why do most adults choose marriage? They do this by consent for reasons of mutual security, mutual benefit and sometimes, but not always, mutual happiness. But the important thing is that it is consent, and mutual consent. Furthermore, individuals mutually consent to marriage because of the benefits to themselves, not out of any altruistic notion of benefiting society at large. Thus whilst society at large may benefit from the institution of marriage, people enter marriage not for society's benefit but for their own. Some honourable members may remember reading in George Orwell's book' 1984' in which the principal character was quite repulsed by the fact that his wife described sexual intercourse between them as 'our duty to the Party'. I am sure that most people are repelled by the concept that a couple's marital affairs are the business of society rather than their own private affairs. It is therefore a private arrangement with which the intervention of the law should be minimal. It follows that the intervention of the law should be minimal in the dissolution of that mutual arrangement. Consent as the basis of marriage applies even when marriage is under stress, that is, when the partners decide that the benefits of retaining their family as one unit outweigh the benefits of family breakup. This is why most marriages endure. What, then, is the place of the law? The law ratifies a consent agreement, but surely marriage must remain at all times based on mutual consent, and to impose legal enforcement on marriage, even if that mutual consent has ceased to exist, would be to alter completely the existing concept of marriage. It is argued by some that this Bill undermines the concept of marriage. In fact the opposite is the case. The present concept is a relationship which exists by mutual consent, and I am sure this is the concept which all people, or nearly all, have when they marry. But some people seem to be arguing that marriage should be still legally enforced even when that mutual consent breaks down. In other words, when people marry in future it will be on the understanding that some kind of legal compulsion will exist if the mutual, that is bilateral, consent should ever disappear. Surely those are not the terms upon which a marriage should be based. Surely that would be undermining the existing basis of maniage, which is one of trust. This is, of course, acknowledged in the existing law, which provides for dissolution of marriage after a period which was deemed to constitute grounds for determining that a marriage has broken down. This legislation now explicitly upholds the concept of marriage as a voluntary union and a solemn union based on trust. To impose on this union a system of legal compulsion based on arbitrary principles is itself to undermine the basis of marriage. As I noted earUer, people enter a marriage for mutual benefit to themselves, not out of any motive towards society as a whole. It is a private arrangement and not one in which the law should impose rules, apart of course from the ordinary rules of common law applying to all citizens. When the marriage has broken down, the place of the law should be to extend the principles of common law to provide justice to the parties and to the cluldren of the union. This BUI does everything it is possible to do in a BUI to prevent the irretrievable breakdown of marriage. Apart from the provision for counselling and the provision of facilities for counselling services attached to the family court, there is provision for assistance for voluntary marriage counselling organisations. Furthermore, apart from the general provisions for counselhng, there is special provision for those cases where the parties have been married for less than 2 years. This special provision appears in clause 14 (6), and wUl no doubt have special relevance to very young couples who may just need some good advice. Instead of just sitting out thetimebefore the divorce, as can happen now, the court is required to suspend the proceedings for dissolution of the marriage until the parties have considered a reconcUiation with the assistance of a marriage counsellor. It is also worth noting clauses 15 and 16 which provide for counselhng facUities to any party to a marriage, that is, even in the absence of the filing of a notice for dissolution of the marriage. Thus there is every possible facUity to prevent marriage breakdown before it occurs. On the other hand, this BUI in no way facilitates the breakdown of marriage. What the court is asked to decide is whether inevitable marriage breakdown has occuned. Unlike the present BUI, it does not promote marriage breakdown. For example, a single act of adultery on the part of the respondent can at present be grounds for divorce, however contrite the respondent might be. I faU to see why such a case should be grounds for the court actuaUy to promote-yes , promoteirretrievable breakdown when it has not in fact already occuned. Yet that is possible at present. Under this legislation, the court cannot any longer promote mariage breakdown before it has already occuned. AU the court can do now is dissolve a maniage when it is recognised that irretrievable breakdown has occuned-not e the past tense-and only when it is acknowledged that irretrievable breakdown has already occuned can this breakdown be given legal recognition. A number of people have expressed the proposition that one party can desert the other and obtain a divorce, against the wishes of the deserted party after 12 months. CanI make 3 points in relation to this proposition? Firstly, what actuaUy happens in real life? Does the deserted party really want the maniage to continue? Do people really defend divorces to preserve the marriage? My information is that they do not. People defend divorce cases because they wish to contest questions of custody and access, maintenance or property settlement, not because they wish to remain married to the deserting party. To those who say that people wUl have their marriage dissolved against their will by the capricious desertion of their spouse, I would ask: 'Where are the examples of this? Where are all these examples of people who want to contest the divorce, not on the questions of maintenance and so on, but on the grounds of preserving the marriage?' Incidentally, it is worth recording that most divorces now are undefended, and now that the question of fault is to go if this legislation is passed, it is probable that even fewer will be defended. The second point is that where one party deserts and the marriage is irretrievable, a denial of dissolution of the marriage wUl serve no purpose. One cannot compel a deserting partner to return by simply denying the legal recognition of dissolution. It is futUe to maintain a legal facade over something which no longer exists in fact. It is not only futile bui, in my value judgment, wrong. The law should not be an instrument for Old Testament retribution; it should be humane, compassionate and realistic. This Bill is humane, compassionate and realistic. Thirdly, there is clause 48 (3). A respondent who wants to preserve the marriage can place evidence before the court to show why the marriage has not in fact broken down; and, notwithstanding 12 months separation, clause 48 (3) provides that a decree of dissolution shall not be made if the court is satisfied that there is a reasonable likelihood of cohabitation being resumed. Clause 48 (2) which defines what is irretrievable breakdown, begins with the phrase 'Subject to sub-section (3).' This is a necessary safeguard, and surely a quite adequate safeguard. Of course, there are other safeguards such as those affecting the maintenance of children, and properly so, but these appear elsewhere in the Bill. An important question is whether a period of separation of 12 months is sufficient to justify a decision that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. It is difficult to know what is the minicumstances be dependent upon the male. That mum period which could be safely applied. Obviously many marriages could be safely said to be finished forever after one month's separation, or even less, but this would not apply to all. The opinions given to the Senate Committee led a majority of that Committee to beheve that 6 months was adequate in most cases. It decided on a period of 12 months to be safe. Frankly, I do not have the experience to judge for myself. Therefore I feel bound to accept the Committee's findings. AgainI ask those who say that 12 months is insufficient: Where are the examples of 12 months being insufficient? If 12 months is too short a period of separation, surely there must be examples which could be brought to the attention of Parliament of cases where reconciliation has occurred after 12 months. No one has shown me a single example. It should be remembered also that legal dissolution is not automatic; it can only follow the institution of proceedings by one party. So, if there is a prolonged separation, divorce does not necessarily follow and if it does not follow there is nothing to believe that under the legislation as now stop cohabitation from being resumed at any time. Some of those who have submitted petitions to the Parliament on this subject have maintained that a further ground should be inserted, namely, intolerable behaviour. I find that difficult to reconcile with the sentiment that is expressed by the petitioners of the Parliament that the Bill will make divorce too easy because intolerable behaviour, unless it is to be made to run concurrendy with a period of desertion, will constitute an immediate ground for divorce. So it seems to me to be somewhat inconsistent on the one hand to call for divorce to be made more difficult and on the other to request the insertion in the Bill of a clause to provide a ground for divorce of intolerable behaviour, which will constitute an immediate ground and therefore make divorce easier. I would like briefly to say something about the proposition which has been expressed to me and no doubt to other members to the effect that in all circumstances the ex-wife should be maintained indefinitely by the ex-husband. I commend clause 75 (2) to those people who hold that point of view. The Bill sets out a very large number of explicit conditions to which the court must have regard in deciding the conditions of maintenance; It seems to me that the Bill goes to the limit in providing the circumstances which the court must take into account in determining the ability of either party to support himself or herself. It seems to me that the only way in which one can go further than that is to accept the proposition that the female of the species should in all cirseems to me to be somewhat of a downgrading of women. It also seems to me to be an acceptance of the proposition that the role of the female is to be nothing more than an apendage of the male of the species. Apart from that, of course, we have to consider the rights of males. All honourable members no doubt are aware that many men feel that they are being unduly oppressed by many features of the existing legislation inrelationto the payment of maintenance. On the question of costs, I have been rather surprised by the representations that have been made to me about the unjust treatment of the female-perhap s the male also, for that matterwho can be called upon to pay costs in an action that is brought for dissolution of marriage against her consent. I honestly believe that the people who hold this view have not had a close look at the Bill, because under clause 117 the court can take account of all the conditions and the ability of the various parties to pay the costs. I proposed there is adequate safeguard in clause 117. It is worth noting, incidentally, that subclause (3) of clause 117refersto assistance from the Australian Legal Aid Office. As most honourable members would know, the Australian Legal Aid Office, upon its establishment in various parts of Australia, had explicitly set out all Federal legislation as being the basis for the giving of assistance to people who cannot afford to seek private legal advice. I would like to express one minor reservation I have about the Bill. It is in relation to clause 75 (1) (f), which relates to the fact that in deciding, say, the maintenance payable the judge must take into account the eligibility of either party for a pension. Let us take the example of a decision by a court that a wife is unable to support herself and requires outside help. Let us suppose, if i can choose what might be a rather high figure, that in ordinary circumstances the judge were to decide that a maintenance payment of $70 a week by the husband is appropriate and that the court were then to say, having regard to the wife's eligibility for a pension, that the husband need only pay $50 a week and the state will pay the other $20 a week. If it is determined that the ex-wife is unable to support herself, I am inclined to the view that the responsibility should fall upon the other party to the marriage rather than that the rest of the community should be called upon to support her. I will be interested in the reply of the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) to that. I have some reservations about that subclause. Finally, I ask the Attorney-General to give in his reply to the debate on this Bill consideration to my remarks about clause 114, wbich relates to injunctions granted by a court. I have in mind the type of instance where the court might decide that, because of the behaviour of one of the parties to the maniage, it should order that pany to vacate the matrimonial home. It is not quite clear to me whether a period of separation enforced by an injunction of the coun under clause 114 will constitute separation for the purposes of determining that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. I hope that the purport of the query has been made clear. I will be very interested to hear the reply of the Attorney General to that query. Having said that and having expressed a minor reservation, I shall listen with interest and impartiality to what is said in the Committee stage of the debate. But, as far as the general concepts and objectives of the Bill are concerned, I indicate my strongest support for the Bill. shall support the amendment because although Matrimonial Causes Act but I will say that I conthere are many things in the Bill which, in my sider this to be a matter of major importance and view, are good it is, again in my view, a most deI would not want a fundamental change to be fective Bill which should not be passed in its made without some consideration of the prinpresent form. There will be many disagreements ciples involved. about it among us in this House, but surely on reflection there will be unanimous agreement on one point, nam^y, that it was a very good thing on one side or another on this question at this that this Bill was not put through before Christstage. AllI am saying is that here is an absolutely mas without adequate consideration being given major matter which goes to the whole root of the to it. That, I think, is now the unanimous view. I think that changes should be made to this Bill. Detailed changes will have to be made clause by clause. Whether it is by the Committee of the Whole or some select committee, because time may preclude the examination of the Bill clause by clause by the Committee of the Whole, that will have to be done. There are, in addition, matters of major importance which go to the structure of the Bill and the principles behind it. I wish to indicate 4 kinds of matters which seem to me to be objections to the Bill in its present form. I will give examples of them. Thefirstis the matter of drafting. These may seem to be small things, they may seem to be niggling things, but they are important when we are dealing with a Bill of this kind which has such a major and permanent impact on the structure of society. For example, let us look at clause 121 of the Bill which says that in this proposed section 'judgment of the court' includes a report made to a court by an officer. The only trouble about it is that the words 'judgment of the court' do not occur in the clause. This is just bad drafting. There are numerous examples of this kind of thing in the Bill. I have given one example. The Bill has not been looked at with sufficient care because in quite numerous cases the drafting of the Bill is such that its meaning is not clear. Surely we would agree unanimously that whatever Bill we pass, whatever principles we endorse, at least the meaning of each clause should be clear and unambiguous. The second point which I think is wrong is that major matters have not been discussed in the Senate or indeed brought up in this House although they are major changes made by this Bill. I instance clause 51 of the Bill. This clause changes the nature of the prohibited degrees in marriage. The change may be goodI am told that it is made in conformity with the British practice-o r it may be bad, but the important thing to remember is that we are making a major change here and none of us has really turned his mind to the impactions of what we are doing. I would not say at the present moment that I would be against a change in the present AgainI emphasise that I am not coming down",92,Family Law Bill 1974
241,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) (8.48),"I prohibited degrees which are set out in theincest taboo, to the difference between conof people who have re-married. We know that sanguinity and affinity, something that goes back sometimes when people Uve apart even for two for thousands of years into human history and or three months they reaUse that they have made which has been quite fundamental, and we are a mistake. I am not thinking of the period belightheartedly making a change without thirilring tween the decree nisi and the decree absolute as about it at all. I venture the thought that not one being important to enable investigations to be quarter of honourable members have even made; that is a thing of the past. But I do think realised that we are making this major change that this lengthened period is desirable in order and that it is incorporated in the Bill. I would like to give a chance for a final reconciliation. Very to hear considered argument from both sides on Utde harm would be done. this question before I would countenance making a major change. The third kind of objection I have is that this matrimonial offence, which is unhappUy someBill does things which are unrealised and its times all too much a fact-adulter y or some other consequences have not been made clear. Let us matrimonial offence-is excluded. We have protake clause 83 of the Bill as an example. I am vided for only one ground. I do not say that we only giving examples because each one of these should get away from that ground, but there examples can be multiplied into many clauses. If should also be another objective ground. I supwe look at clause 83 we see in it an innocent subport this position absolutely. Unless this is proclause (7)-wbic h says: For the purpose of this section, the coun shall have regard poses and too short for others. to the provisions of sections 72,75 and 76. It does not look much but what it means is that all the orders existing under the old Act can now be upset, even if they are years old, and the whole thing can be overturned. This may be a good thing but it has never been brought to the attention of the House. I would say that the House does not understand what it is doing in passing a clause like this and what really are the implications of that innocent-seeming little subclause. We have not talked about it. We do not realise what we are doing. In a major matter like this it is terribly important that we realise what we are doing. The fourth kind of objection I have to the Bill in its present form concerns matters of major principle. I believe that the Bill ignores the facts of human behaviour and is a kind of pseudoscientific nonsense. Any competent sociologist would recoil from it. Let me give an example of the kind of thing I have in mind in regard to these matters of major principle. I believe that the period of separation in order to establish the fact of irretrievable breakdown of marriage is too short. It is to my way of thinking-certainl y where there is not mutual consent-unreasonabl y short. I would not like the 12 months, which is the period set down in the Bill, to be lengthened to 5 years as it is under our existing Matrimonial Causes Act. I beUeve that 2 years would be a reasonable and proper compromise. I certainly think that the 1 month set down as the period between the decree nisi and the decree absolute is far too short and I see no reason whatsoever why that period should not be lengthened to at least 3 months. After aU, there can be regrets. We know The period is too short, and yet in a sense it is too long, because there is only one ground. The vided the period wiU be too long for some purMr Kevin Cairns-It could be quite intolerable in many circumstances. is certainly too formal. I beUeve that the famUy courts, less formal perhaps than the present courts, are still too formal. I would Uke to see a family court whose decisions would not be without appeal against the respondent, a famUy court in which no lawyers appeared. I think that in the initial famUy court the appearance of a lawyer is itself an offence. I would like to see a famUy court where there was the maximum of informality and the maximum chance of reconcUiation. But if you do that you must give the respondent the chance of an appeal to a court where there is greater formality because there is a chance of applying the principles of law for those who are unjustly treated. SoI say that this BUI is at once too formal and too informal. The BUI has the principle of no fault in it, yet it does have the principle of fault in it. Because maintenance and custody of chUdren are involved the question of fault must be brought in. It is a pure sham to say that this BUI is fault-free when as a matter of fact it still embodies in the most contentious areas the concept of fault. I say that the BUI is unfair to women because it does, unfortunately, give to the man the power of casting off a woman. It is, unfortunately, physiologically irrefutable that a man's sexual Ufe is longer than that of a woman. This is one of the things which is in human nature, and you cannot ignore it in the BUI. Yet, at the same time, it is unfair to men. If a woman commits adultery",97,Family Law Bill 1974
242,Mr Wentworth,"Yes. I say that the Billand becomes pregnant and the period of gestation is less than 12 months, the man has no redress and would have to adopt as his own and maintain as his own a child which he knows is not his own. So it is unfair to women and it is unfair to men. The Bill is ill-considered. These are questions of major principle which I think are inherently wrong in the Bill in the form in which it is before us. I would hope that as well as looking at the Bill clause by clause, the House would have some consideration of the major principles and the way in which the faults in the Bill could be remedied. I believe there is a constructive alternative. I believe that there should be an objective ground as well as 2 years separation. I believe that if we are going to have 2 years separation it should be real separation and not under the one roof. I believe that if there is no consent then the provisions of maintenance and child custody should be strengthened. I am not saying that we should be hard on those people who wish to get a divorce because of an irretrievable breakdown when it is acknowledged on both sides, but if there is no consent then I think we have to think better in relation to the maintenance and custody provisions. Where there is a contest between 2 parties there has to be protection in respect of property and child custody. Some principles contained in the present Actnot the present Act in its entirety-shoul d be preserved. Finally, may I draw attention to a mistake which is being made by the proponents of this Bill. It is a logical mistake which goesrightto the root of the whole matter and which was instanced in the speech of the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun), which we heard a few moments ago. The honourable member for Kingston said that maniage is entirely a private matter between 2 people. If that is so, why do we want marriage laws at all? Why do we have a monogamous rather than a bigamous or a polygamous society? Instinctively when it comes to a point we do realise that marriage is not just a matter between 2 people. It is a matter which concerns the continuity and existence of the nation, and as such we have to try to reconcile the very real values of the human relationship with the very real necessities of preserving the continuity of our national life. We will bring this to what is known as the reductio ad absurdum if we take and accept the principle which the honourable member for Kingston put forward so eloquently and unequivocally and carry it to its conclusion. The conclusion is that we would need no marriage laws at all. That would be something which instinctively the good sense of this House would reject. Because we realise that we do have the necessity for some marriage laws, because we realise that this is an important Bill which is before us, because we believe that it is so much a question of conscience that we can override Party lines as we are now doing, we instinctively realise and accept the fundamental proposition that marriage, although it is a matter between 2 people, is not only a matter between 2 people but also is a matter which concerns the nation as a whole. believe, brings in very much needed reforms affecting relationships between individuals within families. I think it is an answer to the changing social scene that is the product of the materialistic and technological society of which we are now part. If one examines the previous divorce laws one finds that they are largely derived from the pre-185 7 English ecclesiastical courts and are theological in concept and in basis. If one continues this particular study one finds that there are 63 references to marriage in the Bible. No references are direct quotations of God or Christ. Fourteen of the references which deal with the institution of marriage are the opinions of Paul and are expressed as his view of the relationship between the 2 partners in a marriage relationship. We find in both the Roman Catholic and the Protestant traditions no fundamental reference to the relationship of marriage so far as God or Christ is concerned. In fact, this type of investigation reveals that the only references that Christ made to marriage were in terms of answers to such questions as this: If a woman was married to two or three men on earth, who would her husband be in Heaven? There is nothing of substance in the Bible in regard to the fundamental relationship. The law under which we have operated in the past has been preoccupied with the concept of sin. One or other of the partners can obtain relief from unhappiness only if a partner can be labelled as the quilty party and this is proven in a court of law. In these laws, as in many others, we find the view that the inevitability of sin as the cause of all human failure and unhappiness is the rationale for the basis of the law. The church has a preoccupation with sin which has, I believe, led it to the position where in recent opinion polls we find that only one-third of the population of Australia has a strong commitment to the church. In that same sample we find that 55 per cent of these people have a strong commitment to the concept of God. I put the proposition that this",98,Family Law Bill 1974
243,Mr Whan (Eden,"Monaro) (9.7)-This Bill, Ipre-occupation with sin which in the past has riddled the divorce laws is no solution to the problems of a modern community. The church establishes a position of judgment rather than a position of understanding. The church has grown away from the doctrines that Christ taught. He taught the doctrine of understanding; the church preaches a doctrine of judgment. The church does this unconsciously. It defines sin in black and white by saying to the people 'you cannot do this, you cannot drink, you cannot dance, you cannot do so and so'. Once this definition is made there is a judgment implicit in it. As soon as sin is defined in these clear cut terms it creates an atmosphere of judgment of your fellow man rather than an atmosphere of understanding and surely in a situation such as the modern world presents we need that atmosphere of understanding between people more than ever before. It is on that aspect of the previous laws that we as it was in the past. find the greatest fault-the need to prove guilt, the need to demonstrate sin, the need to arrive at future. The future suggests-in fact we can expect a position where a fellow man can judge another. This sense of judgement always has to be it-tha brought to the fore in relationships between past.

It is of no use whistling for the past or wishing for the past. The fact is that these birth control techniques exist. That is a fact that cannot be wished away. It is a product of the technological progress our communities have made. These birth control techniques have introduced a completely new dimension into the role that women play in the commumty at large. Without birth control it was absolutely essential to have a morality and a code of ethics that protected the unwanted child, that ensured that all children were born into an atmosphere of love and understanding-the birth right of every child, the essential atmosphere for that child to develop its personality and to grow.

It seems to me from inquiries that I have received, and which I am sure have been received by you, Mr Speaker, that there is a considerable amount of misunderstanding in the House as to the meaning of the amendment. The copy of the amendment which I have proposes that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting certain following words.

It shocks me to think that an Attorney General and people who have been in this House for 2 years, 3 years, 15 years or 30 years have never bothered to follow the procedures that can be adopted in this House. In this House, when the Opposition moves an amendment couched in terms similar to those used in the amendment that I moved, the Government has always understood that it has had the numbers to defeat such an amendment. The question that we are discussing at the moment in relation to this Bill will be decided on a free vote. Why is it that suddenly at this stage, after 3 Family Law Bills have been introduced, 100 amendments moved and two or three reports brought down, people want to curtail debate in the public House, the House of the people? Why is it that at this stage, because 40 or 50 people in this House have the ability, the decency and the honesty to have a look at the Bill, these types of tricks are pulled?

If this question is carried the amendment moved by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation is defeated and the way will then be open to agree to the question: 'That the Bill be now read a second time'. On the other hand, if the question before the House is defeated and the words after 'That' do not stand, a question will then be proposed that the words of the amendment be inserted. Those words are open to amendment. The effect of carrying the amendment would be that the question for the second reading of the Bill would not be carried. ing what you said, Mr Speaker, would it be in order subsequentiy to carry the question for the second reading of the Bill? tirely if the amendment is carried. correct ruling. would have to be re-submitted or re-drafted. requires close and conscientious scrutiny by the House for one simple reason. All laws on marriage and divorce ultimately affect the welfare and happiness of everyone in the community and, indeed, the welfare of the whole society. All responsible people in the Australian community want a law on marriage and divorce that embodies just and humane provisions for all parties concerned-husband , wife, and children of a marriage. I believe there is common agreement across society that any law affecting marriage, divorce and the family should meet 2 fundamental standards: Firstly, it should strengthen, rather than weaken, the stability, integrity, and happiness of marriage and family life; and, secondly, where the misfortune of dissolution of marriage does occur, the law and its administration should",102,Family Law Bill 1974

273,Mr Lynch (Flinders) (9.37),"This Billensure that divorce proceeds with justice to all parties, and with safeguards to the dignity and due privacy of all concerned. There are some provisions in this Bill which represent an advance towards the humane administration of divorce law. I refer to the separation of Family Court matters from those courts which necessarily deal with criminal offences; the provision for divorce proceedings to be conducted in closed court; the emphasis on the paramountcy of the child's welfare in custody proceedings; the attempts to improve counselling and reconciliation facilities; the proposals thefiUngof the apphcation for divorce. The Bill for a continuing study of matters affecting family stability, the working of divorce law and legal aid-provided , of course, this study is conducted in a genuinely representative way. While these provisions are a positive move towards humanising divorce law and its administration, they are secondary to the main thrust of the legislation before the House. Indeed, the positive effect of those provisions may well be nullified by the consequences of the 2 primary changes which the Bill seeks to make. Honourable members appreciate that a considerable degree of public controversy has centred on 2 principal issues: The new single ground for divorce and therightof one party to dissolve, the marriage irrespective of the other party's wishes. To implement these quite revolutionary changes is clearly the main purpose of the Bill. The other provisions are, at best, supplementary; at worse they could be merely nugatory. I address myself chiefly to these 2 changes. They would introduce into the law affecting marriage and divorce 2 entirely new principles. They intend to transform the legal concept and practice of marriage in ways that will affect all existing and future marriages in this country. These changes do not, I believe, reflect present community values and attitudes, for this very significant Bill the reverse effect, the law should provide would affect the nature of all marriages, not merely those that will end in dissolution. The definition of marriage enshrined in Australian law has hitherto been phrased: Marriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all ethers, voluntarily entered into for life. While we have recognised the need to make provision for divorce, such legislation is in no way meant to diminish the import of the undertaking of marriage as accepted in AustraUa, as a permanent union to be protected by the State until death. Whatever be the exceptions, the generality of marriages rests on the beUef and practice of mutuality of contract and permanent union. This BUI seeks to overturn that belief and that practice. The 12-month separation provision as the sole ground for divorce enshrines an entirely new principle in marriage law. It is, in effect, declaring that henceforth a marriage is a union which can be terminated at any time at the whim of one party, subject to the 12-month procedural delay which the BUI provides. By this legislation, a party to a marriage, no matter how much he or she has been mainly or wholly responsible for the breakdown, can declare that the marriage is ended. That is, the subjective opinion of one party becomes in effect the determinant, provided 12 months separation is estabUshed since states that where this is estabUshed, 'a decree of dissolution shaU be made'. There is no discretion in the court to refuse a divorce. The court is there to rubber stamp decisions already made. The alleged safeguards to which the Senate amendments appear to add are mainly irrelevant to the force of the new principle of marriage which this BUI imports. The delays to proceedings, which a judge may make for marriage counseUing, do not touch the real heart of the matter. For, as the BUI prescribes, after any such adjournment, if either party insists on the hearing being resumed, the judge or magistrate shall resume the hearing as soon as possible. The party that is insistent on divorce has only to wait out the delays, going through the formality of attendance upon a marriage counsellor, as though these various devices did not exist. A divorce will be granted. This BUI claims to buttress the institution of marriage, while at the sametimeit proposes significant reductions in the barriers to divorce. A divorce will now be virtually automaticaUy granted after the passage of 12 months technical separation. I believe that this condition is totaUy inadequate because if divorce laws are to buttress marriage, rather than have impediments to easy divorce so as to ensure that individuals do not enter into marriage without giving serious thought to the responsibUities they are in fact undertaking. Both England and Canada, 2 countries which can be regarded as having a simUar social structure to AustraUa, require significantly longer periods of separation in order to establish a ground for divorce. In England it is 2 years where both parties agree to the divorce or otherwise 5 years, and in Canada it is 3 years, or 5 years when the petitioner has deserted the respondent. It is not difficult to envisage any number of situations in which a period of 12 months separation would be quite inadequate as establishing breakdown of marriage. Such a provision might not allow sufficient time for a newly married couple to work out their differences. One year might be regarded, by a reluctant party to a divorce, as too short a period in which to prove that the marriage had broken down, and in which to attempt to effect a reconciliation. A longer period of separation might be particularly important where young children are involved. This stipulation has the added disadvantage of imposing on the community an arbitrary, and in many cases I believe an entirely unreasonable guideline, for establishing whether a marriage has irretrievably broken down. The customary judicial tests of objective facts to make a judgment are virtually abolished by this Bill. No differentiation is made between individual situations with the blanket approach which the Bill implies. The court becomes simply an institution to record the subjective opinion of one party that the marriage has ended. The contention of the other party becomes irrelevant. The petitioning party has merely to establish the separation time provided by the law. As the former Attorney General himself stated in his second reading speech: There would be no enquiry by the court whether there had 1970, the year before is became effective, to in fact been a breakdown, the separation would be sufficient proof of breakdown The former Attorney-General has alleged that partly explained by improved means of dealing this Bill abolishes the concept of matrimonial with a backlog of cases. However, it is not unfault and thereby rids divorce proceedings of hureasonable, I submit to this House, to suppose miliation and indignity. It has been widely comthat much of the increase is due to the easily mended in certain sections throughout the comavailable grounds for dissolution under the new munity because it purports to do just this. It is Act. Yet the British Act does not make divorce as true that it is most difficult and often times easily accessible as the Family Law Bill 1974 impossible to apportion responsibility for the does. marriage breakdown between the parties to the marriage and attempts to do so often result in grave injustices being done to one of the parties. However, anyone who has read the Bill will be aware that it is completely misleading to claim ance which the Bill will introduce. This legisthat the concept of matrimonial fault has been lation, as I interpret it, seeks to provide for radremoved from divorce proceedings. It is true that ical alteration to the principles on which mainthe former Attorney-General has sought to elimtenance is determined. I believe that the combiinate the concept of fault from the area of the disnation of the proposed maintenance provisions solution of marriage, but he has been unable or and the 12 months separation provision as the unprepared to eradicate it from the areas of cussole ground for divorce will transform the nature tody and maintenance proceedings. In these and legal concept for maritalrelationships.They areas the Court is still able to take into account will educate people into a concept of marriage the conduct of the parties to a marriage. The former Attorney-General claimed that the tices on innocent parties. Australian society's removal of fault from the dissolution of marriage views of marriage and practice, notwithstanding virtually eradicates the indignity of divorce. the present trend towards equality of male and However, surely the very fact that a marriage has female roles, is I believe that the husband finanfailed and that the parties to it seek a legal decially in the generality of cases supports his wife, cision on this point is the cause of most of the while the wife supports her husband in the home indignity and demoralisation. If the question of conduct in a marriage is to be transferred to the area of maintenance and custody proceedings, it can hardly be considered less essentially degrading and humiliating to restrict the bitterness in a divorce to costly legal batdes over money and children. Surely if the court is to examine the conduct of the parties to a marriage at any stage it should be in the area to which it is most relevant; that is, the dissolution of the marriage. Both English and Canadian divorce legislation include the concept of fault when establishing whether or not a marriage should be dissolved. The Canadian law provides for various grounds which represent a combination of fault and nofault grounds; while the new English legislation stipulates that there shall be only one ground for divorce, that being irretrievable breakdown of marriage. However, in order to establish this ground it is first necessary to prove one of 5 facts, three of which are fault grounds. It is interesting to note that the new English legislation, which was regarded as a considerable liberalisation of divorce law, was followed by a substantial increase in the number of petitions for divorce. The numbers increased from 55 007 in 1968, the year before the Act was passed, and 71 661 in 110017 in 1971 and 109 822 in 1972. This increase in divorce petitions in Britain may be Let me turn now to the provisions on maintenand family responsibilities that will be destructive to family life and may impose grave injusenvironment, particularly during the child-bearing years. The law has reflected this practice over which can be difficult, again the onus is on her, a long period. I believe that on this relationship the innocent party, to prove her need. Physically the very stability of family life rests and most he may still be able to work. But during, say, 10 particularly does the welfare of the children rest. years spent in carrying out her responsibilities of A woman fulfilling her home making role is norraising and caring for a family she has lost touch mally engaged in a fulltimeoccupation which with the pre-marriage work in which she was generally precludes her from earning income employed.

This Bill would must compete for employment with younger, radically change these fundamental relabetter-trained and more recently trained emtionships between husband and wife on which ployees. the cohesion and stability of family life rests. The There, in addition to the problems imposed on Bill states: A party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party, she has now to bear the added burden of proving to the extent that the first mentioned party is reasonably able her need for maintence and paying her costs in to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately. Thus by one stroke this provision would remove marriage and the family, is to be further from the husband bis present legal duty to mainpenalised by this legislation while the husband, tain his wife. The onus is on her to prove her whose misconduct has caused the harm and the need for maintenance. It imposes on the wife a break, is to be exonerated by the law from repositive, primary legal duty to maintain herself. sponsibility. It imposes on the wife a positive legal duty to maintain her husband in certain circumstances just as it imposes a legal duty upon the husband former Attorney-General's claim that the Bill to maintain his wife only in certain circumwill dissolve marriages with the 'maximum fairstances. This new principle goes far beyond simple sion of injustice. questions of maintenance after divorce. It imports an entirely new concept into husbandwife relationships within existing and all future Bill have gone some way to moderating the origmarriages. I do not believe that the general public has any intended by this legislation. real appreciation of the total implications which this change foreshadows. What is more disturbing is the injustice which this provision will life in general? impose on the innocent party.

Because she knows that at any time her partner can decide it is all ended and she will have to face the likelihood of mamtaining herself. She can have uttle confidence that under this Bill the law will protect her dignity, much less herfinancialwelfare. I believe, therefore, that it would be in a sense of irresponsibility if this House were to pass this Bill without significant amendments. To do so would be to grant the law's blessing on the guilty and the irresponsible, to impose harsh and unjust burdens on the innocent, and, ultimately, to undermine the stability and integrity of family life. I support the amendments that have been proposed. They give expression to a series of basic principles. These principles must be incorporated as the essence of this legislation if Australia is to have a Family Law Bill which generally and genuinely buttresses the institution of marriage and protects the family unit. (9.56)I am not one of those members who have come into this chamber this evening with a lengthy pre-prepared speech revealing that I am unaware, as the Attorney-General( Mr Enderby) has pointed out to all members, that the proposed amendment negates our opportunity to discuss the Bill further. One of the regrettable features of this entire debate is that some honourable members totally opposed to the Bill have masqueraded as open minded people. They have presented an amendment which virtually asks all honourable members if they believe in motherhood. The right answer to that question would mean kaput for the entire Bill. It is unfortunate that the amendment has been couched in such terms because a strict application of the Standing Orders of this House would virtually preclude meaningful debate. When I examine the amendment proposed by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation ( Mr Stewart) I realise that I can answer yes to all of the questions it poses. I believe that the family is the basic and stable unit of Australian society. On the other hand I am not completely convinced that the Family Law Bill of 1974 does not already spell that out. I came to this House early this week with an open mind after having done considerable reading and having listened to the views of many people. But having discussed the subject. I cannot be sold on the view propounded by the Minister when he proposed his amendment. I do not believe it does what the honourable members for Deakin( Mr Jarman), Darling Downs( Mr only at the stage when their marriage has gone McVeigh) and others say it does. I believe the position is far from what they suggested. I agree that marriage should be buttressed, that it should be permanent and secure. These are questions the amendment poses. How many people enter marriage with the view that if divorce is easy that marriage is all right? Until recenttimesdivorce has not been simple; it has not been inexpensive. Does that mean that over the years people have not married because of those factors? Every day in every city in Australia thousands of people enter the state of matrimony. The amendment claims that full and proper recognition be given to the status andrightsof a woman as wife and mother. I do not believe that those who support the Bill as it stands disagree with that concept. SoI could go on. Regrettably, one of the previous speakers showed a lack of judgment when he said that earlier he did not have very many feelings about this legislation but that he has now had many letters and therefore he had come out against the Bill. I remember when the abortion issue was before this House. I received some 1300 letters on that occasion. I would have received approximately 50 letters opposed to this Bill and perhaps 15 in favour of it. Public reaction to this Bill has not been nearly so great as that relating to the abortion issue. An honourable member who bases his judgment and his vote simply on the volume of mail that he receives in his office has surely reached the time when he should stop and look at himself to determine whether he is a person worthy to continue in this place. Looking further at the letters we have received on this matter, we find they are motivated very much by the Church. But within the Church itself tremendous divisions exist on this question. In my city of Brisbane, the Anglican archbishop says: 'Go ahead; it is all right'. In other areas, Anglicans are against this Bill. In some areas, Baptists are dead against the legislation while in other districts Baptists are in favour of it. This is an issue which should not be considered on the basis of church divisions but rather on the viewpoint of each individual member. I repeat what I said earUer: I believe that people do not get married to become divorced. That is half of the substance of the whole issue. Through every one of the speeches of those who oppose completely this BiU and who propose this amendment runs the thread which suggests that the passage of this BiU wiU mean that people will race off, get married, separate, and then be divorced. I suggest that even today under the present laws, people start the process of divorce upon the rocks. I know-thi s is one of the aspects",103,Family Law Bill 1974

But this arfanuiy. gument still does not get away from the fact that the vast majority of those who are divorced these days suffer tremendous pains and penalties in meeting the requirements of the process. It is apt that in 1975 we are re-examining the entire divorce process in AustraUa.

But if a household is not normal, it is only proper that we examine the degrees of abnormahty under which Stirling asks: 'What penalty?' Let me deal with chUdren must live. So often a marriage has just another furphy, in answering that query, by held together because one partner cannot afford referring to the paragraphs of sub-clause (2) of separation or divorce, or because that would be clause 75. Some honourable members said this inconvenient, or for some other reason. This is a afternoon and this evening that because nastifar unhappier situation than a maniage which ness in the early stages of divorce would be breaks asunder and which results in the chUdren avoided under this BiU, it would be reintroduced of that marriage being awarded to one parent when the maintenance provisions were deterwith access being granted to the other parent.

I believe that it is high time we considered ways and means of ensuring that particularly young people-the very young-canno t simply run into marriage at three or four days notice. There has been talk about wanting to buttress the state of maniage. One way of doing it is by ensuring that marriage is not so easy, introducing a system whereby something like 3 months notice is needed and requiring that the priest, clergyman or celebrant must have at least two or three discussions in a counselling way with those who are being married. That should be done. I acknowledge the point raised by some prethey do not Uke it.

277,Mr Sullivan (Riverina) (10.13),"Withmarry. When we make laws to help these people we must make certain that we do not make the majority suffer. This Bill will do exacdy that. It will weaken the marriage contract, which in turn will lead to a weakening of the family as a basic unit of our society. Who would honestly go about the task of helping one party well knowing that hundreds and thousands of others would suffer as a direct result of that help? The Bill provides for only one basis for the dissolution of a marriage-1 2 months separation. This is a profound and revolutionary piece of legislation. It proposes a major change in the social structure of the Australian society. Because of that we must consider it carefully and look at the implications before we decide that Australia should take such a step. This is not really the time for platitudes or this Bill until the Parliament resumed this year. I for legalistic arguments about the sordid aspects of divorce. This is the time to think about the consequences of this legislation for all men, all women and all children of this generation and future generations in this country. What is it, in this legislation that will weaken the marriage contract? I assume that all honourable members agree with the proposition that the maniage contract is an on-going contract. It is one that requires a continuing contribution from both partners if it is to succeed. Effort on the part tions and ministerial statements had to be conof one is not sufficient. Here we have the real thrust of this Bill. It would permit the contract to be broken by the unilateral decision of one partner. Clause 48 proposes no objective test to ascertain that there has been an inetrievable breakdown, other than separation for a period of 12 months. Again let me say that there is room for reform in the existing Act. For example, we could substitute 2 years for 5 years as the period of separation. We could join together the grounds for divorce so that they are replaced by one ground, namely, conduct by one party justifying the other in withdrawing from cohabitation. But there is neither room nor mandate for divorce by abandonment. Whilst clause 48 is in my opinion the most dangerous clause of this Bill there are many others as unacceptable in the way they are written. I want to elaborate on only one clause because other honourable members who see the weaknesses of this Bill will speak about them. The proposal to which I refer is now in clause 117 which says that, in the event of a divorce being defended on any ground, each party shall pay his or her own costs. The effect of this provision is that if, for example, a wife is deserted and becomes involved in a defended maintenance proceeding she not only has the advantage of being deserted but also has the privilege of paying for it. This is irresponsible legislation. We, as men and women, are brought together to consider the needs of the community. We are not here to satisfy the wants of the few. Consequently we must reject this legislation. I do not commend it to you, Mr Speaker, or to the honourable members of this House. to traverse the ground that has been covered by other honourable members. I confess that I did not anticipate that I would be speaking in the debate at this stage. I want first to comment on the action which I took last year, with the support of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), when I moved a motion-h e seconded it and it was carried by this House-to postpone confess that I am amazed by some of the letters that I have received relating to the action which the honourable member for Macquarie and I took. I thought that any person of reason would appreciate that as about 100 amendments were made to the Bill in the Senate, it would have been completely and absolutely inesponsible for this House to consider the Bill with the thought of passing it in 3 days in the closing stages of the session during which other business such as quessidered. It was with that thought in mind that the honourable member for Macquarie and I took the action that we did on that occasion. I want to comment on the statements made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Whan). Every person is entitied to his own particular opinion, and I think that honourable members are aware of my background, but I would hate to think that the words spoken by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro are anywhere near the truth. He implied that the church was outmoded, that it was not needed and that nowadays there was no real thought about the principles and the standards of the Christian church. As I said, every man is entitled to his own particular opinion but I must say that if that is the opinion of the honourable member for Eden Monaro the facts completely disprove what he said. I think it would be most unfortunate if there were even a grain of truth in the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. He spoke about a need for understanding and tolerance. I say to the honourable member that it has been my responsibility to marry people who have been divorced. To that degree within the Christian church there is an aspect of understanding and tolerance and the qualities about which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro spoke. But there is one thing upon which the",109,Family Law Bill 1974

I am now referring to the primary vote only and not to the preferences that were counted as a result of three or four corthe length and breadth of AustraUa who are very nered contests. When the honourable member for Corio makes a statement in this chamber he should get his facts correct. If he is concerned about the result in Queensland and the fact that the AustraUan Labor Party won only 11 out of 82 seats contested, he ought to stay at home and do a Utde homework to try to get a few facts and figures that the people of Queensland and the people of Australia are prepared to accept. I issue a warning to the Prime Minister( Mr chamber, and virtually compeUed to stay here Whidam) who appears to be running on Unes similar to those of the Labor Party in Queensland. I want to raise another point tonight. A number of people have spoken to me about the excessive expenditure by the present Labor Government. It is not a case of only the odd person raising this; it is being raised by many people. I refer first of all to an advertisement which has appeared in many newspapers. Strange as it may seem when an advertisement appears in a newpaper, irrespective of whether it is in a country or a metropoUtan area, naturaUy enough it means income for that newspaper, but I am amazed at the number of editors who have made reference to this advertisement. Virtually they have said: 'This is pretty good stuff; do not stop it. But we do not beUeve in the principle'. I have the advertisement with me. newspaper it was in; it was in most country you may. I also have with me a document ennewspapers. a bit more about the advertisement. The people payers' funds.

It depicts a graph and mentions tax deTurning to a larger document, I have here a copy ductions on home loan interest payments and of the 'AustraUan Government Digest 1.4'. It so there is a reference to income tax rates being happens that this is the 1973 edition. reduced by the AustraUan Government. What this Government is doing is advertising itself, not the AustraUan ParUament where the final dethese reports an account of what the Leader of cision is made. In other words, the Government the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) has said or what is advertising the Labor Party. This is what the any front bench member or the Leader of the people object to. I see no large advertisements, Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony) has paid for by the taxpayers, presenting the views of said. Everything in these reports deals with the the Liberal Party, the Country Party or any other political party. Only the Labor Party is being advertised. There are many people throughout critical of this. I also have with me a booklet entitled 'Report '74' and sub-titled 'A statement made in the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister, the Honourable E. G. Whidam, QC, M.P., on Thursday, 5 December 1974'. Many honourable members wUl recall that occasion. We saw the Prime Minister standing at the Table. He went on hour after hour and all of this report is incorporated in Hansard. Those of us who were in this because it was the close of the final pariiamentary session in 1974, thought it was bad enough having to Usten to the Prime Minister, let alone having to read it in Hansard, but now we are issued with this document. I do not think it would have been paid for by the Labor Party nor would it have been paid for by the Prime Minister, so therefore it must have been paid for by the Government with taxpayers' money. cost but it is a very nice document. It even has a photograph of the Prime Minister on page 2. Glossy paper has been used. The report is set out very nicely. But anybody who wants to read what the Prime Minister had to say can get it from the Hansard record. This wastefulness is the sort of thing that people object to.

The Government is not satisfied with giving members one copy; they give them 2 copies. I do not even read one copy so how am I going to read the second one?

301,Mr Speaker,"No. Everything is in order.has been done at the cost of the Manly ferry service which affects the electorate of the honourable member for Warringah and, perhaps to a lesser extent, my electorate of Mackellar. I would not say we are very glad to, but we are certainly amenable in helping Hobart cope with the effects of the disaster. The people of my electorate have been disadvantaged by the transfer of a ferry to Hobart but we are primarily, of course, a Liberal electorate and therefore a generous one, and we see the need of the people in Hobart. I have asked the Minister for Transport ( Mr speak. I hope that the honourable member wdl Charles Jones) to look at the quesuon of the rehabilitation of a ferry known as the 'South Steyne' so that it could be made available to the people of Hobart on a temporary basis while their emergency lasts, and subsequently could come back to Sydney and be used on the Manly run. The 'South Steyne' is a fast ferry, it can carry about 1700 people and it has, I believe, a top speed of some 17 knots. This large fast ferry will require wharfage facilities. I have had a look at this aspect and I believe that the necessary wharfage facilities could be made available in the Hobart area if the ferry were provided. The 'South Steyne' was put in dock. While there she suffered from afire.The cost of refurbishing her may be somewhat considerable because not only have the effects of the fire to be made good but also some of the plating in the hull will need to be replaced, particularly since this ferry crosses the Sydney Heads and sometimes has to meet heavy seas. The cost of refurbishing the vessel isrightoutside the funds available to the present State Government. However if the Federal Government provided the funds we would have a vessel available for the Hobart service within three or four months which could meet many-no t all, of course-of the traffic troubles that at present exist in that city. Such an arcrew members still missing. Cars using the bridge rangement would release some of the smaller and inadequate ferries which could be used temporarily on the Manly run until the 'South Steyne' became available. The honourable member for Franklin might be interested in my proposal. He is to speak after me in this debate. I hope that he will take the opportunity of co-operating in this scheme and helping me to put representations to the Federal Minister for Transport. Funds which are perhaps out of the question for the Government of New South Wales are well within the ambit of the Federal Government in relation to its function of helping in respect of the consequences of a disaster. The Tasman Bridge accident was a disaster and it has put the citizens of Hobart to very considerable inconvenience. I would like to see a co-operative venture under which the 'South Steyne' could be refurbished in three or four months. The wharfage could befixedat the same time. We would have a fast large ferry for the Hobart run while the emergency exists, and then the refurbished ferry could be returned to the normal Manly run to the great advantage of the people of the electorates of Mackellar and Warringah. I will conclude my remarks at this point because I believe the honourable member for Franklin wishes to co-operate with me in making representations to the Minister for Transport to do something which is to the immediate advantage of Hobart, to the eventual advantage of my electorate and which will, I think, help him in his temporary difficulties. will have to travel at about 25 knots to get in the few words I want to say. Firsdy, let me acknowledge that we in Tasmania, and certainly I personally, concede quite openly the generosity and liberalism of the assistance we have received from the New South Wales Government. This is only the second occasion on which I have spoken in the adjournment debate in mytimein this Parliament. Therefore tbe subject matter I want to raise this evening is of very great personal concern and of equal concern to the people of Tasmania and, in particular, to the people of my electorate. At 9.26 p.m. on Sunday5 January the 'Lake Illawarra' crashed into the Tasman Bridge. A span of this lovely bridge came down sinking the 'Lake Illawarra' almost immediately which resulted in 9 recorded deaths, including 3 members of the crew of the 'Lake Illawarra' with 2 plunged into the Derwent River causing 6 known deaths. One vehicle is still unaccounted for. I am well aware that a marine court of inquiry is now investigating this disaster. Therefore I make no comment upon the reason for the disaster. It would be improper for me to do so. However, some 40 per cent of the people in my electorate have been affected by this great disaster, and I want to make one or two observations on how magnificently individuals and organisations have responded. I particularly want to pay tribute to the Australian Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) who responded immediately to the call of myself and my colleague, the honourable member for Denison( Mr Coates), for an immediate inspection of the bridge and consultation with the State Government.

312,"Mr Mcleay Asked The Treasurer, Upon Notice:","(2) If so, what is the position of deposit-holders who have been promised tax concessions rather than tax penalties by the Government on these bonds. Dr. J. F. Cairns-The answer to the honour member's question is as follows: able member's question is as follows: (1) The surcharge will apply, subject to the taxable income exceeding $5,000, to interest on Special Bonds as much as to interest on deposits with building societies, etc. It will not apply to retirement benefits, whether received as superannuation pensions or lump sums, but income derived from reinvestment of a retirement benefit is property income to which the surcharge will apply if taxable income exceeds $5,000. (2) Investors in Special Bonds receive interest and in addition, where the Bonds are held for a specified period, the amount payable on redemption exceeds the amount subscribed. No tax concessions attach to the interest which is, therefore, properly subject to the surcharge. The excess on redemption, however, is treated as exempt income for tax purposes; it is not subject to tax nor, therefore, to the surcharge on tax payable.

329,Mr Morrison,"The answer to the honourableCorporation under the Australian Wool Harvesting Program. (2) For the current financial year, CSIRO will be spending approximately $276,600 from Treasury sources and the Wool Research Trust Fund. The Australian Wool Corporation will be making available $357,400 to other bodies from the Wool Research Trust Fund. (3) The CSIRO Divisions of Animal Physiology and Applied Organic Chemistry are conducting research into chemical defleecing along the following lines: (i) the potential of agents that act by preventing cell divhonourable member's question is as follows: ision in the wool, (ii) the potential of agents known to inhibit wool growth by other (unknown) mechanisms, (iii) fundamental studies of the mechanisms of wool growth, follicle function and the action of the defleecing compounds, (iv) the supply of defleecing compounds from natural sources and by organic synthesis. The CSIRO Division of Textile Industry is investigating the use of rugs to protect the fleece from dust and vegetable fault and as an adjunct to chemical defleecing. The CSIRO Division of Animal Genetics is studying the wool and body characteristics that make for easy and fast shearing, particularly those that are highly heritable. (4) Progress is as follows: Chemical defleecing: (i) cyclophosphamide was found to be effective as a defleecing agent but has undesirable side-effects, including the permanent inhibition of some wool follicles. (ii) Steroids such as Cortisol gave unpredictable and variable effects, not only on different sheep but on different body regions of the same sheep. Some animals were defleeced, while others merely grew a band of weakened wool. The amino acid mimosine has given the best results to date. Commercial application is not envisaged at this stage because much more work must be done to determine whether it would be effective under farm conditions, whether it could be produced in adequate amounts at acceptable costs, and whether it would be acceptable to regulating authorities. (iii) Mimosine is being used as a model compound to gain a better understanding of the biochemical pathways involved in defleecing. The active components of the wool follicle have been isolated and used to synthesise the components of the wool fibre under laboratory conditions. Tests to screen and assess potential defleecing agents have been developed from the follicle components. (iv) A readily-available natural source of mimosine has been identified and a method of extracting mimosine developed. The laboratory synthesis of other (analogous) agents is in its early stages. Rugging: Trials have been in progress to improve the resistance of the plastic material to sunlight and to make it colour-fast. Rugs can now withstand twelve months outdoor exposure and hold their colour. Improvements in rug design are being sought Easy Shearing: The work is progressing but no results can be reported at this stage.

(3) Normally, circulation is 70 to the press gallery plus about 20 to interested individuals. (4) The incidence of press releases issued by the Special Minister of State is not high enough to warrant isolating costs from the total vote. (5) In the Department of the Special Minister of State, there is one public servant who, as the occasion arises, distributes press releases. However, this is only a minor part of that person's duties.

(6) Will the report be made public. able member's question is as follows: (1) The Working Party has commissioned several studies, some of which have been completed-other s are still in progress. These include: A survey of social welfare manpower in Western Australia and Queensland. A discussion paper on Community Development and Training. A survey of teaching resources in schools of social work. Information on existing and proposed courses is being collated together with all available data on existing manpower resources to form the basis for projections. The lack of a registration requirement for some welfare personnel presents difficulties in data collection. (2-4) No reports have, as yet, been made to me. (5) An Interim Report from the Working Pany to the Commission is expected in February 1975. After Commission acceptance, this will be transmitted to the Government through me. (6) Reports of the Social Welfare Commission are tabled in the Parliament.

Salary Subsidies for Handicapped Services Organisation: This will extend staff salary subsidies in sheltered workshops to 50 per cent for all approved position and introduces similar subsidies for staff employed in activity centres, training centres and residential projects. During thefirsttwo years of operation of the new service, salaries may be subsidised at the higher rate not exceeding 100 per cent of the salary. Provision for the extended subsidy is contained in the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act recently passed by Parliament. 2. Subsidies for the Establishment of Services for Handicapped People: This will increase the rate of subsidies for eligible organisations wishing to establish sheltered workshops, training centres and hostels for handicapped persons from the present rate of $2 for$l to $4 for$l. Provision for this is contained in the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act. 3. Sheltered Workshop Incentive Allowance: This means-test free allowance is available to all disabled people employed in approved sheltered workshops who are in receipt of sheltered employment allowances and is paid in lieu of the present means tested supplementary assistance.

The Report recommended the establishment of an Australian National Gallery and a broadly-based National Collection, and these principles have been endorsed by succeeding Australian Governments since that time. In February 1973 an Acquisitions Committee for the AustraUan National Gallery took over the role of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Boad which had formerly been responsible for acquisitions for the future AustraUan National Gallery.

(2) The Grants Commission did not calculate grants on a per capita basis. Grants were assessed by taking account of the revenue raising capacity of each individual council and of the cost disabUities experienced in the provision of ordinary services.

Mr Lionel Bowen-The Postmaster-General has provided the following answers to the honourable member's question: (1) The Broadcasting and Television Act 1974 (No. SS of 1974) provided by Section 10 that Ucence fees might be refunded in respect of the unused amount, except in cases where the Postmaster-General otherwise directs. (2 and 3) When aboUtion of the Ucensing system was being considered the Government estabUshed that the cost of making refunds for the unexpired portion of aU Ucences purchased during the 12 months to 17 September 1974, would have exceeded $30m. If that amount had to be found aboUtion of the Ucensing system could not have proceeded. However, the Governmernf decided that the long-term benefits for aU listeners and viewers would outweigh the Umited disadvantages in thefirstyear and decided that no refunds would be made in respect of Ucences due for renewal to 17 Sept. 1974. Subsequent events have confirmed that the decision was welcomed by the community in general. It will be appreciated that crediting the unused amount to a person's telephone account is only another means of allowing a refund and in the circumstances cannot be considered in view of the Government's overaU decision on refunds.

At present, a periodical visiting service to adjacent towns is provided from existing regional offices. As the decentralisation program expands to the larger centres, there wUl be a consequent increase of this visiting service to the smaller towns. The Department is, however, conducting an experiment with a caravan in certain areas of South Australia and wUl be assessing whether such an approach should be adopted in other States in a few months' tune. In Western Australia, road conditions in some of the remote areas might prove a limiting factor.

(6) Would the Postmaster-General release details of any could be carried out on another site. analysis that may have been done to suppon the contention that it is necessary to centralise the proposed building for operational as well as economic reasons. Mr Lionel Bowen-The Postmaster-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The proposal to construct a Post Office Administrative Centre at the northern end of Forrest Place, Perth, has been re-examined in the light of the changed circumstances which will arise with the formation of the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, as recommended by the Commission of Inquiry into the Post Office. The re-appraisal of accommodation requirements has led Departmental management to the firm conclusion that the headquarters offices of the Postal and Telecommunications Commission in Western Australia could not be satisfactorily housed in the proposed Administrative Centre. Accordingly, action is being taken to seek cancellation of the reference of the proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. Alternative plans for the long-term accommodation of the State headquarters of the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions are now being developed. These plans do not envisage the use of any part of Forrest Place, other than the areas occupied by the Perth G.P.O. and the adjoining Departmentally owned Central Hotel property, for future staff accommodation. (2) to (6) The other matters raised in this question relate to the former plans to construct a Post Office Administrative Centre across Forrest Place. In view of the planned abandonment of the project it is not proposed to provide further details in answer to the honourable member's question unless he advises that the information is still required.

Action is being taken to withdraw the reference of the proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and repon. In these circumstances answers to the ten points raised in the Honourable Member's question do not appear to be necessary. However, should the honourable member indicate that he still requires this information, it will be supplied to him.

Trade, upon notice: (2) Can he say whether (a) critically high mercury contamination levels are apparent in foodstuffs obtained from exports to South Africa in each of the last 5 years. animals fed on whale meal and whale solubles supplied by Cheynes Beach Whaling Company, as claimed in submissions to the Metallic Contamination of Seafoods Subcommittee of the National Health and Medical Research Council, (b) mercury concentrations in persons consuming member's question is as follows: foodstuffs obtained from animals fed on whale meal and whale solubles could be of a critical level, (c) exports of Japan and Hong Kong would have critical mercury contamination levels, (d) Cheynes Beach Whaling Company supplies approximately 4000 tonnes of mercury contamiand poultry feeds to Australian farmers every year and (e) action can be taken to remove whale meal and whale solubles from the stock and poultry feed additives market if it is true, as stated by the West Australian Commissioner for nation of Seafoods Sub-committee of the National Health and Medical Research CouncU, that these products are contaminated by critically high mercury levels. (1) I am aware of the press reports. These refer to experimental work in Western AustraUa to determine levels of mercury which could result in poultry from atypical feeding feed containing unusually high levels of whale meal. The reports are substantially correct but they do not refer Investigations by the relevant authorities in Western local markets containing mercury levels higher than those recommended by the National Health and Medical Research CouncU. (2) (a) There have been no formal submissions to the Chairman of the Metallic Contamination of Seafoods Sub-committee. Information has, however, been given to the Sub-committee to indicate the results of the above experiments. (b) There is no evidence to support the contention that critical levels of mercury are present in any persons who have eaten foodstuffs from animals fed on whale meal. (c) The mercury levels in exported whale solubles are similar to those in whale solubles used as protein supplements for Australian livestock without hazard to human health. (d) Approximately 4000 tonnes of whale meal and whale solubles are supplied to stock feed manufacturers yearly in AustraUa. This represents less than 2 per cent of the protein-rich concentrates from all sources used for stock feed manufacture. (e) Action is not required to remove whale meal and whale solubles from feed additives in view of the fact that the only products for human consumption found to contain high levels of mercury result from experimental conditions, including altered feeding practices.
