No interference has been or w ill be made in that regard. nouncement made by the Prime Minister that 300,000 tons of shipping freights have been secured to meet the export of wheat, and to the fact that this w ill suffice for only 11,000,000 bushels, whereas the ex-Prime Minister estimated that thig season's crop would amount to 160,000,000 bushels, I desire to ask the PrimeM i nister whether he will let the House know what arrangement he is making for consignments in excess of an export of 11,000,000 bushels? regarding the amount of freight available is that which was promised by me on behalf of the Conference. We. are engaged every day in securing more freight. Our business is to obtain all the freight available. I ask the farmer to remember that the arrangements made by the Commonwealth and States aim at enabling him to secure the f u l l f.o.b. price. The amount of freight available will probably not be sufficient to remove the whole of the crop that we expect before June next. The greatest crop yet grown in Australia was, I think, that of the year 1914, when we exported about 1,600,000 tons. It is anticipated that about 2,600,000 tons will be availahle on this occasion for export. The quantity of wheat for export being very much greater, and the amount of world's freight being very much less, than ever before, it is perfectly obvious that there is a great gap which no ingenuity, skill, or care can wholly bridge. But Conference, and of my own efforts, to enable us, as far as possible, to bridge that gap. The arrangements made by the Commonwealth and States aim at enabling the producers of the country to bridge that .gap; to get their money for their wheat, or a percentage of it , in the meanwhile, and, in any case, to get the f u l l market price for their wheat. That, is the policy of the Government and of the Wheat Conference, and that, I think, we shall succeed in doing. So far, we have provided ample freight for December, and freight for January, equal to the greatest amount available in any previous year, and it remains for those who are ready to buy wheat to do so. for the Navy say whether the Government have decided upon the establishment of a munitions factory at Beaconsfield, in Tasmania? decision has been arrived at. I shall make inquiries, and let the honourable member know what has been done. OLD-AGE PENSION S. able member for Cowper submitted a question with reference to pensions for women livin g apart from their husbands. The answer to the question isThere 19 .no provision preventing women who live' apart from their husbands receiving a pension. There are numerous cases in which persons are paid in such circumstances. If the husband has an income which debars the wife from a pension the Commissioner has power in certain cases to give the wife a pension. In some cases in which the wife has refused to assert her rights as against the husband the pension has been refused. In cases where the wife haB been deserted and the husband cannot be traced the pension is granted. On the same day, the honourable member for Wannon asked a question having reference to continuing the payment of the pension in part to the pensioner and in part to an institution which may bo seeing the pensioner through any trouble. The reply isWhen a pensioner enters a Benevolent Asylum temporarily his .pension is suspended. When he leaves the institution he receives pension for four weeks if he has remained that it has been the object of the time in the institution, or a correspondingly less amount if the time was less than four weeks. No payment in the case of temporary admission is made to the institutions which are supported partly by private and partly by State contributions. The policy of the Commonwealth Government so far has been to refuse payment to the institutions in the case of temporary admissions. If, however, the pensioner is sent to the institution because he is unable to look after himself, the pension ceases, and the institution is paid 8s. a week for his support.

I am sorry to be obliged to repeat my complaint in regard to the request for two special telephone , lines, which ought to have been constructed many months ago. I refer to the requested line between Yeelanna and Murat Bay, and between Cummins and Darke's Peak. The State authorities are so satisfied of the importance of these districts that they have constructed railways to them. and I am not exaggerating when I say that thousands of blocks have beeu allotted. The district served by one railway stretches over 200 miles, and the other extends for a distance of about 100 miles. Neither place has telegraphic or telephonic facilities. During the recent adjournment of Parliament, I made a hurried trip to tlie districts, and saw the great inconvenience under which the settlers labour, in consequence of having no means of communication except the weekly mail. "" A man may be in the midst of taking off his crop when a machinery part breaks, and he must wait a week before he can send for a new part. They are under the same difficulty in regard to sickness and accidents. nearest doctor is at a distance of 150 miles, and there is no means of sending a message to him except by the weekly mail or special messenger. Some time ago I understood that telephone facilities were to. be provided by the State railway authorities and the postal authorities in conjunction, but, so far, no agreement has been arrived at in regard to the basis on which the expenditure should be allocated. In the meantime, the unfortunate settler must grin and bear his troubles. I am being inundated by letters from settlers in that area, and. it is a crying shame that more consideration is not given to those men who have so many other inconveniences to face in connection with the development of that country. The new Postmaster-General is a ""whale"" for work, and from his personal experience of out-back districts should have a thorough knowledge of their requirements. I hope he will realize that these attention, and do what he can for the benefit of the people concerned. I do not wish to complain unduly of the conduct of the -Defence Department, because I recognise that in the raising and equipping of 160,000 men there must because for many complaints; but there are matters to which we are justified in drawing attention. I was surprised at a letter which I received from the Department today. I had complained of the unfairness of allowing officers of the Citizen Porces who have not enlisted for service abroad to enter the Officers' Training School and to compete there with men who have volunteered for the front. The land has been subdivided, an immediate and complete reform. who have not enlisted, because of "" cold feet,"" are drawing the pay of their rank and are competing against men who have volunteered for the front , and who, having passed through the non-commissioned officers' school, wish to present themselves for examination for the position of commissioned officer.

Men should not be allowed to enter the school until they have enlisted for the front . cannot enter the school until they have enlisted. statement in the letter which I wish to bring under notice, and which is signed The by the Secretary to the Defence DepartmentI am directed to inform you that no officer of the Citizen Forces is given preferenceI said nothing about preference being given. My contention is that men who hav© volunteered for service abroad should not hav© to compete with Citizen Force officers who have not done so. It was stated recently that over 700 paid officers in the Citizen Forces have not enlisted for active service.

I should have nothing to say to that statement had the Citizen Force officers to whom I am referring enlisted. The letter states that 353 Citizen Force officers and 296 others without previous military experience, have been made officers in the Australian Imperial Force. sent arrangement is unfair to men who are making great sacrifices, who have given up opportunities of advancement, and are leaving families behind. These men have devoted considerable time to the study of military matters in order to qualify themselves for commissions, and they find that others who are not ready to offer themselves for service abroad are competing against them at no risk. Another matter to which I draw attention is this: I have a constituent who lives in the Port Lincoln district, and is now serving in Melbourne as a gunner in the Australian Imperial Force. given his final leave, but, as his wife resides about 40 miles from Port Lincoln, the leave was not long enough to enable him to visit her to say good-bye to her and the children. This man endeavoured to catch a boat which might enable him to visit his wife, but owing to the irregularity of the services, he could not do so, and I wired to Colonel Cox Taylor, the Commandant of the D.C.A. Camp, Queen'sroad, Melbourne, asking for the extensic"" of his leave to the 9th instant. Tha body of troops with which he is associated does not leave Melbourne unti l the 16th, so that the request was not unreasonable; but I got no reply to my telegram, and tlie man had to return from Adelaide by train without having seen his wife and family, although he got within sixteen or eighteen hours' journey of where they live. I think it was due to me that I should receive a reply to my telegram, and I think, too, that cases like that which I have brought under notice should receive consideration. I hope that the Government will, at the earliest moment, create a Supply and Tender Board. The purchasing business of the Department is enormous, and, in the interests of the country, this Board should be established. I believe that great waste occurs in the construction of military works. These works, like the works undertaken by the Home Affairs Department and the Postmaster-General's Department, should be subject to the criticism of tlio Public Works Committee; the Defence officers should not be on a different footing from those of other Departments. The taxpayers wbo find the revenue for ordinary public works also find the revenue for military works. A lot of complaints reach ns from the dependants of soldiers. There should be in this House an Assistant M in The preister of Defence, to give attention to thesematters. thought that on the appointment of a Minister for the Navy we should obtain more information, but we get less. appointment of the Minister for the Navy has been of any great advantage to this House. I do not blame the present Ministers, because there is more to be done than they can handle; but there should be a Minister to deal specially with the smaller departmental matters. Men apHe was parently get lost from time to time when transferred from one company to another, or from one State to another. Sometimes a soldier falls ill and is sent to a hospital, and while he is there his unit leaves for the front , and no one is l e f t to take charge of him. Recently a man at the Adelaide Hospital was receiving no pay, and I took his wife to the local paymaster, who was very courteous; but it took three hours to trace the case, and it was ascertained that the man had not received his pay because the sergeant-major who always took the pay to h i m had gone away to the f r o n t in a recent hatch of troops. In the meantime the wife of the man had come down from the f a r north at considerable expense, and was paying her hoard close by, yet not a penny was coming in from the Department.

Arrangements should be made to relieve the Minister of Home Affairs of these other matters. I am sorry that the Minister of External Affairs is not in the chamber, because he gave me a rather flippant answer last week. With no ulterior intent, I asked a simple question as to why a certain hotel in the Northern Territory had heen closed, and I was told that it was closed because, so far as the Minister could learn, the only customers were two white men and a blackfellow. The hotel had been kept for many years by the widow of the late Thomas Crush, a member of the Labour party in South Australia, and evidently she has seen the Minister's reply, because she has wired to me as follows:My books open to inspection, which embrace that five years would he the outside limit; 195 accounts, exclusive of two white men and but, in spite of the length of time that has a blackfellow.

In my opinion, this is only in accordance with the general policy of this Government of going slowly in the matter of the Federal Capital, for there is no sincerity underlying the pretended desire on the part of the Administration to push on with the building of the Capital. When the Constitution was accepted, including the provision, relating to the Federal Capital, it was never dreamt that the duration of the Federal Parliament in Melbourne would extend for so long a period as fourteen years.

One of the original conditions on which New South Wales agreed to enter Federation was that the Federal Capital should be at Sydney, and as New South Wales was the only State making any sacrifice she was entitled to some consideration. However, through the magnanimity of the present Sir George Reid, who represented New South Wales at a Conference of Premiers held in Melbourne, a compromise was effected by which, though the Federal Capital should not be in Sydney or w it h in 100 miles of Sydney, it must be in New South Wales. Therefore, it ia useless to raise that question at the present time. The fact remains that the provision was inserted in the compact, and was accepted by the other States, though we had a terrible job in this Parliament to get the representatives of the other States to r a t if y the agreement and finally select a site for the Federal Capital. The site has now heen selected for a number of years, but there is no appreciable advance in the direction of the Federal Parliament meeting there, and at the present rate of progress it seems to me that it w ill he many years yet before this w ill come about. Let me remind the Committee that on the 27th May of this year I moved the following motion:1. That in view of the importance of having the Commonwealth Parliament removed at the earliest opportunity from the undesirable influences inseparable from its location in any of the existing State capitals, in the opinion of this House the building of the Parliament Houses and Administrative Offices and other necessary works should be proceeded with at the earliest possible opportunity. 2. That the carrying of this resolution be an instruction to the Government to take all necessary steps to expedite the construction of the necessary accommodation. It was carried unanimously; face of that resolution, the ex-Minister of Home Affairs apparently came to the determination to flout the decision of Parliament, and not to take the necessary steps for proceeding with all expedition with the construction of the works and buildings that would enable the Federal Parliament to meet in FederalI trust that the present Minister honour the compact with New South Wales, and respect the resolution of this House. any Minister to take upon himself the Mr W.

Honourable members of the Opposition have treated Ministers very generously and f a i r l y , and given them every consideration, because of the war, and because we recognise the need for leaving their hands as free as possible from a l l irritatin g influences; hut if the Government propose to take advantage of our generosity and magnanimity in order to impose on the State of New South Wales and deprive her of her just rights, I shall not stand by quietly and see it done. In the interests of the whole community, this matter should not be allowed to be lost sight of. I am sorry that the Minister of Home Affairs is not in the Chamber, so that I might make m y views known to him. To make private representations to any Minister is absolutely useless. They .usually go into one ear and out of the other, and are presumably forgotten, whether through woeful defect of memory or from any other cause I am unable to say. The only step a member can take is to get the matter recorded in Hansard, so that a Minister with a short memory may be able to have his memory refreshed by reference to indisputable authority. I desire now to call attention to a matter that has been brought under my notice in connection with the Warren training camp, situated in my district. U p to quite recently complaint was made that the men had not been able to get proper equipment ; that they were parading the streets in dungarees and other styles of clothing, owing to the neglect of the Department. The officers themselves also complain of their treatment. A number of officers have qualified at this camp for their commissions. They know all the men individually, they have acyet in the tively assisted in their training, yet when the men have been drafted away for reinforcements, instead of obtaining their commissions and being sent along with them, they have had to stand down in favour of strangers from Melbourne. The officers allege that they have not received fair treatment in this respect. Apart Territory. from all other considerations it would be will wise if , as f a r as possible, the Defence Department sent away with the men the officers who had been associated with them It is a very serious thing for in their training, who had gained their confidence and who knew them individually. there is a far greater prospect of efficiency ; of the development of a spirit of camaraderie, and of a perfect understanding between ofiicers and men. tem of appointing officers who do not know their men does not make for the greatest military efficiency. with many honourable members who have had complaints to make against the Department. I could bring forward a number myself, particularly in regard to the absence of business method. have been presented showing the absolute necessity of a business department being associated with the Department of Defence. There are very few strictly military men who have had any commercial experience, or, at least, the commercial experience necessary to the conduct of a business of such magnitude as that of the Department of Defence, and it is very desirable that some steps should be promptly taken to organize a business department in connection with the war. Moreover, very few honourable members who have had any experience of the workings of the Department will disagree with the suggestion made by the honourable member for Grey, that a Tender Board should be established. I desire to call attention to the report of the Public Accounts Committee relating to Cockatoo Island, which is of such a nature as to demand immediate attention from the Government. were an ordinary time, and if any other Government were in power, no Minister controlling such a Department as this would be able to survive for long after the appearance of a report like this. I will quote one or two extracts. reviewing the present method of financing the administration of the dockyard, the report observes that it has taken two and a half years to advance the equipping of the island with the necessary power-plant and machine tools, to the stage of tendering. Notwithstanding all the expenditure that has been in curred, it has taken the Government two and a half years to bring the dockyard to the stage when it can tender. And that period includes twelve months during which we have been engaged in a war which is threatening the very foundations of the Empire. The possibilities of such a catastrophe as that does not seem to hasten Governmental [257]2 W it h such conditions operating methods in the slightest degree. The report goes onIt is impossible to say how much longer it will take to install the complete equipment The syson the island. And thenMaking ample allowance for all extenuating I am in agreement circumstances, the Committee is unable to arrive at any other conclusion than that there has been undue delay in equipping this dockyard with tbe necessary plant to enable the building of warships to be carried on expeditiously and economically. It is impossible to estimate even approximately the loss caused Reports to the Commonwealth on this account. We all know of the unwarrantable delay that took place in the construction of the Brisbane, between the time she was laid down and the time she was ready for launching. Even when the vessel was ready for the water months elaosed before her launch could be effected through neglect of dredging and constructing the slipway into the water, and on present appearances it is likely that the war will be over long before the vessel is put into commission. W it h this state of things in existence it would be interesting to know how much money is going to ba spent upon Cockatoo Island and other branches of the Naval Department before any direct results are likeb to accrue in 7 In this connection connection with the war itself. Coming back to the reportThe efforts of the present manager ( Mr King Salter) to remedy the shortcomings when he took charge were not, in the opinion of the Committee, adequately supported by the NavalI f the present Board. That statement, made after careful investigation by the Public Accounts Committee, embodies against the Naval Board a very serious charge, that should be in vestigated immediatelyAfter The Committee considers the position was sufficiently serious to have justified, without any hesitation, the suspension of ordinary routine in favour of the immediate securing of the equipment. There was no question of lack of funds, as £110,000 that had been authorized was still unexpended. This suggests that there is something radically wrong either with the management of the Naval Board, or with the Department responsible for the whole concern, and it is nearly time new methods were adopted, and urgent reforms introduced. The report continuesAfter allowing for some shortcomings, due to the want of experience, there was a general consensus of opinion amongst witnesses that the quality of work turned out at Cockatoo compared favourably with that of the British dockyards. Tliat information is very satisfactory as f a r as it goes, but it is very little use having work turned out favourably unless it is turned out in time to be useful the moment the need for its use arises. I quote furtherThere were, however, very definite opinions expressed that the quantity of work performed at the island was not what it should be, and that there was a certain amount of "" malingering or deliberately wasting time."" AgainOne witness informed the Committee that the men on piece work in England did two and two-thirds more than the men on day work here in the same time. Mr King Salter stated that the cost of riveting steel drums and water pockets of a boiler was 40s. per 100 in England on piece work as against 70s. on day work here, and the cost of flanging boiler ends was Is. per foot in England as compared with 6s. here. It is also stated that the work on the island is carried on under no fewer thar. fifty-one separate industrial awards. N/> wonder the Defence Department is spending such enormous sums of money. would not mind the amount providing we were getting the value for it. think anybody will begrudge any expenditure necessary for the efficient out of the war, but in the case of Cockatoo Island we appear to be money lavishly-indeed, travagance-without that will help us in the prosecution of thia war. tremely high, and seems to be altogether disproportionate and the price paid for similar work in the Old Country. at length on these matters, but the report is now public property, and I refer to it in the hope that steps will be taken to remedy the condition of affairs which it reveals, and which reflects no credit on those responsible for it. office of the High"" Commissioner, I would suggest to the new Prime Minister he give favorable consideration to the offer made by Sir George Reid to give his services gratuitously during the continuance of the war. It is most undesirable that an honourable gentleman who has had charge of the affairs of the Commonwealth of the war should, while the war is still raging, and at a time when his presence here is absolutely the office of Prime Minister to take up the post of High Commissioner Old Country. Mr W. Elliot Johnson. friendliest personal feelings towards the ex-Prime Minister, Mr Fisher, I cannot bring myself to believe that the contemplated change would be in the best in terests of Australia. For the Prime Minister to desert his office at a time like this in order to displace a gentleman from a post which he has brilliantly held in London, is, in my opinion, an act not justified in any way. The best in terests of the Commonwealth would be served, I believe, by continuing Sir George Reidi n his present office, which he has filled w it h such conspicuous ability and distinction. He has rendered signal service to Australia, and should be retained in his present office, at all events, during the continuance of the war. I hope it is not yet too late to reconsider the decision arrived at, and that no new appointment w ill be made during the currency of the war. By adopting this suggestion, the Government would act in accordance with what is One the general consensus of opinion in Australia. honourable member for Grey has referred to carrying the necessity for the establishment of a Tender Board and the creation of a new spending portfolio. Both suggestions are good, and with gross exfrom what I know of some matters relatgetting any result* ing to the tendering that has taken place in connection w it h tlie various Camps, I The cost of labour alone is exthink the sooner we have a Tender Board the better. It is only a few weeks since to the work performed, honourable members on both sides unanimously requested the creation of a new One does not care to dwell Department.

The Minister of Defence fold me to make application, and I did so. I am giving him an opportunity to-morrow to place my application before Together with a number of the House. In reply to that application the letter which the Minister for the Navy read to the House came to me from the Minister of Defence. I object to the statement of the Minister that to that letter he received no reply. Many supporters of the Government have indulged in a lot of criticism, and have expressed the opinion that, instead of writing to the Ministeri n connection with Private Ryan's case, I should have waited upon him. As a matter of fact, I saw Senator Pearcei n his room at the Victoria Barracks with regard to tlie offer I had made to him. I thanked him for his reply, and added, "" I do not desire an appointment in Australia. If you propose only to give me an appointment in the Commonwealth, then I feel that my services can be better employed in watching the in terests of my constituents."" I therefore declined his offer, but suggested that until I got thoroughly fit, he might send me to Egypt where, with my knowledge of stores and other matters, I might be of some value to the Department. The He at once asked if I letter to which I have referred, and to I was medically "" f it to which I received no reply, was sent by me to the Minister about 22nd October a month after the other letter reached me. In that communication, after complaining regarding the inadequate system of payments, I said thafc I would be very pleased to visit the Department, look into the system, and introduce one that would D i d the honbe satisfactory. To tliat offer I received no reply whatever. On Monday last, I went to the Victoria Barracks because of the element of doubt existing regarding a certain telegram which Senator Pearce said he had sent to me, but which I had not received, and also in connection with the letter to which I have referred. No trace could be found of the letter which I sent on the 22nd October.

We have had no evidence of any wave of enthusiasm in the Commonwealth because Sir George Reid is being displaced to mate room for Mr Fisher. I believe that in the minds of the great mass of the people there is a feeling of profound disappointment that a man who has so ably filled the office of H i g h Commissioner for a long perioda period sufficiently long to enable him to know all the ropes and understand all the obligations of the position-is at this critical time in our history bein,g displaced by a man who has no knowledge of those particular duties. that Sir George Reid is being displaced.

Is he being sent from this Parliament to assume that high office simply to make way for Mr Hughes and the political shuffle which has brought new men into Ministerial office? sent to London to make room for the Fusion. ber knows a lot, but he does not speak with Ministerial authority. From a political point of view, t'he change from Sir George Reid to Mr Fisher has been coldly received, and I am convinced that the majority of honourable members of this House would feel infinitely more confidence in the old and experienced man than they can feel in the new appointee. A good man is being displaced by a man who, because of his inexperience, is much less adapted to the office than the man who is being dismissed. The occupant of the office of High Commissioner ought to be a man of broad views. What sort of a man has Mr Fisher proved himself to be in this House? Australia has recently passed through the greatest trial, so far as seasons are concerned, that the Continent has ever endured. It experienced a great drought, which was calculated to have a serious effect upon the revenue of the country, and to call for the utmost care in the expenditure of public money; but, in order to blind the eyes of the public, and because in Mr Fisher's own constituency there did happen to be a fair season, he could not look further afield, and he made himself ridiculous by his reiterated statement"" a little drought."" A t the time he was made the charge; but he was not man pronouncing that view he was proposing enough to attempt to prove it . I intend to large increases in expenditure for the ordinary services of the Commonwealth, and he endeavoured to justify adherence to that policy by reiterated statements that the drought was only a little one. I wish he had been a farmer and felt the sting of the lash, and experienced the suffering endured by those men to whom he so cynically referred. Another qualification which we should expect to find in a High Commissioner is ability to take an all-round view of things. Very recently, the late Prime Minister told a deputation in Sydney that he was going to the H i g h Commissioner's office because he thought it was necessary It is not right to say that the position should be filled by a man who held views in consonance with those of the dominant party. The n why is Mr The further the man holding that office can get from party politics, and the more general his view of things, the better it w ill be for the Commonwealth. Mr. Fisher's reference to the referendum as a non-party question shows that he is not capable of comprehensive views. His statement and that of his colleagues regarding the two previous referenda was The honourable memthat the question involved was distinctly a party issue; but now that it seems to suit his hook he says that it is not. H is statement is that the referendum is not a party question, or, if it is, those who are opposed to it make it such. We should not appoint to the post of H i g h Commissioner a man of German tendencies. The Kaiser, after preparing for war for a quarter of a century, coolly asserted when the crisis came that the responsibility for the outbreak was on the Allies; that, in effect, having resisted him , they, and not he, are responsible for the war. That is the position of the Right Honourable Andrew Fisheri n regard to the referendum. He has declared war on the p o l i tical party opposed to him, forcing a conflict at a time when every effort should be made to preserve unison; and yet he says that it is those who resist, not he, who are responsible for the party strife that must follow. Above all things, the H i g h Commissioner should be one at whom the finger of scorn cannot be pointed.

The position created by the war is unprecedented; but in what has been done Parliament has practically abrogated its rights in a most important particular. A Tariff sanctioned by Parliament has been superseded by another brought into operation by Executive act, which Parliament has not been asked to sanction. rogued, this new Tariff would cease to operate. It can be kept alive, improperly, only by continual adjournments. In view of the importance of Tariff legislation, I contend that we should either revert to the old Tariff, which Parliament has sanctioned, or proceed to the discussion of the present Tariff, with a view to legalizing it. In quite a number of items there would be alterations; but the representatives of the people should be asked to say whether the new Tariff should or should not stand. In view of the fact that the Government ask for further Supply, I enter a protest and invite the Minister to seriously consider how long the Tariff is to be kept alive in that way. Undoubtedly a Parliament which consents to a proceeding of that kind allows itself to be divested of one of its most important functions, and in regard to a very leading subject. The other day the Minister of External Affairs made a statement about the action he has taken in regard to the liquor traffic in the Northern Territory. He was good enough to say ber who made an inquiry would rejoice to know that the industry was a paying concern. I . for one, do not rejoice at that fact. I consider that the Minister showed very bad taste in practically asserting that he rejoiced in the trade being a paying concern, because the more it prospers in the Territory the greater will be the amount of degradation there. It is, of course, very nice for a Minister to be able to say for once that the State is running a concern which pays, but I submit that it is not seemly to pay into the The taking of money Treasury money derived from the industry, because it is the price of blood. It is a bad business. Those who go into the back country are aware how easy it is for men to set up sly-grog selling, here, there, and everywhere.

The condition of things existing in that Department to-day is simply shocking.

But, although some weeks have elapsed since that order went forth, many of them are still in arrears with their pay. During the past week-end I met some twenty or thirty who occupy this position. Some of them will be embarking for the front in the near future, and the Department will owe them, perhaps, a fortnight's pay. Surely an instruction can be sent out that these men must be paid immediately! Then there is the question of travelling from the new'camp at Holdsworthy to Liverpool. This new camp has been established 5 miles from the Liverpool station, and there is no means of getting to it save by private conveyance. I may add that each soldier is charged 2s. each way for travelling that short distance of 5 miles. He is thus obliged to spend 4s., in addition to his fare from Liverpool to Sydney, whenever he desires to visit the city. worthy and Liverpool has been reduced to 3s. 3d. assured that it was 4s.

For a distance of 5 miles a charge of Is. should be sufficient, especially as the owners of the vehicles always secure good loads. I wish also to stress the growing dissatisfaction which exists owing to the meagre information obtainable from the front in regard to our wounded. We know that it is impossible to secure anything like adequate information. The Defence Department obtains certain particulars, which it communicates to the relatives, but beyond that it cannot go. Now there are many cases in which parents have thought it desirable to cable Home for information regarding their wounded sons' condition, and in which they have taken the precaution to prepay the reply. Yet they have found it impossible to obtain any reply. remedying. I have met mothers who are so anxious in regard to their sons that they imagine the very worse has happened. Only the other day I was conversing with a lady who had cabled to a hospital in which her son is supposed to be an inmate, and who cannot secure any reply to her communication. Surely this state of things can be remedied! Let the Government appoint some officer whose duty it will be to attend to all this correspondence, to ascertain the condition of the wounded soldiers in respect of whom inquiry is made, and to forward a reply to the parent. difficulty. eables to a hospital in which his or her wounded son is an inmate, there ought to he no difficulty in furnishing a reply at very little cost to the Commonwealth. High Commissioner's office ought to be able to attend to such matters. the High Commissioner's office could certainly attend to such matters in respect of hospitals in the Old Country. Probably the High Commissioner would be able to appoint an officer to discharge similar duties in Egypt. Something should he done in that direction. If we wish to assist recruiting, we can do so by insuring a ready response to the anxious inquiries of parents regarding their sons more effectually than we can assist it in many other ways. Theso matters may appear small to the Ministerial head of the Department, but they are of very great importance to the individual. I do hope that something will be done to remedy the defects to which I have referred. [5.44] I join with the honourable member for Hunter in expressing my regret that we are to be denied an opportunity of discussing the Estimates for the current financial year. Apparently we are to be placed in a position similar to that which we occupied last year. Upon that occasion we were told, when the Estimates were submitted for our consideration, that it was idle to discuss them, inasmuch as all the money had been spent. That is a very dangerous procedure to adopt. To-day representatives of the Government are going ahout the country impressing upon everybody the need of economy, and at the same time this Parliament is handing over to the Ministry the control of the entire funds of the Commonwealth to do with them just what they choose.

It took the Department from 7th October to 29th October to ascertain the facts I asked for. This letter was not received by me until to-day. my country address yesterday, but it does Mr Manifold. than exists take a long time for letters posted in the Defence Departmeut to reach the individuals to whom they are addressed. Perand various haps it would be better if I said that it takes a considerable time for a letter, At a time like the present after having been duly written and signed, to find its way to the post. In this connection I noticed the other day Barracks, Melbourne. that the Defence Department have ceased building to date their letters in ink. This is now done by lead pencil. The Minister of Destrucfence said the other day that the only at these letter I have written to the Defence DeI do not know what it is to partment was one inquiring after payment due to a man named Hammond, of Colac. If that is so, it seems funny that the letter to which I have just referred should builddeal with the case of Private Angus, of the Reserve Reinforcements, at Broadas the Demeadows. It states that most of the payments due to Private Angus have been Melbourne made, but that from the 16th to 30th I am pleased to know that September he was marked absent on the pay sheet of his unit. I am now in communication with the Broadmeadows Camp to ascertain why the man was marked absent, because his pay for that period I have not sought has been held back. Now that I have I taken up the case, the authorities have promised to inquire why. The point of and I all this is that it should not be necessary for members of Parliament to have to make these inquiries, either at the payoffice or at the Department. If the accounts were kept in a proper way, there These people say they canwould be no necessity for me to have to inquire about this man's pay. Yet at the present moment men are going about the description country informing the public that they cannot get their pay, that their wives could not get their pay, and that their widowed mothers were in a similar position. If the Department were properly I remanaged this sort of thing would not occur. In another case a lady named Department, Mrs. Elora McKay has written to the Dethat no partment, stating that she has received all the money due to her excepting that from 16th August to 31st August, and has received the information that the pay for that period cannot be traced. It It is a remarkable seems extraordinary that cases of this sort should occur at all. I know that flagrant blunders have occurred in the transfer of men from the various camps to the Base Hospital. Whether the authorities consider that when a man is transferred to a Base Hospital that is to be the end of him or not, I do not know. But if they do, they are not very complimentary to It may have been at the Base Hospital. to include him on the pay-sheets. not think any business man' would ever attempt to carry on his business in the same manner that the Department is conducting its business. In the payments to the troops at the barracks a man's name is read out"" John Jones, £ 4 .

I received a letter to-day from a man who informs meI do not know whether his statement is correct-th'a t the Department owes him £ 1 5 5s. "" I have been told to inquire everywhere,"" he says, "" at Melbourne, at Seymour, at Ballarat, and I cannot get any reply. They seem to take no notice of me."" That is the great trouble. These men write to the Department in their endeavour to get their pay, but no notice is taken of them at all. They are not even told that the matter will be looked into, and, as a letter I read from the district paymaster shows, it takes a long time before the Department will even send a reply to a member of this House. T h o y ar© not allowed Privates who have enlisted have great difficulty in getting any money sent to T h a t is so. I do them. I trust something w ill be done in this matter, because, apparently, recruiting will have to go on for some considerable time, and no honourable member will care to be on a platform and hav© thrown up against him the statement that the men are not able to get their money. I want, however, to pay a compliment to the Base Records Office. If any Department is doing good work it is Base Records. The officers there are able to give all th© information they receive. But , unfortunately, the news from the f r o n t is very scanty indeed. To illustrate this I Yes . The present will quote one particular case which I went into. A friend of mine had enlisted, and I was anxious to find out for his people how he was and what he was doing. about exWe got the news that he had been sent to Malta, so I went to Base RecordsT h e Defence Deto inquire, and the officer there said he would do all in his power to find out. A cable was sent to the Commandant at do not see why the Malta, but no reply came to hand. Three weeks later the young man's mother met one of his comrades in the country, a man I think it would who knew one of the doctors in Malta, so we sent a cable direct to that doctor, to be who happened to be assisting at one of the Malta hospitals. The reply came straight cannot the away, so it could not have been the fault of the cable company that no reply had the Combeen received to the previous cable. The doctor to whom the cable was addressed replied that he had lunched with the young man on that particular day, and gave the information that he was doing The money order well. We also discovered that the young man was 8 miles inland, at Malta. He had been suffering from influenza, had been sent to an inland hospital, and, as far as the authorities were concerned, he was practically lost sight of altogether. I want also to bring under the attention of the Government the position with regard to some of the permanent officers at the Defence Department. I refer to the sergeant-majors, the men who have devoted their lives to military work, and who to-day are not allowed to go to the front. I think about 100 per cent, of them have volunteered and are really anxious to go, but they are being kept back.

As a result of a question which I asked the ex-Postmaster-Generali n June last, I ascertained that in the year 1913-14, when there was a daily service on most of the country railway lines, the Railway Department of New South Wales received £121,811 , but in 1914-15, when the railway service on country lines was curtailed to three trains a week, a subsidy of £123,000 was paid. In other words, for a curtailed service the Railway Department of New South Wales was receiving an enhanced subsidy. The reason given for the increase was that the opening of a number of new lines has necessitated the granting of an extra subsidy. I should like to know what number of new railways was brought into existence in New South Walesi n 1914-15 1 Furthermore, I asked a question as to whether the mileage travelled on newly-opened lines exceeded the saving in mileage by the curtailment of the former service. I venture to assert that the number of train miles travelled' in 1914-15 was less than the mileage in 1913-14, in spite of any additional new lines. master-General informed me that "" under the existing agreement between the Postmaster-General and the Railway Commissioners of the several States, no reduction is made in the payment by the former when the frequency of the railway service is reduced. On the other hand, no additional payment is made where the railway frequency is increased."" The subsidiary mailmen who carry the mails in various o directions from the branch lines made their contracts in the expectation of having to deal with a service on six days a week, but immediately the railway service was curtailed, the Postmaster-General notified those contractors that their subsidies would be considerably reduced.

A mail contracI desire to deal briefly with the tor named Hawker entered into a contract for the conveyance of mails from Coolac, on the railway line between Cootamundra and Tumut, to a place called Jugiong. He contracted to carry the mails six days a week for a subsidy of £ 1 7 5 a year. When the Railways Commissioners, in their wisdom, curtailed the railway service to trains on three days instead of six days in the week, the Postmaster-General immediately notified Mr Hawker that his subsidy would be reduced from £17 5 to £ 87 10s. per annum in consequence. The contractor had made his arrangements for changing stations and for fodder some months ahead. He had no hope of securing any other work on the days on which he was not engaged in carrying the mails; and, although under the new conditions he only took the mails three days a week, he took precisely the same weight of mails as he would have had to take if he had continued running his coach six days in the week. He had this added disability, that, on the three days on which he had to take the mails, his passenger space was curtailed by reason of the increased amount of mail matter to be carried on each trip . He has consequently been a loser all along the line, and no redress The late Postor sympathy was given h i m by the Postmaster-General. I find that the reason advanced by the Postmaster-General for the reduced subsidy paid to mail contractors in these circumstances' is that ""the amount is calculated on a mileage basis, and strictly in accordance with the general conditions of mail contracts.""

In making these remarks, the last thing in my mind is a desire to raise any party feeling in conComplaints of the work of the Departments at this time may very well be regarded as suggestions for improvement. W it h regard to our Military Camps, the fact seems at present to be overlooked that it is the Federal Government that is responsible for their administration. However much we may blame individual officers, it is the Federal Government that is, after all, wholly responsible for the administration of the Military Camps. I intend to refer to one or two matters, which may be in the form of complaints in order that the Minister representing the Minister of Defencei n this House may see what is occurring through spectacles other than those which he wears himself. As one who is keenly interested in the recruiting movement in New South Wales, I say deliberately that those who are enI am loath deavouring to recruit more men, and still more men, under the voluntary system are faced with many difficulties and disI n common with many other abilities which might be easily removed by a little more keenness in the administration of our Military Camps. One of the I had a matters which requires radical alteration has referenceto the lads after they have gone into Camp. Before they go into Camp they are allotted to a certain unit, and have particular numbers given to them. They are put into certain battalions, and if they then fall sick they are placed in a hospital or under medical supervision. The moment they come under the purview of the medical officer they lose their identity as members of the battalions to which they were allotted, and their transfer papers are not immediately sent on to the battalion to which they are transferred. When a Men who have fallen ill and gone into hospital, have had their pay withheld for weeks, and even months, because, when convalescent, they have been attached to another unit, whose Officer Commanding, or other responsible officer, knew nothing of their circumstances. This is a grave fault. W it h in at least forty-eight hours of a man going into hospital, the fact should be known to a recording officer, to hi m directly he joins his. new unit. These matters get talked of by the lads concerned, and knowledge of them spreads through town and country, producing hesitancy on the part of would be recruits, who, otherwise, would be only too ready to join the Forces.

The system of voluntary enlistment is on its trial. Soon there will be hardly a family in the Commonwealth which has not lost some near and dear member, who will have fallen covered with glory, or has not had some member returned sick or wounded. People are already asking whether the voluntary system is effective. Unless we have a much better response to the appeals for recruits, there will be in favour of conscription a public opinion so strong that no Government will be able to withstand it.

CATTS (Cook) [ 8 . 6 ] replied the other night to the complaint as to the bread from the New South Wales State Bakery. for Hume has mentioned two points, and I wish to show how absolutely ridiculous he is making himself appear. In the first place, the bread is supplied to the Military authorities at so much per 100 lbs. It is taken from the State Bakery to the Military authorities, and put on the scale, and they get the 100 lbs. for which they bargain. Is that fact disputed f weighed out to the men. the bread checked by the M i l it a r y authoritiGS ? MrJ . H . CATTS -Yes. I verified this statement at the week-end, and found that it is correct. the clause in the contract? MrJ . H . CATTS -The honourable member says that he is not disputing that the M i l it a r y authorities are getting f u l l weight from the State Bakery, but that there is a clause which provides that the loaves shall be supplied in two sizes, namely, 2 lbs. and 4 lbs. All that I can say is that if there is a slight variation in the weight of the bread of 8 or 10 ozs. a slight variation? MrJ . H . CATTS -It may be. In a period of months there has very likely been an isolated instance or two picked out, where the State Bakery has not been very particular, because the bread had to be put on the scale and the bulk weight taken. There is absolutely nothing in the contention of the honourable member. by weight or by loaf? Mr J. H . CATTS T h a t is another question. I asked the honourable member for Nepean the other day whether there was a complaint that the men were not getting enough bread, and he admitted that there was not. As a matter of fact, the only complaint in that connection by Opposition members is that bread is being wasted. The honourable member admits that, does he not ? He now wheels round and says that the men are not getting Order ! The honenough bread because of the way in which it is delivered. I from the fact that the State Bakery is supplying light bread. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable The honourable member member for Hume says that the Chief Secretary for New South Wales has issued a regulation' which provides that bread made by bakers shall be of certain weights, namely, 2 lbs. and 4 lbs. That regulation is not singular at a l l ; it is to be found in every State. The honourable member for Hume says that the regulation applies to all bakers. In the corridor the other day I put a case to him. I said, ""Suppose that I , as a baker, were to make bread for my own private table. Do you go so f a r as to say that the regulation weight of would apply to me, and that I would be fined if I did not produce bread of the prescribed weight?"" And he replied, ""Yes."" H o w do you get over Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member did not say that. He is now wheeling round again. What he said then was that the regulation went to that extremity. The statement only shows how absolutely ridiculous he makes himself in trying to find fault w it h the Government on this question. that he does not let you wallop the Government. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member, as usual, adopts very elegant language. The whole point of the regulation is that if a baker sells a loaf ostensibly of 2 lbs. or 4 lbs. weight, he is liable to be fined so much per ounce for every ounce he is found to be short in providing the public. Buti f the same baker makes bread, specially for a gaol or a hospital, where it is supplied by the 100 lbs., and not by the loaf, it is not a breach of the regulations if a loaf is found",34,Higgs

As the Leader of the Opposition stated by interjection just now, I have my complaints, and am willin g to join w i th honourable members in bringing forward any reasonable complaint. The honourable members for Nepean and Hume would strengthen their position immeasurably if , when they find that they are wrong on a point, they would admit their mistake, because on another occasion, if either brought forward a reasonable. complaint, they would receive some support. They prefer to bring forward a ridiculous case, a i d persist in the contention after it has been explained to them over and over again that they are wrong, and the result w ill he that when they come along with another complaint no one w ill take the slightest notice of them. master-sergeants are delivering 32 lbs. of in regard to the waste at camps.

The supplied is really not f it for issue to the honourable member for Nepean says ""Hear, hear!"" to that remark. In all conscience, if the men are burying bread because they cannot use it , how can there be a complaint that they are not getting enough bread to eat. The suggestion to the contrary is absolutely ridiculous. There are one or two phases of the bread question with which I wish to deal. While I do not know of any actual shortage of bread for the troops, that is not to say an actual shortage does not exist. Most of the waste is not due to there being a superabundance of bread supply to the troops as a whole, but comes about because the same quantity of bread is supplied on Saturdays and Sundays, when there are 20 per cent, of the troops absent, as is supplied on other days when there is a f u l l complement in camp. The honourable member for Cook will recollect the quarterthat one of my contentions last week was loaves are each from 8 to 10 ounces short, I see. it stands to reason that each man is not receiving his f u l l quantity of bread. Ifc may be claimed that the mess orderly can return and secure a few more loaves if ous Camps. I wish to emphasize the fact chamber last week were picked out in which much of the bread supplied by the It is more than that.

As to the shortage in weight, I do not say that the State bakery supplies short-weight loaves w i th the object of defrauding the troops of their f u l l complement of bread, but I do say that gross carelessness is shown which would not be tolerated from a private baker. The authorities would not permit him to issue loaves short in weight. The State should set an example to private employers in this respect, and if the State authorities insist on private bakers supplying full-weight bread, they should set an example in the matter, particularly as it opens up an avenue for a profit which should not exist. that in Camps and in Government-controlled concerns there is not the same care in checking goods as is exercised by private firms, and it is reasonable to assume that when the Camps take delivery of bread it is a frequent occurrence for the number of loaves to be checked, and not the actual weight o with three Defence Ministers, we cannot have one in the chamber when we are discussing these matters? this squabble is a disgrace to the National Parliament. member in order in describing a debate in the Chamber as a disgrace to the National Parliament? member for East Sydney used those words, which I did not hear, I ask the honourable member to withdraw them. what I said, because it was absolutely true, but in order to conform with the rules of the HouseI withdraw my statement. able member to withdraw it unreservedly. forms of the HouseI withdraw it , but in the circumstances I could not heln the statement.

Nothing that we can do is too good for men who are prepared to meet their misfortunes in that spirit. A t Fairfield and Smithfield the people are determined that returned soldiers so afflicted shall be properly housed. One of these soldiers is to be married at Easter, and a resident is providing h i m w it h a block of ground, whilst others are going to build a house and furnish it for him. This blind soldier, who is about to assume tlie responsibilities of matrimony, is thus to be given the titledeeds of his home and' the necessary fur niture. Most of the soldiers who have lost their eyesight desire that they shall be taught a trade. But I say that their pension should be sufficient to enable them to live independent of work if they so desire.

I wish now to quote a letter that I have received from the Blind Workers Union of South Australia for the purpose of showing that I am not speaking at random of the treatment that is extended to the blind. The lady secretary of that union, in a letter to the Minister of Defence, saysI t has come under our notice, through the medium of the press, that, after communication with your office, a conference of managers of institutions for the blind in the various States, 0 together with other persons, was held in Melbourne to consider ways and means of assisting We beg to point out that the members of this do not properly represent blind agement.

The writer of the letter I hav© quoted goes on to sayThe above-mentioned conference is practically the same that, in 1911, approached the Federal Government with certain proposals concerning the blind, one of which was not to grant pensions to blind persons, except on conditions set down by themselves. Therefore, we beg respectfully to suggest to your Department that, before finally arriving at any decision with respect to any proposals placed before you concerning tbose recently afflicted (who, owing to their affliction and to the terrible experiences through which they have passed, will be quite unfit for some time to safeguard their own interests), you will appoint some responsible person or persons to guard the interests of those returned soldiers, and that any pension or other publicly-subscribed funds due to them be not placed under the control of managers of blind institutions nor of boards of management as they are at present constituted. We also beg to state that, not only are the blind not represented on these boards of management, but the Government, who are asked to subscribe large sums annually towards the support of these institutions, are without direct representation, so that boards of management and managers are not accountable to anybody or to any section of the community. It is desirable that the blind, as a whole, should, where practicable, have an opportunity of expressing themselves, through their representatives, on all matters pertaining to their general welfare, especially all unions and societies which have for their object the improvement of industrial and other conditions of the blind, and the protection of their rights as individuals. In another letter she tells me that these institutions are controlled by persons who aro supposed to be elected by subscribers to them, but that in reality these persons are re-elected from year to year as a matter of form. They know nothing whatever about the institutions, except what the managers may tell them. The letter which I have read expresses the views of the blind workers in regard to such institutions. I hope when the question of giving pensions to the blind heroes who offered their lives and gave their sight for their country is taken into consideration, that their right to a few shillings per week will not be interfered with by the gentlemen who compose the boards of any in stitutions for the blind.

CATTS I thin k it is 16s. a week and board. but the point I want to make is that, when a man receives a pension from the Commonwealth for the services he has rendered, he alone should be allowed to judge how the pension shall be used. Do not let somebody else be the arbiter for him. If he can swell his pension by what he earns, well and good; but do not let ther?, be any provision which says, "" W© will make the pension up to such and such an amount.""

Quantities of equipment were on the grass awaiting destruction; so that I do not think I could have visited the Camp at a worse time. possibly could without appearing to be looking for trouble.

To begin with, I have taken the keenest interest in aviation for six years past, and have spent over £600 in experiments and building a biplane. On 19th February last I noticed in the newspapers that the Defence Department would be requiring engines, and wrote them for particulars. The Secretary replied, on 22nd February, that no particulars were yet available, and the calling for tenders was not yet authorized. Next, to my surprise, I received an urgent telegram, sent from Melbourne at 4.35 p.m., Saturday, Oth March, which reached me on Monday, 8th March, requesting that my price for constructing three engines should be submitted before Wednesday! I immediately took the train to Melbourne, and there I inspected the sample engine. I asked whether this sample engine could be taken away and used as a pattern by the successful tenderer, and was told that it could not. Not having this model, and having to do everything from inspections and drawings, the cost of construction would necessarily be much heavier, say, equal to about £25 per engine. You will see later that the successful tenderers were allowed the use of the model engine. I managed to get in my tender, my price being £525 per engine. I subsequently learnt (although I cannot disclose my informant's name) that I was the lowest tenderer, but Tarrant Motors Ltd., a Melbourne firm, were given the contract at about £35 per engine above my price. They also, as stated before, had the use of the model engine as a pattern. I had been put to loss of time and expense, which I can ill afford, in my trip to Melbourne; and there was evidently no intention of considering the tender they had asked mc to submit. I next learnt that another Melbourne firm, Kelly and Lewis, had been given three more engines to construct, and at a price about £15 per engine above Tarrant Motors', or £50 above mine. You w ill observe that the first tenderers were given no opportunity for tendering for these further machines. This was most unfair to the other tenderers, and shows the strong leaning of the Department towards Victorian firms. I am told that what happened in this case was as follows:-Kelly and Lewis had a question asked in the Federal Parliament, through some member, "" Why were Tarrant Motors alSome of them w o u l d almost lowed the use of the model engine when it was refused to other tenderers?"" To preyent a scandal, this firm was given the contract for three more engines. But I am told, further, that six more engines have been ordered without any calling for tenders from another Victorian firm (outside Melbourne). I w a n t to k n o w if t h is is a f a c t .

If the Defence Department had inquired about me they must have learnt that I was quite capable of carrying out their requirements. Andi f they had no intention of considering my tender, why did they put me to the expense and loss of time of a t r ip to Melbourne? Now, as regards the biplane I have built, and which has been inspected by the M i l it a r y authorities here, I have asked that one of the aviators, who are employed by the Defence Department at high salaries, should come over and inspect it . I do not know why this is not done. The Defence Department should be only too ready to give assistance and foster the industry, and their aviators are employed and paid for that purpose. I again ask your kind assistance in this matter.",40,Chairman Th E Honourable In Which They Met Their Misfortune Was

287,Mr Yates,"Mr Wittber conI enclose copy of the letter I wrote to the Minister of Defence, and the very unsatisfactory reply I have received. Trusting that you w ill not allow this matter to rest or be delayed in the usual red-tape fashion. I am told that it is compulsory that a l l accepted tenders should appear in the Gazette. A friend of mine tells me that Tarrant Motors' tender and their price has never been published. I shall now read the l e t t e r w h i c h MrW it t be r for w a r d e d to t h e M in is t e r of Defence. It is as f o l l o w s : Adelaide, 8th October, 1915. The Hon. Minister of Defence. Victoria Barracks, St. Kilda-road, Melbourne. DEAR SIR, On 9th March last I tendered for the construction of three "" Renault"" type 70 H.P. aero, engines for the Defence Department. After waiting for sixteen days for a notification of the receipt of my tender, I wrote, and in reply was informed that my tender had not been accepted. SinceI tendered I have been watching thc Commonwealth Cassette to see who had been accepted, also the successful tenderer's price; but up to date it has not been published. I have noticed in the Melbourne Argus that Messrs. TarrantsL t d . have liad a t r i a l run with the first engine, which, I understand, is the first out of the three which were ordered from them. I also understand that a further number of these engines are required, and that another Melbourne firm are at present constructing more engines for the Department, and I would like to know why the first tenderers were not notified of the further requirements in these engines. I was pleased to note tliat last February the Department had decided to give firms in the Commonwealth a chance to tender for the construction of aeroplane engines; but it is very apparent that firms outside of Victoria are not considered, as I have good reason to believe that my price was lower than that of the firm who were accepted, therefore, I think it is only fair that the legitimate tenderers should know how they stood in the matter. I may point out that when I inspected the sample engine at Point Cook, one of the first questions I asked was whether the sample engine could be used as a pattern in the event of a tender being accepted, and the reply was to the effect that nothing was to leave the school while the war was on, so naturally this put the prices of the engines up considerably more than it should have. I now find out that the firm who constructed the engines had the sample engine in their factory to work from, thus facilitating the work for them, and not putting all the tenderers on the same footing. I wish to point out that I have for the past six years been deeply interested pertaining of time and money in trying to advance aviation in Australia. attention about three or four years ago, and although I Mr Yates. made various proposals to your Department, thu matter was put off u n t i l I was heartily sick and tired of t r y in g to receive any departmental recognition or assistance. Last AugustI finished off a 50/55 H.P. six-cylinder aeroengine for my own machine, which, with an old 25 H.P. engine was only capable of short, straight hops, and I am now awaiting permission fro m the local commandant to test the machine with the new engine, which has been tested on the bench, and gives splendid results. It is now fitted in the machine ready for a t r i a l . This engine of mine is entirely designed and built by South Australians, who have not had an opportunity to see an engine of the radial type, and was made without the aid of foreign mechanics; also the propeller is of colonial timber, which goes to prove that Australians are quite capable of undertaking this class of work on their own. The engine has been inspected under load by two members of the local Military Inventions Board, viz., Mr Goodman,'of the Adelaide Municipal Tramways Trust, and Professor Chapman, of the Adelaide University, also Majors Hudson and Logan, of the Head-quarters, Keswick, who would, no doubt, give their candid report of same should they be asked to do so. Trusting you w ill give this matter a f a i r hearing, and enable all those who are willing to assist in doing their best a chance to prove that others outside of Victoria are competent in carrying out this class of work. T he D e p a r t m e n t w r o t e in r e p l y Department of Defence, Melbourne, 20th October, 1915. DEAR SIR,-With reference to your letter of 8th inst., relative to the manufacture of aeroplane engines, I am to inform you that the first order for engines was divided between Messrs.

It is noted that you have completed a 50/55 H.P. six-cylinder aero engine, and it is hoped that it w ill be completely successful. A report on the t r i a l of the engine is awaited with interest.

I "" should like first of all to refer to a lamentable statement made this evening-by way of interjection, it is true -by the honourable member for East Sydney.

I am not attacking the Minister, though he must be held to be finally responsible for the system he is administering. If he wil l not alter the system, there is nothing for us to do but attack him.

I am acting at the earliest possible moment. I have taken the woman's statement as she gave it to me. Her husband died on the 2nd August, and all she has had from the Defence Department in three months is £ 4 on which to keep herself and five children. Those are the bare facts of the case, and I think they require a lot of explanation. I ask the responsible Minister to investigate this case. case ? the particulars of the case to the Minister. WhatI claim ought to be done is this: I say that the Minister representing the Minister of Defence should lay on the table a statement setting out the procedure that should be followed, so that honourable members may know what it is, and, if necessary, be able to post the statement to his constituents for their information. It would be better still if the Department were to follow these cases up, and fix them without any trouble on the part of the widows and families. The widows ought not to have to go about begging and praying for something to live upon. I repeat that such cases are a perfect scandal. It is said that these things do not occur in some of the States. Why. then, should they occur in New South Wales with such shocking frequency ? I urge the Minister for the sake of his reputation and that of the Department, and in the interests of humanity, to put an end to them. It is no pleasure to me to draw attention to these matters, and I have not done so before; but the case which. I have mentioned is so shocking that I think that there must be something radically wrong with the system to make this possible. It is useless to be contented with the making of inquiries into individual cases: the system needs altering, so that justice may be done. I have been told that one of the causes of tlie trouble is the over-wrought condition of the Sydney ofiice, which is undermanned, so that the employees have to work overtime night I am glad to after night, week in and week out. Whydoes not the Minister of Defence relieve himself of the civil work of his Department ? Why does he not call in some of the best business men of Australia, and ask them them suggest a staff for the civil work. MrJ . H . CATTS He has supporters I have not had who could take this in hand. ought not to be bothered with these details. He has enough to do on the military side. But although the Commonwealth has paid Mr Anderson over £1,000 for advice, and has had renorts from Committees and Commissions, nothing results, and nothing can result, unti l the Minister ceases to strain every nerve to keep everything within his own hands. To do that is beyond the power of any one man, and the sooner the civil business of his Department is under proper business control the better it will be for the Minister and for the reputation of Australia. The other morning I visited the Base Hospital to see the arrangements for providing luncheon for sick and wounded soldiers who are receiving outdoor treatment. I found that these men are required to attend at 9 o'clock in the morning, and that some of them have to -wait about for a great part of the day before being attended to. What could be simpler than to draw up a roster so that each could take his t u r n in fixed order 1 When things are done wrong, unnecessary trouble is made for all concerned. When at the hospital, I met a man in civilian clothing who told me that he had been jeered at by three men in khaki for not being at the front, although, as a matter of fact, he had been at the front, had been wounded, and had been discharged as incapable of further service. That man is liable to insult, because he has nothing to distinguish him from men who have not offered their services.

It is easy to say, "" Why not go to this officer or to that? "" hut if the system were put right grievances would not occur. The sooner the present scandal ends the better for the country's reputation. MrM c GRATH (Ballarat) [9.41] I support the demand of the honourable member for Parramatta for an inquiry into the case that he has mentioned. Honourable members generally regret the necessity for making these cases public. We all desire that the widows of men killed at the front shall have no difficulty in getting what money is due to them. During the past twelve months I have had brought under my notice a great many claims for pensions, and have not found much difficulty in getting them dealt with in the Pensions Office. As a rule, when notice of a death is received, fche pension papers are sent to the next of k in to the deceased to be filled in . and the ordinary payments are continued for two months, so that in ninety-nine cases out of 100 there is no interval between these payments and the payments of the pensions. The case mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta is a most serious one. He told us that in three months a woman received only £ 4 . Many of these persons do not know how to seek relief. As I said the other night, the outbreak of war forced us to suddenly create organization which is naturally defective in operation. I can safely say that I have had more cases of delayed payments brought under my notice than have been put before any other honourable member. A t least 1,000 cases have been brought before me. Nearly all of them have been fixed up easily enough, but I have in vain appealed to the Department to introduce a system which would enable men to get their payments without difficulty. If the Minister for the Navy will take a note of the suggestion that I am going to make, he will be able to put an end to the trouble which occurs when soldiers are sent into the Base Hospital or are transferred from one camp to another. Those are the cases in which 95 per cent, of the complaints occur. In the Ballarat Camp the Officer Commanding has to make up the pay-sheets, send them to [258]2 Melbourne, and then the money is sent to Ballarat. If a soldier is transferred from Ballarat to Seymour all record of him is lost. The week's or fortnight's pay which is owing to him in Ballarat probably is not paid for three, or four, or five months. A t Ballarat a sum of money should be placed at the disposal of the Officer Commanding in the Commonwealth Bank, and every fortnight tlie paymaster in Ballarat ought to be able to pay the men without sending the pay-sheets to Melbourne, and, in the case of a man being transferred to another Camp, to do what is done in connection with any mine or business here. If a man is owed four or five days' pay and is transferred to Seymour he ought to receive a cheque before he leaves for that place. A pass-book should be issued to the man, and the date to which he is paid up to should be noted therein. If a man were sent to the Base Hospital he could produce the pass-book to the paymaster there, they could enter him up, and know exactly when to start paying him again. I venture to say that if that little plan were adopted by the Defence Department 99 per cent, of the complaints about the non-payment of money would cease immediately. It seems to me remarkable that so little power is given to the man in charge of a Camp. On SundayI inquired into the case of a man who has been drunk about twenty times, who has deserted again and again, but who has never deserted for twenty days. He has come back at the end of nineteen days and been fined. The Officer Commanding has recommended that the man be discharged, for he has no power to discharge him. But while that recommendation is being dealt with the man is rifling the k it of the other soldiers, stealing boots, socks, and other articles. When I went to the place he was put under lock and key. In most cases we have to continue to pay a in a:i of that type 5s. or 6s. a day. Although the Officer Commanding says that he ought to be discharged, yet he has no power to act. God only knows when he will get word from head-quarters that the man will be discharged. If the authorities here do not proceed at a greater pace I believe that many of these men will be in Camp until the end of the war. A t least we shall have to feed them. The officer in charge ought to have power to say that they should be kicked out of the Camp immediately. I know of a case where a man was medically unfit for active service.

He was told that it would take at least a month before he could get his discharge papers. He is anxious to go to the job, but he dare not take on any work until he gets a discharge. One would think that if the departmental heads had any care or concern for the finances they would be only too anxious to give him an immediate discharge. a very simple thing to do. When the Medical Board examine a soldier and declare that he is physically active service, one would expect Board to have clerks present to write out his discharge immediately, sign it, and hand it to him as he passed out of the door, and so finish the matter.

Writing to me the other day about a letter I had sent with One would reference to the pay of Private So-and-So, an officer said, "" W ill you call and see the This man has a job to go to, Officer Commanding and have this man's payments adjusted?"" It was, I think, a most astounding request to receive from an officer Judging from the letter, one might think that the honourable members of tliis House are mere office boys for some of the M i l it a r y crowd; that we are here merely to do their bidding, to go from one room to another and find out how much pay is due to a man. That incident It is ought to prove to Senator Pearce that there must be a great lack of system in connection with the payment of the unfit for soldiers. The Government ought to adopt the the principle of decentralization. They did a wise thing in establishing Campsi n and then the country. Let them now provide each Officer Commanding with a paymaster, uid a banking account out of which to pay the men every fortnight. Let the Officer Commanding pay the soldiers who are sent away, whether it is to another Camp soldier can receive his papers or to a hospital. From my experience, I These are little guarantee that my suggestion, if adopted, would solve practically all the difficulties, f t is a matter which ought to be dealt We all with without delay.

I guarantee He ought to be looking that when a soldier's wife is complaining that her money is not coming to hand, it is not an inducement. to her next-door neighbour to enlist and leave his wife and little children at the mercy of the DefenceI have Department.

Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan) [9.57]. I am surprised to find that a SupplyB ill has been introduced authorizing the expenditure of over £7,000,000 without any explanatory speech by the Treasurer. I do not know of any previous occasion on which this course has been followed. The Labour party, when they were in opposition, were very insistent that f u l l explanations should be given in regard to every SupplyB ill . I am sorry to see that the Estimates have not heen submitted. They are usually presented within a couple of months after the end of the financial year, but that system seems to have been departed from since the outbreak of the war, though I see no reason for it . The Departments should be in a position to provide their Estimates, whether there is a war in progress or not. They must have information as to what they propose I am aware of that. to spend in the coming year, and the Treasurer is always able to estimate what revenue he expects to receive. It is regrettable that we should have departed from a rule which has been the practice of all Parliaments in Australia up to the outbreak of the present war. Though four JOHN FOBBEST -The honourable months of the current financial year have elapsed, so f a r as I can see there is no present intention of providing estimates of revenue and expenditure for the consideration of honourable memhers.

It is customary to circulate these Supply long before the resolutions in Committee of Supply and Ways and Means have been agreed to; but that course has not been followed on this occasion. It seems to me that the Governmeut consider the passing of Estimates by Parhament as of no importance, and the Legislative seems to have gone by the board. matter about which I complain, and about which I have complained ever since the outbreak of the war, is the mixing up of loan expenditure current account, placing the revenue obtained by loans to the credit of the Consolidated moneys and current revenue as if they were one ancl the same thing. This practice has never been followed in any State. usual procedure is to submit loan estimates and revenue estimates, and it is the better plan. Honourable members do not know the details of the expenditure of this £5,000,000 which is provided in this Bill for defence, yet no State Government would propose to spend on public works without submitting estimates and giving all details in regard to it. Are we to be less careful as to our finances than the States, which have had long experience, and have had just as much trouble in getting loan through Parliament as in getting on current account agreed to? Since the advent to office of the Labour party the Sir John Forrest. but tbose who live Commonwealth Parliament have got into inconvenienced a slip-shod way of dealing with the finances. £50,000.000 or £60,000,000 a year on the war, and do not get much information in and the Appropriaregard to the expenditure.

In this connection I desire to bring under tlie notice of honourable members a case which occurred the £5,000.000 other day at' Armidale. In that Camp loan there are about 400 men, and suddenly measles made its appearance ' amongst them. There was not a stretcher in the Camp, and there was no hospital accommodation.

Needless to add, long before the reply was received the local residents had provided the sick men with stretchers. such circumstances it should not have been necessary for the Commandant to wire to anybody for permission to purchase stretchers. He should have been able to purchase them on his own authority, and to send the bill to the Department. quarantine the Camp? South Wales when only two or three cases of measles occurred. CampI saw, at least, twenty cases of men recovering from measles. There are one or two other matters that I wish to impress upon Ministers. There is nothing that requires more reorganization in the Defence Department than does the supply of information in regard to casualties. my notice in which an intimation has been sent from the Defence Department to the relatives of soldiers who have sustained in j u r y at the front , and in which the relatheir boys have been wounded, and that tives have thereafter unsuccessfully endeavoured to secure further information. Personally, I do not know of any man who attends to his duties with more assiduity than does the officer in charge of the records at the Base Hospitali n Melbourne; but he is handicapped by what transpires overseas. I propose to cite a case in this connection which is by no means an isolated one. I may inform honourable members that recently I have taken the trouble to secure a copy of tlie cables that have been forwarded in reference to casualties sustained by our troops from the Base Hospital in Egypt. In the present instance, the first intimation was that a soldier, whose name I shall not mention, was reported wounded, by cable, under date 26th May last. The parents were naturally anxious to secure some additional particulars, and accordingly they got into touch with tlie Defence Department, and received the following reply: Egypt advises absence further reports, assumed all wounded progressing satisfactorily. The father thereupon cabled to almost every person he could think of in Egypt, but could get no further information as to his son. Eventually, in reply to an urgent request of mine, another cable was despatched on the 12th September, On the 18th September, a cable was received from Alexandria, which readReported wounded 10th May, But I venture to say that in 1015. No further report. good-bye to that poor man. was despatched asking for a report as to the injured soldier's progress and his whereabouts. It was addressed to the the authorities Australian Intermediate Base at Cairo, and readCan yon ascertain and report progress. . . in New. . . reported wounded 10th May? Alexandria replies, "" No further report."" Subsequently a communication was received, which set out that the soldier in question was wounded and missing, though he had previously been reported as wounded. The Australian Intermediate Base added that there was no trace of his whereabouts, and that he had not rejoined his unit. It has taken the Department five months from the date when Dozens of cases have come under the man was first reported to have been wounded for the final information to be obtained. These reports go from mouth to mouth in the country. Parents state they can get no information regarding them. I have heard people telling one another of their difficulties in this respect, and when other parents hear, they are not anxious to let their own sons go. If the Department had the necessary staff, it should be a very simple matter to keep up a regular weekly record of what is occurring. That information could very easily be coded and transmitted to Australia in the nature of a progress report, so that if a man is progressing satisfactorily the Department would be in a position to send that in formation to his next of k in . I know, as a matter of fact, that this is done in regard to the wounded in Europe, where it would not be possible for a man to be missing for three months without the Base knowing. where a man was reported to have been wounded at the Dardanelles, and his parents can hear nothing further about him. stand, when the actual conditions at",52,Smith How Long Has The To Put Things On A Business Footing Let

General) [10.30] I desire to take this opportunity to make a few remarks upon two or three aspects of matters that have been placed before the House. I can assure the honourable member for Richmond' that I will investigate the grievance which he has brought under my notice. It seems to be complicated and inexplicable, but I will endeavour to get at the facts, and have what appears to be an -anomaly rectified. Concerning the subject referred to by the honourable member for Hume, namely, the carrying of mails on the railway systems of the Commonwealth, I want to say that I am in no way responsible for the present condition of things. That contract was entered into by some predecessor of mine in office a long time ago, and it seems to lack that attention to detail which should have been exercised in a contract involving, as it does, the expenditure of such a large -sum of money. To-day, we are in the anomalous position that while we have arI will ranged with the railway authorities to carry our mails, say, six times a week by train, if they reduce the trains to three times a week, we still have to pay the same amount as previously, and in two or three cases in which we improvised a trolley service to maintain the mail service as originally arranged, the railway authorities actually had the audacity to charge us for the trolley service as well as for the trains that did not run. some Governments are not business like. I suppose fche stigmatize any one in particular over this subject. I simply state that it is unfora hundred lines, and the tunate that we have not displayed a keener comprehension of our responsibilities and obligations in these matters. W it h regard to the other subject brought forward, the delay in the despatch of week-end cables to and from our men at the front, I can only say that I hope that trouble will disappear. The Postal Corps which is being sent to Egypt is being despatched for the purpose of remedying unforeseen difficulI should like to know ties that have arisen since the outbreak of the war. trouble is caused here through letters beI f the Postmaster-General ing put into the wrong bag. trouble at this end, I will have f u l l investigation made. The principal difficulties, I understand, have been at the other end, owing to the absence of co-ordination, but I hope all troubles will soon be remedied. I realize that I have been called upon to administer a heavy Department-a Department that is the butt of every honourable member of the House, and practically of every man outside the House-a t an important juncture in the history of the Commonwealth. to say about it vourself. hostile criticism. My endeavour always was to help those who were administering the Department, and I want to say that I feel that the responsibility to-day is f a r greater than it ever has been in our history.

I ask honourable members, therefore, to remember this in their criticism. I do not mind criticism if it is good, and if it be levelled sideration,"" and the whole subject will be honestly. No man need fear honest criticism, for it serves but to indicate what may or may not be remedied by those in authority. I should like to-night to set out for the benefit of honourable members and public bodies, as well as the public generally, one or two principles that I intend to observe in the conduct of the Department. There has grown up a system under which the Ministerial head as well as responsible officers are interviewed at all hours of the day, and without any notice, by members of Parliament, public bodies, and the general public, without previous intimation of the objects of their interviews. In this way much valuable time, which officers should be devoting to their duty, is lost. unbusinesslike and slip-shod method must inevitably lead to a waste of time on the part of the Minister as well as his staff. I propose, therefore, that every interview with me or with a responsible officer shall be preceded by a precise statement of the object with which the interview is sought. ters arise unexpectedly. need not come under that rule. the honourable member proposes that all interviews shall be by appointment? object of the interview shall be notified. It is not fair to the Minister or to the departmental officers that interviews should be sought with them without notice, and concerning matters of which they have received no previous intimation. lost very often in finding out what is wanted, and it frequently happens that a second interview is necessary. object of each interview be intimated in advance it will be better for the Minister or tlie officer concerned, and will lead to expedition and economy. I propose to apply tlie same rule to public deputations. I intend, if I can, to require that a precise statement of the object of any proposed deputation shall be forwarded with the application for an appointment. If this be done, it may often be found that the matter can be adjusted by the Minister without a deputation, and unnecessary travelling may thus be obviated. ment is sent along a reply will be f u r nished that the matter "" will receive conforgotten by the Department before its reply is received. while I am in office. I have issued an in struction that expedition is to be regarded as an indication of the just performance of the duty ef every officer. ister will enforce that rule ? the reason why. I wish now to deal briefly with a matter relating to the industrial side of the Department. Rightly or wrongly this Parliament decided some time ago that all matters appertaining to wages, hours, and conditions of labour in the service should be determined by the This Conciliation and Arbitration Court. That is the policy of the Government, and is clearly understood to be the basis upon which such matters shall be adjusted. throughout the whole service ? case of those who are exempt by Act of Parliament. master-General see that the awards of the Court are carried out? In other words, cases. There is cast upon those representing the men engaged in the postal service the obligation of seeking an award by the tribunal which has been fixed by Parliament for the adjustment of their grievances, and there is cast upon the man controlling the Department the obligation of seeing that the awards of that tribunal are carried out in their entirety. in the past.

447,Mr Webster,"No. I want to getscale of rents and call charges, and spent the last week-end in an endeavour to see whether I could give any f u r t h e r relief to subscribers, while at the same time doing justice to the Department and the service. the new scale came nearest to the view expressed by the Postal Commission six years ago. They are as follow: Annual ground rent, within 2-mile radius. f § Exchanges or -§» Networks with Subscribers' Lines 12 -si connected as shown hereunder. ""5 w »8 sa -§3 « S Miles.

No charge will be made to the subscriber for calls received by him. Thc calls made over each line will be charged for separately. Calls mode on the business of the Postmaster-Genera] by any duly authorized officer will not be charged. Instead of being calculated on the population basis, which is not adopted by any other telephone system, the above rates are based on the practical, common-sense method of calculating the number of subscribers on the exchange. The charge for a call upon a public telephone will be 2d. The estimated increased revenue is £180,000 per annum. The present deficit of the service is £500,000. upon having the same number of subscribers ? for a 20 per cent, decrease. An examination of the rates charged on other telephone systems shows that, except in Sweden, Switzerland, and Copenhagen, Denmark, there is no other system in the world that will be nearly as cheap as ours, even at the increased rates. Therefore, although we have to serve a scattered population on a large continent, with great initial expenses, we are able to give a service which is equalled by very few other countries. each State be uniform?

In South Africa the minimum charge for a business telephone under the measured system is £7 10s. for 900 calls, and Id. is collected for every additional call. Every call over a distance of 5 miles is counted double. In London the flat rate is £17 10s. for business and residence telephones. On the measured rate the charge for a business telephone is £ 5 10s. for 360 calls and Id. for every additional call, and an extra charge is imposed on all calls through other exchanges. Those figures are sufficient to show that in comparison with the charges levied in other parts of the world, the rates I am proposing are just, and even lenient. I do not like being obliged to impose extra charges, but that course is necessary. During the next three or four months I intend to devote whatever ability I have, and all the time. I can spare, to a thorough investigation of the postal services, and if after having gone through the Department in a thorough manner I can evolve some system which will remove the anomalies which exist, and improve the general conditions in the Department, and if Parliament is prepared to adopt that system, I have no doubt that in time. I shall have the nleasure of being able to reduce the charges. At present it is impossible to avoid an increase. orable member's time has expired. [11.2] A few days ago the Prime Minister was asked a .question in regard to Mr Ashmead Bartlett's reports on the problem at Gallipoli, but no honourable member has touched on that matter during the present debate. Honourable members may he wise in maintaining silence on the subject, but Parliament is to adjourn shortly, and may not meet again until March, and if any discussion is to take place in regard to the war operations the present is the most opportune time. Australia is doing its share in the terrible war which is in progress, and the Supply Bill before the Committee contains avote of over £5,000,000 for the Expeditionary Forces. The Prime Minister stated that it was not for us to reason why in regard to the conduct of the war. I do not agree with that view. Australia is expending an enormous sum of money, and the unrest in the British Parliament provides evidence .that there is something wrong in the Imperial conduct of affairs. We in Australia ought to know a little more than we are permitted to know at present. I do not desire any information as to the mode of campaign. He would ba a fool who would ask for such particulars-,, but as people who are as much involved ini the present struggle as the inhabitants of.' the TJnited, Kingdom, I do demand that Australia, as well as the British tax'' payer, should have some say in the conduct of affairs. We are paying our quota, and yet we have no more say in regard to the large expenditure on the war than have the people of America. There should be no taxation without representation of some sort. The opinion has been abroad for some time that the Oversea Dominions should have a say i?i the administration of the war in certain directions. member not think that it would be just as well for us to put our own house in order first? 1 am dealing with what is our own house, in view of the fact that it is costing us over £50,000,000 a year at the present; time. The right honourable member for Swan to-night objected to the expenditure in Australia, but it is not a fleabite compared with the vast expenditure we have undertaken in connection with the conduct of the war. If the honourable gentleman was justified in complaining of the expenditure in Australia, I am surelyjustified in referring to what we are heing called upon to expend in connection witli the war. The Ministry, through thu Prime Minister, should, in my opinion, make some approach to the Imperial Government to secure that, in common with the other oversea Dominions, we should be given some say in the matter. It has heen suggested in the Imperial Parliament itself that the oversea Dominions should be consulted to somo extent. I do not presume to lay down any lines of policy, hut I do say tliat, as a paying partner in the concern, w should have some representation in the administration of the great affairs in which the Empire is engaged to-day. member should not forget that as partner? we do not pay pro rata. paying quite our share, and I will tell",58,Smith How Long Has The To Put Things On A Business Footing Let

It is the wealth of the British Empire that we are out to protect, and, according to their wealth, the people of Great Britain are not paying more than we in Australia are paying. more per head than our people are paying. quite true, but they are not paying more according to their wealth. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the people of Great Britain have little or nothing to pay with.

I heard soldiers forty years ago say that the only way to force the Dardanelles was to make an attack at the Bulair neck of the Gallipoli Peninsula. The Turks themselves iiave thought so, because that is the part of the peninsula which they have most strongly fortified. We have been attacking a narrow front, and it is generally admitted that there has been a mistake. It is a muddle; but we are paying very heavily for it in flesh and blood and money, and I repeat that we should have some say in the conduct of the war. We are now sending to the Old Country a representative who will he fresh from our financial position, and of the opinions House. When we are doing the fair thing in rendering assistance to the Empire, it is but right, in my opinion, that, with the other oversea Dominions, we should have some representative at the centre of the Empire in close touch with In my those who are controlling events, and able to give us information as to how things are going on. WhatI have said may be unpalatable in some quarters; but I have come to the conclusion that when we are paying so much in flesh and blood and money, the time has arrived when we should have some representation. I do not expect universal approval of the ther the Prime Minister intends to do anything in the direction I suggest. Judging from what he said the other day, he does not intend to adopt such a course; some expression of opinion from Ministers, and particularly from the Prime Minister,* in connection with our concern in the trouble at Gallipoli to-day. If the Prime Minister does not express some opinion of the kind, we cannot force him to do so, because I may inform honourable members opposite that this is not one of the matters that can be brought before the Caucus. I leave the subject with these remarks, and with the repetition of my view that something in the direction I have suggested should be done. wish to direct the attention of the Minister for the Navy, as representing the Minister of Defence in this Chamber, to one more pin-prick that, as a recruiting enthusiast in New South Wales, I find is going to add to the difficulties we have to confront in promoting the voluntary system of recruiting we have adopted.

491,Mr Speaker,"This is the usuala first time. ^'That this Bill be now read a second time. [[11.24] I rise to call attention to a ..natter that should have been referred to (earlier-the absence of financial proposals for fittingly recognising the great uervices rendered to Australia by the late Major-General Bridges, the first leader of our Expeditionary Force. The glorious death of that gentleman has had sad and serious consequences for his wife and family, and nothing is proposed, nor appears in contemplation, for the adequate recognition of their sacrifices. To put the case in a nutshell-becaus e we may not discuss it at length at this hour of the night-the Bridges has required of his family a tremendous monetary sacrifice, so far as the family is concerned, to say nothing of his having given his life to the service of the country. H a d he stayed here, he would have been entitled at least to as handsome treatment as many other officers in our Defence Forces have received-officers , some of them, by the way, who had rendered not a tithe of the service which he had rendered. Honourable members w ill recollect that only a little while ago a commandant of New South Wales retired, after filling out his years of service in peace time, with a gratuity of, I think, £ 1 , 5 0 0 voted to him by Parliament. of Brigadier-General Gordon. t h in k , and he has another job at Home. General Bridges not gone to the war, but stayed here, filling out his round of duties as other superior officers have done, he would have been entitled to receive an amount of about £4,500. duty. regulations of the Defence Department. Had he been injured here in the performance of his duty, he would have been entitled to a gratuity amounting to £4,500. T h a t is, I believe, the amount which we actually did pay to General Hoad, and we paid £2,000 to Brigadier-General Gordon when he retired from the position of State Commandant. All that General Bridges' widow and family will receive is about £ 1 5 0 a year. MrJ . H . CATTS -What are their circumstances ? General Bridges l e f t his family in very poor circumstances; in fact, I understand that they have. practically nothing. He received only a very moderate salary unt i l just lately. An y one knows what representing a place like Australia at the heart, of the Empire means. I believe that while General Bridges was in London the amount we paid to him did not nearly cover his expenses, and the restilt of his unselfish service to the State is that his widow and family have been left in very poor circumstances indeed. I know the democratic feeling prevailing in this death of Major-General chamber that one man is as good as another, and I know the arguments which are put forth from time to time. But I submit that, in these matters, we may not alone take that democratic view. We have a right to take the value of the General's services to the country, and on that basis, and on that alone, he is entitled to more generous treatment than is provided under our present war conditions. submitted again to the Cabinet. It is a peculiar case. I believe that, in the Defence Department, there is only one other case like it . membered also that General Bridges more than any other man represented the entire Army. He was the maker of the He received £2,000, I Army in a very real sense, and I do think that his case is entitled to exceptional treatment. It stands by itself. It can be construed into no precedent, so far as I know. An honourable member has just put up a plea that we ought to be admitted to all the privileges that members of Parliament get at the other end of the world. If we are to be entitled to all the privileges, is it not up to us to accept some of the responsibilities? died here, and not in war, his widow would have been entitled to' £4,500, but by passing the War Pensions Bill we abrogated her right under the regulation.

508,Mr Mathews,"It is the only point,there is another point, and a very strong one. Every other country, democratic or autocratic, always makes a special grant to the leaders of its M i l it a r y Eorces, in time of war particularly. I submit that these two points, taken together, make an exceptional claim on the consideration of the House. the Government to take this matter into their very serious consideration, and see whether, in the circumstances, they cannot pay this officer the compliment of treating his family more generously than is proposed in the regulation. something of that kind is done it means that the Government will be penalizing this hero. we all ought to get into our minds. We have actually penalized General Bridges because he created an efficient Army, and went out and sacrificed his life in leading it . ought to treat him at least as generously as he would have been entitled to have been treated had he stayed here and done nothing special for his country. glad to hear the Minister of Trade and Customs say that this matter will have reconsideration, and I express the very earnest hope that the result of such reconsideration will be an increased ^generosity on the part of the Government and the House to the family will never know the debt it owes to General Bridges, and how much of the efficiency of its Military Forces is due to his unselfish and patriotic labours during the whole of his career in our service.

I wish, however, to endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Hume. The pension which is paid to many of the mothers of the soldiers who have fallen at Gallipoli is not sufficient. When the War Pensions Bill was before This country the HouseI was one of those who trusted that these mothers would be treated equally with widows, and be entitled to the f u l l pension of £ 1 , but' I find that many of them are receivinc no more than 5s. a week.

I have heard with some concern this declaration of policy from the Postmaster General. I should have thought that before making any declaration of that kind he would have inquired first of all into the whole of our telephone system; yet, after being in office for so short a time, he tells us that he proposes to make the people pay £180,000 more for the existing wretched, inadequate, and inefficient telephone service. I did not expect it from h i m . I am not so sure that he has not always been a strenuous advocate of removing the inefficiency of the service before the imposition of increased rates. One would not object to payment where one had a fair return for his money, but in New South Wales the telephone service is the most inefficient of all. Itcould not be worse, and yet on the top of that we are to have the solatium of increased rates. If the Minister enforces these increased rates it will simply mean a huge decrease in the number of telephone users, because the use of the telephone will be outside the pale of ordinary people. To propose to nut the matter straight by raising the rates is unwise and unbusinesslike. thought economy on a grand scale should be possible by the wholesale introduction of automatic telephones, and that this would cut down the expenses of the Department immensely; but nothing is done, there is to be no improvement in the system, and no retrenchment or economy in this respect.

I will never consent to the telephone rates being raised until the Department has been thoroughly re-organized. The proposal of the Postmaster-General is like putting the cart before the horse. If Parliament once consents to the increase of these rates, and the Telephone Branch pays in consequence, they will muddle along indefinitely, and we will never get any chance to secure much needed reforms. the Postmaster-General can say, "" Here is a credit balance,"" we will hear nothing more about re-organization, and he w ill find all his energy w ill fizzle out, beproposal to increase the taxation upon the cause his officers will put up to him the argument that there is no necessity to bother. .On the other hand, so long as there is a deficit there will be some chance of securing that re-organization in the Department which is so badly needed. want also to direct attention to the position with regard to trunk telephone lines. I am satisfied that the officials underestimate altogether the revenue to be derived from this source, and they seem also to be unable to appreciate the circumstances in very many instances. while ago a telephone line was applied for in my electorate between Cawongla and Kyogle, a distance of 10 miles. sent telephonic communication between those places is vid Lismore and Casino, a distance of over 65 miles, and the reason advanced by the Department against the direct trunk telephone line was that there would not be sufficient business to warrant it . Now, anybody who has had experience of calling through a number of exchanges knows that one might be there a couple of days and not get a connection. I have tried myself to get telephonic connection between Cawongla and Kyogle, and though I have persisted for four or five hours, I have been unsuccessful. Therefore, when the Department puts up that reason as an argument against a direct trunk line, I am unable to understand it . knows that this discussion is out of order. He can discuss it on the Postmaster-General's estimates. much in order, and the first item is an excellent opportunity for dealing with this matter.

Instead of that, he has been in office only a few days. He has hardly had time to warm his official seat before he comes to this Chamber and asks us to consent to this iniquitous increase in the rates. If the Postmaster-General intends to treat the Committee in this cavalier way, and if he asks us to challenge his decision as he did to-night, he. must be a greater simpleton than I take him to be if he thought that in regard to this matter the Committee would not immediately take up a challenge of that sort, even at this late hour of the night.

Here are two items of increased savings. The Board of Management is to effect savings .in a very short time, and an additional modicum of savings is to be effected by removing the staff from the control of the Public Service CommissionerEvidence was given to the effect that the position of Chairman of the Board of Management would be worth a salary of at least £2,000 per annum. Your Commissioners are not prepared to recommend the amount of salary necessaryA f t e r saying that it should be £2,000, the honourable gentleman goes on, in the next sentence, to say he was not prepared to recommend what it should bebut consider that in order to obtain suitable members for the Board of Management it is imperative that attractive salaries be provided, as the service requires the highest standard of administrative ability procurable. The constant concern and the main interest of the Board of Management would be to anticipate public requirementsI suppose that this increase is in anticipation of a public requirement. D i d anybody ever hear of a people requiring £180,000 more to be clapped on in the way of taxes? This increase is the requirement of the bureaucratic Minister, not the requirement of the publicThe constant concern and main interest of thc Board of Management would be to anticipate public requirements by continuous assimilation of all the improved methods adopted in the post and telegraph world, and it would, in order to popularize its own system, be constantly considering the public welfare. I suppose that the honourable gentleman's method of considering the public welfare is to make an additional charge of £180,000Such a Board of Management would, doubtless, endeavour to establish the post and telegraphic service on a self-supporting basis, without undue sacrifice of facilities to the public. Once effective management is established, reforms in the Post aud Telegraph Department will inevitably follow. The honourable gentleman has clapped on the rates, but he has not given us the management. Then, over the leaf, he says in his reportSuch Board of Management should equip Parliament through the Postmaster-General with reliable advice on the financial condition of the services. "" Having looked into this matter during the week-end,"" he said, "" I have decided that an .increase of £180,000 must be imposed."" Where is poor old Spence? What has he gone for? W h y did the party put him out at all? on saying that? How do you know that he did not resign ? He may have resigned. may have declined to sit any longer with that "" pestilential gang "" opposite. Paragraph 485 of the Royal Commission's report saysYour Commissioners inquired into the question of the advisability of separating tlie Telephone Branch from the Post and Telegraph Department. The evidence received was to the effect that the telegraphic ancl telephonic services are closely associated, ancl could not be separated with advantage. The engineering and construction work of both these branches is performed by the staffs of the Electrical Engineer's Branches. According to this paragraph, the telegraph and telephone services must be linked, but now the Postmaster-General says that they must not be in association, fchat there must be complete separation, and that the telephone service must be made to pay as such. As a matter of fact, he was correct in what he said a few years ago. The one service profoundly affects the other, and the two must be considered together in their bearings one upon the other.

No man desires a telephone system at the expense of the people of Australia. member, however, where one great saving can -be effected in the construction of country lines. Whenever a line is being constructed in the country, even if it is only intended to carry one or two lines, an engineer is sent out to survey the line. A foreman follows, supervising the erection of the line, and expenditure goes on in that way that is not required at all, whilst very often the line is made too strong. An 15-ft. poles when 10-ft. poles w ill do ? erect such short poles, but I have seen 26-ft. poles being used to carry two wires. A.fc Bridgewater it is possible to see such a line, the construction of which must have cost £ 2 6 a mile. member remember that when I described Luis particular line, he referred to it as being jerry built? the honourable gentleman speaks of is a line where tlie poles are 8 or 9 feet high. In the line I suggest the poles should be 21 feet high, 2 f t . 6 in . round, and 4 feet from the butt. That gave about 17 feet oufc of the ground, which is ample. too. were used instead of proper insulators on a very lightly-constructed line. I am not speaking of that line at all, however. My opinion is that the engineer has followed too closely the engineering in the Old Country, where provision has to be made for snow troubles, which are the worse troubles the telephone has to meet. In the country a line at one time erected at the rate of £ 1 1 6s. per mile ought not to cost more than £ 1 6 a mile now. That line would probably last from seventeen to twenty years if the timber was well selected; and if that system were adopted the Postmaster-General would be able to reduce his expenditure very considerably. What is the need of sending an engineer out over surveys like those in the country when there are foremen linemen quite capable of doing the work. If thc people were to find the labour, as it was suggested by the honourable member for Wannon, they would, with a foreman lineman supervising and putting on the wire-becaus e an amateur ought not to be permitted to deal with the wire-the cost I can teli the honorahle of construction would be reduced still* more. Another matter in connection with the Post Office came under my notice quite recently. Men were told off to go by train at 6 o'clock in the morning, then walk some distance, and to work u n t i l 5 o'clock in the evening. The result was that the hours were very long. The men complained, and set out their grievances, and tlie result was that two engineers went down in a motor car to have a look round and attend to the complaint. city, but they are not, in my opinion, neI would not cessary in the country, and their presence in country districts all tends to an in creased charge. I hope the Postmaster General will go into the details of this branch of the service again, and I am of opinion that he w ill be able to make greater reforms, and at the same time the honourable bring charges down. I do not want to see the telephone service dp mor© than just pay its way. I do not want to see the Government making any profit out of the telephone service, because immediately you increase the telephone rates you penalize a majority of the business people who are using the telephone for the purpose of facilitating trade and increasing the community's wealth. Business people in a smaller way who are compelled to use the telephone, will also be penalized. Any profits that may occur to the system, however, instead of going back in big dividends into the pockets of some owner, will eventually find its way into the people's pockets. In my opinion, however, the Postmaster-General has been compelled to increase the rates. We cannot go on in time of war giving an excellent service for very small pay without penalizing a large number of people. ber satisfied that this increase is necessary ? deficit exists that has been described, soma such action is unquestipnably necessary.

I greatly appreciate the manner in which the right honourable member for Swan received my interjection to-night with regard to the delay in the presentation of his Budget speech on a former occasion. He said that I had exaggerated by saying that he had asked for time; but I have looked up Hansard, and I find that he was asked twice why he had not presented his Budget. The session opened on the 9th July, 1913, and we did not get the Budget speech until the 2nd October of that year, although we were under normal conditions at the time. I would not have mentioned this but for the fact that I wanted to show that my statement was correct. . have to express my indignation that the Treasurer brought in his proposals to increase the telephone rates at such a late hour. this heavy imposition on the country people. Members from the other States, after travelling all night, are not in a position to deal with this important proposal which has been brought forward so suddenly. Mr Spence, when Postmaster General, presented a statement to this House indicating that there had been a loss ' of £500,000 on the telephone systems of the Commonwealth; but it was shown that practically the whole of that loss was accounted for in the capital cities of the Commonwealth, and, that being the case, it would be only fair for the Government to ask the subscribers to telephones in the metropolitan areas to bear the increased charges, in order to make up the . deficiency. The honourable member for Denison was very much astray in his geological information concerning Sydney when he informed the Committee that engineers had told him that Sydney was rocky country, and nothing else but bluestone. Thatinformation is not correct. The delays which occur when fresh applications are made for connexions with exchanges are partly responsible for the unsatisfactory financial position of the Department. Generally it takes weeks, sometimes months, before the new telephones are installed. In my own constituency application was made eighteen months ago for a telephone line from North Condobolin to Bobadah and VermontH ill , a distance of about 60 miles. The people were told that they would have to subscribe a certain amount to cover the cost. They put their hands in their pockets and found the inoney; hut even now they have not got the telephone, though tenders have been accepted. They are willing to pay for it, and if the Government had pushed the business along, certain of those subscribers would to-day have been increasing the revenue of the Department, and thus helping in a certain measure to reduce the deficit. The same thing is happening elsewhere. Only the other day I had a letter from a gentleman who has a business at Cumnock, and another business at Yeoval. He wrote to me to say that he had written several times to the Department, but could not get telephone connection, and he asked me if I would move in the matter. A gentleman in another town told me that he had been waiting for quite a long time It is absolutely wrong to place to get. telephonic connection; and only last week, when I was at Manly, I remarked to a friend of mine, a Mr ""Webb, that I would ring him up in the morning. "" No, you won't,"" he said, "" for I have dismantled my telephone, because I find it pays me much better to walk and see my friends, and tell them what I have to say, than to try to ring them up on the telephone.""

The officials say it is due to Sydney's rapid growth in the last few years, but they have not taken the precaution to make provision for the future, as -any ordinary business man would do. One of the complaints in New South Wales is the lack of attention. This, for instance, is a rule "" more honored in the breach than the observance "" It is the duty of the operator to repeat every number passed by the subscriber, in order to give the subscriber an opportunity of correcting any misapprehension. In case the repetition is not clear, the operator's attention should be called to the fact. If it is incorrect, the right number should be repeated very distinctly, with emphasis on the figures misunderstood. The average Sydney subscriber certainly repeats the figures with emphasis, for there is a growing tendency on the part of the attendants not to repeat the number. A good deal of delay is thus caused, as the subscriber does not know whether the attendant is getting the number or not He waits, and finally loses his temper, which is a mistake, for once you lose your temper on the telephone you are ""gone to the mountains."" The attendants seem to have no fear of being reported. If you do report them the officer in charge promises an investigation, but you hear no result or the cause of the delay. On 18th August, 1911, Mr Ramsay Sharp was appointed a Commission to inquire into the complaints. In his report he statedBefore dealing with the results of tests nnd observations, I wish to emphasize the stupendous task that confronts the telephone officials, before the present system can r-e brought np to date and the result of pact neglect wiped out, to say nothing of the difficulty of coping with the rapidly increasing demand for telephone connection throughout New South Wales. Those responsible for tbe present chaotic conditions show want of foresight and ability, lack of faith in the future development of Australia, and want of acquaintance with the commercial life of this city. He recommendedThat all subscribers on single lines be allowed a rebate till tbeir lines be made metallic. . . . That a second meter be placed at subscriber's telephone, or a system introduced whereby the subscribers make the record under the telephonist's supervision. . . . That more power be given telephone manager? to deal promptly with careless and inefficient telephonists. . . . The Telephone Department should be run on strict commercial lines, witb a new business department thnt is in clo.se touch with the' development of the State, familiar with the latest methods in telephony, and competent to make ample provision for [259] expansion on the various exchanges and lines connected thereto. . . . The present centralization methods should be discontinued, and the city and suburbs divided into districts with an electrical engineer and a telephone manager to each district. The electrical engineer to have control of the local construction staffs, repair shops, stores, &c.; and the telephone manager to look after traffic staffs and attend to local applications for new lines, removals, &c. Those recommendations were made in 1911, but the very defects which Mr. Ramsay Sharp said existed at that time continue to exist, and yet the Minister tells us that there must be a material increase in the telephone rates. A t present, the subscriber has no means of checking the account rendered to him periodically. He cannot say that the account represents a f a it h f u l record of his use of the telephone. Throughout the States complaints on this score are general. Business firms allege that they are continually overcharged. Some eighteen months ago an appliance for the automatic recording of calls at the subscriber's end. and also in the exchange, was submitted by the inventor, Godfrey, to the then Postmaster-General, Mr Agar Wynne, who promised to give the machine a trial. If that invention were brought into use, the subscriber would feel satisfied that he was paying for what he had enjoyed. The officials may say that, instead of the subscriber being overcharged, there is a likelihood of calls not being charged up, bufc in the Argus of 1st June last year, appeared this letter under the heading "" The Infallible Telephone Department "" Sir,I have a telephone on my private house. Six months ago my family left for a holiday to the Old Country, and I decided to lock-up the house and stay at a hotel during their absence. Tbe house was securely locked, and the key left at the local police station. I have only been to the house once during that time, and the telephone department now charges me for 652 calls, alleged to have been recorded from my house. It is so absolutely impossible, as with tlie exception of the police who looked in once a week, no one has been near the place. NowI am told that if I don't pay the line will be disconnected in fourteen days. As my family are returning on the incoming mail steamer, I have to "" part up "" or suffer abuse. When are we going to have matters righted?-Yours, &c, ST. Krr.nA. 31st May. Frequently complaints of that nature have beeu made to me, and the Department invariably answers that somebody must have entered the house and used the telephone. There should be some means provided for checking all calls, but there is a tendency on the part of the Department to tur n down all inventions of Australian origin. sulators invented in Australia in favour of those made in Japan. party. policy of the oarty on this side of the House. We should encourage our own inventors. New inventions should be tested, and when they are equal to the imported article they should be installed, and the demand for them created. ticulars of another mechanical contrivance for recording callsSome three years ago, shortly after the introduction of the toll system, a device known as the "" Phonetoll "" was invented. This machine collects one penny from telephone users for each separate call, and is for use in conjuncters taken from scores of such communications, tion with all types of telephones to which large numbers of persons have access. The"" Phonetoll "" conforms to the regulations, and in no possible way interferes with the proper working of the telephone. This machine is an improvement on the "" Telecoppa,"" a coin collecting device owned by this firm for use on magneto telephones only. On placing the "" Phonetoll"" on the market, the permission of the Postmaster General was sought, and, as no objection had been made in the case of the "" Telecoppa,"" it was expected that the improved machine would meet with the same approval. Before, however, the slightest notice was taken of this request, more than four months elapsed, when a sample machine was asked to be submitted. This was promptly done, and, at the suggestion of the engineer, certain slight alterations were made, which completely eliminated any possible objections from a mechanical point of view. Permission to use the machine was still not definitely granted to the public, and many months again passed before any sort of reply to various requests for consideration was elicited. The ultimate response from the Department was thc raising of quibbling objections that the machine interfered with the proper upkeep and maintenance of the telephones where it was in use. Thc statements are unsupported by so much as a fraction of truth. The phonetoll, so far from causing any interruption, is actually of material help to the working of the exchange, .preventing, as it docs, thc incessant Hashing of switchboard lights by impatient callers. The principal objection seems to be that it is necessary to place a kep in the attachment when receiving messages, a feature that is common to every device for collecting coins, and has not been found in any way to cause -obstruction. Our Mr Beedon recently went to Melbourne, and spent several weeks, at considerable expense to this firm, in endeavouring to lay the matter fairly before thu Postmaster-General, and succeeded in securing an interview. Tliat gentleman, however, gave us to understand that he had no time to interfere in any mechanical matters, all of which he left to his engineers, and declined even to inspect the machine. Subsequently the Postmaster-General's Department definitely vetoed its use. The Minister remarked on the occasion, however, that he believed the machine to be a success, and knew of instances wliere it had effected a saving of £25 per annum. Our attention has been drawn by subscribers using our attachment to the fact that one feature of its use is a very great reduction in the number of calls charged, amounting in some instances to as much as 50 per cent a result brought about by the elimination of many quite needless callR, made before a really efficient coin collector became available. We suggest that this is the real objection to the phonetoll, the mechanism of which is so simple as not to need the special knowledge of an I have parengineer to see tliat the statement that it in any way interferes with the operation of the telephone is puerile. The machine is the only one which affords subscribers really efficient protection, and we are sure that the gross unfairness of the Department's ""action in preventing its use will be quite clear to you. We enclose a representative selection of letthe examination of which we invite. At present there are no means whatever available to subscribers to insure the collection of telephone fees, and this action of the Government is obviously short-sighted, as tending to place telephones beyond the reach of many people who, with the phonetoll in use, would find their instruments a source of revenue to themselves, and convenience to the public. I do not know the writer of that letter, but it does seem to me that it describes a machine that might be advantageously used. It should be given a trial. The public will be satisfied if they have some guarantee that the bill sent to them by the Department for telephone calls represents the amount of their indebtedness. I hope that the Postmaster-General will go into the merits of this machine, and will also call for a report on the Godfrey system, which is receiving a trial at the Ballarat exchange. If it be proved that these machines will accurately record the number of calls, the Minister should consider the advisability of installing them. There is one other matter to which I wish to refer, and that is the injustice which is being done to persons in charge of allowance post-offices through having the paltry pittances paid to them in many cases cut down by more than one-half. The person in charge of an allowance ofiice in one place in my electorate was, in the past, receiving £ 1 6 10s. per annum, but he has been written to by the Department to inform him that, in future, they cannot afford to pay more than £ 8",78,Honourable Membee B Y Using Highly Salaried Ofiicers Are Necessary I N The

For that reason the Government have taken a wise step in .suggesting £18,000,000. Even the £7,000,000 suggested as the requirements of the States during the next financial year should not be beyond the country's resources. Honourable members complaining of the expenditure on public works have a l l along grumbled at the waste of time by the Postal Department in the erection of post-offices and country telephone lines.

I confess I am bitterly disappointed. say-in this time of war, when we are trying to rake in everv sixpence, when we are floating loans by tens of millions throughout Australia, and are appealing to the people to patriotically contribute their money-that the Government are not spending nearly enough on public works, is a revelation of the attitude of the party that is governing Australia. One does not wonder, in view of statements like this, that the public debt, as well as the taxation of Australia, is in creasing so rapidly ner head. One does not wonder that Australia is already, perhaps, the most highly-taxed country in the world. But it is a fact. The honourable member for In d i on Friday was gibing us over this same question. He struck quite a triumphant note when he said that the present Government had always lived within their income, and that the Opposition had never done so. The answer to that is that the present Government have, within the last two or three years, placed £5,000,00 0 additional taxation upon the people of Australia. £1 per head, or £ 5 per family, to the burden of taxation -within the last two years. have done all this withi n the last year, to say nothing of the permanent obligations they are entering into for other than war purposes. want more for war purposes that I am arguing we should spend less just now for civil purposes.

Here we have the speetarle of Germany all out. out to the la.sf sixnpnre, her people suffering agonies of discomfort and distress in order to beat us; while in this House we have honourable members opposite holding the notion, apparently, that we can beat that nation with one hand and carry on onr usual occupations with the other. They are ready to fling money about for all sorts of things. Here we have proposals to spend £4,000,000 for public works, £1,100,00 0 more than last financial year. It is monstrous.

I am here to do my duty, as I conceive it , to the country, and I care not for all these jeers and interjections. able members make them. them. I am determined to make my protest against this extravagance in expenditure on the civil departments of this country at this time. I want now to refer to the increase of £3,000,000 on the ordinary Estimates of the year. not now before the Chair. The question under discussion is the expenditure of £647,000. of the extra £3,000,000 of which I am speaking. have already decided tliat. am talking about. I am protesting that, in this time of war, instead of husbanding our resources, we are spending £3,000,000 more than usual on the ordinary administrative Departments. I say, also, that we are doing that whilst we are withdrawing 160,000 of our citizens from the industrial ranks. That is to say, 160,000 of our people are being paid for out of special war loans; and yet I am told there is a serious unemployed problem in Australia. If tliere is, then all I can say is God help the Government of this country, for the State Governments spent more in the last financial year than in the previous year, which was a period of peace. Money is pouring into this country from loan sources, and if . with our waterways and our ordinary channels of communication open, and our ordinary industrial enterprises going on, there is a serious unemployed problem in Australia, that condition of things is a serious reflection on the Government of this country. Is this all we get out of Socialistic methods of government? selves hy means of loan moneys we are told that as a result of all the operations of Socialistic Governments to-day there is a very serious unemployed problem. I venture to say there is no serious unemployed problem in Australia to-day. There may be defective organization, but there is today a job for every man in Australia who C r d e r ! The honwants work. I do not deny that there may be some temporary dislocations, but taking Australia by and large there is a job for every man who wants work. WeI care not find the farmers saying that they have not workers to gather the harvest. They pay good wages in harvest time, and if the Government will economize as I have sugLet honorgested and let these men help to get in I can stand the harvest they will do well. But when these things are mentioned we are met with more of these interjections of which I complain. We are told, "" You want to sweat their wages down."" We have to listen to such taunts whenever we argue for economical government in war time. I never felt my duty so seriously as I feel Order ! That is it just now. It is time that the Government of the Commonwealth and the State Governments took a pull at themselves and sought to ascertain whether it is not possible to shear down the civil institutions of Australia and to place our civil resources upon a war footing. I wish to take exception to the remark made by the Leader of the Opposition that whenever the question of the war and the finances is discussed by the Opposition in this House their observations are received by gibes and sneers from honourable members sitting behind the Government. I can assure the right honourable member that the Government and their supporters are as profoundly impressed with the seriousness of the business which confronts the country as he and his party are. He complains of the expenditure on public works. It is only a few months since not only public men, hut the press of Australia, were appealing to the Commonwealth and the State Governments to keep the wheels of industry going round in the interests of the thousands who had been thrown out of employment owing to-private enterprise having become paralyzed as the result of the outbreak of hostilities. W it h in the last month or two there has been an improvement in the conditions of the unemployed, but the whole of the unemployed in Victoria have not yet been absorbed. In the metroA f t e r relieving ourpolitan area there are possibly 3,000 or 4,000 men still out of work and looking for employment. That is a reasonable estimate.

The great British nation has never needed to introduce conscription, because it has always known that it could make men join the Army by shutting down big works when necessary. Bringing about unemployment in the cities means that those on the land will be able to fix their own prices for land, and means also the forcing of men to enlist for a livelihood. I shall always object to bringing about conscription in that way. If it has to come, it will have to be fought out in this House vote by vote. Without detracting one iota from the glorious work done by our men at the front, it is sober truth that thousands of them went because there was no. employment in Australia for them. In times of stress it is the duty of the Government not to close their purse-strings, as private employers do. A bold policy is called for, and that is what the present Government are adopting. In the time previous to the war the Government would not borrow. The Opposition, when in power, passed a LoanA c t for £3,500,000 for the Fleel, but the Labour party repealed the Act, and paid for the Fleet out of revenue. Times are very different now, and the Government must have a bold policy. I hope tliat neither they nor the party behind them w ill ever listen to any method of bringing about compulsory service by stopping the wheels of industry. I am sorry the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has imported into what was becoming a very interesting discussion a subject that has nothing to do with the question. Leader of the Labour party at the last election announced that if one sphere of economic production failed, the party would create new ones, their object being to keep the wheels of industry going. The honourable member for Fawkner rightly pointed but to-night that all parties had combined in the early stages of the war to contribute to a policy of profitably absorbing labour. however, have moved since then. people were agitated, not only by the outbreak of the war, but by the fact that the country had stopped producing, and we had to send all round the world for foodstuffs to feed our people and stock, and so avert a famine for man and beast. Since that happened we have begun to appreciate what Australia can do, and what she canraise. The rubbish that we had to i m port as food has shown us that we have a country well worth fighting for. A policy by which the State has to absorb and employ its population places on the State the obligation to create employment, i regard public works, not as an instrument to absorb labour, but as a means of providing facilities to enable the people to carry on trade and commerce and assist production. I hope we shall never reach the stage at which we regard a public work as a mere means of absorbing labour. We build up a far better State by putting in each man's hand the means of working out his own destiny. I have heard this Government charged w it h failure to carry out its election pledge to find employment for every man and woman in the country, but I do not look on that as its real obligation, although it probably represents the obligation placed on the Labour party by its then leader. The true obligation of th© State is to provide reasonable facilities for its people to carry on their ordinary avocations. It is not the duty of the State to engage against private enterprises, and go into competition with its own taxpayers, levying taxation on them for the purpose of that competition. Instead of undertaking a public works policy for the purpose of providing employment for the people, as some honourable members have suggested, the prime reason for such a policy should be the creation of facilities that may assist production. A party may go upon the hustings and w in its way to power by saying to the electors, ""Support us, we have a vigorous public works policy, and The manifesto of the we w ill give you employment."" But when the State has utilized all available means of providing employment, and is unable to absorb all those who are seeking work, the fellowers of that party find themselves cast upon their own resources, and the Government having failed to organize enterprise those people find themselves without a means of support. TheI have not previously spoken during this part of the session, because of a vain hope that the party charged with the government of the country would be allowed to carry out some portion of their policy; but I cannot sit idly by and hear a comparison, which has nothing to j u s t if y it ,",90,Supply Works An D

Private enterprise has often come to the rescue when there has been a considerable amount of unemployment; b u t it must be remembered that we are only just recovering from a very serious drought, during which primary production was held up throughout Australia. This resulted in a serious loss of capital, and in the usual avenues of rural employment being almost completely closed up. I am in a position to say that a rumour was circulated by interested individuals to the effect that, in the agricultural districts, city men who knew nothing about farming work could secure employment at not less than £ 1 per day.

The award for bricklayers is, that they were prompted by the highest 1 believe, 14s. per day, and if a single man motives that could actuate citizens-the is in a position to choose between employdesire to fight for the preservation of the ment on public works at 14s. a day and liberties of their country.

If the war, the Government could have found a Government propose to l i m it employment remedy for it . Honourable members on on public works to married men, I have, both sides are aware that the Minister of of course, nothing more to say. The GerDefence had to be whipped into adopting mans pay Is. 5d. a day to the man in tlie two shifts at the Lithgow Small Arms Faotrenches, and the same wages to the man tory. H a d the country been f u l l of unemin the factory. If a man is not satisfied ployed, men could easily have been found with his job in a factory, he is promoted quick and lively to the trenches. The consequence is that in Germany they have no unemployed problem. It appears to me that the Government are, in this matter, on the horns of a dilemma. They must break their word to the Imperial authorities to send 9,000 men per month to the front , or they must give the people of this community to understand that they will employ only married men on public works. The statement so often repeated tliat any born fool, and the perfect waster in every other walk of life, may at the same time be a heaven-born farm labourer is the most ridiculous fallacy ever uttered. Do honourable members believe for a moment that a man owning machines costing anything from £ 5 5 to £ 1 5 5 each will place an unskilled man in charge of them at a skilled man's wages? We know that he will not do anything of the k in d ; yet city people honestly believe, because they have been told it over and over again, that any man in possession of health and strength can get a job on a farm at not less than £ 1 per day. There is not a man in Australia to-day who if he wants a job. and looks for it , cannot find it ; and consequently I say that the proper place for a single man physically fit who finds that a job that will suit him which actuated most of the men who have joined our Expeditionary Force.

800,Mr Pigott (Calare) [4.15 A.m.],"for three shifts. I have repeatedly drawn attention to the need for following the example of Canada and South Africa in regard to the manufacture of munitions. Canada has manufactured £50,000,000 worth of munitions. much, the money would have found employment for about 330,000 men at £3 a week. Of course, money spent on erecting structures of bricks and mortar, and in building railways in the Northern Territory does not leave the country, but its expenditure does not help us to defeat the Germans, the Turks, and the Austrians. Their defeat can be brought about only by the sending away of troops and the furnishing of munitions. has manufactured about £8,000,000 worth of munitions. Australia has done practically nothing in this way. I understand that private enterprise in Newcastle is manufacturing shell cases, but I do not think that any have been yet sent out of the country. Were we to vigorously engage in the manufacture of munitions, for which there is an unlimited demand at good prices, we should provide remunerative employment to some hundreds of thousands of men, and should materially assist Great Britain and her Allies. Only in this way can we help to bring the war to a successful issue. Question resolved in the affirmative. Eesolution reported. Standing Orders suspended, and resolution adopted. Resolution of Ways and Means covering Besolution of Supply reported and adopted. OrderedThat Mr Higgs and Mr Hughes do prepare and bring in a B ill to carry out the foregoing coming season's harvest, but there is not resolution.

The business of the next sitting will be the War Loan Bill and the Murray Rivers Agreement Bill. One or other will be taken first, and the other will follow. ' State Bill first. South AfricaI ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, to whom we can always look for the information that we require, when he will assume control of the wheat freights question, which, strictly, comes under his Department, and of which I should like to see him take charge in this House; I have one or two reasons for taking this course. We experience a difficulty iu getting any information on the subject in response to our questions. The Minister sitting at the table has a great deal to do with trade and commerce, he is well posted in the practice of shipping, and therefore is in a far better position to inform honourable members. lengthy statement. reason for speaking now is the ability of the honourable member to handle the affairs of his Department. The next point is that we desire to obtain some very important information. In this city today I endeavoured to get from the premier shipping firms a quotation for the one of them in the market to buy. Surely this matter has been going on long enough -fro m the 24th July to the present time! There is not a shipper in this city who is prepared in the present chaotic state of the freight business to enter the market. It is one thing to make an arrangement abroad and announce to the country in a sort of flippant way that freights have been arranged from December to January, and that we shall be able to go ahead; but it is another thing to find the buyers. I seriously ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to assume the control of this business, and to let the trading community have the benefit of his experience -",93,Supply Works An D

806,Mr Rodgers,"I know that; but myam most anxious to do justice to a constituent in the Wellington district. I havo questioned the Minister of Defence and the Minister for the Navy, arid written to the Department. The Ministers said that they had sent three cablegrams in connection with the matter, and, as I cannot get any satisfaction from them, I shall be very pleased if the Minister of Trade and Customs will act. A young fellow named Robbins enlisted from the Wellington district, and went to the front. Instead of making t'he money due to him payable to his mother, it was made payable to his credit at a Savings Bank. The old lady, of course, expected to get the money as soon as he went to the front. She is a widow who was entirely dependent upon the efforts of her son, and' now she is absolutely without means of support. This good old lady, who had not been accustomed to go out to service, rather than beg amongst the people of Wellington, is doing menial work. It is deplorable that any country, Labour or Liberal, should allow the mother of a soldier who is fighting for the flag to go out as a servant because the Defence Department will not do its duty. I think it is high time that some action was taken. The Minister for the Navy will recollect me handing over the papers to him. He promised to have some inquiries made, but up to the present moment they have not crystallized. 1 ask him to be good enough to make a note of the name, namely, i±. C. Robbins, 23002.

The Defence Department knows all about the case. If I have written one letter, . I have written twenty, and also seen the paymaster at the Victoria Barracks in Sydney. I ask the Government, for the credit of themselves and the country, to attend to this very important matter. f4.31 a.m.] I have a motion on the notice-paper for a later hour of the day.
