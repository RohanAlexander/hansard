0,"Hous E Of Representatives. Wednesday, 85 August,. 1980. The Clehx Reported The Unavoidable Absence Of Mr Speaker. Mr Chanter) Took The Chair At 3.1 P.m., And Read Prayers. Of Personal Explanation, I Call Attention To A Statement Published In Monday's Argus And This Morning's Age, Which As","sociates my name with Divorce Court proceedings in Melbourne. My knowledge of the publications of this statement came to me only on my arrival from Adelaide this morning. The statement is false in every particular; I have never even heard of the persons concerned in the alleged proceedings. I promptly placed the matter in the hands of solicitors, so that action might be taken against the newspapers responsible for the publication. I wish to express my appreciation of the courtesy and decency of those conducting the Melbourne Herald, who refused to publish the statement pending an interview with me. During my twenty-seven years of parliamentary life-twelv e of which have been spent in this ParliamentI have come into daily contact, in the friendliest manner, with the representatives of the newspapers that I have mentioned, yet tbey published a shocking libel upon me without having the decency to ascertain from me whether the statement was true or false. WOOL SCOURING. in the wool-scouring industry are being put off for lack of wool to scour, and 1 therefore ask the Prime Ministeri f he will make wool available from the supply awaiting shipment? telegrams from practically all the woolscouring works in and about the metropolis of New South Wales. Messrs. Swinburne Brothers are closing this week; Henry Haigh and Sons Limited, of Liverpool, having no wool to scour, have practically closed down; Messrs. Swinboume and Stephen have put off thirty-seven men, and thirty-three more will finish this week; and the position is about the same with Messrs. Sugden and Company Limited and Messrs Wrigbt and Bruce. closing down of the works mentioned must involve the throwing out of employment of a large number of men, and I shall make inquiries without delay to see what steps, if any, can be taken to make wool available for scouring. Before the embargo was raised, the Government were in direct communication regarding it with all the interests involved, and it was as a result of representations made by a deputation at which these interests were represented that the embargo was raised. Certain honourable members were present at that deputation. I then put the question categorically to the representatives of each industry-to those of the packers, growers, brokers, fellmongers, and scourers-whethe r they were quite sure that the action whicli they wished me to take was compatible with the best interests of Australia. I said to the representatives of the fellmongers and scourers, "" Are you quite sure that you will have enough wool to scour?"" To that question their reply was "" Yes.'' I asked, "" Do you wish me to take this action ? "" They said "" Yes."" I said, "" Are you sure that you represent the whole industry in Victoria, .New South Wales, and elsewhere?"" and they replied "" Yes."" Under, these circumstances the Government are hardly to » blame for the removal of the embargo. Any blame there may be must fall on the shoulders of those who, having had the amplest opportunity to consider the matter, and being invited by me to set out exactly what was wanted for local requirements, failed to do so. Tbeir present complaint is a poor expression of gratitude to the Government, which for the past six years have drawn upon themselves the criticism of the growers for I have received their action in making wool available to the scourers at a much lower price than could be got anywhere else in the world. However, I shall make inquiries, and see what can be done. tion of the Prime Minister been drawn to the following cablegram:Sir Eichard Amess, formerly Honorary Secretary of the Canadian Patriotic Fund, who is an officer of the League of Nations, complains that Australia is the only Dominion which has not yet paid the 1020 contribution to upkeep of the League of Nations.

However, I shall make inquiries into the matter. ROYA L AUSTRALIA N GARRISO N of the Defence Department, on the plea of employing returned soldiers in the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery, to discharge married men who volunteered, and obtained the volunteer's badge, but were prevented from going to tbe war; and is the Department recruiting young single men who did not go to the war? a fact that we are putting off married men who volunteered to go to the war. The replacement of those who did not volunteer by other men is under consideration, though nothing definite has been decided. We shall not put off married men who unconditionally volunteered for service abroad. I shall get a definite statement for the honourable member. orable member of either House to raise the question of making a grant to Lieutenants Parer and Mcintosh, who have just completed an aerial flight from London to Australia, I would like to know whether it is true, as reported in the press, that the Commonwealth propose to make a grant of £1,000 to these distinguished officers in recognition of their great exploit, and to suggest that the amount might be made £1,000 each. Government have decided' to make a grant of £1,000 to Lieutenants Parer and Mcintosh in recognition of their splendid feat, but the honourable member's request to have the amount increased will be duly considered. I hope the honourable member is not overlooking the fact that it was entirely owing to the action of the Commonwealth Government that any of these flights have been made. So far as I know, it is the only Government throughout the Empire that has done anything to encourage aviation on such a large scale. However, I join with the honourable member in paying my tribute to Lieutenants Parer and Mcintosh. When the Government offered a prize of £10,000 for a flight from London to Australia, the idea was to demonstrate that aerial navigation between Europe and Australia was not only possible, but could also be achieved within a time that would demonstrate the superiority of this form of navigation over any other in point of the time occupied on the journey. These splendid young men have arrived here after a series of most wonderful mishaps and adventures in a machine totally unfit for a world flight. Their feat stands out like those of the ancient circumnavigators who encircled the world with vessels that now would hardly be considered safe in Port Phillip or Sydney Harbor. The request of the honourable member will be regarded by the Government with favorable eyes, and if we are not able to accede to it, our friends Lieutenants Parer and Mcintosh will realize that it is not because the Government do not fully recognise what they have done, but because of the financial position. master-General yet consulted the Minister for Defence in regard to the request put forward by me a little time ago, that the Government should subsidize commercial aviation on the north-west coast of Western Australia? consideration by the Minister for Defence and myself. article appearing in this morning's Argus, setting forth what are alleged to be the financial proposals of the Government, was inspired by the Treasurer, and whether it correctly states the Government's financial policy? did not inspire anything so extraordinary.",20,League Of Nations Contributions

The possibilities of dumping are not to be overlooked, and the Government w ill introduce legislation at an early date. That may be taken to be the policy of the Government, irrespective of the case now pending, and of any decision that may be given upon it . The position, therefore, is that the Government believes that the Department of -Trade and Customs is correct in its interpretation of the law, and that in normal conditions it is the most equitable method of calculating the basis on which duty should be collected. But it recognises that abnormal circumstances now exist, and it w ill introduce legislation which w ill relieve the disadvantages under which Prance now labours, and at the same time the facts is not accurate.

This clause affirms the right of some tribunal to force men to worka matter about which I feel so strongly that I shall vote . against it . I cannot accept, and I hope that the party with which I am associated will not accept, the declaration of that right. We are moving in the direction of freedom of contract between employer and employee rather than away from it . The Labour party has always stood for compulsory arbitration, for the reason that the so-called freedom of contract between employers and employees did not exist. Employers, because of their organization, their command of wealth, and the economic and social pressure that they can bring to bear, made it impossible for the employees to exercise a deliberate choice. But now I am happy to think that, with the greater enlightenment which has come to the workers of this country, and the more definite manner in which they have organized for their own protection, they, through their organizations, are able to confer on equal terms with their employers as to what their conditions of service should be. Therefore, the principle never yet having been embodied in an Act of Parliament that a man shall be compelled to work, I maintain we should hesitate before we insert it in one. ciple is right or wrong i u Russia-and I have not sufficient information to justify me in discussing the conditions which apply there-doe s not necessarily make itright or wrong here.

In the amendment of the definition of "" strike "" occur the words "" and the total or partial refusal of employees acting in combination to accept work if the refusal is unreasonable."" Thus a tribunal will sit for the purpose of considering the impulses that have moved men to decline to work under certain circumstances.

I think that the times are moving away from the atmosphere of compulsion. I take this opportunity of saying that the operation of the Federal Arbitration Court has been immensely beneficial to all interests in this country. Because there have been isolated cases in which men bound by an award have not seen fit to observe it , it has been contended that the Arbitration Court has been a failure; but that contention has been raised by persons who have not been in a position to submit to the country, or to t i e House, that mass of evidence which they might have submitted in regard to the number of disputes which have been settled and prevented, and also in regard to the amount of disorganization and loss which has been prevented by the operation of the Court functioning through the various methods at its command. ments there would not have been the animosity that has been created under arbitration. industrial agreements under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

In considering this clause, I think I am entitled to say that it is to be immensely regretted t h a t . there has been apparently a deliberate desire on the part of vested interests and persons who should have known better, to discredit the operation of the Act, and in so doing the natural consequence has been that they have supported the doctrine of what is known as direct action; that is to say, while pretending to be the most implacable opponents of such a policy, they have really fostered it . It is a matter of very little edification that, because under the present President of the A r b i tration Court certain awards have been given at various times which some people thonght"" were too liberal, these paragons of law and order should declare that the whole Court should be wiped aside. But I cannot, for a moment, I can assure these gentlemen that when they succeed with their propaganda, and wipe out the Arbitration Court on the ground that its awards are too generous, they will find it supplanted by something which, from' their point of view, w ill be less satisfying to them. that way, but they claim that it imposes a penalty on one section of the community, and not on the other; that is to say, one side is free, and the other is shackled. what the honourable member means, unless he means that the effect of arbitration has been to secure more for the men' than he thinks his friends ought to pay. In the whole history of the Arbitration Court industrial disputes in relation to activities righ t throughout the Commonwealth have been dealt with by two or three Judge3. It is simply impossible for a Court to function successfully when it is undermanned in this way. The Industrial PeaceB ill contemplates setting up tribunals all over Australia. for the appointment of additional deputies. it does so, but the amendment is somewhat tardy, and, in any case, I think it In other should have come before us instead of the effect, supplant arbitration.

101,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [4.23].,"there are employees. Asi t is, half-a. dozen men employed on the one machine iu a particular factory might have a very serious grievance, but if , as tbe result of a consultation, they decided not to work, they might be subjected under this clause to heavy penalties. On the other hand, one man might have 500 or 600 men in his employment, and, without acting in combination with any other employer, lie might make the conditions of employment in his factory absolutely intolerable to his men. He would thus inflict hardship on his employees, but since it could not be proved that he was acting in combination with other employers he would not be liable to any penalty. The Government are treading on dangerous ground in proposing to legislate in this way. Many persons have unjustly criticised the principal Act. I hold that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court has done magnificent work, and that those who are always seeking to improve it , in many cases, are only making the position worse than it is. Mr Justice Powers, by means of a circular addressed to honourable members, has conveyed to us an insight of the great work that the Court is doing. He has been able to show that, within five years more than 500 agreements have been made on the conciliation side of the Court. I agree with the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) that tbe provisions of the Industrial PeaceB ill , passed last week, might very well have been embodied in this measure. We shall take a dangerous step by providing for the imposition of severe penalties upon a few individuals who because of a serious grievance refuse to work. Instead of moving towards conciliation in the conduct of industry by amending the principal Acti n this way, we shall make the positionof the workers still more uncomfortable. In these days men refuse to work under uncomfortable conditions, and no one can blame them. move That paragraph c be left out. I maintain that the amendment of the principal Act for which paragraph c provides is unnecessary and unreasonable. Its only effect will be to penalise the workers. It is unjust to say that men shall not have the right to refuse to work under conditions to which they object. It is all very well for the Minister to urge that in refusing work men must be proved to have acted in combination in order to be liable to the penalty for which the B ill provides. We know perfectly well, however-and every honourable member on this side' of the House at one time or another has suffered at ,the hands of employers-that very often employers make the conditions of work intolerable, and that the only redress open to their employees is to knock offWhere they object to the wages or conditions offering, they should have the right to leave if they desire to do so. Mir. GBEGORY -They w ill have that right under this B ill . honourable member to dictate to me as to what is and what is not in the B ill . On the motion for the second reading he spoke of an award relating to the pastoral industry in Western Australia, which, . he said, applied to the big sheds and not to the small ones, and when, in order to put him on the right track, I inquired whether he was referring to an agreement, he answered that he was speaking of an award. He thus proved that he does not know what is going on in his own State, since there is no award, and never has been one, applying to the pastoral industry in Western Australia. Why, then, should he dictate to those who are familiar with working conditions ? Listening to some honourable members, one would imagine that the workers stopped work for the mere f u n of the thing. One would imagine that they regarded a strike as something in the nature of a pastime. As a representative of the workers-as one who has had to work all his life, who has been associated with strikes, and who, having regard to the social conditions under which we live, will probably be associated with strikes in the futureI do not hesitate to say that no one realizes more than do the workers themI selves the hardships imposed upon them and theirfamilies when they are forced to go on strike. There are times, however, when it is absolutely necessary that they should strike, since by no other means can they obtain the redress of their grievances.

I have received from the company a communication dated 6th inst., in response to my letter, which sets out their position, and of which I enclose a copy herewith. The following is the letter sent by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to the Employers Federation on 6th August:I duly received your letter of the 3rd inst., and .in reply, would say that we are in a different position from firms .who are solely engaged in the carting industry.

The youths in question are quite free to leave our employ if they are not content with their present rates. Although we have in the past paid them according to the award of the Federal Court, we have some doubt whether they really come under this, because, unlike the recognised improvers in that industry who go on to the roads, these lads merely lead the horses which draw trollies along the tram line either from the ship's side or from the stacks of sugar. the honourable Here we have a large corporation which refuses to work under an agreement.

128,Sir Robert Best (Kooyong),"lnenvbers desire to attack the compulsoryclauses of the Act, let us deal with them directly, and not attempt to maim them as this amendment proposes. All that the Bill proposes to do is to complete the principles which have been already fundamentally established by the Act itself. So long as we have compulsion we must, necessarily have penalties of some description for the purpose of aiding the enforcement of such compulsion. Already there is a penalty of £1,000 for strikes and lockouts. The Bill creates an additional offence, and the existing penalty is only made more comprehensive and complete. Therefore, it is essential that we should vote for paragraphs b and c; the mere deletion of them will not rid the Act, of penalties. If honourable members wish to abolish the penalties already provided for by the Act, there is another way of attaining their object. am not very much concerned as to whether or not the amendment is carried, because even if the penalty for strikes and lockouts were made imprisonment for life, it would be just as logical as the rest of the Act. Honourable members on this side are naturally averse from penalizing strikers, but we know that if any industrial organization, such as the Miners Federation or the Seamen's Union, is powerful enough to make their say in regard .to working conditions effective, even the strongest of Governments listen to their demands; and whether or mot penalties are provided they will not be enforced. If they are enforced in the form of either fines or imprisonment, they only insure the success of the strike. If strikers are sent to gaol, which is the logical consequence of this legislation, the success of the strike is assured, because mines and ships cannot be worked if those engaged in the industries are imprisoned. The whole of this industrial legislation is .absurd, so far as the prevention of strikes is concerned; and, as for the attitude of the employers, only the other day Mr Emery stated in Sydney, on behalf of the BrokenH ill mining companies, that if Judge Edmunds awarded tbe miners a six-hour day, or abolished contract-mining, the companies would not guarantee to re-open the mines. They, like the miners, had already agreed to abide by the decision of the Tribunal, but before the Judge had given his decision they intimated to him that if such decision was in favour of the men on those two points, the companies would not guarantee to re-open the mines. could not 'guarantee to run the mines at a loss. honourable member know what Mr Emery meant? He, like myself, can only judge by the press report. Mr Emery may have meant anything. He may not have been authorized to speak for the companies, but according to the press report he spoke in their behalf. His statement represented very well the attitude of employers generally.. Whenever an award goes against them they cannot be compelled by the present Government, or indeed by any other Government under the existing social order, to continue their business when they say they will be conducting it at a loss. But if, on the other hand, a few workmen do not turn up to work, they are said to be on strike, and the law says that they shall be penalized. When the marine engineers were on strike, the War Precautions Act, which was designed to "" save Australia from Germany,"" was employed for the purpose of placing an embargo on the union finances. The principle of this Bill is in keeping with the same clas9 of legislation in every country in the world where Governments are protecting the interests of the employers. In America an anti-Trust' law was introduced, and "" a corporation in restraint of trade "" was interpreted in the Courts to be a labour union. Mayor of Sydney, too. Home and Territories has a very logical mind if he can see a connection between the Mayor of Sydney and this Bill.

It is only those who are bound by an award and do something in the nature of a strike who are liable to the penalty in the proposed new section, and a strike is the total or partial cessation of work by employees acting in combination as a means of enforcing compliance with demands made by them or other employees on employers, and the total or partial refusal of employees .acting in combination to accept work if the refusal is unreasonable.

The general intention of the Act was to secure industrial peace, and do away w i th the old methods of industrial warfare and substitute compulsory arbitration in their place. It was made an offence for any person on account of an industrial dispute to do anything in the nature of a lockout or strike. But here we have got beyond the actual dispute, and are dealing w i th cases in whicli awards have been given. dispute while an award is in force ? prevent a dispute occurring after an individual may award has been given, but the proposed at work under an new section 6A applies only to cases where an award is i u existence which both parties are bound to observe, and that section imposes a penalty on the employer who does anything in the nature of a lockout, or on the employees who do anything in the nature of a strike, during the currency of such an award. The idea is to observe the sanctity of the award, and to see that both parties comply w it h it . The trouble that attaches to the honourable member's amendment is that, if inserted, it may cast doubt upon other'sections of the Act.

I think the time has arrived when we should express in clear words the intention of the Legislature. Minister is probably correct when he says that there is ample provision to meet the contingency which I have put forward, but, on the other hand, those who take advantage of the Arbitration Court complain that the new section, to which they raise no objection in anv other respect, may have the effect of rendering organizations liable for the action of a few individuals. for Works and Railways) [5.34] -Last week the honourable member was good enough to indicate the nature of the amendment he proposed to make to the new section, but I told him at the timo that I thought that the words he proposed to add were quite unnecessary. However, I promised to refer the matter to the Parliamentary Draftsman, and I have done so, and he is quite satisfied that bhe honourable member's fears are unfounded. The difficulty of including the words in one section is that it may create doubt in regard to other sections. If we were to insert such a proviso in this proposed new section and fail to insert it in other sections of' the principal Act in which the same words occur, it might give rise to doubt on the part of the Court in interpreting those provisions. I promise the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, however, that I will refer the matter to Sir Robert Garran, and that if he feels that there is any cause for anxiety I will nave the matter made perfectly clear.

There is a reason for not inserting in this clause the words which appear in section 6 of the original Act. That section provides thatNo person or organization shall, on account of any industrial dispute, do anything in the Mature of a lock-out. . . . A prosecution for a contravention of that provision could be taken before an ordinary Oourt-it would not go before a Justice of the H i g h Court-and , as the honourable member knows, what does and does not constitute an industrial dispute is a complicated question, so that it is desirable that the leave of the President should be necessary to the institution of such proceedings. stance, however, an award is known to be in existence, and there is no necessity to place any further impediment in the way of a prosecution by making it necessary to obtain the leave of the President of the Court to institute proceedings. It would mean delay, and, moreover, the nature of the offence is different from that with which section 6 of the prin cipal Act deals This clause applies to both employers and employees. under this clause? or special magistrate. As the honourable member is aware, it was held in Alexander's case that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court was not a Court within the meaning of the Constitution, aud, in order to secure the enforcement of penalties, it therefore became necessary to amend the Acti n certain directions by making provision for prosecutions before magistrates-. do not agree with the Minister( Mr Groom) as to the reason for inserting in section 6 of the Act the words "" no proceeding for any contravention of this section shall be instituted without the leave of the President."" in regard to its retention, and not to its original insertion in the Act. same words have not been inserted in this clause. They should be inserted for the same reason that they were inserted in section 6 of the principal Act. I conceive that they were introduced into that section to enable the President to judge of the circumstances before allowing a prosecution to take place. . The circumstances might be such that it would not be desirable to give leave to institute proceedings. I , therefore, think that the same provision should be made in the proposed new section 6A. A t present the Conciliation and Arbitration Court has no authority to interfere, for example, with the very arbitrary use of powers under the W a r Precautions Act. The exercise of those powers in an arbitrary manner is so exasperating that it sometimes leads to men ceasing _ work. In such circumstances perhaps the President of the Court or Deputy President would not think f it to give leave In this in to prosecute, although they would not have any specific power to cancel the regulations or to make an order contrary to the provisions of the Act. If we make it necessary to obtain the leave of the Court before a prosecution can be instituted under this proposed new section, which involves such a heavy penalty as a fine of £1,000, we leave in the power of the Court a discretion which it is very necessary that the Court should retain, with a view to protecting workmen against prosecutions that would be unfair.

We were empowered to take evidence in camera, so as to prevent employers, including those of Plinders-lane, dismissing their employees, and following them with a boycott. If honourable members care to look at the report of that committee they will find that, at the Government expense, the families of some employees had to be sent from Melbourne, not only to Ballarat, Bendigo, Castlemaine, and Geelong, but as far as to Sydney, in order to avoid the boycott which followed men who had given evidence. In these days, we wish no man or woman to be penalized for giving such evidence; and that, I take it, is the object making it clear that an employer shall not of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton). Mr Harrison Ord, in connection with that committee, made a report, and, although he was not a Labour man, but a Liberal, to whom I was keenly opposed politically, he showed the serious charges that lay against manufacturers and certain firms of Flinders-lane. Looking back to the horrors, of that time, I can give one or two little instances which may induce honourable members opposite to bring some pressure to bear on the Minister, with a view to the adoption of the amendment now proposed. At the back of the Honiceopathic Hospital, St. Kilda-road, there was a factory, below the floors of which, in the absence of any underground drainage, there was some 14 inches of dirty, filthy, slimy water, over which the employees had to work. We took a medical man down to that factory, and we found not one employee, man, woman, or young person, but was unhealthy. Another instance was afforded by a factory opposite the Melbourne Hospital. This factory had a door into Lonsdale-street, but that .door the girls employed were not permitted to use. At the back of the factory"" there were six hovels, three occupied by Chinamen, and three by our "" unfortunate "" sisters, and every young girl of the factory had to enter by that yard. Those conditions were abolished as a result of the inquiry then made. The employees of this or any other country owe nothing to the great mass of the employers for the reduction of hours of labour, or other improvements in their conditions. Individually, there have been right aud good men amongst the emDr. Maloney. ployers; but it has been only by the efforts of the workers themselves, assisted by good men in public life of all parties, such as Lord Shaftesbary, that conditions have been improved. [6.5] I hope the Minister in charge of the Bill will see his way to accept the amendiment. A threat to dismiss is a more effective weapon in the hands of an employer than dismissal itself. And whilst our legislation provides that the employers shall not dismiss a man because of various things set out in the Act, the employer is yet able to attain the same end by threatening to do what the law forbids him: to do. We should take this opportunity of by any threat of dismissal penalize a man for having complied with the laws made by Parliament. I support the amendment. I have had experience of Arbitration Court proceedings, and I know that employers on many occasions have threatened that any one complaining to an officer of a union about his conditions of employment, or giving evidence before the Court, would be no longer employed. The result has been that people in many industries have been prevented from asserting themselves. If the Government are anxious to make the Arbitration Act more effective, they should give every protection to persons whogive evidence before the Court or lodge complaints against unfair conditions. The employer should be liable to a penalty for threatening to dismiss just as he is for actual dismissal. when the employee knows that it cannot be carried out? dismiss the man in any case. always evade the Act by saying that an employee does not suit him', and dismissing him on that ground. I think the amendment should be agreed to. for Works and Railways) [6.7] -The amendment suggests that an employer should be liable for a penalty if he threatens to dismiss an employee on the ground of being a member of an organization or for having appeared as a witness and given evidence in proceedings under the Arbitration Act.

I am inclined to agree with the amendment, but as I have not had time to give it f u l l consideration, I will agree to postpone the clause with a view to having the amendment put in order by the draftsman.

I think those words should be inserted.

199,Mr Groom,"The alternative is toThe Minister seems to be giving a concession, but actually he is giving nothing at all away. In the Tasmanian case that he mentioned, a man was dismissed because he was dissatisfied with his working conditions; but no change ever occurs in ithe conditions of an industry until some member of a union who is working for a private employer has become dissatisfied with his hours or remuneration, or some other condition of his employment. Should he express his dissatisfaction, his employer would immediately say to him, ""Your organization has an award, which I am following, and, as you are not satisfied with it, you can go."" continue to employ them; but otherwise There is no protection for that individual. I can understand the statement of the Minister that the measure is designed to encourage organization,' because evidently its purpose is to transform 'the organizations of workers into police bureaux for the benefit of the employers. It pretends to give a benefit to the employee, but gives none at all. matter of fact,any employer who was stupid enough to inform an employee that he was dismissing him for his industrial views, .could not remain in business very long. employer does when he wishes to get rid of an objectionable unionist is to tell him that he has no work for him. I have had that dodge worked on me. I have been given a start at S o'clock, and ""fired"" at 5 o'clock. threaten to dismiss their men; ithey merely get rid of them. This clause is a mere doping of the workers by pretending to confer benefits upon them which are not conferred. point of view, the Minister's explanation makes the position worse. He asks us to solemnly devise machinery for the protection of the employees, when, as a matter of fact, the power of the employer to get rid of men is not and cannot be taken away. How can an employer be prevented from dismissing an employee if he does not say straight out, "" I am dismissing you for the part that you took in such-and-such a strike,"" or ""because you gave certain evidence in the hearing of a case""? An employer, if necessary, can suspend his operations temporarily, and afterwards would not be compelled to re-employ his original hands. A wharf labourer who was obnoxious to his employers would not be "" seen "" by the boss when he attended on the wharf to be picked up; the sailor who was obnoxious would not be able to sign on for another voyage. The miner, after he had cut out his fortnight's contract, would be offered a low price for the next, so 'that he must refuse the work. There is .no way of protecting any of these individuals, and the workers will never be able to protect themselves from their employers except by the power of their organizations. If it does not pay an employer to penalize individuals who are agitating, he will he will get rid of tliem, even though he may have to stop his plant for a time to do so. In Broken Hill there have been cases of deliberate victimization; but when a mine has been laid idle in protest against such cases, the men may be reinstated, but a little later they are got rid of under circumstances which make As a it impossible to prove victimization. It is nonsense to think of protecting the employees by provisions of this character. To-day the employers are on top, and have the control of industry, and until In practice, what the the workers have a bigger say in the control of industry, they will have no protection.

Evidently that is not the intention of the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser). I am prepared to discuss the honourable member for Capricornia at some other time when the discussion will be relevant. It would not be relevant to this Bill. Incidentally, as the matter has been raised, I may say that I think the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) made up his mind to ""leave the Labour party, and it was a question whether he should be expelled or should get out in some other way. Apparently, he chose his own way. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! propose to limit this protection, not only to members of an organization, but to members of organizations which are seeking to better industrial conditions. This position may arise: A man is a member of an organization, as he is entitled to be, and as he is invited to be by this legislation. He suggests to the fellow-members of his union, "" We should go to the Arbitration Court in order to better our conditions, and obtain an award."" The organization may or may not be impressed by that view, and may or may not take any action ; but if the organization has not no protection whatsoever. I do not see taken any action to better the conditions of its members under this Bill, the man who suggests that action gives evidence of his dissatisfaction with his conditions, becomes marked as a dissatisfied mau, and may be dismissed by his employer with impunity for that reason. The Minister in charge of the Bill asks how we can prevent employers dismissing employees. He says that we cannot expect an employer to put up with a grumbler who is constantly complaining about his conditions. If that is the spirit in which he approaches this question, why trouble about paragraph a, which forbids a man being penalized in the circumstances there set out, and why his own new clause? When speaking on the second 'reading of the Bill, the Minister pointed out that he was giving a certain measure of protection to men who might be dissatisfied with their lot, and I interjected that the Government did not intend to penalize "" divine discontent."" I understood the Minister to agree with that view, but I find that he does not agree with it . is dealing with discontent, whilst I was referring to "" divine discontent."" gentleman will read the clause again he will recognise the very limited extent and the very parsimonious manner in which he proposes to sanction "" divine discontent."" Outside that, very limited sphere of discontent the Bill proposes to give the employer an absolute and unrestrained power to dismiss. Dealing with the second part of my objection to the clause, let' me suppose that a man is a member of an organization, and; for the sake of my argument, we may presume that he is not a direct actionist. He wants to avail himself of the law,_to submit himself to the arbitrament of a Court, and is prepared to accept its judgment. But the Minister says that unless he happens to be a member of an organization which as such has taken steps to better the conditions of its members, if he a3 an individual expresses the opinion that there should be some improvement in his conditions, or if he suggests to his organization that they should move for better conditions, under this Bill he gets what is in the mind of the Government..

The honourable member has quite misconceived the purpose for which .section 9 is being amended by clause 4. amended because of a, decision given in a Court in Tasmania before a magistrate, and referred, on appeal, to the High Court. In that case the point at issue was whether a member of an organization seeking to improve its conditions could be dismissed by an employer on the ground of dissatisfaction with 'the conditions of his employment; and the Court held that, under the law as it stands at the present time, the employer was protected in this respeot. The employer's evidence was that he had dismissed a man, not because he happened to be a member of an organization, which he is prevented from doing by paragraph (a), but because the man was dissatisfied with the conditions of his employment'. The organization to which the man belonged was seeking to improve its conditions, and the employer dismissed him because he was dissatisfied with the conditions which the oi'ganization was seeking to improve. It was lawful and legitimate for <the organization to seek to improve those conditions, and it was equally fair and proper that the employee should have a right to be dissatisfied with them, and should want to improve them in accordance with the aims of his organization. To meet such a case the Government proposes to add to section 9 of the principal Act a paragraph providing that an employer must not dismiss a member of an organization seeking to improve its conditions on the ground that he happens to be dissatisfied with those conditions. long way. ference with the ordinary common law master, who is of opinion that a servants' dissatisfaction with the conditions of his employment is such as to render him unsuitable as a servant, to dismiss him, without incurring any penalty for so doing. The Government's proposal cuts right across that common law rule, on the ground that, as the Conciliation and Arbitration Act seeks to encourage organizations to register under the Act, and empowers the Court to give them the right to appear before it and submit It is being plaints for the improvement of industrial conditions, individual members of such organizations whose natural desire is to further the plaints before the Court, ought to be protected from dismissal on the ground stated.

""We cannot do that. The only logical reason for affording a man protection is the fact that the organization, of whicli he is a member, is also dissatisfied, and is seeking to improve its conditions.

There is a reason for having these words in paragraph a, because in the period that elapses before registration, employees must get together to form an association, and if an employer could with impunity dismiss all the persons who were members of an association about to be registered, he might interfere with tbe lawful right of the members of that association to become a registered organization, and, logically, he ought to be punished for seeking to block the endeavour of his workmen to exercise their lawful right to register. same in the two paragraphs. gistration an association is not seeking organization or corporate body, and _ it specifically to improve industrial conresolves itself into the complaint of an inditions, because it does not formudividual.

The Government go so far as to say that so long as the dissatisfaction is that of an organized body, the mere fact of a member of that body expressing the same dissatisfaction is not to entitle the employer to dismiss him.

But to introduce these words into proposed new paragraph d would be a grave and serious matter, because it would give to the discontented individual even greater security than could be given if the words "" which is seeking better industrial conditions "" were struck out.

Nowadaysi t is done more scientifically. It is amusing to hear honourable members on the other side putting up a plea for the unfortunate emthe idea is to ployer.

This Bill, in many of its clauses, sets out to protect the worker who is endeavouring to improve his industrial conditions and those of his fellow workers. That is the whole tenor of the B ill .

The honourable member spoke of the case of a discontented individual. every reform that has taken place has begun with one man or a few men, and the history of all countries proves conclusively that the few have suffered in trying to bring it about. In some cases their lives have been taken, and it has been proved that, over and over again, many workers have lost their positions.

I find it quite impossible to follow the arguments put forward by the Minister( Mr Groom), or the special pleading of the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best). They seek to draw a distinction between proposed paragraph d and paragraph a, so far as concerns an organization or an association that has applied to be registered as an organization. I fail to see upon what logical grounds any exception can be taken to the very fair argument of the honourable member for Batman for the in clusion of members of an association which has applied to be registered as an organization, as well as members of registered organizations. ment has been directed to that point at all . the argument of the honourable member for Batmani f he simply wanted to add the words he has suggested, and did not want at the same time to delete the words "" which is seeking better industrial conditions."" for Batman made it very clear that those are two separate matters.

I have pointed out the logic of the honourable member for Batman on the first branch of his argument. I am with him also on the second branch, because the inclusion of the words "" which is seeking better industrial conditions "" places an impediment in the way of establishing the guilt of an employer who would dismiss a member of an organization because he was dissatisfied with his conditions.

If the honourable member would allow an employee to be dismissed in circumstances that the honourable member for Batman is trying to guard against, he would enable an employer to victimize, if he were so inclined, a member of an organization who was honestly endeavouring to persuade his fellow employees that they should seek better industrial conditions. That could be done under the clause as it stands. I should like to know who suggested this proposed amendment of the principal Act. Where did it emanate? -Who suggested that paragraph d should be inserted in section 9 of the principal Act?

The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) would dismiss an employee because he is dissatisfied or is agitating; he would dismiss him, he says, with perfect confidence, for any of these reasons, and, iu fact, for no reason at all. Let us then approach this subject of conciliation in the atmosphere of unconciliation which the Government and their supporters have created for us.

The second amendment deals with the tenure of office of the President. Under section 14 of the original Act the Deputy is appointed for the unexpired term of office of the President for the time being, which implies that if the President resigned, died, or vacated his office for any reason, the office of Deputy would cease to exist. The 'Government desire the office of Deputy President to continue, so that he will hold office during the unexpired period for which the President was originally appointed. pointed for seven years, and only two years had expired when he resigned, the amendment would enable the Deputy to hold office for the remaining period.

There are no other reasons apart from those I have given. [9.40] I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister for Works and Railways. As I understand it, the term of office of the President and Deputy Presidents must expire at the same time. This will hamper the Government in dealing with the conditions as they exist in the Arbitration Court. If at the commencement of the President's term of office there is a period of congestion, the Government can only If the President was apappoint an additional Judge for seven years. On the other hand, if we are within a year of the expiration of the President's term of office, we can only appoint Deputies for one year. The work of the Arbitration Court cannot be foreshadowed for five, six, or seven years, and the result of making this long term of office compulsory will be that the Government will defer the appointment of a Deputy as long as possible, in .the hope that the congestion will disappear and an additional Judge will not be necessary. opposing the amendment? means.

Mr Justice Higgins continuedThe Prime Minister says ""The hearing of cases is often very protracted. . . . one reason is that the Judge is necessarily unfamiliar with the trade or industry whose conditions he is called on to settle."" . . . I challenge the Prime Minister to show that any case has been protracted for that reason. Contrary to my own expectations cases hardly ever turn on expert knowledge of this sort; but if, and as far as they do, the outsiders are generally more likely to be impartial. The statement that the hearing of cases had often been protracted was the Prime Minister's excuse for introducing the In dustrial PeaceB ill , which B ill , in my opinion, w ill tend to create industrial strife in this country, if only for the reason that it fails to deal with the main cause of industrial unrest, namely, the profiteering which has been unchecked by the Government, who are in power through the in strumentality of the profiteers.

His Honour pointed out that the delays of the Court were not due to any faul t of the Court itself, but to Parliament itself, and he went on to illustrate how the Court has been beneficial in preventing industrial disputes. that his opinion differs from that of the Government, and that the amendments which have been submitted to Parliament were not suggested by him , but, in all probability, are in direct opposition to his considered views. The discussion this evening has proved that the amendments are not designed for the preservation of industrial peace, but rather for the purpose of giving unscrupulous employers the weapon with which to cow their employees who endeavour to improve the conditions of their fellow workers and themselves. These are pernicious amendments which are designed to foment industrial trouble through the victimi zation of men who are termed agitators.' Mr Justice Higgins continuedApart from these particular strikes the fact is ignored that the Court has preserved the country from many strikes which would have occurred but for the Court's influence. The public know only what they have suffered; they do not know what suffering they have been saved. There are no statistics as to the number of strikes averted by the knowledge that the Court gives fair play; but the number is great. Perhaps we can get some idea from certain statisticians' figures quoted by Mr Watt last year. ( I think that the Prime Minister was away from Australia at the time.) It appeared that, in the years 1914-15-16-17, able to give an opinion upon arbitration there were in all 1,647 strikes in Australia; for the war created much industrial unrest. Of these 1,647 strikes there"" can be found only three ('at the most) in disputes that could possibly come under the jurisdiction' of the Court. The Court could not touch the dispute in the great strike of 1917, because it was a dispute between State Railway employees and the State Government. I say nothing as' to the propriety of the meaThey have to rely on the Judge presidsures proposed, for that is a matter for Parliament, and I am not asked for my opinion. I say nothing as to the constitutionality of the measures, for that is a matter for the High Court; and I want to leave my mind open for any discussion. In this statement. I confine my self to a few of the misunderstandings as to the Court, expressed by the Prime Minister; and I should keep silent, even as to.these if the Court had the benefit of a constitutional of this party, that before protector. President of the Court Andi n the Evening News of the 24th August, this statement appearedMr Justice Higgins appears to take the same view as some of thc members of Parliament on the Industrial Peace Bill, and, to-day, in the Arbitration Court, he gave some hint of retiring from the position of President. After the luncheon adjournment Mr Barker, on behalf of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, That statement shows asked His Honour if he could give an indication as to when the case might come on. Mr Justice Higgins replied that he could not. It was possible that he might be compelled to resign from his oflice as President. It was better, he said, to let his successor make his own arrangements. As the Bill was only now before Parliament, it was not seemly for him to make any further _ statement. He could not make any arrangement as to new cases, and would not give any undertaking as regards the order of business. That clearly indicates that the President of the Court has not been asked to suggest amendments to existing legislation with a view to making the Act more beneficial to the people of Australia as a whole. We, on this side of the House, can f a i r l y claim to be representative of the great body of workers, and I submit that the President should have been asked for a report for consideration, not only by the Government, but by the people and their representatives in Parliament. Unless we secure the good w ill and confidence of the great body of industrialists, we cannot have industrial peace, or that atmosphere which is necessary before there can be immunity from strikes. There is every need for a comprehensive report by the President of the Court to be submitted to Parliament. Nobody is better questions. No man has had more to do tice Higgins has dealt w it h cases of widely divergent character.

327,With Arbitration I N Australia. Mr Jus,"living. It is all very well for the Government to wave aside the criticism 'that they are not giving the workers a square deal, but we know the history of their administration, and an impartial person can come to no other conclusion than that they are not.here in the interests of the workers. The funds which financed their election campaign were not supplied by the workers, but by the profiteers, whose interests lie in the bleeding of the workers and in making it harder for them to strike for better industrial conditions. There is not an honourable member on this side who has not been penalized because he has agitated for better conditions. We all know what it is to be black-balled and branded as pariahs because we have fought for those who have been working in bad circumstances like ourselves. We know that there are unscrupulous employers who, through representatives in this Parliament, are ready to stoop to anything in order to prevent the representatives of the workers from l if t body for the interests of Australia. I ing their voices in the cause of better industrial conditions. Every honourable member should be able to go back and tell his constituents that he asked the Government for a report from the President of the Arbitration Court. I want to be able to inform my electors that in voting for this measure I had before me the suggestions of the President of the Court, in order that I might be able to assist in bringing about the better working of the Court, and so prevent industrial trouble. But, so long as we have a Government representative of the profiteers there will continue to be industrial unrest, because they will not deal with fundamental causes but will only tinker with industrial legislation, and thus, aggravate the whole position. They can hope to achieve nothing, because they will not deal with principles. for Works and Railways) [10.3] -The spect, as I do the Prime Minister( Mr speech and methods of the honourable Hughes).

If I were to sented both the honourable member's attempt to array in their order and speech and his purpose. The honourable strength the elements which are behind the Opposition party, and then were to proceed to impute to its members that they represented the views of any one of those sections, there would be a howl of indignation. We do not hint, for example, that because there is a Bolshevik section of the community honourable members opposite are Bolsheviks. Buti t is all right for the Opposition to say anything they, can lay their tongues to concerning the Government. Anything is good enough. That is the method employed for endeavouring to lower in the public esteem a Government whioh, by its good works, stands higher in the regard of the community than ever before. The honourable member for Gwydir desires that consideration of the clause be postponed. He says the Committee should not agree to it imtil honourable members have been furnished with a report from the Judge of the Arbitration Court regarding what he considers should be done. Surely this Parliament is the legislative repeat, deliberately, that the majority of the clauses in this Bill are based on suggestions which have been made by the President of the Court. His very latest letter to the Government, which is dated 3rd August, and which I have before me, contains one of these suggestions. have given my reasons.

But, as I consider it is sent in contempt, and in case it conies from tainted money, earned by trying to get guilty criminals off, and thus loosing them on the community to commit further crimes, for, I understand, you never aBk where the money for such cases comes from that you receive as fees, nor have I learnt of your helping them to live better lives, I have therefore decided to try and purify it by adding £1 and sending it as a conof Melbourne, to ask how much money tribution in our joint nameB to a hospital, receipt for which I enclose. If you still think you are right in your action, and you want satisfaction from me, you have only to ask Yours faithfully, W. I enclosed my receipt from the hospital; but a difficulty arose in connection w it h the contribution. The secretary of the hospital pointed out to me that the odd halfpenny would make it awkward to balance the hospital books, and so I was compelled, in addition to the £1, to add another halfpenny to my share of the contribution. I gave Mr Morley a chance to reply to my communication, but he has not done so. 1 wish honourable members to recollect that I did not move in this matter u n t i l asked to do so by my party. I was disposed to treat Mr Morley w i th contempt; out being called upon to act, I did so. The following is the resolution that was carried at several meetings:That this meeting strongly protests against Mr Morley, barrister and solicitor, being permitted to escape punishment for flagrantly, insolently, and impudently breaking the law pertaining to ths secrecy of the ballot at the last Federal general election. In sending this resolution to Mr Morley, I addedKindly note -This resolution was carried unanimously at several meetings following the request made to me by my party to endeavour to have Mr Morley prosecuted for seeking to destroy the secrecy of the ballot, in view of the fact that so many people have been prosecuted for trifling mistakes. cuted ? prosecuted in connection w i th the Ballarat election, where worse offences were.committed! rightly answered Mr Morley's impertinent insolence in Bending a halfpenny as a contribution to members who voted as they thought right. My answer to h i m is that I do not know of any barrister who has drawn more money from the Government of the day. As Mr Morley says that he has lost his chance of advertising by accepting the post he atpresent fills as a member of the Basic Wage Royal Commission, I propose, as member for the city Mr Morley has received, and how many days he has attended in Court? Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.3S p.m.",64,Adjournment
