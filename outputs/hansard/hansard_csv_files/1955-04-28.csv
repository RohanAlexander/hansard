Dr. Evatt","I suggest that the Vicephysical arrangement of the building in Canberra, and the fact that it is situated a considerable distance from places of residence, hotels and boarding houses, it is quite unreasonable to exclude members under suspension from the use of facilities in it. Indeed, that deprivation is keenly felt by such honourable members. able gentleman moving a motion? Minister) [10.54] -ISTot having been aware that this matter would come up, I have no form of motion in my mind, but I am quite prepared, to improvise one. As you have just said, Mr Speaker, we nad a discussion on this matter at a meeting of the Standing Orders Committee and the general view expressed there, which I share was that suspension from the service of the House should not involve deprivation of the amenities, such as the dining-room, in the building. I move That, in tlie view Â»f this Houso, suspension from the servioe of the House involves exclusion from the chamber and its immediate surroundings but does not involve deprivation of the other amenities of the building. second a motion which is submitted by a Minister. all the same. Question resolved in the affirmative. BAE KINO . surer a question regarding finance provided by the banking institutions for the building of homes. I have received many representations complaining of the restrictions which have been placed in the last ten or twelve months on finance provided by banks for that purpose. I ask the Treasurer, who has the general right of supervision, or, at any rate, of intervention, in these matters, whether he will consider calling together in conference the Governor of the Commonwealth Bankthe central bank-and the representatives of the trading banks to ascertain whether that position can be reviewed as a matter of general credit policy, because the present restrictions are putting sucb a tremendous burden on the various bousing commissions of the .States. I merely ask the Treasurer now whether he will consider the proposition that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and the representatives of the private trading banks confer on the matter with a view to ascertaining whether the position can be remedied, or at least mitigated. ences are continually taking place between the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and the general managers of the trading banks, and the matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition is one which comes up for consideration periodically. Thei'e are no restrictions, within the real definition of "" r e s t r i c t i o n so n the trading banks. There is a natural restriction, which is governed by thc liquidity of the funds of the trading banks, but the portfolios which they carry concerning their advances policy are a matter for themselves. It is quite within their own jurisdiction, and their own. administration, to advance money for buildings or for any other activity, and the amount of money that they advance for building naturally is conditioned by the advances they make in other directions. ""When the money is being made available a balance must be preserved between the various factors. The trading banks have not unlimited resources, and, consequently, their policies are carried out in conformity with the liquidity of their own funds and the nature of their advances in various I desire to ask the Treadirections. for Social Services inform me whether the programme regarding Avar service homes, as outlined in the last budget, will be completed in the current year?

Immigration say whether it is a fact that deportation orders have been made against Malays employed, by master pearlers in Darwin because they refused to sign on for wages of from Â£26 to Â£33 a month ? Is it also a fact that the master pearlers are now threatening to use in their place Japanese crews as well as divers? If that is so, will the Minister take steps to see that all labour employed in the pearling industry is employed subject to the award rates of pay and conditions that prevail in the Northern Territory ? any deportation orders such as the honourable gentleman has mentioned and I should be astonished to learn that any such reason as he has mentioned had been given for action of that character. I am glad that the honourable member has raised this matter, because I have read in the press some most misleading and incorrect statements, attributed to officials of trade unions in the area, regarding the wages that were to have been paid to Japanese divers to be brought to this country. Far from this Government condoning the payment of wages below the level prescribed by the award, all the information in our possession indicates that not only have those already employed in this industry been able to receive a considerable amount above award rates of pay, but also that the divers coming here have every prospect of earning greatly in excess of the minimum wage rates prescribed. I shall try to obtain precise particulars for the honourable gentleman, but I can assure him that the policy of the Government throughout, in relation to all types of labour coming to this country, is to ensure that there is no reduction of standards that will affect the persons concerned. The people employing such labour are required to pay Australian award rates of pay, and to provide Australian conditions of employment. Prime Minister a question which refers to the comprehensive water scheme in ""Western Australia, in respect of which the latest survey discloses that costs will be greatly increased over those arrived at before the original agreement. Has the right honourable gentleman received any communication from any source in ""Western Australia requesting the Commonwealth to meet 50 per cent, of the increase of costs? If so, can be inform the House what consideration has been given to any such request? we have twice received a request from the Premier of ""Western Australia in connection with that matter. The present Commonwealth contribution is Â£2,150,000. of which about Â£800,000 is as yet unexpended. Requests have been made for an addition of about Â£3,000,000 to that contribution which would raise the total Commonwealth contribution to about Â£5,000,000. That is obviously a large matter, which involves a number of questions concerning Commonwealth and State financial relations, and it is therefore engaging the consideration of the Government as a matter of policy at this time.",12,Housing

Has the Minister considered those proposals? proposition that wheat should be graded and appropriate discounts fixed for under-grade wheat made available for stock-feeding purposes was canvassed over a period and has been revived recently. I.'n. New South Wales, and I think in all of tbe wheat-growing States, State legislation prescribes that State instrumentalities, or instrumentalities identified in State legislation, shall be the monopoly receivers and handlers of wheat. In New South Wales, the Silo Board is prescribed by State legislation as the monopoly receiver and handler. So it is beyond the competence of the Australian Wheat Board or of federal authorities to deal directly with this matter. It is not to be thought that it would be easy to establish a system for grading all wheat, because the physical requirements of handling a crop amounting to millions of tons are not easily arranged. But the Australian Wheat Board, as a matter of practice, does sell under-grade wheat to stock-feeders at a discount. At present it has some millions of bushels which are being offered to stock-feeders a t a discount of 6d. a bushel. It would be within the power of the States to fix the amount of the discount if they elected to do that. Mr W. M .

At present Newcastle is served by Williamtown aerodrome, which is a perfectly good airport. It may be that in years to come Newcastle will have an airport much closer to the city, but I suggest that in the meantime the authorities there should give some thought to providing a municipal airport on their own if they think it is required urgently. We have already acquired the land for the airport, so it cannot be used for any other purpose.

55,Sir Earie Page (Cowper,"Minister Bazeley had drawn up a full list of laboraadequate supplies of monkeys for him to commence work. The major buildings to house the plant and equipment are being provided on a priority basis. Dr. Bazeley will examine, immediately on his return, existing buildings to see if an earlier start can be made. With all these arrangements well in band, the production of the vaccine on a fairly large scale at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories is assured, not only with the minimum delay but under the expert and experienced direction of an officer of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories who has been intimately associated with all Dr. Salk's work. In the meantime, efforts have also been made to obtain some supplies of the vaccine from those United States manufacturers concerned in the great experiment that bad been made with Dr. Salk's vaccine in the United States. This experiment was sponsored by the National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis, and was wholly a private, philanthropic venture. In this experiment some 2,000,000 children were voluntarily engaged. Of these, almost 500,000 were vaccinated with Dr. Salk's vaccine three times within six weeks. Another 500,000 were injected with a fluid of similar colour, but without the vaccine in it, while the third group of children of the same age was used for observation purposes. The vaccine for this huge undertaking had been provided by six large manufacturing firms in the United States and. Canada for the National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis which operated under special licence. The experiment was conducted in such a way that no one could tell, during the progress of the experiment, which child was getting which injection. When the experiment was concluded it was arranged that a doctor of very high standing, Dr. Francis., secretary-general of the American College of Physicians, should make a determination as to the value of the vaccine by consoon as we had the information to which trasting all the various results which had been carefully tabulated. That took several months. Until Dr. Francis's determination was Eesearch Council for its advice. The made, there was a halt in the manufacture council is composed of representatives of of the vaccine. On the 12th April last, the State and Commonwealth Health Dr. Francis gave his determination which Departments, with various research Sir Earle Pape. showed that 80 per cent, protection was given against the infection of paralytic poliomyelitis, and 60 per cent, against the other types. A couple of firms had gambled on the success of the experiment to the extent of making np their special tissue fluid into vaccine, as otherwise it would spoil. However, these were quitfready to go ahead very quickly, but. were waiting for a licence. Their first objective is to find vaccine for some 9,000,000 immunizations foi the repetition of the poliomyelitis fund experiment of last year on those patient* who had been given inert doses. Thr surplus would be available for commercial sale in the United States and. forexport, if export permits were given. Parke, Davis and Company Limited could supply to Australia small quantities in June and July, and substantial quantities in August. If given an export licence, the E l i Lilly International Corporation could do the same. Some other chemica l firms have also offered to assist in a smaller degree. Eepresentatives of those firms were all brought together by me at a meeting on Friday, the 22nd April. Mr Mallinson. president of the E l i Lilly International Corporation, who had left ""Washington only on 18th April, attended this meeting, together with representatives of the other firms. All expressed their readiness to help Australia. They suggested that the Australian Government should make a request for a substantial amount of vaccine, as it might be reduced by the United States Government in its export licensing. The United States Government indicated to the Australian Government that firm arrangements with the American makerswere necessary to secure the export licence. A telegram that we received this morning disclosed that the American Government had not yet determined when expon licences would be issued by the United .States Department of Commerce. A I have referred earlier, the matter was taken to the Epidemiological Committee of the National Health and Medical experts. This committee suggested that we should make a request for 100,000 courses monthly for the next six months. There are three injections in each course, which means a total of 300,000 injections monthly for that period. By that time, Australian production should be rolling out, and we should be able to see more clearly what we would have to import. The amount suggested is sumcient to handle only a couple of grades of children. The committee recommends that five year old children should have preference in the first batch of vaccinations, as they go out to school and submit themselves to possible infection for the first time at that age. At the same time, nurses in fever hospitals, and physiotherapists who see the patients quite closely, will be given protective vaccine as well, together with pregnant women during their first three months of pregnancy. It is found that, when pregnant women become infected with the disease, nearly always the woman and the child die. When these demands have been fulfilled, the idea is to vaccinate children of the age immediately above and below that of the first group, that is to say, children of four vaccine could be used at once, and years and six yeai'3 of age, though it may be that the difficulties of vaccinating the underfive-year-oldchildren may make it preferable to do the seven-year-old group next. Seventy per cent, of the total number of poliomyelitis cases in Australia occur in children betweeen the ages "" f one and ten years. This vaccine, because of its shortsupply in the whole world, must be under control as regards priority. The National Health Act empowers the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to declare the vaccine, or any other drug, of restricted application and to define the limits of its use. Also, under the Quarantine Act, the federal Minister for Health may issue certain types of drugs free of charge under such conditions as he sees fit. Existing legislation, therefore, gives the Australian Government automatic control of the rationing and distribution of the vaccine. Now that we have some certainty of supplies ahead, the State governments will be called together. The question of administration will be discussed on the lines of the States taking over the vaccine imported by the Australian Government and handling it just as they are doing for diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus toxoids. The whole position oi the ultimate real value of the vaccine, and of the most effective way in which to handle it, is in the experimental stage. It is necessary, therefore, to keep exact records of every case. We received new from America this morning that, unfortunately, in California several children have died, apparently as a result of inoculation, and I am sure the House would like to express its deep sympathv with those who have lost their children The particular firm that supplied the substance has been precluded from making further sales. The vaccination of school children will enable the vaccine to be more easily handled, and as fairly large numbers of patients will be given injections in groups the danger of deterioration of the vaccine will be lessened. The vaccine is being provided in ampules of three doses and of nine doses. Consequently, if a number of children could be treated together, all of the there would not be the slightest danger of its deteriorating as a result of beinp kept overnight. To keep vaccine overnight is a very dangerous practice. Honourable members will probably remember that at Bundaberg about 30 years ago there were quite a number of deaths from diphtheria because the serum had been kept overnight. The children will, be, more or less, under constant observation by their teachers. Dr. Salk, in his experiment, was giving all tliree injections within a month or six weeks, but now both Dr. Salk and Dr. Bazeley agree that the third injection should be given six or seven month? after the first, as that procedure very greatly boosts the protective factors in the body, or the anti-bodies as they arrcalled, and lengthens the time of protection. I have just received a letter from London which states that thc authorities there have been carrying out certain experiments as a result of which they believe that, if the third injection is given seven months latei than the first, instead of six or seven ui -eks later, the person receiving the injection may be protected for more than H year. By the time the third injection becomes necessary here, it is hoped that Australia will be producing the vaccine. The makers have assured me that there is no difference at all in the composition of the vaccine prepared by different manufacturers. They all work to a definite standard which is laid down by the American Department of Health, and that department would give a certificate for all vaccine sent here. They would not allow any vaccine to be exported which had not received that certificate. Early talks will take place with representatives of the State governments, especially on the technical level, [f satisfactory supplies are approved by the United States Government, and if the necessary export licences are issued by the lst May, we ought to be able to start injections in June or July at the latest. It may even be August, depending upon when export licences are available. The manufacturers have informed me that they think they can commence manufacture by the end of May. This whole matter is such high policy that the Prime Minister will communicate with the Premiers of the States and suggest that their professional and technical men should meet their opposite numbers in the Commonwealth sphere to work out the details of the method of administration. Then the governments themselves will be able r,o deal with the matter. It is suggested that the States should carry the whole administration of the injection of the vaccine, as they do at present with diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus serums, Departments, clinics, shire and local councils. The Commonwealth would import the vaccine and hand it over in bulk to the States on a per capita basis according to the number of persons in each State and the group immediately being treated. Limited supplies in the initial stages make necessary the determination of the proper use of whatever vaccine is available, and the establishment of firm Sir Earle Page. priorities in its use. The advice of the Epidemiological Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council is being followed. We will still press, on a government-to-government level, in Washington, for the maximum quantity of vaccine to be made available to Australia. We have secured the active support of the United States manufacturing firms by giving a firm order, which course the United States Government has recommended. That course will strengthen its hand in the issue of export licences. It will be seen, therefore, that all initial steps necessary to obtain whatever quantities are available from the United States have been taken and that they were, in fact, technically discussed before the final determination of the value of the vaccine on the 12th April. These supplies will enable valuable experience in Australian methods of organization and distribution to be gained before mass production of the poliomyelitis vaccine at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories will enable us to protect our young people from the effect of this dreaded disease. Opposition) -by leave I thank the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) for having made a statement on this matter. There are two suggestions that I wish to make. The fir3t is in relation to the production of the vaccine at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Apparently, the intention still is that major buildings should be erected. The Minister has stated that that work would be done on a priority basis. However, it would still mean considerable delay. through their Education formed that they would be completely hospitals, pre-natal finished within six months. the use of existing buildings should be pursued. I feel confident that existing buildings could be found, because the matter is so important that it deserves a high priority. The other matter to which I refer is the leaving of the administration of the injection of the vaccine exclusively to the States. I take it the suggestion means that the Commonwealth Department of Health",16,Poliomyelitis

I think everybody will agree that that is so. for Supply) [11.35] I lay on the table the following paper:Atomic Energy Act-Australian Atomic Energy Commission-Second Annual Report and financial accounts, together with the Auditor-General's Eeport, for the period ended 30th June, 1954. -and move-Tliat the paper be printed. In presenting this report, I wish to amplify some of the matters referred to in it , and to indicate developments which have taken place since the close of the statutory period. In the establishment of the uranium-mining industry in Australia there have been several notable developments since the SOth June, 1954. An example is the bringing into production of the uranium deposits at Rum Jungle, in the Northern Territory, where a large and complex treatment plant constructed by Consolidated Zinc Proprietary Limited, as agent for the Commonwealth, was formally opened by the Prime Minister on the 17 th September, 1954. This plant is now successfully producing uranium oxide, two substantial shipments of which have already left Darwinf o r delivery to the Combined Development Agency. Further shipments are expected to be made henceforward at regular intervals. This very considerable undertaking, which was completed in the remarkably short time of twenty months, represents, not only a punctual fulfilment of commitments entered into by Australia for the defence of the free world, but also a contribution of great significance towards the development of the Northern Territory. Another encouraging aspect of the position is that ore is beginning to come forward from privately-operated mines outside the project area. B y arrangement with the Combined Development Agency, this ore is being accepted for treatment at the R u m Jungle plant. In the sphere of arrangements with the Combined Development Agency, I must mention also that the South Australian Government has likewise made gratifying The Minister states progress with its uranium project at RadiumH ill . The mining operations and concentration plant there were formally opened by the Governor General on the 10th November, 1954, and the associated treatment plant at Port Pirie is expected to come into operation shortly. Like the Rum Jungle project, the RadiumH ill undertaking is committed primaril y to the production of uranium oxide for the Combined Development Agency, but it has established the uranium-mining industry in South Australia, and there are good hopes that the industry in that State w ill eventually produce oxide in excess of the committed output. Honourable members w ill be interested to know that the R um Jungle and RadiumH ill projects were inspected by the Raw Materials Sub-committee of the United States Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, which visited this country in November, 1954. In a report issued by the committee on its return to the United States, the projects are referred to in tbe following terms:The Committee came away with the strong conviction that thc money which the United States had advanced on loans to the Government of the Commonwealth and of South Australia had been pruriently and efficiently expended and that Australia now has two large producing uranium properties which are daily adding to our uranium supply. The policy of seeking to interest private capital in the development of uranium mining in Australia has had encouraging and important results. Promising discoveries were made by p r ivate companies in the South Alligator River area, in the Northern Territory, and early this year the companies concerned had discussions with a major United Kingdom mining company on proposals for the development of this field. Although these discussions did not result in agreement w i th this British",19,Poliomyelitis

61,Mr Beale (Parramatta,"Ministe rcompany, they brought the Australian companies together, and some of them are now consulting with one another and with a large Australian mining company in an -endeavour to work out a joint development plan. If agreement is reached, as [ hope it will be reached, a basis will have been established for what may prove to be most important operations in the area, involving, ultimately, the erection of a treatment plant and the production of substantial quantities of uranium oxide. One of the major companies operating in the area, the North Australian Uranium Corporation, has also just concluded an agreement, which was announced yesterday, with a large American company, under which the American company will contribute capital, on a Â£l-for-Â£l basis, equal to the present subscribed capital of the North Australian Uranium Corporation, for surveying and prospecting work, to be followed by the erection of a treatment plant if this is justified by the results of the survey. All this is a hopeful augury for the uranium mining industry in the Northern Territory, and for rhe development of the Territory itself. In the Mount Isa-Cloncurry district iti Queensland, a number of deposits of uranium-bearing ore have been, located, although their full value has not yet been assessed. Development rights to what appear to be the two most interesting deposits were acquired from the discoverers by an Australian company, the Australasian Oil Exploration Company, which has now transferred a controlling interest to the Rio Company Limited, Kingdom mining organization. these arrangements, the Rio company will provide finance and technical skill for the thorough examination of the leases. of the investigations warrant it, the Rio Tinto company will establish, at a cost of several million pounds, a treatment plant, the output of which will, in normal circumstances, be purchased by the Commonwealth. I do not need to enlarge on the great interest and importance of these possibilities. developments did not take place of themselves. I do believe that the Rio Tinto company, for instance, would not have Mr Beale. undertaken operations in Australia but for the very active encouragement that was given to it by the Australian. Atomic Energy Commission with my authority. I believe, also, that other developments have been brought forward more rapidly by the knowledge of thp work that the commission, has undertaken. Comment has been, made in certain quarters concerning the policy of the Australian Government in relation to the purchase of uranium ores, and the attitude of this Government has been contrasted with that of the United State? Government, which purchases such ores much more freely than we do at this stage. So far, this Government has offered to purchase uranium ores of a certain, minimum grade delivered at Rum Jungle. This offer was made because, at Rum Jungle, we have a plant capable of treating such ores. ""We have had in mind the prospect that at some stage it may be necessary to establish buying stations elsewhere. ""When discoveries of uranium ore were reported in the Mount Isa-Cloncurry district of Queensland, the Australian Atomic EnergyCommission and, a little later, I , myself, had discussions with Mount Isa Mines Limited. As a result, that company offered to co-operate with the Government in the purchase and treatment of uranium ores in that district, provided, of course, that satisfactory terms could be arranged, and, above all, that there was a sufficient quantity of ore of a Tinto commercial grade in the district to ena large United sure the operation of a treatment plant Under for a period suflicient to enable a reasonTinto able return to be received on the substantial capital outlay involved. So far, except at the Mary Kathleen If the results lease, no appreciable tonnage of ore has been proved in the Mount Isa area, although radio-active minerals have been located in many parts of the district. In respect of the Mary Kathleen deposit, the Rio Tinto company has, as I have indicated, now acquired a majority interest in the Australian comThese encouraging pany which holds the lease, and has, I understand, taken charge of the exploration work going on there. If this exploration shows successful results, the owners of the deposit will erect a treatment plant primarily to treat the ore won from their own deposit. I have already had discussions with representatives of the Rio Tinto company and. have received their assurance that, so far as is practicable, having regard to the varying characteristics of the ores, the company will co-operate with the Government in connection with the treatment of ores produced from other deposits in the district. It is too early yet to do more than this. In relation to treatment of uranium ores, it must be remembered that the characteristics of tbe ores vary considerRecent information, however, indicates ably and that all ores are not amenable to the same extraction processes. For instance, the processes employed at Rum Jungle and at RadiumH ill to extract the uranium from the local ores differ quite substantially. In the Mount IsaCloncurry district, there are varying types of ores and, in order to ascertain what sort of extraction process is necessary, extensive tests are currently in progress, not only in Australia, but also in the United States of America, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Arrangements for most of these tests were made by the Australian AtomicEnergy Commission in order to assist producers. The establishment of plants for the extraction of uranium from ores is not a simple or inexpensive process. Three factors, in particular, have a primary significance in determining the policy to be pursued. They are (a) the amount of ore reasonably proved in any one area; (6) the amenability of such ore to treatment and the sort of treatment necessary; and (c) the grade of the ore, that is, the amount of uranium contained in the ore. When these three factors are known, it can be determined whether there is justification for expending the quite substantial amount involved in erecting a treatment plant. As a rough guide, it can be accepted that the exploration and development of a deposit of commercial grade ore to the production stage, and the erection of a treatment plant, would involve a capital siderably under the figure which we outlay of between Â£3,000,000 and receive for uranium in Australia at the Â£5,000,000. In the United States, the moment ? Government, because of its enormous atomic weapons programme, has for a good many years been encouraging the search for and the production of uranium on a scale which this country could not face. It has been deliberately seeking a substantial self-sufficiency in uranium, realizing that a war would undoubtedly render importations somewhat uncertain. It has, of course, made contracts with other countries such as Canada, Belgium, South Africa and Australia for the supply of uranium., and in all or most of these contracts the United Kingdom has participated. that the United States Government is moving away from a policy of ore buying toward one of buying oxide from producers with their own plants. This has for some time also been the policy in Canada. I was so informed by Mr Howe when he was in Australia a few days ago. The Australian Government has not, on the advice of its experts, felt able, as yet, to adopt as generous a policy for the purchase of uranium ore. Merely to buy uranium ores of commercial grades wherever they may be found in Australia could well involve the outlay of many millions of pounds of public money with the very definite risk that, for many years, little or no return would be received. Clearly, it is impossible to establish costly treatment plants in every area in Australia where uranium ore is found and, equally clearly, the cost of transporting ore to the areas selected for treatment plants on the basis of the ore reserves in those areas might well make the operation completely uneconomical. Contrary to what many people think, uranium does not bring a fabulous price. As a guide to the sort of price Australia might expect for any exportable surplus it had in the future, the director of the Raw Materials Division of the United States Atomic Energy Commission recently gave it as his opinion that the world price for oxide produced from this mineral might settle down at about 10 dollars per lb. or about. 90s. Australian.",20,Atomic Energy
62,Mr Wentwokih,"That would be conthe Combined Development Agency agreement is higher than the figure I have just quoted. The. Australian Government, so far, has pursued a policy of encouraging private enterprise to -ea.rch for and produce uranium by the grant of rights to mine and sell the product; by substantial tax-free rewards for discoveries; and by the guarantee of a market at a specified price and for a specified period. Only in the case of the Rum Jungle project has it taken a direct hand. This policy is not inflexible and has already been modified in the light of current happenings. It will no doubt be modified again as and when circumstances warrant; indeed, some aspects of it are before a committee of Cabinet at the present time. The Australian Atomic Energy Comniission is already buying ore at Rum Jungle from producers in the adjacent territory. It will consider purchases elsewhere if and when sufficient ore reserves are proved and a treatment plant appears justified, or if other special circumstances appear to make it desirable. The supply and demand position is constantly under review. It is, however, extremely difficult, in the absence of freely disclosed facts as to production throughout the world to form any infallible judgment aa to what the future holds. The military demand is, at present, the dominant factor, but the United Kingdom's requirement for its recently announced programme of nearly Â£200,000,000 for the generation of power from nuclear sources is also now an important factor. We are negotiating now with the United Kingdom about the fulfilment of part of its requirement from Australian sources. The Australian Government is very conscious of the importance of uranium, to meet, first, its own future industrial needs; secondly, the requirements of the free world for atomic weapons; and thirdly, the industrial needs of other countries of the free world. It believes that the production of uranium is best left in the hands of private enterprise. It shown by the United Kingdom Governhas, and it will, give encouragement to private enterprise in this field, but in so doing, it must have due regard to the risks involved to public funds. In short, tralia's side as prompt and effective as it has to determine the risk which it, ascustodian of the public purse, is justified in taking to assist in establishing a uranium-mining industry. Its policy must be, and is, flexible and capable of adjustment to changing circumstances. It is constantly in touch with governments overseas and is advised here by practical experts drawn from the mining industry. Turning now to action directed toward? the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy in this country, I must mention first the completion of arrangements under which Australia will collaborate with, and receive full assistance from, the United Kingdom in a co-ordinated research and development programme. Discussions on this matter wero proceeding at the close of the period reviewed in the commission's report, in the relevant sections of which the scope and objects of the arrangements then under consideration are outlined. This is, undoubtedly, the greatest single measure which could be taken to hasten atomic energy research and development in this country. As is said in the report, it has at one step given Australia access to the results of the immense amount of work on the industrial applications of atomic energy which has been done in the United Kingdom over the past fourteen years, and has placed us in a position which, if we had had to rely only on our own unaided efforts and resources, would have taken us, at prohibitive cost, many years to reach. In addition, the United Kingdom has made available facilities for the training of the scientific staff of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission both in research and in reactor technology and engineering. At present, the commission has fifteen officers at the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment, some of whom are engaged in the final design of the reactor to be built in Australia, and some in research work, while others are attending the Nuclear Reactor Technology School there. The Government recognizes with gratitude the generosity and breadth of vision ment in the discussions on these matters. To make the collaboration on Aus-",22,Atomic Energy
63,Mr Beale,"Yes; the price underpossible, action is proceeding energetically for the implementation of a full-scale research and development effort in this country. To this end, the Government in September last, authorized the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to proceed witb the construction of laboratories . and a research reactor on the outskirts of Sydney, and to recruit sufficient numbers of highly qualified scientists for the research programme. Several, distinguished scientists have now joined the commission. I u particular, I mention two' names. Our chief scientist is Professor C. N . WatsonMunro, OBE., M.'C., A.M.I.E.E., who prior to his appointment was professor of physics at the Victoria University College in New Zealand. He earlier worked in Canada on the Canadian atomic energy programme, and from 1945-1948, at Harwell, handled the design and construction of the first atomic pile built in the United Kingdom. Our Chief Engineer and Deputy Chief Scientist is Dr. G. C. J. Dalton, B.Sc, B.E., D.Phil., who was previously professor of engineering at Auckland University College, New Zealand, and from 1947-1949 was head of the East Reactor Group at Harwell. The fact that these and other outstanding scientists have joined the commission is fortunate for Australia, and a high compliment to the status and quality of the research and development programme which the Government has put in hand. This programme, which will be carried out in close co-ordination with the development programme in the United Kingdom, will be directed primarily towards the use of nuclear fuels for the production of electric power, but will provide also research in other and related fields of atomic energy technology. In addition to the co-operation now arranged with the United Kingdom, closer relations in this field are being established with the United States and Canada. Two officers of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission's staff are at preseut attending a school of nuclear science and engineering conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Interesting and useful discussion concerning co-operation with Canada also took place with the Right Honourable C. D. Howe, the Canadian. Minister for Trade and Commerce, and Defence Production, who controls the Canadian atomic energy programme, when he was in Australia recently. Australia is moreover to be strongly represented at the ""Atoms for Peace"" international conference to be held in Geneva in August of this year, where developments in the peaceful uses of atomic energy will be discussed. I would emphasize that the decision to establish the commission's research installation near Sydney in no way prejudices the position as regards the siting of any future projects for the production of nuclear power for industry. The laboratories and research reactor will be used for research purposes only, and are being built near Sydney because, in that situation, the research workers will have easy access to important light and heavy industries and to the facilities of other research organizations. If and when il is decided to establish installations for the production of industrial power, their siting will be determined by quite different considerations. I shall not attempt to traverse in detail the other steps which are being taken under thf research and development programme; these matters will be dealt with fully in the commission's next report. I may say. however, that scientists have already been recruited and sent to the United Kingdom to prepare designs for the Australian reactor, and are now engaged on this work, which they hope to complete within the next twelve months. Preliminary civil engineering work on the foundations, of the reactor will be begun while these studies are proceeding. Plans for the laboratories to be built by the commission are well advanced, and tenders will be called later this year. The clearing of the site and other preparatory work will begin shortly. The site is at Lucas Heights, near Menai, in an unoccupied area about 20 miles from the centre of Sydney. The land which it comprises has been made available by the Australian and New South Wales governments. In the operation of the reactor on this site, complete precautions will be taken against ill effects from atomic waste matter. Some months ago, Mr Stevens and Professor Baxter, at my request, attended a special meeting of the Sutherland Shire Council and discussed this matter f u l l y with the council, which passed a unanimous follows:That this CouncU after hearing the full and comprehensive explanations by General Stevens, Professor Baxter and Mr B. G. VVhitlam, M.H.R., regarding the safety of the reactor at Menai unanimously consider that no objection should be raised by this Council to its establishment. There is, indeed, a great deal of ill informed talk ahout the dangers from atomic waste material. Suitably treated there is no danger, as may be gathered from the fact that the wastes from Harwell, after treatment, flow into the Thames, which is the drinking water of London. Besides preparing for the research programme to be carried out at Lucas Heights, the commission has heen expanding the general basis for atomic energy research i u Australia. Postgraduate studentships have been established in six of the Australian universities to help towards providing trained scientists for futur e needs, and undergraduate scholarships have been established in several universities for the same purpose. contracts have been placed with some of thc universities for the investigation of specified problems connected w it h the research programme. The commission'3 Icsire to promote suitable research activities w it h in our university seats of learning and other institutions may be gauged from the fact that already the commission has established sixteen postgraduate studentships and 22 undergraduate scholarships for the promotion of research and the encouragement of degree studies in fields in which it is interested, and has placed research contracts with four of the universities for the investigation of designated problems connected w i th the general research programme. the commission wrote to the Australian universities invitin g co-operation in the general research effort, and offering assistance. I can do no better than quote rhe following words from this letter:Tlie Commission, therefore,, makes the following proposals:(a) that each Australian should supply reasonably detailed ifr. Beale. proposals of research related to atomic energy which it would wish to carry out and which would require special facilities at the resolution as Commission's researcii establishment, together with the space which might be required and the University staff that would be involved; (6) that, in a similar manner, each University should indicate any facilities it expects to require in relation to post-graduate training courses in the atomic energy field, which ft may be planning and in which the Commission's facilities would assist. In addition, Commonwealth funds have been provided for the carrying on of very valuable work, at the Australian National University in fundamental research and at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in the field of industrial chemistry. From all that I have said, it w ill be clear that, in taking energetic measures towards the establisliment of atomic energy research and development on a substantial scale in Australia, the Government has planned its programme on a wide basis and with a view to the fullest possible participation therein by the universities and related institutions. I In addition, research emphasize this point, because there has been some misunderstanding in certain quarters about the matter. As I have mentioned, the UnitedK in g dom Government has announced a comprehensive long-term programme for the production of electric power from nuclear fuels, and proposes to spend some hundreds of millions of pounds on the construction of plants for this purpose. This programme implies that atomic power is regarded in that country as having a practical economic significance. Herei n Australia, preparations are being made to take f u l l advantage of the progress made overseas, and we ourselves shall be contributing significantly to the In addition, more recently, common endeavour. There is no reason to doubt that, at the appropriate and not f a r distant stage, we shall be ready to avail ourselves of the beneficient uses of this new and miraculous source of energy in the service of our country and its citizens.

89,Mr Whitlam,"Yes, for the _ exduring the five years' currency of those licences-the Royal Commission on Television recommended a three-year term, if I recollect aright, but the Minister has granted a. five-year term-the same interests which have a monopoly of the daily newspapers in Victoria, and of all the daily newspapers, except one, in New South Wales, which are the same interests that control the wealthiest broadcasting stations in Sydney and Melbourne, and the States of which they are the capitals, will also control the only commercial television stations in those two States. It is the policy of the Government that there shall be a dual system of television, public and private. Tho Government realized quite well, when it decided to permit private television, that there were very few companies already in existence which could operate private television. It knew that private television could he operated only by the companies that already dominated the commercial broadcasting field, which were owned by the monopolists of the newspaper field. It had every self-interest in propounding the principle of private television, because the newspapers to which I have referred, without exception, support the political point of view propounded by the Government coalition. The commercial broadcasting stations, insofar as their listeners will tolerate propaganda of a political character, also state the same point of view. It is plain, therefore, that in the two principal States of Australia, in which commercial television is to be instituted, the same point of view will be put on television as is put by the press and the commercial broadcasting stations, and that point of view alone will be put. Here we have, immediately, the makings of a monopoly in all three fields of mass communication. We are often told that public control ing interests. of the means of communication would result in thought control. It is clear that, with private control of all three means referred in my submission is the breach of mass communication in Australia, we of shall have thought control by the people also passed in another place, in the folwho control those three means. Those lowing terms:means of communication will be controlled by people who are politically Australian sympathetic to the parties now in office, of ownership or control over any Australian and to those parties alone. Applications for television licences were made on behalf of the people who hold the contrary point of view, by the general secretary of the largest trade union in Australia and the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) as leader of the Australian Labour party. They made these applications as Labour party trustees. The trade unions, and last month at Hobart, the federal conference of the Labour party, ratified the applications. But the Australian Broadcasting Control Board rejected the applications, and the Postmaster-General, of course with alacrity, endorsed the rejection. Therefore, the only means of presenting a point of view that is alternative to the point of view held by the people who control the four companies that have been granted licences in this latest, most pervasive and most potent form of mass communication in Australia, has been lost. It has been lost not for three years, but for five years. That position will lead to thought control. One can at least say of public television that it will in all probability proceed on the lines on which public broadcasting in Australia has proceeded. That is, it will prove to be the only form of mass communication in which not only the majority, but also any substantia] minority, can have its point of view expressed freely, without favour, and with equal prominence. Everybody gets a hearing on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's stations, and everybody will get a hearing on public television. But only one point of view will be propounded on the television stations to be operated by the four successful applicants. It. wil] be the same point of view as is propounded over the commercial broadcasting stations and by the newspaper interests which own those stations. The public will be very satisfactorily conditioned in that regard, by the interlockThe other matter to which I have the resolution that was passed by this House on the 28th November, 1951, and it is undesirable that any person not an should have any substantial nieasure commercial broadcasting station, whether such 1 ownershipor eontrol be exercisable directly or indirectly. On that occasion the honourable members who sit. on this side of the House, both the members of the Australian Labour party and the members who are now members of the un-Australian Labour party members' who sit on this side of the centre aisle voted against that resolution, f t is true that the honourable member for Darebin( Mr Andrews), the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Corporation Proprietary Limited, in MelMullens), the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M . Bourke), and the bonorable member for Yarra( Mr Keon), were absent during the division on the resolution, as they were absent from the rest of the proceedings of the day. But those honourable members on this side of the centre aisle who were in the chamber on. the occasion of that division voted against it. I was not here at the time, but I know that the honourable members who voted against the resolution did so because they doubted the bona fides of it. You will recollect, Mr Speaker, that the Daily Mirror interests in London had at that time just bought the controlling interest in the Melbourne Argus, and the broadcasting stations owned by the Argus. Honourable members on the Government side would never have persisted with that motion if the other branch of the Harmsworth family, which controls the conservative Daily Mail, had bought the Argus and its broadcasting stations. They persisted with it, however, because the radical Daily Mirror interests had bought them. resented the fact that the Argus, under its new control, had already changed its political tone. They feared the possibility that the broadcasting stations formerly owned by the Argus would also change their political tone. We objected to the timing and the sheer vindictiveness of the motion. The general principle that Australian means of mass communication should be owned and controlled by Australians is surely endorsed by all members of the four parties in this House -the two principal parties and the two rump parties. It is true that the applications made to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board were severely modified by the board, but in the result it is possible for 20 per cent, of theshares in each of the four successful applicant companies to be owned overseas, and for any shareholder in one of those companies to live overseas and own 15 per cent, of its shares. The line-up is that a 20 per cent, interest in Amalgamated Television Services Proprietary Limited, the SunHeraZcZ-Macquarie station will be held by the Daily Mirror, of London; 20 per cent, of the shares of the General Television bourne, the Arc;ws--4(7e-Hoyts station, will be held also by the Daily Mirror, of London; 20 per cent, of the shares of Television Corporation Limited, the Packer station, in Sydney, will be held by the DailyM a i l ; and 20 per cent, of the shares of the Herald and Weekly Times station in. Melbourne will be held also by the Daily Mail. No shares are at present held by the Daily Mail, although the evidence given before the board was that the Herald and Weekly Times wished to include 30 per cent, of the capital investment from Associated Newspapers Limited, which owns the Daily Mail. The real significance of that shareholding appears from a fact acknowledged by the board on page 21 of its report. The board statedI t is. a generally accepted principle that u shareholder with a comparatively small percentage of shares can, in certain circumstances, exercise effective control of a company, and, indeed, apart from that consideration, we feel that the influence of any individual overseas shareholder should, as a matter of principle, be restricted. The board considers any company to be They controlled overseas if one-half of its shares is held overseas, or if the overseas shareholders can control the company. But you will appreciate, Mr Speaker, that it is very easy for any company, ih fact it is normal for it to be controlled by an interest owning a minority of the shares. A Â£1,000,000 company is easily controlled by some big interest which has a Â£250,000 shareholding. It is not. very diflicult for such an interest to get the concurrence of a sufficient number of other shareholders and so get a half of",27,Wentworth Adjourned Television

To-day the honourable member for ""Werriwa says that we should not have overseas capital in our television companies, but in 1951 the Leader of the Opposition saidTliis motion is anti-British and directed consequence of those hearings, made ceragainst the investment of British capital in tain recommendations to me. I conveyed Australia. He was most indignant on that occasion. It is quite possible that, but for the motion proposed by the honourable member for Mackellar, there would be a very much larger percentage of overseas capital in television in Australia to-day. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board in its report, which is available to all honourable members, had indicated that it took cognizance of the resolution of November, 1951, and that it gave very careful consideration to the wishes of the Parliament as expressed in that resolution. I think, therefore, that the House owes a debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Mackellar for having directed attention to the matter at that time. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board recommended .that a certain limit be placed upon the extent of overseas ownership of television stations in this country. The honourable member for ""Werriwa television in Australia should be the propointed out that the granting of television perty of any particular party or of any licences is in the hands of the Postmastergovernment for the time being in power. General. That is perfectly correct, but I shall read some of the conditions of the the power to grant television licenses is television licences that are to be granted. a very wide power indeed. It is a power Primarily, we endeavoured to ensure that I considered was far too great for that television should be under the me to exercise single-handed, and so I control of Australians, and directed prinobtained the assistance of the Australian cipally by Australians. Therefore, we Broadcasting Control Board.

We have decided that the vision licences.

In an state his case at a public hearing. Appliinvestment of about Â£3,500,000 for four cants had to indicate the capital that they television stations in Australia, not more proposed to use in the establishment of a than Â£700,000 may come from overseas. station, and also the source from which it was to be obtained. They also had to should be given for some overseas capital indicate the nature of the participating participation, because many overseas ifr. Anthony. parties, their experience in mass communication media such as radio, the theatre, television, picture shows or the like, and to give a very f u l l description of their ability to make a success of television in this country. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board conducted hearings of that nature for several months last year, and, as a those recommendations to the Cabinet, which endorsed, in general, practically all the recommendations of the board. There were, however, one or two minor alterations of those recommendations. The honourable member for Werriwa pointed out that the term of the licence is to be five years instead of three years as recommended by the board. It may not be plain in the board's report, but the board recommended a period of three years as currency for the licences, and indicated that the three years was to commence from the time programmes were actually televized. Therefore, the Government considered that five years from the time of granting the licence is roughly equivalent to the period recommended by the board. Consequently, honourable members will perceive that the Government's action is not much different from the board's recommendation. This Government did not propose that It is rather important that permission companies are already established in Australia where they are at present operating wireless or picture show interests. For example, Paramount Film Service Proprietary Limited has a small interest in one of the Sydney television companies, and Hoyts Theatres Limited has a small interest in a Melbourne station. Philips Electrical Industries Proprietary Limited is a huge Dutch enterprise which is already established in Australia and is employing 2,000 or 3,000 people in Adelaide. That concern also has a small interest in one of the Sydney licences. Therefore, honourable members will see that overseas interests are represented in a small degree, but nevertheless such interests are already established in Australia and should be encouraged in their enterprise. The conditions of the licences specify that not more than 15 per cent, of overseas ownership shall be in the hands of any one particular person. For example, in one Sydney station, Philips Electrical Industries Proprietary Limited, the Doily Mail, London, and Paramount Film Service Proprietary Limited of America are all represented, and those concerns originated in three different countries. Those overseas interests cannot own more than 20 por cent, of the capital in that particular television concern, and no one of them can hold more than 15 per cent. Consequently, it is quite plain that very little control will be exercised by any one of those organizations in an Australian television station. Another condition of the issue of licences is that each licensee shall, each half-year, make a declaration that there have any control over television prohas been no change in the amount of overgrammes ? seas capital invested in the relevant concern. Werriwa expressed some fear that these ing Control Board. Another condition private television stations would be used of the licence is that the licensee shall to obtain party political advantage, and provide programmes and shall supervise I have no doubt that that might have the televising of programmes from his been so if a government of the political station in such manner and in all respects complexion of the honourable member had as to comply with such standards as the been in power. I say that, because Australian Broadcasting Control Board broadcasting stations that are at present determines. Therefore, the board will controlled by the Australian Labour party exercise supervision all the time, in the most unashamedly use their media to interests of the public and this Parliabroadcast Labour propaganda, sometimes ment, over the programmes of the teleto the exclusion of propaganda for which vision stations. payment is offered by their opponents. Almost every broadcasting station in Australia will at present accept advertising matter from any political party or any religious organization, except some of the Labour-controlled broadcasting stations which refuse to accept material for broadcasting from the political opponents of Labour. The allocation of time for the televising of political and controversial matter shall be strictly on the basis of equal treatment for all parties in the manner recommended by the Royal Commission on Television. as long as it can be paid for. attaching to the issue of television licences will provide for equal treatment for all political parties. Honourable members should note that the allocation of time for the televising of religious matter shall be arranged on the same basis as that' which governs the broadcasting of religious matter from commercial broadcasting stations. Therefore, not only are political parties to be treated on equal terms, but also religious denominations are to have equal opportunities to use the television services. Insofar as that, arrangement relates to broadcasting, it has proved very satisfactory in this country, and as long as I have been Postmaster-Generalwhich has been for a good number of yearsI have not heard of a single objection from a religious organization that that organization was not getting fair treatment by the broadcasting stations.

The present have directors who are appointed by an English company that has about.Â» 44 per cent, interest in the organization controlling them. Therefore, this effective control has put at nought a resolution of this House. The Government has stated that it ha Limited-Sydney Sun; given effect to a motion of .the House by insisting that the Macquarie network Morning Herald; should not serve .substantial British interests. T'he Government's actions in this matter are like its actions in connection with the stevedoring industry. It. passed a stevedoring industry measure, but did not give effect to it and the position which the measure was designed to remedy remained as it was. Now we find overseas capital is to be strongly represented in the companies that have been given licences to operate television stations. Indeed, only one organization, the Herald and Weekly Times Limited of Melbourne, has stated that it will operate with local capital. I suggest that this Parliament should ensure that there shall not be any overseas capital in any of our media of communication of ideas or entertainment. A very bad situation has arisen when people can invest money from -overseas in .brings in the these various propaganda-creating instruments. It is the view of 'the Australian Labour party that those instruments should be completely owned by Australians.

I give you, Mr Speaker, my assurance .that I have no interest whatever. I have a. great interest, however, in protecting the public against the decision of the Government to hand over four television licences to two of the greatest monopolies in existence. honourable member attempting to continue his speech on the subject before the House? am continuing my speech. note the time. shall start now. The four companies to which the Government .has given licences represent every daily mewspaper and every leading radio station in Australia, with the exception of 3KZ of Melbourne although 2KY of Sydney, which is also a Labour-owned station is tied up with one of the successful Sydney applicants. The Government represents big interests generally, very big interests, big electronic manufacturing interests and the like, and these four television stations are to be placed in the hands of one huge monopoly or cartel. That, in my view, is all wrong. I . believe in the platform of the Australian Labour party and in the nationalization of the Labour party's platform. But, if we are to have commercial television, let ali of those interests who applied for licences have them. Why not give one to the Labour group, on behalf of whom the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) submitted an application, both for Sydney and Melbourne? Why not give one to the Mirror group in Sydney also, because it can be stated that that group and the Labour group are Australian owned and Australian-controlled. None of the other groups to which licences have been granted can make that claim. They are aill tied up with foreign interests. If foreign capital is to be invested in Australia, surely we ought to encourage its investment in heavy industry and in the establishment of industries which do not exist in this country. If we were to have investment of that kind, we would have, not only machineiy, but also the know how that is so essential to our defence and development. T.he introduction of foreign capital for television services is intended to benefit only those people who happen to live in two capital cities. The remainder of the people of Australia will not benefit. We should not divert labour and materials for the construction of television stations at this stage, anyhow. If our danger is as great as the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and other 1 Ministers have stated it to be from time to time, we should use all of our available resources for the defence of Australia. It would be far better to build a north-south railway, harbours and civil airports than to waste our money on the establishment of television services.

That is all wrong. The Royal Commission on Television recommended, in paragraph 23, that licences should be granted only for a three-year period, and that they should be renewed for a period not exceeding one year. But the Government goes beyond the terms of the recommendation of the royal commission. It proposes to grant licences for five years so that the organizations that are affected may establish their equity, and so that everybody else may be kept out for that period. The Government has given the advantage to certain big financial interests in a manner that goes far beyond the recommendations of the royal commission. The Director of Airways and Civil Aviation, Mr R. M. Badenach, has stated that the introduction of television may be delayed, because Australia is lagging far behind in electronics. If there is a country that needs all the advantages that electronic science can give it, Australia is that country. To say that newspaper organizations abroad and in Australia must have advantages in the matter of provision of television services is to neglect the public interest. We know the organizations that are interested in the various companies to which licences will be granted. There is the Daily Mirror in London, about which the Government waxed so eloquent in 1951 when it secured agreement to a resolution which denied the right of foreign capital to have substantial investin the House to-day, one of them by the ments in broadcasting stations. Daily Mirror is interested, I think, in the to suggest that the commercial broadSydney Morning Herald, the Sun and the Macquarie network. The Daily Mail of London, which is run by Lord Rothermere, is interested in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. The Daily Mirror in London is run by Lord Northcliffe's family. It is not an organ of the Labour Mr Calwell. group, but it has Labour leanings. It prints a newspaper with a daily circulation of 4,000,000 copies. But the Government thinks that the Daily Mirror should not be allowed to have substantial interests in the Macquarie network of radio broadcasting stations. able member's time has expired. pity. We have been asked to-day to believe that the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Television in relation to the issue of television licences might create a monopoly. No matter how we look at the applicants, and particularly successful applicants, for licences, we find ample evidence of competition between the various groups, regardless of the fact that the Australian Labour party continues to raise and to support the fiction that there is unity between the great press and radio interests in this country. This morning, the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) tried to tell us that we had an aggregation of monopolies developing a new super-monopoly over television services. When we consider the applicants-and after all, the board can grant licences only to applicants-the plain fact that emerges is that each of them represents an aggregation of capital. Without the backing of that aggregation of capital, how in thc name of goodness could they withstand the long period of high capital cost and high expenditure on operations without earning a profit? I suggest that, if we were to grant licences to applicants with a lesser financial background, there would be grave danger of default, and the listeners would be badly off indeed. Two remarkable claims have been made The honourable member for Werriwa who tried casting stations, in some strange way, are sympathetic to the Government. I well remember what happened a couple of years ago when there was a crisis in Australia over the balance of overseas payments. The time came for the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to make a",34,Pairs

Being quite unwilling to use the power that is conferred upon the Government by the Australian Broadcasting Act to commandeer time from the commercial network, he sought a hearing on the commercial broadcasting stations. They advanced all sorts of reasons why time could not be provided, even for the Prime Minister in relation to a matter of grave national importance. The reason behind that, of course, is that the commercial interests feel that they are under a threat from a Labour or a potential Labour government, particularly when they hear statements like those that have been made by the honorahle member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who wants to nationalize broadcasting stations. On that particular occasion, the Prime Minister was given time by a very restricted group of stations indeed, who were aware of their national responsibility. The point to be kept in mind is that, although in Australia there is not any interest which can conceivably be linked with the Government, there are five Labour-controlled stations in the capital cities which are pouring put a steady stream of Labour propaganda, and to which licences were granted when the party which they represent was in office. The broadcasting act provides that commercial stations shall make their facilities available without discrimination yet, as the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) pointed out this morning, the Labourowned stations refuse to accept advertising or broadcast programmes from anti-Labour sources. Perhaps the time has arrived when we should look at that aspect of the matter. It is true that there are five in 1951. The broard fact is, as Labour-owned stations. It is rather intriguing, therefore, to note that, when the Leader of the Opposition was in Newcastle recently, the Labour station in that area denied its facilities to him. Apparently he did not belong to the right Labour party. In other words, the station gave him the air, but not in thc manner in which he wanted it. The honourable member for Melbourne accuses the Government of inconsistency. There is no greater expert on inconsistency in the House than the honourable member himself. He has turned a complete somersault since 1951 when, in association with his leader, he fought very hard for the right of overseas interests to have unlimited participation in commercial broadcasting concerns. The 1951 resolution, to which reference has been made, did not arise because overseas capital sought to dominate one particular station. The fact Ls that in 1951 overseas interests tried to dominate the entire broadcasting picture in Australia, and it was quite right and proper for the Government to support the limitations to which the House agreed at that time. I remember, too, that it was the honourable member for Melbourne who had something more than a passing interest in the picture at that time, and no doubt he felt keen disappointment But it is very refreshing indeed to note that he is prepared to sink his disappointment, and that he is now quite prepared to accept very graciously the decision of the House at that time and say, "" Yes, I believed that in 1951, but to-day I am prepared to accept the decision of the House and change my views completely I do not think we have ever before seen in this chamber such an exhibition of "" seeing the light "". Having agreed to accept the decision of the House, he now argues that overseas capital ought not to be given access to the television field. I suggest that there is a mine of inconsistency in that particular situation. The fact is that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, in its recommendations to the Government, which the Governnient has accepted, has interpreted the spirit of the resolution to which the House agreed the honourable member for Werriwa himself so forcefully stated this morning, that there is no influence which is more powerful in affecting public thinking, and the development of the national spirit, than is television. Australia is suffering enough already from its insularity. There is a very great heed in this country for overseas experience and skill, particularly in the new field of television, which is well, developed overseas. If we were to debar ourselves from the benefits of overseas resources of skill and experience, Australia and the television industry would be very much the poorer. The'reihave been many suggestions that 1 Overseas financial interests will be allowed 1 todbminate the field of television in Australia. Because my time is limited, I -sh&il mention only Philips Electrical' Industries Proprietary. Limited,, which will ihavc a minor, holding in one of the Sydney -commercial television stations. This holding, will represent only a very small part -of the great investment of capital in .Philips Electrical Industries Proprietary Limited. If we acceptthe benefits of the know-how and techniques of big overseas companies we must at the same time give them some interest, very much' short of control, in television in this country. It is difficult to argue that an aggregate holding by overseas companies of 20' per cent, of the capital invested in a television station will give the overseas company a substantial measure of control. The limit imposed'on overseas-capital conforms with the practice in the United States of America. No one will deny that the Americans are very careful about the development of new industries. Under the Communications Act of the United States' Congress, foreign holdings in American radio and television undertakings are limited t'o 20 per cent. Radio and its kindred spirit, television, operate in the puhlic domain, and it is right and proper that the Government should exercise its peculiar responsibility imthe field of television and that it should protect the industry in this country from control by overseas interests. As I have already stated, any one will be hard put to ifc to maintain that a 20 per cent, interest, which, incidentally, may not be held by one person, represents substantial control. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board has done a very good job. The people who are now to be given a measure of control in the television industry have already rendered splendid service to this country in allied fields. We should'be content with that knowledge.

117,Mr Speaker (Hon. Archie,"Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [2.40] I move That Mr Speaker's action, relating to thc iillotmcnt of rooms to the Australian Labour party (Anti-Communist), be approved. It grieves mc very sorely to have to. propose this motion, which is aimed at depriving my opposite number in the Opposition of his palatial suite of rooms, which adjoin those of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). In contrast to the luxurious suite of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), my own office assumes an air. of spartan coldness. From his rooms the honourable member looks out upon the courtyard, and no doubt communes with nature and contemplates the vileness of man. I grieve because I shall have no opportunity in the future to accept hospitality in the luxurious surroundings of that suite. However, I am comforted by the knowledge that the lionorable member's leader thinks so much of the comfort of his deputy leader that he does not want him removed into outer darkness, but wants him to be as close as possible-indeed , closer than a brother. However, I Avarn the right lionorable gentleman not to allow his deputy leader to get too close to him. There arose in the midst of the Opposition one by the name of Joshua, the honourable member for Ballarat. I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition does not want anywhere near to himself the leader of the Anti-Communist Labour party, because anything associated 'with anti-communism has a. tremendous affect upon the Leader of the Opposition. As I have pointed out, tbe Leader of the Opposition seems to have no .desire to be closely associated with the Anti-Communist Labour party, although history has it that on occasion he has sought the friendship of a certain gentleman 'with a saintly name -Other days, other ways! It reminds me of the old sawWhen Che devil was sick, the devil a saint would be; WJien the devil was well, the devil a -saint was he. The Leader .of the Opposition has circulated an amendment to the motion, which is interesting, because it seeks 'to have a committee appointed to consider this matter. The committee members proposed by the right honourable gentleman are: Mr Speaker; .the Prime Mmister; the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who is myself; the Leader of the Australian Country party; the honourable member for Melbourne; the Leader of the Anti-Communist Labour party; and the honourable member for Herbert. What has the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) to dc with the matter? The inclusion of the honourable member reminds me of the old story about the negro who proposed the puzzle: What is it that runs, jumps, lays eggs, and barks like a dog? No one could give him the answer. He thereupon said, "" It is a chicken"". Those to whom he put the puzzle pointed out that a chicken does not bark. The negro replied, "" No . I put that in to make it more difficult."" I strongly suspect that the honourable member for Herbert has been included for a similar purpose. BeforeI deal, Mr Speaker, with the letter which you have tabled, and the thoughts that arise in my mind as a result of it, may I direct attention to the fact-it is worthwhile for me to do so-that the Leader of the Opposition has made a great name for himself throughout the world as the champion of minorities. I recall that he made a name for himself in respect of the smaller nations in the United Nations. I also remember that he has obtained his reward for championing minorities. This great leader of democracy! But what about the minorities in this Parliament House? He cannot expect any reward for championing them and, therefore, he does not do so. He would say, in effect, ""Away with them, I have nothing to gain from supporting them"". In those circumstances, democracy flies out the window because, .forsooth, the n-ight 'honorable gentleman can gain nothing by championing their cause. I turn now, Mr Speaker, 'to ithe letter which -you .ha.ve tabled.",37,Supply Grievance Bay
118,Sir Eric Harrison (Wentworth,"gentleman read iti if honourable members wish me to do so, because I propose to comment upon several paragraphs in it. It is an interesting document because you, Mr Speaker, adopted the right action in seeking a direction in this matter from the House. An examination of all the authorities, including the procedure followed in the Mother of Parliaments and decisions made by preceding Speakers in this House, indicates clearly that you have the power to allot rooms within the building as you deem fit. Therefore, you followed 'the right course when you received the letter from the Leader of the Opposition ""which, I may say without straming my imagination, was couched in terms that were slightly discourteous to you. honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr by tlie Government, subject to Uis right of C a l w e l l ) , w h o is D e p u t y Leader of the Opposition , objects to m y comment on that matter, I shall read the letter and let the c o u n t r y in t e r p r e t it and say whether m y observation is j u s t if i e d .

In that matter the Speaker is the mouthpiece of the House. The right honourable gentleman's letter continuedIn our judgment your action in interfering with the official accommodation both of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader is both arbitrary and unjust. I also consider your action is calculated to hinder and obstruct the performance of the duties of the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition. The Opposition ( I respectfully remind you) has rights and responsibilities within Parliament House co-equal with those of the Parliamentary parties supporting Her 'Majesty's Government. I do not desire to break the continuity of this letter, but I shall deal with that point when I complete reading it. It continues-:I quote, as follows, from the report of Mr Justice Nicholas in reference to the duties of Opposition Leaders:The n , the Leader of the O p p o s it i o n made i r r e l e v a n t extracts whic h honourable members m a y peruse in the letter thatlias been tabled.

I turn now to the allocation of rooms. At present' the Leader of the Opposition has four rooms at his disposal whereas the Prime Minister; when he was Leader of the Opposition, had three rooms. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has three rooms whereas when I was Deputy Header of the Opposition I had one room 1 at my disposal, whilst the Leader of the AustralianCountry party, which was 1 then the second'party in Opposition, and the parties ih those days closely approximated the parties now in Opposition, had' a corner room which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition now occupies. So, the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, had three rooms, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, had one room and' the Leader' of the Australian 1 Oountry party had three rooms. All that' the Speaker now proposes to do is' simply to make provision similar for the new party that has been recognized by this House; the Anti-Communist' party, similar to that which was made for the Leader of: the Australian Oountry party when he was in Opposition. The Speaker has decided that the leader of' the new party shall occupy the: room which is now occupied hy the Deputy.

At the most, seven rooms for the Opposition, and 4.7 rooms for fifteen Ministers! I suggest that most of those Ministers-and I do not think you will interrupt me by disagreeing with me, place at all, any more than war-time facilities should have heen in this place. They should be accommodated where their main offices are. There may have been justification for having ministerial suites established in the Parliament building in war-time, but the trend should be the other way now. Ministers should retire from this building, but, instead of that, they are increasing their demands on Mr Speaker for additional accommodation. Ministers to-day have march more accommodation than they had in the days of the Curtin and Chifley governments. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has three rooms and the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) has two. The Vice President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production, whose principal occupation in this House is moving the gag, needs three rooms in which to soliloquize and contemplate the next move that he will make against the rights of members of this House. The Minister for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration Holt) has four rooms. The Minister for Oommerce and Agriculture McEwen) has five rooms, and the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) has three rooms. The Minister for Defence (Sir Phillip McBride) has three rooms, and the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) has four. General .( Mr Anthony) has three rooms and the Minister for the Navy and Minister for the Army( Mr Francis), the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale), the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes), the Minister for Social Serfor Territories ( Mr Hasluck) have .three rooms each. The Minister for Air and Minister Townley), who, at least, has two most impon'fcant portfolios, is asked to do with if r . Calwell. two rooms. In addition, there are five Ministers on the Senate side of the building who have those palatial suites of which the Vice-President of the Executive Council spoke. The Vice-President of the Executive Council indulged in a great deal of pompous persiflage. He thought up -some well rounded phrases, and even suggested that I could contemplate the not to be in this glories of nature from the back window of the so-called third room of the so-called three rooms which I occupy. The right honourable gentleman himself has a wide vista of the surrounding hills on which to gaze. much to do other than what he does here in the Parliament, and generally he does that pretty badly. However, he can look out of his window at the surrounding hills, his mind attuned to the words of the poetWhere every prospect pleases, arul only man is vile. The action taken in respect of the allotment of rooms is wrongful, and if I uttered my views on it here my words would be regarded as being completely unparliamentary. In 1940, when I first came to this Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition was Mr Curtin. He had a staff of two, and the Deputy( Mr Leader of the Opposition in those days had a staff of one. But the work of the Par( Mr liament has increased as a result of the war and also because of the changes in our habits and the greater concentration of powers in the Commonwealth Parliament which resulted from the decision of the High Court in the uniform taxation The Postmastercase, the alteration of the Constitution placing social services under Commonwealth power, and other developments. Not only has the work of the Parliament increased enormously, but in addition, the membership of the Parliament itself has increased by two-thirds. The truth is that this chamber is very overcuowded.

It is said ito ihim that if I am to be evicted I can occupy one of his rooms. To offer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in those -days, one room in which to work, would be -completely unfair and, I suggest, improper. But to deprive the Leader of the -Opposition of one of his rooms is grossly improper. Like everybody with Scottish or Irish HoodI have a racial objection to evictions, and I certainly protest against this one. It is .not fair. The Government itself ought to think of extending the building on the Opposition side, even if it means going into the courtyard to do it. Something has to be done in regard to the present inadequate facilities provided for all honourable members. I have been courteously supplied with information showing that 27 members of t.he Liberal party in this House are provided with private room accommodation, but that five members of it have to find accommodation in the party room itself. In the Australian Oountry party there are seven members who are so situated. In the Labour party, however, we have to provide for eleven of our members who have no private accommodation, and we then provide, them only with a table in ""the party room, where they are expected to discharge their obligations to those whom they represent. The position is not going to be helped by what will happen should this motion be carried. All we want, if I may borrow a phrase from the foreign' affairs debate, is peaceful coLeader of the 'Opposition in his remarks, existence. We want to be able to do our work effectively and. efficiently, because the Opposition is an integral part of our parliamentary system. Perhaps the Vice President of the Executive Council does not wan-t -an Opposition to exist. be satisfied if .there were no room for anybody [to (represent the Opposition. I know that that is 'how he feels, because he has never recovered from his twelve months in .London, when he was the lion of Mayfair -during hi3 term as our resident Minister in the 'United Kingdom. He came ,back .with ideas -that the Government side 'should have .everything and the Opposition side .should .have nothing. Why does not tlie Government make rooms available to the new group from among the rooms occupied by Ministers? Why does not the Ministeri o r External Affairs move out from his suite on the lower floor? Why does not the Vice-President of the Executive Council himself move out from his room, because it cannot be said that he is overworked or is capable of putting any great thought into anything except the hurling of diatribes at the Leader of the Opposition? His remarks were unworthy of him, and were the sort of thing which should not be said in a debate that is concerned with the rights of the Opposition. The Opposition has rights to staff and to accommodation. I am told I have three girls and a vacant oflice. The office has always been vacant. I have never tried to fill it. I , at least, try to economize Wheni t is a matter of expending public money. The Leader of the Opposition has not been extravagant, when one looks at some of the ministerial staffs. Some Ministers have a private secretary for each of their portfolios, and an assistant private secretary. I do not doubt that they are trying to create deputy assistant secretaryships for others. When general elections are approaching this building is filled with people who are working on propaganda for the Government, and not on official matters. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has been most unfair to the and is quite unfair in what he proposes to do now to force the Leader of -the Opposition out of one of his rooms and force me out of the suite I occupy.

I am a Victorian, and in any event I liked using the party room. We are a party. That must be remembered. We represent the voice of a section of the people. It is the voice of the Victorian people at present, but it is also the voice of people all over Australia, and it is the voice of many men who sit on the benches behind the Leader of the Opposition. As a party, we requested that we be given sufficient room to enable us to do our work. You, Mr Speaker, proposed to allot to us a room at present occupied by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I am. not very familiar with that room, because I have been in it only a few times, but I know enough about it to realize that it represents absolutely the minimum of the accommodation that we require. The room that we are allotted will have to accommodate a lot of people, it will have to accommodate myself, my deputy leader, the whip, and also a staff of at least two. It will have to serve also as a party room for the seven of us, and possibly for many more before very long. If the Leader of the Opposition is really concerned to save space in this building, he should do something about uniting the Labour party. Then it might be possible to save a good deal of space. We of the Anti-Communist Labour party are prepared to go to any room in the House that is allotted to us. We appreciate your difliculties, Mr Speaker, in finding accommodation. There has been a shortage of accommodation in this building for a long time. This is a matter of importance, but I think it should have been raised in a proper and dignified way at the proper time, and not made to serve as an excuse for trying to make my party appear small. However, I am sure that it will not appear small. On the contrary, it will increase in stature as a result of the work of the Leader of the Opposition. To me, it is a matter for regret and unhappiness that the personal comfort of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should be disturbed, but by taking a certain course he could avoid disturbance and retain his present quarters. All that I want to say in conclusion is that we do not desire to make any one uncomfortable, but we do require suitable accommodation so that we can do the job for which we were elected. listened with growing impatience to the long and loud moans from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the Deputy Leader, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). As this debate unfolded, I was astonished to hear about honourable members who apparently occupied mansions in this building, because when I was elected to the Parliament a short time ago and went to the federal members' rooms in Sydney, I was politely informed that, unfortunately, there was no room for me there. I remarked then that it was fortunate for me that my constituents had reserved a seatf for me in this House. When ,1 came to the Parliament, I found that, the accommodation allotted to me was a desk in a room used by between half a dozen and a dozen other honourable membersI do not know the exact number, because it seemed to fluctuate-in a room used also as a common room. No member who is allotted accommodation like that could prepare a speech any better in this building than he could if he were in the middle of Wirth's circus.

Neither of them is any good to the House. occupy the time of the House further, except to point out that those who inhabit rooms might sometimes give some thought to those who have only a desk in a common room.

I claim that this matter ihould never have come before the House. L"" say that the time wasted on this debate to-day is a disgrace.

But it appears that there is a pact between the new party and the Government parties to make personal attacks on the Leader of the Opposition nnd his deputy. It is time that we brought .1 little common sense tb bear on this matter. The Leader of the Opposition ,-isked for a conference to discuss this matter outsidethe House. The honourable member for Ballarat and some of his colleagues made an approach to Mr Fraser; Allan Speaker on an earlier occasion. When they asked for accommodation to If allotted, to them, I understand that Mr Speaker made a survey of the building and endeavoured to find accommodation. The Government parties are,.so to speak, lapping up the new party to-day, but I warn the Vice-President of the Executive Council to be very careful lest a similar situation arise in his own party. ThaÂ» could quite easily happen. That the question be now put. The House divided. (MR . SPEAKER-HON . ARCHIE C'AMEROH.) Ayes .. .. 56 Noes 45 Majority 11 AVES. Adermann, C. El. Joske, E. ES.

161,G. Evatt..Dr. H . Vi Mr Speaker,"I shall require theDebate resumed from the 27th April (vide page 216), on motion by Mr realistic. They agree with the GovernThat the following paper be printed:Foreign Affairs and Defence-Ministeria l means that we must have defence in Statement, 20th April, 1955. statement of the Prime Minister( Mr try and seek to expand overseas markets. Menzies) on foreign affairs contained some concepts of which all Australians can well be very proud. It contained the concepts of constantly seeking peace by every possible means, of defending not only our rights but also the rights of others, and of improving our living conditions and the living conditions of our neighbours. It is a policy on international relations with which all political parties must agree in principle. The only divergence of opinion by any political party in Australia, except, perhaps, the Communist party, can be in regard to methods and priorities. There are a few people who believe that we should constantly seek peace by means of appeasement. We know that, unfortunately, appeasement is the surest road to disaster, particularly when dealing with a potential enemy who is both ruthless and without moral standards of any kind. The Communist doctrine itself postulates that might is right. It subscribes to the idea that the end justifies the means, and it openly advocates deceit, lies, and the breaking of agreements, as legitimate instruments of international diplomacy. Unfortunately, there is also a small group of people who believe that we can defend our rights, and presumably the rights of others, by keeping our defence forces at home. Any one who has any knowledge of the horrors of war would resist to the utmost, and at almost any cost, any suggestion that, if a war were forced upon us, we should fight it on our own territory. Everybody appreciates that low standards of living cause discontent, that they form a breeding ground for the Communist doctrine, and that they make people susceptible to Communist propaganda. Those people who think that the standard of living can he raised and maintained by a system of indefinite credit are doomed, of course, to the most dismal awakening. Fortunately, the majority of people in Australia are more ment in the belief that we must seek peace with honour, that to defend our rights depth, ancl that to improve our standards of living means that we must increase the real wealth of this counI f we are to defend ourselves in depth, we must have some sort of outpost for our defences. Probably the most controversial portion of the statement by the Prime Minister was his reference to the sending of a small force to Malaya. It is, relatively, a small force. It is proposed that it shall consist of one battalion, two fighter squadrons, a light bomber squadron, and a couple of small ships which will be either destroyers or frigates. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) gave the impression that that was to be Australia's contribution to a central reserve for a possible war in the Pacific. That is not the case. This relatively small force is a contribution from Australia to the British Commonwealth's effort in South-East Asia under cold war conditions. I think it is a very good plan. It will encourage the people of Malaya to make every possible effort to regain peace in their own country and so advance their aims of self-government, because no responsible national in Malaya, whether he comes from China or any other eastern or western country, believes that, in the present disordered state of that country, he could survive if British forces were withdrawn and he were thrown back on his own resources for self-government. As the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) pointed out, without doubt these people will welcome any forces from a friendly nation which will enable them to terminate, in the shortest possible time, the present turmoil, and so bring closer the day when they may take over the direction of their own affairs. The plan to which I have referred does not represent the full extent of the Government's proposals for defence. It is a plan to meet a particular situation in South-East Asia under the existing cold war conditions. I believe",50,Pairs Mimiztps R
162,Mr Bostock (Indi) [3.59],"Thethat the fact that: this small force will be a time when we hope to develop our -stationed in Malaya does not mean that it cannot be used in any other trouble area in South-East Asia under cold war conditions, such as in Thailand, the associated states of Indo-China or Burma. I hope that, in addition to providing this acceptable help to Malaya, thus giving to the peoples of tbe states which border Malaya some small additional sense of security, we ourselves will take the opporcharge of our obligations under the ANZUS tunity of obtaining some practical training in actual active operations and, particularly, that we shall be able to arrange with the British Government for some responsible appointments to staff and command positions. Wo have been told by the Prime Minister that, to meet a possible hot war situaless than 7,000 men. Such a group tion, the Governnient proposes to establish now, or as soon as is practicable, a force of aiiproximately two divisions. That is the force that the Government proposes to raise as a ma jor contribution towards meeting its commitments under the ANZUS pact and the Manila treaty. For a country of Australia's population and resources to establish and equip a force of two divisions is quite a formidable task. To that degree. I welcome it. It is however, such a task of difficulty that I wonder whether wi> could not make an equal, or possibly better, contribution to our common cause in the event of a major war in the Pacific by means that are more suited to our circumstances. Tbe raising of two divisions will require the utilization of a great deal of man-power. Two divisions constitute an army corps. The raising and equipping of two divisions, or an army corps, would absorb approximately 70,000 or 80,000 men. because such a force comprises in addition to divisional troops, corps troops, ancillary and other services. History has shown that, in Australia in peace-time, we have not a great rush of volunteers, and the voluntary method is the traditional method by which Australia raises its forces in peacecause God forbid that it should be retime. Indeed, it is the law of the country that in peace-time forces must be raised by voluntary means. In addition to the difficulty of persuading approximately 80,000 men to volunteer under peace-time conditions, the withdrawal of such numbers of men from Australian industry at natural resources, when labour is so short, and when we have full employment, would be an extremely difficult task. I suggest as an alternative that, by the utilization of air power, we could achieve the same or better results with the 'expenditure of approximately one tenth of the man-power. If our contribution to the common defence of this area, and the dispact and the Manila treaty, were to take the form of a group of highly mobile medium bombers of the V class, the group to consist of two wings each of two squadrons, the man-power necessary, even allowing for all of the ancillary services that would be required, would be should be established on a mobile basis. It should be equipped, preferably, with American-type aircraft capable of carrying atomic weapons. I suggest American-type aircraft, not because I think they are better than British aircraft, but because it is obvious that, if we must go to war in this area, our major ally will be the United States. To have in the field the same type of equipment as our major ally would simplify our supply and equipment problem very greatly. If this group of medium bomber aircraft were established on a mobile basis, and if preparations and arrangements were made with our allies for forward operational aerodromes, the striking force, relatively, would be significant. In addition, we should not be obliged to call upon our own resources, or those of our allies, to anything like the same degree in order to move such a contribution to the common defence in the event of emergency. I point out in passing, that, even if we had this army corps fully established and fully trained before we were faced with the catastrophe of war. we should be immediately faced with the major problem of moving it to where it was required, bequired in Australia. If it were required in Australia, the war would be already lost. We must remember that our contribution to the defence of the Pacific area must be of such a kind as to enable us to get our'forces into position to .fight where they are most needed and as far from Australia as possible. At present it is beyond the ability of this country to move an army corps in the short time that will be available if it is to be employed effectively. As a result, we automatically present to our allies a difficult problem, in assisting us to move these troops at the very time when our allies are fully occupied with their own concerns and the movement of their own strategic forces. The same argument does not apply to a highly mobile group of hard-hitting air bombers, which could make an initial attack within an hour or two. If such a group were to go forward to operational bases outside Australia, air transport within our own ability could sustain it until further provision for continuous operations could be organized. Such a plan is much more feasible and much more within our resources than would be the raising, training and, if necessary, moving of an army corps, and it would enable us to make a much more effective contribution to the common defence of the South-East Asian :i rea. The Prime Minister pointed out iu his statement that if we are to put these defence plans into operation a very considerable recasting of the training and provision of defence forces will be necessary. I hope that -this process will include the recasting and revision .of the organization of our .forces. The arrangements are cumbersome aaid out of date. We should not load so much on to our Defence Department. existence, though, so far as I am -aware, it has not met for a number of years, a Couucil of Defence. It is a comprehensive body which 'is capable of dealing with the military aspects of our defence problems. The purely military aspects of our defence problems should be taken out of the hands of the Defence Department. The operational ^aspects of defence should be considered by the Chiefs of Staff Committee, 'from which could be sent direct to the Council of Defence, which ,then would consider -all military sas.pects as factors of the :en tire problem and in conjunction with all other Ur. Bostock. aspects of defence-economi c considerations, international relations, national resources and development. The .Council of Defence, constituted as it is to-day,, would then be in a much better position than is the Defence Department to .forward to Cabinet considered recommendations, having regard to all the circumstances and conditions relative to the problem. At present, we have one huge organization in fhe Defence Department, which is overloaded and overworked in the attempt to deal with all aspects of defence. It is too big and unwieldly to achieve efficiency. Adermann) Order! The honourable member's time has expired. lize that this Parliament and, essentially, the Australian people are nowadays taking a greater interest in the problems of foreign relations and defence than hitherto. Two world wars, the employment of the powers of nuclear fission, the development of the atomic bomb, the rapidity of transport from one continent, to another, and the utilization of radio and associated services and of all the other great scientific inventions that have burst upon mankind in the last two decades, means that we now tend to consider our relationships with people in ether parts of the world to a greater extent .than formerly was necessary. It is probably true to say, also, that another cause of a profound interest on the part of present higher organizational thoughtful men and women is that it is realized that, although World WarI . and World WaiI I . were fought to .end wars We have in and although it was thought, in 1945 that the United Nations perhaps would solve all our international problems, great tension between people of different nationalities and ideologies remains. As a member of the Australian Labour party, I believe in defence. This -country must be defended. It.has been thrown up at me from time to time in this House that .on one occasion in ""1938 I declared that I would not spend 3d. recommendations on defence. The people who throw that utterance in my face clip it from its context and do-not reveal that itiwas:made : under certain circumstances and with certain qualifications. The people who",51,Menzies

164,Mr Pollaed (Lalor) [4.19],"I reabandy that remark about and attempt to use it: to; discredit; me ignore their own weaknesses and the. position in which they stood in. 1938. Although they claim that they, believe most strongly in defence and in all practical defensive measures, they did not act before World War LT. As a result of their neglect, on the out^ break of World War II . in 1939, Australia was almost defenceless. In fact, an eminent gentleman who was a member of this. ParliamentI shall not name him, but. if any honourable member approaches me privately I shall tell him the name-remarke d to me on the Canberra railway station early in the last war, "" We are so ill-equipped that we bave not one bomb rack, for any of the aircraft in Australia "". It. is true that at that time the aircraft availahle in Australia were very few. The anti-Labour parties professed to believe in compulsory military training, but because they feared'that the electorate would not support them if they advocated compulsory military training, they refused to introduce it although they believe in it. If I was. wrong in 1938, they wereas bad as, or worse than, I was. These remarks should dispose of that charge that is thrown up against me. Let us now turn to the present defence situation. During' the war and in the post-war years until 1949, the Curtin and the Chifley Administrations were fully seized of the importance of international relationships and of the im? portance of making the best possible use of the machinery of the United Nations in order to engender a more peaceful state of affairs in. the world. Since 1949, a number of Ministers, especially the Minister for External Affairs( Mr of the world. On the other hand, a very Casey), who has travelled thoughout Australia, Europe and America, and traversed, the entire globe, have travelled extensively at great personal discomfort. [ do not object to Ministers travelling: But the Government; though it is interested in world peace and though Ministers have travelled so much, has not made any profound statement,, such as those that were made by the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt.) j when he was Minister for External Affairs, in the Labour: Government, and such as might be"" calculatedto.*influence the nations of' the world"" toi adopt more peaceful policies. Government travelled with closed minds. member has.observed, they travelled with closed minds. It is said that, Australia is a small Power.. It . is. But small nations and individuals in thein individual capacities have, in all mannerof things in this old world of ours, profoundly influenced the welfare of mankind. It might be said that the'Saviour was only an individual; but He profoundly influenced the welfare of mankind, and we hope that His teachings will continue to exercise a deep influence on all men, not only in Australia, hut also in otlier countries. I hold the Government blameworthy because, at the various times: since 1949 at which international tensions have troubled us, it did not throw its. weight into the task of achieving peace and did not make the voice of the Australian nation, which is and should be.respected, heard per medium of an expression of opinion about Australia's views. Since1 the forces of Chiang Kai-shek in China collapsed through their own corruption and incompetency and the virile efforts of the people in China who defeated him. tension has existed in relation to tbe islands off the coast of China, and the island of Formosa. Individuals, members of Congress and officers of the State Department in the United States have expressed' opinions about this situation. I believe that a very large section of American opinion endangers the peace large section of responsible opinion ih the United States, which I respect, has striven to preserve peace in the world, and I hope that that bodyof opinion in America will prevail. But what pronouncements have been made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs in Australia about' the views of the Australian Government and the people of Australia?' Apparently this Government has adopted! a? policy of jumping last and supporting-others only when they have taken the lead?",53,Menzies

166,Mr Pollard,"As the honorableCanada is a fellow member witb Australia of the British Commonwealth of .Vations. As far back as 1952, when an nnti-Labour government was in office in Australia, the Minister for External Affairs in the Conservative Government in Canada, Mr Lester Pearson, who is chairman of the North Atlantic Treaty Council, said that the West should be careful not to reject any new Communist proposal for easing international tensions. He statedThere is a great temptation in many quarters to throw everything aside and arm tu the greatest extent and then say to Moscow, "" Come and get us"". This must be resisted vigorously. If we are not careful we w ill fall try. under control of the military, and in the name of security they might do many things which arc unnecessary. The most important feature nf the Lisbon decisions and agreement was the fact, that these were made by civilians and not liy the military. Anyone who has read in the newspapers the articles prepared by the military advisers of the Australian Government must conclude, as I do, that this Government is led by these military men. Mr against the guerrillas in Malaya when Pearson has been consistent in his views. The Australian Government has been silent on international problems and on npproaches, whether from Moscow, red China, American leaders of political thought or any other source. Earlier this year. Mr Pearson warned the United .States that even limited might have a chain reaction and might cause the conflict over the Chinese of f shore islands to spread across oceans. At that time, the Prime Minister, who was in Washington, had given no policy indication about where Australia stood. He had stated in London that the islands off the Chinese coast were "" not worth a war"", but when he was asked later whether he still held that view he refused to reply. He expressed no opinions and made no decisions because he had no courage. Mr Pearson diverged sharply from the American view that the offshore islands are necessary to the defence of Formosa. He stated bluntly that they were, in effect, part of the Chinese mainland ancl that their strategic role "" would seem to be more important in the defence of that mainland against attack than in offensive action against Formosa "". He also reminded the United States that its ilr. Pollard. treaty with Chiang Ivai-shek gave it the right to restrain aggressive nationalistaction from Formosa. Mr Pearson added that he was shocked, by the views that were being expressed., by some sections of Americans. It ison these things that the Opposition join issue with the Government. The Prime Minister's speech, stripped of surplus verbiage, was an announcement to the world that, on the one hand, we are committed to send approximately 1,000men to Malaya and, on the other hand,, wo are committed in certain circumstances to send two divisions to that'counThe Australian Labour party does not approve of the Government'sintention to send 1,000 men to Malaya. Already, there are available in Malayaapproximately 300,000 troops who are drawn from the native population or from British and Indian sources.. Yet, we propose to send a force of 1,000 men. By doing so we shall deplete our industrial capacity to that degree. Arethese men to be thrown into warfare already there are available in that country hundreds of thousands of troops and the authorities do not know what to dowith them ? The honourable member for Ballarat. who is a gallant soldier with a gallant intervention war record, commanded a battalion i i North Africa during World War II . , and because Australia was likely to be cut off from sources of assistance, the force.' with which he was serving were brought back by a Labour government to thi* country. Last night, he announced that he believed Australia should be defended in other countries, apparently without consideration for the rights of the people in those countries. He went so far as to commend the -Government's intention to send these forces to Malaya where, hi expressed the hope, they would be retained in garrison. On this point there is conflict of opinion. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Bostock), who was a very distinguished air marshal in World War II . and is nearer to Government opinion than is the honourable member for Ballarat, said a few moments ago that he hoped that the members of the force sent to Malaya would be blooded and that they would be thrown into action against the guerrillas in order to gain experience in warfare. The honourable member for Ballarat is more modest. He does not want this force to be used. He wants it to be in Malaya; whether as a police force or to be allowed to deteriorate of the British Commonwealth, and it has from sheer inaction, I do not know. But the honourable member for Indi, who has t.he inside oil, wants this force to be thrown into action against the guerrillas, although thousands of Malayan troops already available cannot get a "" go"" against the guerrillas and thousands of Chinese in Malaya cannot get a "" g o "" against the Communists. The honourable member for Indi said that any force that is sent' to Malaya should be given an opportunity to train in warfare and he suggested that it could be used not only in Malaya but also in China and Thailand. Let no Australian mother or father whose sons happen to be in any force that is sent to Malaya be under any delusion that such troops will not be put into action, that once they are put into action they will not incur the hatred of Asiatic Communists and that eventually the call for war will not come from this tory Government with the result that our lium-power will be drained. Some notice must be taken of the honourable member for Indi. He said that the raising of two divisions with ancillary forces would involve 70,000 troops and. that this would place too great a strain upon our industrial capacity. He also said, and I agree with him, that it would be more practicable to rely upon an advanced air force group than upon an advanced army corps. In the event of a hot war, an advanced air force group would be more effective in defending Australia than the sending of two divisions of troops to Malaya. The honourable member for Ballarat, who, of course, is a very strange individual, believes in defending Australia in other countries. He believes in garrisoning Australian troops in. other countries before war breaks out. He is oblivious to developments that have occurred since World War IL , particularly the fact that countries which then agreed that British troops should be stationed within their borders, establishing air and submarine bases, have changed their outlook in that respect. For instance, the'United Kingdom has withdrawn troops which it previously stationed in India for the defence not only of India but also of other parts withdrawn troops from Pakistan and from Egypt. Some people will say that Britain was obliged to withdraw its troops from those countries. In my view, Britain withdrew those troops for two reasons; first, on grounds of common decency, and, secondly, because the British people have come to realize that, British armed forces have no right to remain on the soil of other nationals against the will of those nationals. Does the honourable member for Ballarat suggest that it would have been impossible for Britain, assisted by the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, to retain in the Suez Canal and Egypt, the troops which it previously had stationed in those areas? Some of those troops are now stationed at Cyprus and some may be stationed in the British African colonies. The point I make is that British troops were withdrawn from Egypt because the constitutional government of that country objected to their presence and the sentiment of the Egyptian people demanded such action. to the sending of these troops to their country ? event, they have not been properly consulted on the matter. It might interest the honourable member to know that in Kuala Lumpun, of a population of 300,000, only 7,000 are on the council roll. That fact indicates the opportunity which the Malayan people have been given to express their views. The honourable member for Ballarat think so. He would almost be prepared to kiss the honourable member for Ballarat, but not long ago he was laughing at him. Last night, the honourable member for Ballarat had much to say about smears. He referred to Dr. Burton, who is a distinguished Australian. He is the son of a Presbyterian clergyman. His views",54,Menzies

I do not propose to deal in detail with the right honourable gentleman's speech, but I refer to the very first point that he made because the Leader of the -'Opposition (Dr. Evatt) aud the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) have throughout their speeches said that Australia and the countries which would unite with us against a common enemy should strive in every way 'through the United Nations to bring about peace by negotiations. Of course, we all agree with that view. No lionorable member has objected to itAs a matter of fact, the first point that the Prime Minister made in the great speech that he delivered last Wednesday week wasFirst, we must constantly seek for peace provided '.that peace can be had with justice. That is of paramount importance. Although that statement does not consist of many words it is full of meaning. What is ithe use of peace to anybody if it is not just, or if our freedom is the Prime Minister had not given even not retained? Down through the years, the British people have had to fight to maintain peace. Coming fresh from three Anzae Day services to this House, the speeches'of the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Lalor had a hollow Ting in my ears. At those ANZAC Day services one heard on every hand about .the deeds of the men who have insured for us the continuance of liberty, honour .and British justice. We must uphold the principles for which the British people .stand. We have a flag, but that flag will 'be honoured abroad and in this country only 'so long as we stand .four square for the principles that have made Britain great. But in this debate I have heard from members of the Opposition remarks of that kind .expressed only by the anti-Communist section of the Opposition. I thoroughly agree with the speech that the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) made in rebutting the arguments that were advanced by the Leader of the Opposition last .night. The fifth point that the Prime Minister made wasWe must live and let live. I do not think that he went far enough in making that point. I believe that he should have said that we must live and help live. Through the Colombo plan, Australia is giving effect to the slogan, "" We must live and help live "". Under that plan and under Seato we are helping other nations to live. We are not doing anything to deny self-government to other countries but, on the contrary, by giving assistance through education-the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) has just announced the .provision of more scholarships for that purposeby giving them tractors and foodstuffs we are doing everything with the object of putting them in a position in which they can be given self-government with confidence. Every Australian .realizes that fact. The Prime Minister's speech gave' Australians fresh heart that at last something practical was being done to stem the surge of communism in South-East. Asia and to prevent that area from being used as a jumping off point to this country. The Leader of the Opposition said that a hint that the Government intended to act in a .peaceful way .to .overcome disputes. The fact is 'that the Prime Minister based his whole speech on the need to maintain peace by negotiation. Then, the Leader of the Opposition said that, under the United Nations Charter military forces must be used only as a last, resort. I agree with that statement. But what happens after all peaceful means have been exhausted and the Communists continue to push on.? A good illustration of the attitude :of the.

Tet the Leader of the Opposition expresses such a hope in a speech that was completely lacking in common sense. He also saidOmmode of thinking must keep pace with scientific discovery. Just prior to that, he had said that we must re-establish with China relations that existed in the days of Morrison and Donald. The right honourable gentleman did not appear to be aware of the contradiction. He compared promises made by Roosevelt and Churchill to Malaya with the Japanese promises of the South-East Asian co-prosperity sphere. I could not tell whether he favoured the Japanese promise promise. He admitted that he was not sure which of the two promises was the better. When all is said and done, a promise made by the British or the American people w ill be fulfilled at the right time. T'he classic utterance of the Leader of the Opposition, to whicli I . desire to direct most attention in the brief time available to me this afternoon, is as follows:The sending of Australian troops to Malaya would gravely injure our relationship with that eountry. Those words have been repeated, in substance, by the honourable member Lalor( Mr Pollard), and the opinion is shared by many members of t'he Labour party. tion made that statement, he must have been ignorant of the fact that our troops, wherever they have been sent, have been our greatest ambassadors. have known anything about the people of Malaya. the knowledge gained from the period of four years and four months I spent in that country. that the Australian Imperial Force established with the Chinese in Malaya and with the Malays themselves. world of difference between what one knows, ancl what one thinks. merely thinking statements. sonal experience. I could bring battalions of men from all parts of Australia who have hacl experience of the Chinese in Malaya, and the Malay people, to confirm my statements. Mr Turnbull. sition should talk w it h some of those men, and ascertain the facts. The Australian Imperial Force, when it landed in Malayai n World War II . . was sent, among other places, to Malacca, which is a big place and one of the oldest cities on the peninsula. As soon as the children saw the Australians come along in their uniforms, they disappeared into the houses like wild animals scurrying into the jungle. They remained out of sight for the first few days, but after a while we could not get r i d of them. Photographs in the possession of ex-servicemen bear evidence of the great friendliness disor the Churchill-Roosevelt played by the children towards our troops. As a matter of fact, I think that some Australians got too friendly one to decide. member has no right .to make such a statement. that existed between the Chinese, the Malays and ourselves was outstanding.

The Leader of the Opposition made another classic remark when he said that Australia was saved in World War II . by Australian Labour party. leadership. I have not heard a more ridiculous statement. Opposition members -It is true. but I have to drum it into the ears of Opposition members, that had not the Eighth Division held up the Japanese on the Malayan peninsula for five or six weeks, there would not have been a battle of the Coral Sea. Surely to goodness Opposition members can understand that! The Japanese tried to fight the Australians first on the Malayan peninsula and that campaign gave the Labour government, if there was any Labour party leadership, an opportunity to get the American fleet to come southwards and engage in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Had it not been for the foresight of the preceding anti-Labour government, the Eighth Division would not have been sent to Malaya, and the Japanese would have come straight to Australia. Make no mistake about that! Anybody who has a knowledge of naval and military tactics must agree with. me. It is the only logical gestion very quickly. He said that the conclusion that any man or woman can reach. Yet all the time we hear about the groat Labour party winning the war. Not a word is said about the great Empire air training scheme in Canada, which helped to enable Australia and the other democratic nations to retain the freedoms that they cherish so dearly. I now desire to ask a few questions about Malaya, and in doing so, I paraphrase a passage from a statement made years ago by Sir George Reid. Are we on a quest in search of gain, such as led our forefathers to the Australian shore? Are we preparing, when we send our troops to Malaya, to invade and outrage the nationals of that part of the world in lawless rage of conquest? I hope that our troops will go forward as soon as possible, and when they do so, their mission will' be as pure and as noble as that which any soldiers undertook to stem the onward march of would be tyrants. So far as I can understand the position, the Opposition does not regard communism as a threat at all. If members of the Opposition regard communism as a threat, let one of them rise in his place and say so. That is the point. Two prominent members of the Labour party-the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Lalor, have taken part in this debate to date. I have not heard any statement from them that convinces me that they are opposed to communism in any way. Let them declare their views. Australians are a freedom-loving people. Australians have died in the defence of freedom. Honourable gentlemen opposite speak of "" Her Majesty's Opposition"". Let them say clearly what they mean by their statements on foreign policy, instead of making speeches that no one can understand. Let them declare where they stand. Until they do so we must regard with suspicion any idea of non-participation in Malaya, as advocated by the Opposition. The suggestion has been made that our troops should be trained in Australia, and kept here, and should be flown to a place where they are required. The Leader of the Anti-Communist Labour party ( Mr Joshua) knocked that sugtroops would need to be landed by parachute, and that they would not have any supply lines, so complete chaos would result.

183,Mr Costa,"We have other meansopportunity of self-government, tliey could not only develop further their primary industries and their natural resources, but also considerably improve their economic position in the field of secondary industry. The standard of living in Malaya, because of that country's natural rich resources, is higher than the standard elsewhere in South-East Asia. Better standards of living have possibly had a disturbing effect on the political thinking of the Malayan people. There is an undercurrent of thought in Malaya that Britain's old promise of self-government should be fulfilled. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned the Atlantic Charter, which was later incorporated into the United Nations Charter. It holds that every nation should have its own nationality and should have self government. nations, and it was a clarion call for all nations. The Malayan people responded to it, but they are disapj>ointed that its promise has not been fulfilled. The urge to self-government has become stronger in Malaya since 'World War II fact that the Japanese overran Malaya so easily aroused a feeling of insecurity and loss of faith in British protection among the Malayan people. Because of the quick success of the Japanese in the early stages of World War II . there has developed among their fellow Asians in Malaya a feeling of confidence in their own capacity to manage their own affairs, whicli has given them a fresh urge to self-government. Economically Malaya is very significant to Britain and the sterling area. Its dollar earnings each year are 250,000,000 dollars, which are the highest dollar earnings of any country in the sterling area. Without Malaya the sterling area would be in an impossible position financially. That is the measure of Britain's interest in Malaya. Of course, Britain's interest in Malaya is not the interest of the British people as a whole. It is the interest of a few wealthy investors. That rnay be what we are sending troops to Malaya to protect. It is vital to the British Commonwealth that Malaya should want to lead an independent life as a member of the British ft -[ll ] Commonwealth. It is important for tlie rest of the Commonwealth that Malaya should incline towards a democratic government. If the Communists, to whom I am 100 per cent, opposed, I may say, in answer to the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), were in control of Malaya, they would command a prime strategic area and great resources of tin and rubber without which the west could not easily live. I think, however, that tbe sending of troops to Malaya by this Government will not secure those resources, or keep the Communists out of Malaya. I believe the granting of self-government, the extension of the hand of friendship to the Malays, and the provision of aid to them would do more for our cause than anything else would do. We have the example of India, Burma, Pakistan, and It was meant for all Ceylon, which enjoy self-government, which are friendly members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and which are all anti-Communist. Indonesia is a similar example. Whatever Malaya was in the past, it certainly is not The to-day a mere colony. Malays are conscious of the fact that they are governed from the Colonial Office in Whitehall, and resent it. I believe that some status superior to colonial status should be granted to Malaya now. Every citizen likes to have a say in shaping his own destiny, and the Malays also have that desire. In Malaya about 10 per cent, of the Chinese population are Communists. The entire Communist force in Malaya is reckoned at about 8,000 out of a total population of 6,000,000 people. Ten per cent, of the people are proBritish and anti-Communist, and a big percentage are indifferent, as were the people in Indo-China in the face of the Communist danger. There is an analogy there. I believe that those people would go the way that the battle went. Only a handful of Malays and Indians believe in the Communist party, and I believe they could be turned on to the right path if we allowed them to have their own party, and worked in with them. There is now a genuine national movement in Malaya. It is a labour party, which seeks independence for Malaya. It has a comprehensive programme of reforms which is attractive to all sections of the Malayan community. That programme includes an insistence on self-government, and a willingness to stay in the British Commonwealth of Nations. That is their aspiration, and we should not lose the opportunity to encourage it. I. believe that such plans as the Malayan Communists may have in mind would immediately lose ground if Britain set a time-limit on the British stay in Malaya, as it did in India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon. A total amount of Â£1,200,000,000 is invested in Malaya, and most of the proceeds of that investment goes out of the country. The Malays should have those profits to improve their own country, and to help them to achieve some of the standards in social security, good wages, good hours of work, workmen's compensation, and so on, which we enjoy in Australia and which they could enjoy if they were also given the right of self government. The target for self-government should be set up before the eyes of the Malayan people, not only as something to which they can look forward, but also as something for which they should prepare. There should be established in Malaya training schemes such as were established by Britain in India. When India was given the right of self-government, the Indian people had a civil service in existence to carry on the administration after the British had left. That has been denied to the Malayan people, and they resent it. Malaya ean be best managed by Malays, just as the economic and defence problems of this country should be left in the hands of Australians. intervention is dangerous. That view was supported by the recent elections in Singaassistance and bringing their students to pore, in which military intervention was an issue. Eor the first time in history the people of Singapore had an opportunity to cast free votes, and they showed that they did not favour the sending of troops to Malaya. I believe that the correct answer to our defence problem lies in adequate defences in our own territory. We should strengthen our northern defences, and concentrate our forces in our north and not in Malaya, where the sending of troops by us Mr Costa. could be considered offensive, and could lead to tragedy similar to that which occurred in Malaya in World War II . Our national defences should be prepared in the right place, which is in our north, and should be developed side by side with the general development of our northern areas. It would encourage the growth of population there and we should he offending no one by preparing our defences in their proper place, Australia. [5.15] -The members of the Opposition disagree with the statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on foreign policy and defence. If they disagree with it , surely it is up to them to provide an alternative. But so far we have heard no alternative except that suggested in the most vague and nebulous terms by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) himself. His first attack on the Prime Minister's statement was a declaration that what Australia needed was a positive foreign policy. Let me put to the House what the Government has actually done with regard to defence and foreign policy. We have improved our defence immeasurably, both at home and abroad. We have alliances with powerful friends. I refer to the ANZUS pact and to Seato. We have pursued vigorous economic policies. We were originally responsible for the Colombo plan, and the other treaties that we have entered into, such as Seato, also have economic aspects. We have established diplomatic posts all over South-East Asia and numerous visits to that area have been paid by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey). We have encouraged understanding with Asian countries by the arrangements we Military have made for giving them technical Australia. We have supported the work of the United Nations amongst Asian countries by our contributions to Unicef, and we have taken all sorts of other steps to expand our understanding of the peoples of Asia and to improve our relations with them. If that is not a positive foreign policy, I do not know what is. In addition, the Government has afforded active support to the United Nations. Of course we support the",61,Menzies
184,Dr. Donald Cameron (Oxley),"United Nations. Last night in this debate the Leader of the Opposition produced a great list of countries which he said should be admitted to the United Nations. Perhaps they should. But the fact of the matter is that we have an immediate, pressing and urgent problem on our doorstep, about which, I suggest to the House, the United Nations is unable to do very much. What can the United Nations do about the emergency in Malaya? The conflict in Indo-China, I remind the House, was settled, not by the United Nations, but by a conference of the great powers. What was the United Nations able to do iu Korea, the only instance in which it did intervene? Everyone agrees with the Leader of the Opposition that disputes ancl international differences should be settled by peaceful means. Only a madman would want to settle them by war. In that regard, we have acted in concert with the other nations of the British Commonwealth with our allies in America ancl in pressing upon the world plans for disarmament. The Leader of the Opposition informed the House last night that the great powers had not met for ten years, but in fact it must have been barely ten months ago that the leaders of ing together in Geneva, were able to settle the conflict in Indo-China. But it is useless for the leaders of countries to meet together, inside or outside the United Nations, and attempt to produce a settlement of international disputes unless they .have behind them the strength which gives them authority to speak. What can little countries do unless they are united ? What can even great countries do unless they are united? SoI say that in our foreign policy, unity is the first requirement. The Government has vigorously pursued it in the treaties it has made with other nations, both great and small. What does unity involve? In the first place, it involves a contribution from us. We can never expect help and assistance from other nations with which we have relations and common ideals unless we are prepared to make a contribution ourselves. I.hope this country realizes that the defence of Australia, not only is essential to such a contribution, but also is a matter to be considered in not isolation, but as a part of the defence of the free world. What are we going to defend Australia against? There is only one force, only one power, against which we have to defend Australia to-day. Every one knows it, and to pretend otherwise is idle. What we have to defend Australia against is communism, with its declared objectives and its proselytizing activities in every part of the world. The Prime Minister's statement on foreign policy contemplates that state of affairs. SoI say that the second element in the achievement of unity is the effective defence of Australia, in combination with our allies. There is a third requirement for the achievement of unity. It is readiness to use deterrents against war. There is one which I may call the ultimate deterrent, nuclear power. The position as I see it is that our opponents know quite well that we are not aggressive and that we should use nuclear weapons only in an extremity. Therefore, while it is essential for us to make all preparations for such an extremity and to be ready and prepared to use those weapons, it is also essential for us to be ready to use what are called conventional armaments, not the great powers, by meetby ourselves but as an integral part of the defence plans of our allies. What twaddle it is for people like the honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa) to say that the defence of Australia can be conducted by ourselves alone, in Australia! Every one knows that if there is to be any defence at all, it must be defence by combined powers, and even then we may well expect severe blows in carrying it out. One objective of our defence plans must be to maintain forces armed with conventional weapons. Whether we agree completely with what is said in the Prime Minister's statement in this regard, or whether we listen, as of course we do, with great respect to the suggestions made by my colleague, the honourable member for Indi( Mr Bostock), is only a detail of the main principles of the case I am putting to the House. Whatever we do, we must have some reserve of forces armed with conventional armaments. There is another reason for this. It is only natural to suppose that the Communist powers will follow a policy of piecemeal wars. They know that we are not going to be the first to use atomic weapons. Therefore, they are prepared to use the advantages that they have in man-power and conventional armaments in .order to create more emergencies such as those in Korea, Indo China and Malaya. Those are general words. There are two things which, I think, stand out against that sombre background. The first is the problem of Formosa, which wns referred to by the Leader of the Opposition last night, but again in general terms. I want to say at once that I have no intention of being specific on this matter, because it is one of such gravity that I believe a responsibility rests on all of us in public life and in this Parliament to treat it with the greatest restraint. The negotiations which are going on about it should, I believe, properly be carried on behind closed doors, so that those conducting them will not trumpeted abroad. Every one should realize the awful responsibility that rests upon those who are handling this difficult situation. But let no one doubt that it is being handled and that the Australian Government is playing a noteworthy part in its handling. I only want to say one more thing about Formosa. I hope that, whatever settlement is made, the people concerned will be given some chance to express their own desires, hopes and wishes, and that they will not find the doors of liberty, freedom and human happiness closed for ever against them. The other matter that stands out against this background is the specific matter of Australian troops in Malaya. I shall deal with that in some detail, but first of all I want to refer to what wa3 said about it by the honourable member for Banks. I presume that he spoke for the Labour party. In fact, he declared that he did so. He said that the presence of Australian troops there would be offensive, not defensive. I ask him and I ask the Labour party generally: Offensive to whom ? To the Communists ? Do they object to that? He went on Dr. Donald Cameron. to say that it was against Labour policy to send troops overseas, and he recapitulated the various countries to which British troops had been sent in the past. I ask him and the Labour party: Was it against Labour policy to send Australian troops to Korea? There was a time not long ago when it was not against Labour policy. The suggestion that the presence of Australian troops in Malaya would be resented is not a veiy difficult one to deal with. There has been an Australian bomber wing there for quite a long time, taking an active part in operations against terrorists. Has any resentment, been expressed at the presence of those Australians? If so, nobody has heard it. Has any resentment been expressed at the presence of British troops in Malaya? Does any one really believe that they were sent there to crush Malayan independence ? Of course not. The trend of British policy in Malaya has been in the direction of an orderly programme for elective self-government. But the first be embarrassed by statements necessity is to ensure that, when Malaya secures its independence, it is not immediately destroyed by the forces of Communism, now actively engaged against it . No proper comparison can be made between the grant of independence and self government to Malaya and India. It is misleading for the Leader of the Opposition to attempt to make us believe that any such comparison can be made, because the countries are quite different. In India, there was no active subversive fighting going on, as there is in Malaya. Australia, Malaya and the British Commonwealth generally have a common interest in the security of Malaya, in the establishment of an independent government there, and in seeing that the destructive forces of communism are prevented from strangling independence at its birth. But, more than that, many statements have been made by leading Malayan statesmen, not only welcoming the actions of the British in India, but also announcing that they believe it would be a mistake for independence to be given too quickly to Malaya. In at least one case a reference was made in specific terms to the presence of British troops there. Those leaders include such men as Sir Cheng-lok-Tan, the leader of the British Commonwealth to wherever in Malayan-Chinese Association, and Mr the world we have to go. I have no Abdul Rahman, the leader of the United doubt that such a policy will demand Malayan organization, who, when he great exertions and great sacrifices, but spoke of continuing links with Britain, there is no other course open to us if saidindependent Malaya wil] remain in the and in honour. British Commonwealth and will want thc British Army to stay. A part of the British Army, in its wider debate about the need for peace in the sense, is the Australian force which will world. I am sure that all honourable be there. I could quote many other members of this House, and the great prominent Malayan leaders who have majority of people throughout the world, spoken in the same way. I have dealt with, the two main matters manufacturers and others who make a which stand out against the general backprofit out of war. Nevertheless, while ground. I reiterate that I do not believe we continue to hope for, and seek, peace, for one moment that the presence of Ausby some asinine policies we seem to be tralian troops in Malaya will arouse continually involving ourselves in war. resentment amongst the Malays or Very little progress has been made toamongst the people of neighbouring counwards world peace for many many years. tries, any more than the presence of It seems to have been assumed by many British troops has done. In fact, I honourable members on the Government believe it will bring aid and comfort to side that the English-speaking people many of our Allies in neighbouring should set out for other countries, lay States. AndI ask why is it always wrong down policies for them and tell them for us to make military preparations the way that, they should run their against our enemies, and always right for affairs.

185,Mr Beuce (Leichhardt) [5.33j,"Asuffered in the past through following policies similar to the present Government's policy. This Government, like the French kings, can never learn by its mistakes. That trait of the French kings resulted in a revolution in France, which ultimately did not alter its status in the world, but such a tendency on the part of this Government will probably destroy Australia and bring us under the power of a foreign nation. Let us consider Australia's part in World WarI . I believe that, not by the greatest stretch of imagina tion could it be considered that World WarI . was fought in any way for the defence of Australia. Nevertheless, hundreds of thousands of Australians were taken to the Middle East and Europe and used as shock troops. Many of them never returned to Australia. Had World WarI . uot occurred I have no doubt that our population would have been greater than it is to-day-in fact it would number about 20,000,000 people-and our wealth, and consequently our power, would have also been much greater than it is. If we hacl not been drained of our manfrom Africa. For doing that he was conpower and resources in World WarI . , we should have had a larger population and more wealth, and we could have manufactured greater war' material and prepared our defences on a greater scale than is possible at present. had we not participated in World WarI . we should have been able to develop our industries and ultimately have become the centre of the British Commonwealth. Weight is added to that argument when we consider the articles and warnings that we read about atomic warfare, and the possibility that the British people might have to find a refuge somewhere away from the British Isles. If we had not lost great numbers of our young men of marriageable age in World WarI . , I have no doubt that our populacould never have got them out of the tion would have increased to a number far greater than it is to-day. At the beginning of World War II. the Australian Government was led by the leaders of the present Government. That government followed the same policy as is being followed to-day-that is, the policy of sending men away from Aus3Ir. Bruce. tralia to fight. After World War II . broke out the then government sent men to Africa, but apparently overlooked the real enemy that threatened Australia from the north. If a Labour government had not superseded the Menzies Government of that time, the Australian soldiers in Africa would not have been able to come back to an Australia governed by. Australians. Australia had hardly any defences at tbe time the anti-Labour government sent our men to Africa. In the north of Queensland there were a few troops, hut they did not even have rifles; and, later, even those men were moved south. After Japan entered the war events occurred very rapidly. After the Curtin Government came to power, the Japanese reached New Guinea and a few Militia boys stopped them at Kokoda and at Milne Bay. At this stage I suggest that the proper credit has never been given to the valour of the Militia Forces in the great, job they did in holding up the Japanese at Kokoda and Milne Bay. Soon after that, John Curtin brought back the 6th and the 7th divisions, and, later, the 9th division demned by the leaders of the present Government and also condemned by Great Britain whose then Prime Minisquantities of ter wanted to send Australian troops to Burma. Sir Winston Churchill stated in his biography quite defintely that the I have no doubt that' Australian troops should have been sent to Burma. The idea actuating the minds of the leaders of the British government of the day was that Australia did not matter two hoots. Those leaders considered that even if the Japanese had occupied Australia, they could have been pushed out later. Nothing was more ridiculous than that idea, because it is quite plain that the Japanese could have allowed millions of coloured people to flow into Australia, and even if they had no arms at all we country. Later the Australian Government, under John Curtin, appealed to the United States of America and that country sent men and materials to assist us. To make a long story short, as a result of American and Australian armies fighting together we were able to defend Australia. The fine work that was done at that time has enabled us to be here to-day carrying out the government of the country. However, if we had continued to adopt the policies of the then Menzies Government, and of the present-day Government, we should not have been here to-day. Tn 1910, when the Australian population was about 5,000,000 people, the Australian Government arranged for Lord .Kitchener to make a survey of the defence capacity of this country. Because of oar small population, and the fact that most of our people were in the southern part of the continent, Lord Kitchener evolved a defence plan which was based upon the evacuation of the northern part of Australia beyond the border of New South Wales, in the event of an enemy landing in the north. I suggest that such a plan was quite sound in 1910 when our population was very small, but during World War II . when our population had almost doubled and our industrial power bad increased enormously, both in the south and in the north, that policy was simply crazy. Despite that, and despite all the denials we have heard over the years, the non-Labour government of the day adopted Lord Kitchener's plan which then became known as the "" Brisbane l ine "" plan. I was a Minister in the Queensland Government when the present Governor of New South Wales, Sir John Northcott, was in charge of the Australian Army in Queensland. He said to Mr Forgan Smith, who was then Premier of Queensland, "" When are you going to send your Government to the northern rivers of New South Wales? "". There is no doubt at all that that request was made, and Sir John Northcott practically suggested that he would force the Queensland Government to leave Queensland. However, Mr Forgan Smith was a very tough Scotsman, ;md he replied, "" This is a. sovereign State, iiucl we are not shifting the Government until the Japanese are a bloody sight closer than they are to-day "". tive that the honourable member used is foinpletely out of order. exactly what was said at that time. Pearl Harbour had been attacked, and thp Japanese had advanced to the very shores of Australia. After General MacArthur arrived, there was some talk of him remaining in Melbourne. But he said that he might as well be in New York as Melbourne, and he advanced to meet the Japanese on their own ground. Through its actions, the Labour Government of the day saved Australia for the Australian people. However, if we send Australian soldiers to Malaya, and they get embroiled in fighting over Formosa, we should be embarking on one of the silliest campaigns in history, because we cannot beat China. The population of China is so enormous that unless atomic bombs are used-and no doubt China and other countries have atomic bombs also-an y waiwith China would end in defeat or stalemate. American material and equipment will be required in Chinai f America is fighting against that country and, if Australian troops are over there assisting American forces, there will be a wide open track to Australia along which the Japanese may travel as they went before. Australia, with its supplies of uranium and such commodities, is probably the richest prize for which any nation could look. The Japanese are again going about taking photographs, and they know better than ever the wealth that is in this country. Whether the Japanese be Communists or imperialists, they will, when they are strong enough, move south with the object of conquering Australia. The startling fact is that America is presenting to the Japanese huge quantities of armaments such as jet aeroplanes and other modern equipment. The whole picture is such that I suggest that any man of common sense would recommend to the people of Australia that they should establish their own defences right here in this country. We have heard many statements about experiments with various kinds of atomic weapons in Australia. Is it proposed that the uranium that is required for the manufacture of atom bombs shall be exported from this country? Is Australia to be left naked as a result of the sending of men and materials overseas? Australia would be the final area in which a war would be fought, yet it is proposed to send overseas men and large supplies of armaments, and leave Australia with",66,Menzies

Tihe logical thing :fco do would be to take the men and the materials that were required, and to manufacture the atom bomb. If other people have the atom bomb, and if they say that they can fire it from a certain jriace to Australia, why should we not be able to fire it from Australia to such a point? ""We have t'he basic material, uranium. Moreover, we have the technicians who understand the processes that are involved in the manufacture of atomic weapons. I see no reason why they should not be able to establish an organization for the manufacture of such weapons. We established a huge organization on the Snowy River, and we got technicians from all over the world because we put money into the scheme. Could not a project for the protection of Australia be established in much the same way ? A few days ago, the people of Australia Malaya. The Government does not procelebrated ANZAC Day, and in doing so pose to send Australian troops to Malaya they celebrated a day of wonderful to prevent that country from obtaining courage and fortitude by Australian and its independence.

The main reason for Russia's doing so would be that, immediately the production of such weapons liad ceased, and immediately existing stock-pile3 were destroyed, it would have a preponderance of power in any military offensive. One of the most disgraceful incidents in the parliamentary history of Australia was concurrence in the giving of independence to Indonesia at the time at which it was given. That country was unprepared for independence. One would not take a child that could not walk, put it in a main street in front of traffic, and say to it, "" Go for your life. If you are knocked over by a motor car, it will teach you that you should not go in front of cars "". All of the reliable reports that have been received from Indonesia show that economic conditions in that country now are far worse than they were when the Dutch people were in control. ""We may admit that there were some failures under Dutch rule, but it is now acknowledged that the present Government of Indonesia has made a complete mess of governing that country. I am a mazed that intelligent people should advocate the giving of immediate independence to such countries as Malaya. Has j'nybody stated that we will not give Ma laya its independence, that we will not grant to it the right of self government? the right it is ready to receive it. Take the case of India. The Indians themselves have acknowledged that one of the main reasons why that country was able to make such progress after receiving independence was the foundation that was laid, and the assistance that was given, hy the British. Similar preparatory steps are being taken in Malaya. Progress is being macle every day towards the attainment of independence. steps, too. ns the Minister for the Interior( Mr tation that has marked Western interferKent Hughe's) has just stated.

We would knowledge of events in Asia. That be handing over to a potential enemy a vital and strategic point in South-East Asia. To those who oppose the sending of troops to Malaya, and who say that such action is offensive to the people of South-East Asia, I direct this question: Are we going to Malaya to defend the people of that country against the terrorists, or are we going to attack the the people of Malaya themselves? It is obvious that these troops will be sent so that independence may eventually be given to Malaya, and so that the terrorists who are endeavouring to disrupt the economy and the political life of that country may be completely destroyed. While the terrorists remain in that area, Malaya cannot become an independent nation. AVe have had statements from leading authorities in Australia, from members of the returned soldiers' league, ancl from citizens who are conscious of the responsibility of this country, which support the Government in an action that will contribute towards peace through strength.

I disagree entirely with that view. We shall do nothing practical to meet the onward surge of communism by merely sending troops to South-East Asia to slaughter native peoples in order to force them to see the virtues of Western capitalism. The Government proposes to use force of arms to convince the people of Asia that Western imperialism is preferable to Communist imperialism. Such a proposition will cut little ice with the Asian people.

His views demonstrate clearly to me why the position in Asia is as bad as it appears at present. Mr Justice Douglas statedArrests without warrants n.ro liberally allowed. Sean-lies and seizures without warrants are also freely permitted. Where a business is bein<? run to aid the guerrillas, it can be made subject to a sort of receivership or wound up and dissolved. Persons (not citizens) There is a big difference between citizens and persons in Malaya. A large percentage of the people who live in Malaya have no citizenship rights. I continue with the views of Mr Justice Douglaswho in the opinion of the High Commissioner have aided and abetted or consorted with persons who tliey know or had reasonable cause -to believe were acting "" in a manner prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order "" can be deported or detained. Any one whom the H i g h Commissioner thinks hns aided and. abetted the guerrilla forces may be deported or detained. Mr Justice Douglas continuedThey are deported or detained without trial.

Isi t any wonder that the Asian people can see no difference between Communist imperialism and Western. imperialism? Mr Justice Douglas stated alsoOne tried and acquitted often is sent to a detention camp if he is deemed dangerous to the nation. . . . Mohammed Ysofl, head of tlic Government Workers Union whom Mr Justice Douglas met at Penangthinks the detention law is sometimes used unfairly. He pointed to the case of the Battery Workers Union that was headed by three Chinese. This union struck against the layoff of 200 men. This was in the spring of 1952. The union officials were arrested and put in protective custody on a charge that they were either Communists or Communist sympathizers. In August 1952 the union officials were still in jail. No charsre had been preferred against them, nothing had been proved against them, and there was no proof that they were Communists or Communist sympathizers. They were gaoled simply because they, as trade unionists, had the decency to stand up for the rights of the tnem bers of the unions that they represented. Mr Justice Douglas continuedI do not know nmrc about the merits of the episode than what union men and a few American observers told mc. But it is clear that the detention law is viewed in the ranks of labor with fear and suspicion. There is no doubt that some managers have used it as an instrument of terror against trade unionists. It has in fact sobered the activities of labour leaders, and, as one British observer noted, made workers hesitate to strike even to remedy justifiable grievances. It is about time that we stopped talking all this balderdash about the great British justice that is exercised in Malaya. In Malaya to-day there is a for m of tyranny that is almost indistinguishable from that of a Communist dictatorship. All the rights and benefits that have been taken from, the Malayan people are, in the view of Mr Justice Douglas, the things of which one would expect a people under a Communist regime to be deprived. honourable member hate theBritish so ? of the facts that I have enumerated, situation exists in Government supporters tell us that we British should send Australian troops to Malaya",70,Menzies

Erom which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) quoted last eveningThe coolie ""worked o u t "" not only the expenses of his recruitment and the cost of his transportation from China, but the profit of the broker as well.

I do not hesitate to say that I am not prepared to see Australian men slaughtered in the defence of ""Western investments in tin and rubber in Malaya. If we wish to stop the forward surge of communism, we must give the people of Malaya and of other areas of Asia an alternative to the sort of capitalism under which they suffered in the past. Their The views of Mr Justice only knowledge of the white races has been gained from the exploitation that has marked the influence of imperialist interests in South-East Asia. The people of Asia claim the right to live as decent human beings, free from exploitation, and they have a perfect right to expect us to help them towards that sort of life. We have no right to allow Western investors to enter into Asian countries and exploit the native peoples as the Asian people have been exploited in the past. We shall never find an answer to communism while one section of a community has a free rein to exploit the great masses of the people who, in any country, produce its wealth. Communism will never be destroyed by force of arms. It is an idea, and an idea can be overthrown only by a better idea. Until we can take to the Asian people a better idea than the Communists are taking to them, the people of Asia will not be much impressed by what we attempt to do to prevent as those which originally communism from marching forward.

Even when the elected government at Singapore takes over, it will be free to do only those things which Whitehall allows it to do. says that he likes the British. What is wrong with that ?

Honorahle members interjecting, to insist on order being maintained during this debate on foreign affairs. This is not a joking matter. We are dealing with serious affairs that affect the future of this country and I ask the House to become serious. people of Malaya do not want foreign troops on their soil, but they are not free to say so. It is suggested that they do not object. This Government does not know what the Malayan people want, because they have not an elected government. Except in Singapore, they are ruled by a High Commissioner. Even Ln Singapore tie elected government can do only what the High Commissioner permits it to do. There must be something wrong in Malaya when we realize that when this trouble started in 194S that, although there have been employed .continually since then as many as 300,000 men, including special police and the like, in trying to combat them, there are still just as many bandits operating there to-day as there were eight years ago when operations against them were commenced. If it is true that everything is in perfect order in Malaya as the Government would lead tis to believe, why are these people continuing to get such strong support from the indigenous population as to enable them tocontinue just as strongly after eight years of operations against them? We should give these people the right of self government as the Attlee British Government gave that right to India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon. There is no Communist threat in those countries, and there would be no Communistsin Malaya or Indo-China to-day if the people of those countries were allowed to govern themselves. They have as much right to govern themselves and to determine their future as we have. They are human beings, and the fact that .they are coloured does not lessen their right to enjoy everything that we enjoy. That is the solution of this problem. Those people should be given the right of self-determination and be freed from exploitation by western investors. We should remove poverty, misery and uncertainty which are the breeding grounds of communism. If that were done, communism would disappear in those countries. The Chinese people did not embrace communism because they believed in the principle of surplus value, or in dialectical materialism, or because they understood every word of Das of utter desperation. They were prepared to do anything rather than put up with the rotten and corrupt tyranny that existed in their country.

Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works) [8.20] I shall skip the speech of the houorable member for Eindmarsh which was based on ignorance and on enmity towards the British race. E have had talks with many Chinese and Malays and I know that the one reason why eradicated in Malaya is weakness in the free world induced by the woolley-headed, muddled thinking of people like the honourable member for Hindmarsh and his colleagues who advocate appeasement policies in our dealings with the Communists. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in his speech on foreign, affairs and defence set out in clear and unmistakable language the five principles on which this Government and, I believe, the vast majority of the people of Australia, wish OUT foreign policy to be based. I shall not enumerate those principles, but the last of them was ""the will to live and let live"". I am surprised to find that that policy does not exist in the Australian Labour party to-day. The honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Bruce) spat bitterness across the chamber against the Japanese. Other honourable members have feelings locked up in their breasts far more poignant than the feelings of that honourable member. But I ask the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr friendliness which was non-existent in Duthie), who visited Japan recently, what good can be achieved by bitterness. When I stood on a hill overlooking the city of Tokio and saw the devastation caused when 65 per cent, of the area was practically razed to the srround, and when I realized that from 30,000 to 60.000 people were fried in the holncnuse of fire that followed the bombni.sr. I thought, in spite of the feelings I previously had towards the Japanese, that one could, perhaps, believe thnt the mean Japanese had paid dearly for the atrocities which they committed and of which some of us have close knowledge. Bitterness only creates more bitterness. Tokyo was not the only city to be thus devastated. Yokohama and every eity nf any size right down to Osaka, in the 1 nland Sea, was similarly destroyed. The honourable member for Wilmot said that the Japanese were always taking photographs and the honourable member for Hindmarsh repeated that statement. I have never seen a people more camera( Mr Clyde Cameron) happy, than when I was last in Japan. Everybody was taking photographs of everything, everywhere at every time. Buti f they wanted to hide their intentions in taking photographs they would terror cannot be completely not take them openly in Australia or elsewhere. The principle of live and let live is not entertained by members of the Australian Labour party in their foreign policy. The Prime Minister elaborated t.he means by which this Government is (tarrying out Australia's foreign policy, through support for the United Nations Charter-eve n though its administration is weak we support the United Nations and hope that it will grow strong and through co-operation with other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations and our great cousin, the United States of America, and with all nations of the free world. The right honourable gentleman's speech showed breadth of vision and perspective. It was based on knowledge, experience, sympathy and understauding and should command the respect of every honourable member. It gave evidence of the qualities which have led Australia through a difficult period and established abroad for this country prestige and 1949 because of the foreign policy that was adopted by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) when he was Minister for Extern""! Affairs. The Prime Minister's speech revealed the characteristics which have made bim one of the outstanding statesmen in the world to-day. On the other hand, the Leader of the Opposition delivered a speech which, at best, was a dreary dish of dreamy idealism, unspiced with the ingredients of realism. He tben indulged .in an hour and a half",73,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out

At its worse, it was a speech that will do more to cause war in the Ear East than anything I have heard for a long time, because it will strike fear and dismay in the heart of every small nation and in the heart and mind of every overseas Chinese and joy in the heart of every Communist. I know that the right honourable member did not mean his speech to have that effect. But that is what it will do. When I left Darwin, I did not go straight to Singapore and on to England. I went to Indonesia, up the Chinese coast to north of the 38th parallel to the Injim Eiver in Korea. Australians stationed there are almost a lost legion, forgotten by dangerous. If the honourable member the vast majority of people in this country. Those troops are carrying the traditions of the Australian Imperial Forces and the ANZAC spirit in the interests of the free world. All the way up the east coast of Asia, I met people who are living day by day, and almost hour by hour, in fear of the spectre of the red shadow. We in this country do not realize that fact. My contacts with Malays, Tamils, Sikhs and Chinese have given me a first-hand appreciation of the difficulties in Malaya. Honourable members opposite do not seem to realize that a programme of self government for these people has already been laid down. down for years. in Malaya are to take place later this year. These people came to me and asked, "" Are the British going to leave us to ourselves after we get self-government? If that is so, there will be chaos."" Honourable members opposite do not seem to realize the difTerence between security and self-government. I remind them that Australia once had colonial status, and that we grew step by step to become a self-governing dominion under the protection of the British Navy. In a similar way, security is costing the British Government far more than it derives from that country. Malaya's security and play our part in that task until the people of that country are strong enough to hold their own. Eighty-five per cent, of the internal security forces and 89 per cent, of the police force are Malays. The speech of the Leader of the Opposition was also completely illogical. He raised no opposition to the despatch of the Australian troops who are now in Korea, which is nearly 6,000 miles away, but, to-day' he says that we should not send troops 2,000 miles away to Malaya. He has never, as far as I know, raised any objection to Nato, through which Canadian and American troops in Europe are 6,000 miles from their home base. The right honourable gentleman's speech was not only illogical but also for Hindmarsh is not convinced on this matter, I shall inform him of what Mr Marshall, the Premier of the new Government at Singapore, said yesterdayIt conies ill from us to question the good faith of a nation that now holds out its hand to help us to our feet. able member can have the lot. Certainly. Mr Marshall admitted that there are in Malaya some people of the type to which the honourable member has referred, but they are not in anything like a majority. The Leader of the Opposition also said that the Government had not made any positive approach to Asian problems. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) gave a complete answer to that statement. Nobody has been more assiduous or diligent, and nobody has achieved greater success in spreading friendship and co-operation and in aiding security among the Asian people than has the Minister for External Affairs. The Minister quoted the ANZUS Pact and the Seato Treaty as concrete evidence of actions taken by this Government to provide security for ourselves and our neighbours and in order to. ensure that these Asian countries are not overrun by Communists. He also quoted the Colombo the maintenance of Malaya's plan. Whilst that plan is not his brain child, he has done a tremendous lot in implementing it.

AVhat is the position we find to-day? What is this accusation of colonialism? Many countries in Europe hoped to find themselves free after World War IT . What has happend ? The great nationsBritain and Americai n particularhave been accused only recently in certain quarters of colonialism. What are the facts? I shall not go back to the period when we got our freedom, but I point out that since World WarI . , the following countries have been granted their independence by GreatB ritain and the United States of America, France and the Netherlands: The Bepublic of Ireland, Egypt, Irak, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Israel, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines. Nearly 600,000,000 people, and, indeed, more than that number if we include the populations of South Korea and South Viet Nam, tire involved. During the same time, the peoples of the following countries have lost their freedom, and have been enslaved behind the iron curtain or the bamboo curtain:-Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Rumania, and China -as o North Korea and North Viet Nam, if we like to add them. 620,000,000 persons have lost their freedom as the result; of Communist i m perialism, which is more than the number of persons who have gained their freedom as the result of the actions of the four great nations of the free world. The history of the twentieth century shows two diametrically opposite movements affecting the spiritual and moral welfare of nearly half the peoples of the world. One movement prompted by the great democratic nations has achieved independence and f u l l self-government for more than 600.000,000 peoples. Other peoples numbering slightly more, have been denied their sovereign rights and freedom by Communist regimes led by Russia. As I have said, all up and down the That is one way coasts from Darwin to Tokio one finds this spectre of fear w i th people livin g under the red shadow. The further one went, the more convinced one became that it was not a question of the people of China wanting to accept communism. It was because Russia armed Chinese Communist forces, and had two Chinese divisions trained, which were formed fro m refugees from the Japanese who had fied north of the Amur River and put them in at a critical period. But we shall leave that. It is a matter of history. A t the moment, there are 2,000,000 refugees or more in Hong Kong who have fled from the red fear. I was present on the day when the eA acuation of the Tachen Islands r started. I was told it was expected that half the 15,000 civilians would come with the troops to Formosa, and that the other half would say that they wished to stay. That was not mere talk, because the Americans were with them when the offer was made, and they had very great difficulty in providing for evacuees. Three days later, the Nationalists learnt that of the 15,000 persons on the Tachen Islands, nine only asked to stay because they were too old to move. One man's family said that they would stay and look after the old man who was too old to be moved. The old man committed suicide that night so that his family would not have to remain and come under the Communist Hungary, Esthonia, Latvia, regime. Such instances cannot just be brushed aside, the same as one cannot brush aside what happened after the About armistice in Korea, over the return of prisoners, and the numbers who did not wish to go back under the Communist regime. All this leads up to two main points. One of them is that the Communists start one war at a time. They fight a cold war at all times and in all places, but they fight a hot war at one time in one place. In Europe, they went as f a r as they could unti l they were met by a show of strength. They then switched to Asia, and following the Stalin policy, they have been fighting one war at one time in one place, going as f a r as they could, go. Korea was in the first line. The Communists nearly overran it , but they were eventually stopped, and thrown back to the 38th Parallel. They were bogged down economically and strategically. They wanted an armistice, and they bargained for eighteen months to get the best terms they could. They had no intention of keeping the armistice, and they set off to hot-up another cold or tepid war in their own time in another place. They have not kept the armistice in No r t h VietN am or Laos, and as soon as they signed it they started tension in the Straits of Eormosa. That is why I hope that in any talks which take place, the scene w ill be treated as one picture, because up to the present time the strategy of the Communists has been to endeavour to conquer Asia, or as much of it as they can, before they return to put the pressure on Europe. It is all very well to start to give away I should like to say a word of warning. other people's property, but let me remind I hope that in any talks, Avhen we smoke the House that the one ray of light in the pipe of peace, we shall be quite sure the darkness for the 12,500,000 overseas that we are smoking tobacco and not ChineseI mentioned is the Nationalist opium.

220,Mr Kenthughes,"for peace, but that desire has been traded on by the Communists. If there were no Communist aggression, there would be no need for anybody in this world to provide arms to-day. I hope it will not be long before that stage is reached in the world, but in the meantime, we have to maintain strength in order to command respect. The statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on foreign affairs and defence has produced contributions from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), the Leader of the Australian Anti-Communist Labour party ( Mr Joshua), two Liberal party Ministers, the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) and the Minister for the Interior( Mr Kent Hughes), and, on behalf of the Australian Country party, by the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) and the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock). I shall deal with their remarks in an ascending order; I shall climb the ladder. The honourable member for Lyne is the representative in this chamber of the Church militant. His idea of peace passeth all understanding. However, he has made comments about our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, in terms which he has used on several previous occasions in this House. To hear him, one would think that he was advocating that Australian troops should go to Indonesia, to teach the Indonesians how to ensure security and good government. The only trouble about independence for Indonesia was that it came in 1950, instead of in 1945, 1946 or 1947. The proof of that can be shown by the fact that Communist influence is in the discount and is diminishing in India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, to which the United Kingdom has given self-government. Communism has been largely eliminated in the Philippines, to which the United States has given self-government. The only countries in our area in which communism is still noticeably menacing are Indonesia and Viet Nam, where independence was too long delayed and the population were not trained for it. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) expressed the opinion that the views which the Leader of the Opposition put forward were his own and not those of the party which sits behind him. I give the lie to that statement instantly. They are the views which were ennunciated by the supreme body of the Australian Labour party-the last federal conference of the party sitting a couple of months ago. Those views have since been endorsed by the governing body of the Australian Labour party in the six Australian States and the Australian Capital Territory. They are concurred in by the New Zealand Labour party. But quite apart from his statement on that matter, the honourable member did sayand this is a more formidable chargethat the Government's ideas on sending troops to Malaya were obvious, logical and sensible, and those of the Leader of the Opposition were thoroughly impracticable. It is with that statement that I wish to deal. The views of the honourable member for Ballarat, when he speaks as a private person, are worthy of respect, because he is the only one of the four party leaders in this House who has seen war service. It was most distinguished service, too. But when he speaks as the leader of his party, his views can be largely discounted, for he is the only one of the party leaders behind whom there sits not one man who has seen war service. His followers were not even camp followers. In the last war, they were not in the forces or in essential callings. They were no comfort in war-time to our American allies or to our British ones. I do not mean, by that statement, that they have not shown their potentialities in recent weeks as mercenaries. I pass now to the remarks of the two Ministers. The Minister for the Interior speaks more outside this country on external affairs than does the Minister for External Affairs himself. The remarks of the Minister for the Interior to-night were a piece of those which he expressed when lie was in Taipeh. Formosa, a few weeks ago. I have received from the Formosan Government a document in which his remarks are reproduced in this formEe stressed that the friendly relations between Free China and Australia should be further promoted as the two countries are",77,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out

Tliat is the sort of irresponsible statement which makes for 113 innumerable enemies in Asia because the Chiang KaiShek Government has not one friend in Asia. . The Minister for External Affairs was at some disadvantage in that he followed the Leader of the Opposition. Hc was floundering at first when he made the extraordinary statement that the Labour Government had ignored Asia aud had had no Australian representatives in Asia in 1949, when the present Government came into office. MT. CASEY I said "" In South-East Asia "". tion, and I hope that the Minister will accept the correction that I will now proceed to detail to him. It is useful to recollect the history of the Department of External AfTairs in Australia. It was the first Commonwealth Department created when the Commonwealth was formed in 1901. At the outbreak of World War II . there were 30 members on the staff of the department. When the Labour Government came into office in 1941 the staff numbered 40. When the Labour Government went out of office at the end' of 1949, there were 642 persons on the staff, an increase of about 600. At present there are about 741 members on the staff, an addition of another 100. The recruiting for the department is declining. When the cadet scheme was started during the Leader of the Opposition's term as Minister for External AfTairs, the intake in the first year was twelve, and it continued to rise. In recent years it has dropped. Last year it was merely four. need. Minister's idea of our need is that it is a diminishing need. our post-war needs are completed now. representatives overseas in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan. During the eight years in which the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for External Affairs we established relations with every one of the "" Big Five"", and with every self-governing member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, including the countries of India, Pakistan and Ceylon and with Eire. The Minister himself claimed that there were no Australian representatives in the countries of South-East Asia when the present Government took office. I point out that we had already representatives in India and Pakistan and Ceylon, and those countries had representatives here. We could not have had representatives in Indonesia, because that country did not achieve sovereignty until the 27th December, 1949. The Minister's predecessor arranged for diploI accept the correcmatic representatives to be exchanged between Australia and Indonesia. The announcement was made in March, 1950. We sent a representative there in June, 1950, and he left there in November, 1951. Since then we have not had a Minister or ambassador in Indonesia until this very month. That is to say, for three and a half years our nearest neighbour, which is the sixth or seventh most populous country in the world, was without any Australian representative on a ministerial or ambassadorial level. Minister the facts. The only Minister we had in Indonesia was Mr Hood. He left Australia for Indonesia in April, 1950. According to Current Notes he visited Australia in May, 1950. After his return he remained in Indonesia until November, 1951. He then represented Australia at the General Assembly of the United Nations, and returned to Australia without revisiting Indonesia, and no further Minister was appointed. It I take it that the was only at the beginning of this year that Mr Crocker's appointment as ambassador was announced, and he arrived in Indonesia at the beginning of this month. I repeat that for three and a half years our nearest neighbour was, left without Australian ambassadorial or ministerial representation.",78,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out

The other countries of South-East Asia with which we have established representation are the Philippines and Burma.

The three associated States of Indo-China were not granted recognition as States Avithin the French Union until February, 1950. Until then, they Avere not eligible to receive or accredit representatiA'es. I shall refer now to the remarks in which the Minister for External Affairs compared Seato with Nato. Of course, t.he comparison is not valid. Nato includes every country on the North Atlantic seaboard, with the exception of Spain and Eire, Avhose contributions, with all respect, were not very significant during the last assault on freedom in Europe. It also embraces the maritime poAvers in the Mediterranean. EA'ery country in that area belongs to the organization. The position, in regard to Seato is completely different. There are only tAvo Asian poAvers, the Philippines and Thailand, in Seato. The Philippines is not on the Asian continent, and Thailand has the weakest of Asian regimes. stan. Pakistan is in it too. Those countries are the three Asian members of Seato. They are outnumbered by the Western countries that have interests in this area. Seato is not in any form a regional pact in the sense that the United Nations Charter envisaged. I am now coming to the summit, to the statement made by the oracle himself, the Prime Minister. That statement Avas more notable for what it did not say, than for Avhat it did say. It is amazing that the Prime Minister of this country could make a statement last week which made no reference to the conference then proceeding in Bandung Avhich was attended by 29 free nations whose representatives I shall not accept were the representatives of three-fifths of the world's population, and which was being held in the country nearest to us. Not only was no reference made to the conference in the Prime Minister's statement, but no regard was paid to the people represented at it. Could any unreality be greater? The Prime Minister made no reference to our relationship with Malaya. This was the great occasion, the well-publicized occasion, Avhen the Prime Minister of Australia should have made some statement concerning the attitude of the Australian Government tOAvards the Malayan people themselves. It is true that those people have not yet got self-government, but before the end of the year they will have representative government, even if not responsible, government. The island of Singapore, which has a majority of Chinese people in its population, already has representative government, and it is not hostile to the British point of vieAv. The sensible thing, surely, before sending Australian troops to Singapore or Malaya, is to consult Avith the people there about it. That was not done. We are repeating the same performance that we had in 1950, when an Australian heavy bomber squadron was sent to Malaya and Singapore without consultation Avith the people there. Of course, on that occasion, no reference was e\en r made in this Parliament to the move. The occasion of the Prime Minister's statement was one on Avhich he should have said, in no uncertain terms, that we believe that the people of Malaya are entitled not only to political self determination, but also to economic self determination. Such a statement Avould have removed the last vestiges of indifference in Malaya, because the best Avay to remove indifference in that country is to assure the people there that we are not helping them in order to preserve their exploitation by one poAver alone, but are helping them in order to preserve them from exploitation by any power, whether China or the United Kingdom., and that they will have real self-determination in the political and economic sense, and will have our assistance Avhen they ask for it, and in the terms in which they ask for it.",79,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out

232,Mr Whitlam,"That is true.it is all right to talk about these people not being f it for self-government. The point is that that statement has been made by no one more often than by rhe members of the present Government, about every country that has achieved self-government since the end of the war. According to these gentlemen none of the countries represented at the Bandung conference would be f it for self-government. According to thein, we alone are wise. Yet, one can see what a shambles our politics are. The great trouble about promises of self-government to countries that are waiting to achieve it is that we never say when it is to take place, and who is to make the decision. The people who are to have self-government are the only people who are consistently ignored in connection with the proposals ro establish it . Another omission from the Prime Minister's statement is a clear statement of the use that is to be made of our troops in Malaya. Are they to be garrison forces, or a mobile reserve, or guerrillas? The Royal Australian A i r Force squadron has been used in Malayaf o r the last four years against the guerrillas. Are our troops to be sent to Malaya as if to a bigger and better Canungra jungle training camp? No pronouncement about it has been made in the Prime Minister's statement, which makes it plain that their role has not yet been determined. We are tioing to send them to Malaya without having determined what their role is to be, and without stating who is to be in command of them.

We are faced vvith the absurd position, with continental China excluded from the United Nations, that in any mattei concerning 1 China we have to by-pass the United Nations. We know what happened in Korea aud VietN a m , and what could happen in Formosa. It is better to discuss these things in the United Nations than to discuss them with a de facto regime outside the United Nations. The Canadian Ministerf o r External Affairs has stated that Canada would not go to war over the off-shore islands of Quemoy and Matsu. The same has been 3aid by Adlai Stevenson, the democratic leader in the United States. One view on the question has been well expressed by Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, and 60 other members of Christian Action, in the United States of America. He saidThe more reasonable place to draw the line of the defence perimeter of the free world is around Formosa and the Pescadores. We recognize that there may be an intentional ambiguity in United States policy with respect to these islands. The argument is that it is politically advantageous to keep Peiping guessing and politically necessary to maintain the morale of the Ghinese Nationalists and to placate their extreme American supporters. We believe, nevertheless, that keeping our allies and worldwide public opinion guessing and fearful of our intentions is too great a price to pay for this doubtful political advantage. The strength of the free world ia based upon genuine co-operation and mutual trust among the free nations, not upon our ability to confuse and frighten the Communist bloc or to bolster the illusions of the Chinese Nationalist Government. Surely the proper thing for the Are they the only people It is not stated whether in all Asia who are not f it to go to the that is what Lord Lindsay thinks is most likely their view Another shortcoming of the Prime of the United Nations w i th B r it a in , New Zealand, or Canada we had negotiated before the United States statement, which goes no further than the ANZUS pact, and which commits them and us. I have already pointed out that there has been no consultation with any of our neighbours. The Prime Minister has to do two things. He has, first, to persuade Australians of the necessity to send Australian troops to Malaya, and secondly, to reassure the Malayans and all of our neighbours about the purpose for which they are going. The deterrent effect of sending our troops there is negliof it. gible. The provocative effect is immense. The Prime Minister has not made out a case for the course of action proposed by the Government. able gentleman's time has expired. sonal explanation. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) twice said that I had made statements about the church militant. I remind honourable members that, when I speak from the floor of this chamber, I speak as a member of this honourable House. AlthoughI remain a minister of the Presbyterian Church, a position of which I have never been ashamed, the statements that I make here are my personal statements. would rather be a member of the church militant, with courage and faith in that in which it believes, than crawl in front nf any enemy. listened to the speech of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), I wondered what he would say about a man who was kept in gaol for fourteen weeks without trial Recently, the Cain Lahour Government kept a man in. gaol in Victoria for fourteen weeks without trial. Doubtless, he would have been there for very much longer had he not escaped from Pentridge Gaol. They have not caught up with him yet. That is an example of the sort of thing that can happen in this country under a Labour government. The honourable member read a long passage from an article written by Mr realize that the allegation is a lie. Eor Justice Douglas. I have often thought during the course of my legal career that it would be a fine thing if I could cross examine a judge. But in this case there is no need to cross-examine the judge, because it appears on the face of the judge's statement that if that material had been put before Mr Justice Douglas or any other judge in his own court, he would have said, "" That is hearsay evidence, and I must disregard it completely"". It is absurd for the honourable member for Hindmarsh to rely upon material of such a scrappy and worthless character. I do not hesitate to say that, and I do not withdraw one word The Leader of the Opposition, in tbe course of his speech last night, referred to bringing parties to international disputes to a conference table for the purpose of conciliation. During his scintillations, which went on for so long, I was reminded of another judge, MrJ ustice Darling, the judicial wit. In his Scintilla Juris be told the story of a breach of warranty case. A horse was sold with a warranty that it was peaceable between shafts. In the action for breach of this warranty, evidence was given that the horse pranced, galloped, bolted and eventually broke the shafts. The plaintiff thought he was on a certain winner, but at the conclusion of his case his claim was dismissed because, lo and behold, he I had never proved that it was not peaceable between shafts. A ll he had proved was that he could never get it between shafts. Let the Leader of the Opposition get these people to a peace conference. Is he a man who can get people to a peace conference ? Is he a man of conciliation ? I address those questions particularly to some honourable members of this House. I am reminded of the Shakespearean character who said, "" I can call spirits from the vasty deep "". The instant retort was ""Yes, so can I , and so can any of us. but will they come ? "" I turn to a more serious matter. I refer to the constant besmirching by Communists of the great United States of America and the allegation that that nation is an aggressive nation. That lie should be nailed. One has only to look at the record of the United States to many .years, the Americans adopted the Monroe doctrine. They maintained themselves in what they regarded as a proud isolation. They would have nothing to",80,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out

235,Mr Joske (Balaclava) [9.2],"As Ido with war or warlike operations. They carried that doctrine so far that it was only the tide of events that forced them to enter World WarI . They did not enter World War II . until the attack on I'earl Harbour forced them to do so. They have at all times been a peaceloving nation. They have nodesire for war. Look at the way in which they helped to establish the United Nations. Look at the money they have poured into the United Nations. The United States is the chief supporter of the United Nations, a. body which should be, and in the main is, a body of peace-loving nations. There is no colonialism and no imperialism about the Americans. That is shown by their grant of self-government any effective form of control of nuclear to the Philippines and by the way in which they got rid of the extra-territorial rights in China. They have given, and are continuing to give, enormous sums of money to the communities of Asia so that the people of those communities can raise their standards of living. When the Communists say that the United States is an -aggressive nation, they do so with a view to dividing us from a natural ally and great friend. It is an instance of the truth of what the Prime Minister said in his speech on foreign affairs last week and has said on other occasions, namely, that the Communist doctrine is the doctrine of divide and conquer. What is the record of the Communists iu regard to aggression? Once there were many proud, peaceful and freedom-loving States in eastern Europe. I refer, for instance, to Czechoslovakia and Poland. Now tliose States lie enslaved under the Communist regime. That is the modern imperialism. colonialism. Those in this House who talk about colonialism should realize that the wickedest form of colonialism that exists in the world to-day is that imposed on the magnificent countries of eastern Europe which now lie prostrate at the foot of a conqueror. Look at the kind of aggression that one men, especially in view of the fact that gets from Communist Russia even over the radio. One reads, for instance, that the Government of Iraq is complaining that Radio other atantly inviting the people of Iraq ratification is that the tension in Europe Mr Joske. to rise and overthrow their government. They are being told that the useful schools and hospitals being built in Iraq are being built only to house British and American soldiers. They are being told that the roads which are being built in Iraq are only military roads. That is the kind of aggression that we get from Russian radio stations. That is another example of Russian aggression. If we turn to the United Nations, we see that Russia has time and again declined to agree to universal disarmament except on terms that would leave it with such strength that it could overrun the rest of the world and reduce it to a state of enslavement. The Soviet has refused to agree to weapons. Which is the aggressive nation -the United States, with its magnificent record, or the Soviet? If we turn to Communist China, we see that the war in Korea, the war in Indo-China and the disturbances in the Formosa Strait are examples of Chinese Communist aggression. Even now there is no final settlement in Korea. The eleven American airmen captured by the Chinese Communists are still being detained, and detained on the basis of the myth that China is not bound by the Korean armistice agreement because it was not a belligerent in the Korean war. That is the kind of propaganda that we get from Communist China. The voice of the world, the United Nations, has declared that the detention and imprisonment of those airmen, as well as the detention of other command personnel who wish to be repatriated, is a definite violation of the Korean armistice agreement. Notwithstand that that has been said by the voice That is the modern of the world, the United Nations to which Communist China says it is so eager to belong, those people are still being detained. The honourable member for Hindmarsh referred to something which, according to hearsay evidence, happened in Malaya. What does the honourable member say about the detention of those the United Nations says they should be released ? Moscow and In Europe, the Paris agreements were Russian stations are conratified recently. The result of that -has been greatly reduced. The European -defence organization has been immeasurably strengthened. Consequently, it may be said, and said rightly, that the -danger of further Eussian aggression in Europe no longer exists. In other words, such aggression is no longer practicable. But the position is different in South East Asia, and it is different only for the reason that, so far, the Communists have believed that Seato is only a paper organization. They believe that the treaty will never be carried into effect and, therefore, that they can go ahead with their aggression without fear. In that, they make a very serious error. That treaty represents a real alliance made by determined men, on behalf of determined nations, to preserve liberty and resist aggression. Positive measures are being undertaken to ensure that this alliance will be able to protect liberty and resist aggression. The defenceless countries of Asia look to the members of Seato to carry out their obligations under the treaty. The people of this country and the people of other countries which are parties to the treaty look forward to the provisions of the treaty being carried into effect, so that they will be able to defend themselves. It is a twofold act. It will operate had not spoken for a number of days, as a defence, not only for the members MahometA l i , the Prime Minister of who have signed it, but also for those Pakistan, Sir John Kotelawala, the. defenceless nations who look to the powerPrime Minister of Ceylon, and a number ful nations of the world to ensure that of other Asian leaders had spoken very they themselves may be able to retain strongly against communism.

If you wish to very clear indeed to the Asian people. discuss ideologies come outside "". That They are rightly looking to those ideals, statement concealed the fact that whether and they shall not look in vain. It has been shown by the speeches of from the conference, the fact of his the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and ideology operating throughout Asia and the Minister for External Affairs( Mr within countries such as Pakistan and Casey) that this treaty will be carried Ceylon, had made it one of the great into effect, and that there will then be issues of the conference. strength where strength should be. It is not going to be left open for this country to be invaded, and for our wives we have the Western powers operating and children to find there is a war on with three arms-the diplomatic, the their doorsteps. If there is to be a war, military and the commercial, and that it will be far away from thc shores of governinent-to-government relationships this country. The fact that this treaty are conducted with those arms. The organization will be made strong by what Communist bloc operates with four arms has been done, will have the same effect -the military, the diplomatic, the comas was recently displayed in Europe. It mercial and the ideological. The Soviet will make Communist China realize that it will no longer be able to attain its desire to dominate Asia. After Communist China realizes what it is up against, and what will happen if it attempts further aggression, then will be the time to talk about going to peace conferences. In Europe, since the Paris agreements have been ratified, Eussia has sought to make a peace treaty for ill fated Austria. That shows what happens when the free nations of the world are strong. A similar thing will happen in South-East Asia when the Communists realize that they are up against the real strength of the free world. The conference which recently took place at Bandung was called the Afro-Asian conference, and although that name appears to be regional, the intention seems to have been not to give a regional meaning to the name of the conference, but to emphasize that here was a greatworld conference from which, for the first time, European powers were excluded. Another matter that I should like to note concerning the conference, is the interesting fact that although Chou En-lai Chou En-lai had spoken of his ideology, or whether he had been absent altogether It seems to me that in the world to-day",82,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out
236,Mr Beazley (Eremantle) [9.18],"Uuion is the first power in history to have made the selling of a set of ideas, or values, a dominant arm in its policy. I might define an ideology as a philosophy, a passion, and a plan, and disciplined force of people to bring it into effect. It is a new weapon of people with a set line, clear ideas and explanations-ver y often gross falsifications, but explanations-of everything happening in the world, and is a major weapon in Soviet diplomacy to-day. A Communist can go to an Indian village and state his ideology, and he will win the consent of some of the people to whom he has spoken, because his ideology of class war will seem to some of the people as valid for their own nation as it is for the Soviet Union. But it is not possible for any member of any party in this House, iu whose political platform appears the White Australia policy, to go to an Indian village and preach his policy and expect any person to accept his ideas. So, if it comes to winning the world of Asia with ideas, we have abdicated, and our opponents, the Communist powers, have not. Lenin said that it was necessary for the Eorce. Moreover, one of the great poliCommunist party to take up every tical parties in England was experiencing colonial cause ever to arise in the world. something approaching a political crisis, Not, of course, that the Communists because of one woman and her husband regarded colonial independence as an end coming into a situation where there were in itself-the y did not. But colonial certain grievances, which they knew how independence, as an aspiration of the to exploit. That case was a. striking people, was to be used as a means to an example of the power of the ideological end. Of course the Communists have weapon in the world to-day. sometimes come across a more powerful set of ideas than their own. In 1945, Muso, the Indonesian Communist who East German Communist party in 1950, had been trained in Moscow since "" Wc will win the world; not with atom 1923, was landed, together with 70 bombs, but with something that the inen, in Indonesia. His mission was Americans cannot produce-ou r brains, to turn a nationalist revolt into a our ideas and our doctrines "". I believe Communist revolution. At that stage that it is necessary to recognize in the he encountered an ideology, a set of world to-day, that although Marx was powerful ideas, in Dahr Islam. Ultiabsurdly wrong in most of his forecasts mately, he was arrested and put to death, and that it was necessary for Lenin to and so were his followers. Therefore, it restate the Marx philosophy in order to may be said that at that point the Comtry to conceal the obvious errors that munist ideology was defeated through time had brought to light in Marxism, running up against an ideology locally he had one point which had nothing to stronger than itself. When I was in BurmaI could see that all his material explanations of human the Government of Burma, with its strong behaviour, one striking quality he emphaemphasis on Buddhism and its suggessized-the passion for equality. tion through peace pagodas and so on. Mr Beazley. that peace comes from following the lord Buddha, also repelled, for the time being, the ideology of communism that was being presented in that country. The authority of the Burmese Government, which once did not extend very far from Rangoon, is now real. But the immediate tactic of the Communist party in both Indonesia and Burma :\s to change from a direct frontal assault on Dahr Islam and Buddhism, which had been its policy until late last year, to an attempted penetration by a strategy of indirect approach. It is the Communist, belief that public opinion in any colonial territory can be mobilized by a small number of people with clear ideas, with a philosophy, a passion, a plan and a discipline. I have only to mention one name to make that clear. There was an American nurse named Rosenberg, who married an Indian dentist named Jagan. That man became the Prime Minister of British Guiana, a British colonv in. Latin America. His wife went there in 1945, and by 1953 the British were forced to despatch to the colony two cruisers, a number of regiments of troops and some units of the Royal Air Vishinsky said, to the leaders of the do with his materialist philosophy, in which he was completely correct. After Last year I visited India, and I was very courteously received by trade union leaders of the Congress group of Indian trade unions, of the socialist trade unions of India and of the independent trade unions of India. I was asked to address the members of the trade unions Ln a suburb of Calcutta. The questions that my audience asked me were almost all concerned with the White Australia policy, and. with race relations in South Africa. One should have expected, from one's own knowledge of trade union leaders in this country, that such a group of people would be busy discussing terms and conditions of labour and so on, but that was not so. The very matters that one would have regarded as remote from the experience of those people, were the matters that they discussed. That is, sensitivity to discrimination and what they regard as injustice. That is one of the big factors in the world to-day, and something that we shall ignore at our peril. It has been well said that Asia wants freedom from the white man's colonial control, freedom from the white man's economic control, but above all freedom from the white man's contempt. If we are to be gratified about that, I would say that as far as I could see in Malaya, Burma and India, if the people thought of the white man's contempt, they thought of the White Australia policy. They knew that that policy was the policy of both the left and the right in this counfor profits, whereas he establishes fairly try, and they were critical of what they regarded as a socialist party having a racial policy. As against that, while I was abroad I met Indian students who bad studied in Australian universities. Some of those people told me that there was no White Australia policy. When I asked them where they had got that strange idea, they said, "" Our friends have been students in your country, and we find that Asians are permitted in your restaurants, and are permitted to travel in trains, buses and trams, to sit in the same academic classes as Australians, and to work during the Christmas holidays and receive the same wages as Europeans. Therefore there is no discrimination in Australia, and no White Australia policy."" It would be interesting for honourable members, because we are frequently called upon to point out that there is a critical attitude throughout the world towards the United States, to reflect that just as there is a systematic and deliberate campaign throughout the world to discredit America because it is the only great power that can prevent Bussian world domination, so there is a similar campaign, although on a smaller scale because we do not matter so much, to defame this country. If we are to be too ready to be critical of tlie United States, because of the view being sold throughout the world, it should be remembered that this country also is regarded critically. Those students to whom I referred were surprised at the lack of discrimination in this country, because the White Australia policy has been represented in propaganda throughout Asia as being not an immigration policy but a kind of Jim Crow social discrimination. That was why they were surprised at their reception in Australia. A good deal of nonsense is spoken about imperialism. There is a very fine article by Dr. A. J. .P. Taylor in the last issue of the New Statesman and Nation, which has come into the parliamentary library, in which he revalues the whole question of imperialism. He points out that the thesis that was propounded by a number of the early thinkers on the subject was that the basis of imperialism was a drive clearly that the basis of imperialism is a drive for power. He goes on to state that that is exactly the analysis of imperialism that the Communists will never make, because they are practitioners par excellence of this drive for power, and every crisis in their political structure resolves itself finally into a struggle between the leaders of the two supreme points of power, at one stage the army and Beria. and earlier the army and the secret police in the persons of leaders of the various Soviet secret police systems. Exactly the same thing was true of Nazi Germany, where the possible crises, and the one that did develop in 1944, were crises between the two power points-the leaders of the military and the inner party forces around Hitler. That is why we ought to recognize that in the world to-day there is an older form of imperialgained and maintained by violence, poweris nt which may very well he a softer form nf imperialism. After all, the motives in my mind are much more basic to my iIiinking than the money in my pocket. I!' the purpose of a drive for money is the attainment of power, the basic thing under imperialism is not money but power, and, if there is a state of affairs such as exists in the Soviet Union, there will still be a violent drive for power. Tn the Soviet Shorter Philosophical Dictionary, which was produced in 1941. there appears the following remarkable statement, which is attributed to Lenin, and which is commented upon as being a supreme statement in political thinkingThe dictatorship of the proletariat is power, power gained and maintained by violence, power unlimited by any laws. That is a vital statenient, of the position such a motive with the gravest suspicion.. in the world to-day, because the Soviet Union and the bloc that is lead by the Soviet Union were rightly characterized by Mr Mahomet Ali and Sir John Kotelawala as being the practitioners of a new imperialism, an imperialism of the mind, an ideological imperialism which denies people the right of any other sort of thinking, and which claims to control the mind. I am not standing as an apologist for the history of the West in relation to India or any other country. All of the Western Powers brought to the countries that they dominated poUtical principles which destroyed their own rule. That is to say, they brought into societies, many of which, such as the Mogul empire in India, had had no democratic principles at all, democratic ideas which ultimately militated against the continuance of the rule of imperial power. But in the new form of imperialism there is a total and systematic perversion of education, and even a perversion of science, to rivet permanently on tlie dominated area the values of the ideology of the conqueror. I quoted the words "" the dictatorship of the proletariat"". mean? How do the proletariats go around dictating? They do so by means of a clique governing in their name. The dictatorship of the proletariat is power. Mr Beazley. The governing clique has "" power, power unlimited by any laws "". I think that Asia is extremely interested not so much in us as in our motives. I have never heard anything so profoundly unrealistic as the speech of thebull), during which he spoke as though all Asia was grateful for the Colombo* plan and for the things that have been done. I think the people of Asia know how to interpret goodwill. I am not deriding the Colombo plan, but, I should say that they are interested basically in our motives. What are our motives? Isour motive an attempt to use South-East Asia as a counterpoise to Communist power, a South-East Asia under our leadership, with, us taking the diplomaticinitiative? We may regard that as supremely necessary, but Asia, regardsThe people of Asia may be right or they may be wrong. At the moment, I am only trying to speak of facts. The thing, that those people fear is a polarization of the world into a Communist and an anti-Communist bloc that would lead to an atomic war. I do not think they are at all realistic in their thinking about the Soviet Union or its intentions. They have had a series of shocks in relation to what Communist China has done to its border states, what it has done with Tibet, what it has done with Korea, and' what it has done with Indo-China. I know that in Burma there is a very real fear that China intends to raise the question of the frontier of Burma and China, which was delineated by the British in 1911, but which has never been accepted by any Chinese government, since that time. If the people of Asia think that our only interest is to weld them into our bloc, our diplomacy, in my opinion, has no hope of success. Asia would value an attitude that led them to believe that we accorded them real equality, real care, a willingness to share the good things of our civilization and, What on earth does the term above all, human respect. It is not a question of diplomacy; it is a question of the values that we transmit. able gentleman's time has expired.",84,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out
237,Honourable Member For Mallee ( Mr Turn,,87,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out
238,Mr Speaker,"-Order! The honoram sorry that the honourable member for .Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) did not give us some of his ideas about the statement of thc Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on foreign affairs. The line that he adopted was scarcely that which was followed by bis leader last night. I doubt whether the House has ever waited with greater eagerness than when it waited last night to hear the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). We have heard for some time what the Australian Labour party has thought, about foreign affairs. We had been led to believe that that party had reached some final conclusion, on this question, particularly in relation to South-East Asia. Supporters of the Government had high hopes that last night some constructive and practical suggestion would be placed before the House and the people of Australia in relation to this very difficult problem which could have such disastrous effects on Australia. If communism is to pursue its course of invasion of free countries, as it has in -other parts of Asia, it is only a question of time before Australia will come within the ambit of hostilities. Unfortunately, the House and the people of Australia were badly let down by the Leader of the -Opposition. The only suggestion that he made, and which he repeated ad infinitum, was that we must have a new approach in world affairs, based on the true spirit of the United Nations Charter. The question that follows naturally is this: How is that to be done? Everybody knows that there is an instrument of veto which has been used very often at meetings of tbe United Nations organization. It is easy to express points of view in terms that are vague. I suggest that the speech of the right honourable gentleman was quite illogical from beginning to end. The words that were used by the Leader of the Opposition bear a similarity to that very delightfully coined phrase which has been used so frequently at international conferences-peacefu l coexistence. All of the Russian leaders since the days of Lenin have had a firm belief in the peaceful co-existence of nations, and only recently at Bandung was the phrase bandied around again. and Sir Anthony Eden have used it. men also have used that remarkable phrase. One would think, from the continuous use of it, that we are getting closer to finding a basis for world peace. I am of the opinion that the use of the phrase is so wide only because the formula itself is so vague. It is similar to the expression that was used so frequently last night by the Leader of the Opposition when he spoke about a new approach. I believe that the phrase means nothing at all, but, if it does mean something, it has an entirely different meaning to each person who uses it. In my opinion, the Prime Minister has at least stated the principles upon which co-existence may be established. He has also set out very clearly the objectives of the Government's foreign policy. He referred to two very important principles. The first, to which I shall refer very briefly, was expressed in the following words:We support the Charter of the United Nations, its structure and its procedures. One would think, after listening to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, that there was no reference to that principle by the Prime Minister. The other principle to which I refer, and which I consider to be very important, was stated as follows:We will justif y the co-operation of other nations by ourselves accepting obligations, and doing what is necessary at home to make those obligations pcifoniiable. I shall refer to that statement again later. May I refer again to that thing which I have heard referred to so often as peaceful co-existence. Erom the point of view of the Communist ideology, the term is sufficiently non-commital as not to oppose the doctrine of increasing hostility to any country that is not Communist. In other words, the Communists, in agreeing to peaceful coexistence with, the rest of the world, are not obliged, apparently, to refrain from any subversive tactics that' are calculated to weaken democracy or the rest of the free world. They may carry on, openly or secretly, until the stage is reached at which peaceful co-existence is no longer possible or necessary. They are not prepared to leave the world to peaceful coexistence. It is because of that fact that",87,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out

241,Mr Haworth,"Yes, those gentlewe in Australia find ourselves, as do other great powers, taking stock, as it were, of our defence policy, and at the' same time examining all of those principles that might be useful in bringing about peaceful relations with Communist countries. We are not prepared to give up hope of finding a formula that will be acceptable, it can be said that this Crovernment, by a simple statement of its principles in foreign policy and by pledging Australian aid for the purpose of raising the living standards of those nations that are struggling towards a better way of life, has demonstrated the sincerity of its approach to the cause of world peace. This is one of the greatest of the principles of the Government's foreign policy, and I shall refer to it again later. Thc 'Colombo plan, to which reference has been made this evening, is designed to assist the nations of South-East Asia towards better standards of living. This objective has been pursued by private bodies in many of the other free nations of the world as well as in Australia. I refer particularly to the very fine work that is now done by organizations such as Rotary International which work for rhe common good in an endeavour to engender peaceful relations between the r-oiintries of the world. In pursuing the objectives of our foreign policy, we do not mean to sit back and allow the Communists to push further ahead under cover of the convenient and vague formula of peaceful co-existence. The foreign policy of the Australian Labour party, as it has been enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition, in relation to South-East Asia, with particular reference to Australia's role in that area, can be summed up very well in the phrase, "" Peace at any price"". The free people of the world, and I think particularly of the people of the British Commonwealth the United States, have made great sacrifices in the cause of world peace, to say nothing of the selfrestraint that they have exercised during-the last four or five years. I believe munists that that is not the case. The that those sacrifices and that self-restraint history of Australia during the last five will continue* particularly in .Australia, because we Australians know very well what it is like to be at war and Mr Haworth. we ' know the results of war. I am satisfied that the remaining free countries of South-East Asia will quickly lose their freedom when the Communists believe that the accepted joint policy of the British Commonwealth and the United States is "" peace at any price"", irrespective of what they might do and say to the contrary. I am confident that, great as may be the love for peace among the great democratic nations, they will never support peace at any price. They declared as much when they signed the Manila pact, out of which have come constructive suggestions for the attainment of world peace. We must repeatedly remind the Communists where we in Australia stand. We must make it clear to them that the policy of peace at any price is not supported by the Australian people, although the Opposition members last evening argued that Australians support it. We must remind the Communists that we, like the people of the other free countries of the world, are absolutely opposed to those who believe in the power of intimidation by violence; that we are prepared to stand firm, and if necessary, meet hostile forces with all the might that we possess; and that we will ally ourselves with those countries that pursue the same objectives. To-day, Australia is virtually a part of South-East Asia. Modern science has shrunk the distance between geographical frontiers. It is on these frontiers that the issues of Avar and peace, and of freedom and slavery, hang in a precarious balance. We in Australia are fortunate that there are still independent and free people who stand between us and the Communist-dominated Chinese. Every effort is being made by the Communists to terrorize the small countries that stand in their way. The Communists of Nations and of suggest that Australia will not stand united with the other democratic countries that are signatories of the Manila pact. The statement of the Prime Minister should assure the Comyears also should strengthen this thought. The basic principles underlying the Manila pact, which was signed recently by twelve South-East Asian countries, are based not only on self-interest hut ni so on high ideals. In short, these principles are (1) defence against open armed aggression; (2) defence against subversion; and (3) improvement of economic and social conditions. It is imperative that we help the people of South-East Asia to solve their economic problems. Australia, as a Christian country, has great obligations in that matter. We must help to raise the standards of living of the countries of Asia to the level that exists in Australia. Independence will, never survive in any South-East Asian country that has not a sound economy. We have a responsibility to ensure that the signatories of the Manila pact and the other countries of South-East Asia are insulated against communism, that their independence is safeguarded, and that their economies are bolstered so that they may withstand, the pressure that will be exerted on them by the cold war tactics of the Communists. Unless we are prepared to give this assistance, we shall merely waste our time if we talk about coexistence. The signatories of the Manila pact, under which the stronger nation is prepared to help the weaker countries, have a responsibility to ensure that subversive elements do not prevail during the period of economic rehabilitation in the countries of South-East Asia. Those nations should be pur special concern, because they are our neighbours. The ueople of South-East Asia are likely to suffer first in any further Communist expansion towards Australia. Therefore they need all of our help and consideration. It is just as important that these countries should have national forces capable authority throughout their territory, and it is our duty to ensure that they receive our support. The last place in which we want to defend Australia is Australia itself. We must pull our weight as signatories of the Seato treaty. The sending of troops to Malaya is only one of Australia's obligations under that treaty. In addition, we must provide economic assistance for South-East Asian countries. I believe that, in the main, the people of Malaya will welcome this sort of help. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that we should encourage talks with Bussia and other members of the great United Nations organization. 1 am sure that every honourable member supports the right honourable gentleman's suggestion. No one wants war. No right-thinking person would disagree with the remarks made recently by Sir Winston Churchill, who outlined the fate that would befall the world if an atomic war should occur, and who expressed his great coucern for world peace. We must constantly strive for a pian acceptable to all the nations. It must utilize in the cause of peace the resources that are now devoted to the production of atomic weapons. We have an obligation in this matter, as in the field of medical research, in which it is our duty to find the causes of cancer and a cure for that disease. One of the greatest obligations of Australia and the other free nations of the world is to improve the way of life of the two-thirds of the world's population whose living standards are lower than oui own. The basis of any international talks must be a search for a means by which the stronger nations can help the weaker ones, not only in matters of defence, but also in social and economic development. Unfortunately, in the past, international conferences, particularly in South-East Asia, have failed to find a common formula for a new approach that will enable the free countries of the world to live in peace and harmony. Taken by and large, conferences in relation to Korea, and more recently in relation to Indo-China, have resulted in defeat for the forces of democracy. This is nowhere more notof supporting government able than in recent events in Indo-China. I wish I could believe that the Geneva conference was a success for the democracies. Every conference between the Communist nations and the democracies in the last few years has resulted in the free nations being very much worse off than they were beforehand. We must not be misled into believing that peace can be achieved at the conference table, and consequently into allowing our defence organizations to decline, as we might well be influenced to do by arguments such as those that have been advanced by members of the Opposition in this debate. It is important that all the free countries of South-East Asia strengthen their defences so that they may be safe from aggression. Bargaining can succeed only if we are strong. If , in section of the Labour party being given future, bargaining must be our modus operandi, it is our duty in our own interests to assist the South-East Asian countries to attain strength to defend themselves. Pakistan, which is one of the signatories of the Manila pact, is currently spending SO per cent, of its budget on defence. Obviously this is done at the expense of urgently-needed development schemes. As one member of the Pakistani Government observed recently, so much of the Pakistani budget is devoted to defence because danger stares Pakistan in the face. The Australian Labour party and its went up on this side of the chamber when leader have done a great disservice to the Leader of the Opposition referred Australia by trumpeting Labour's foreign last night to the United States of policy, as they have done in the last two America. It was a most extraordinary days. I ean imagine that the agents prothing that any body bf persons claiming to vocateurs of communism member's time has expired. This debate must be regarded as of great of acquiescence and, to my way of thinkimportance to Australia as a nation on ing, as one honourable member has just account of the issues that it raises. These commented, that was a most disgraceful issues are Australia's future relations exhibition. Does anybody believe that the with the East and with the United States great mass of Australians would dare of America, and the adoption of a policy to sneer and jeer at the United States by means of which we shall be able to which, undoubtedly, has been, and is, a maintain our present position and surbulwark of our security and is one of the vive as a nation in the-Pacific area. The great co-operators for peace to-day? Does tragedy is that few Australians realize anybody believe that any great number of Australia's proximity to the East, and Australians would prefer red China, to the danger of absorption by a new form the United States? Yet, that was a strong of colonialism which is ever moving inference to be drawn when the recogsouthward. The danger to Australia is nition of red China was propagated in considerably accentuated by a real in this chamber last evening. Does anyternal fifth-column activity, which should body believe that recognition of red not be overlooked in a debate such as this. China is necessary, or that advocacy I believe that this point was thoroughly of such action has merit except as a outlined by the Leader of the Opposition psychological persuasion that, after (Dr. Evatt). His speecli is important, all, communism is not so bad? I know because in it he outlined the real reason of no phrase that can be more dangerous for the present break-up of the Australian than the phrase, "" Recognition of red Labour party. The policy that he enunChina"". Is it part of Labour's policy ciated last night has been made possible to sneer at mention of the United States only by the use of bogus .conferences and by the generous use of the bludgeon. The great Labour movement has had no say in that policy. Chance provided him with the opportunity to present it to an unauthorized conference and to have it pushed through without any genuine an opportunity to play a part in that conference. His speech last night was dangerous, and, in my view, it represented fifth column activity at its worse. It did not represent Australian sentiment. Neither did it represent the voice of the masses who comprise the' trade unions of this eountry, or of the masses of those who comprise the Australian Labour party. The right lionorable gentleman, obviously, has hypnotized his followers to a diabolical degree. This House could hardly have failed to note the sneers that form a part of the Labour movement sneers were not repeated when reference was made to red China. Such references were accepted with the greatest degree",88,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out

244,Mr Andrews (Darebin) [9.58],"and to show marked preference for red China? and it is something npon which the people will be called upon to show where they stand. All the indebtedness that we in curred and the gratitude that we owed to the United States under John Curtin's leadership and premiership seem to have just gone by the board. The Leader of tlte Opposition, in proceeding with his criticism of the speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), very carefully outlined all those things that were required to bo done under the United Nations Charterf o r the achievement of peace. In fact, he outlined so many of tbose things that I have no intention of referring to all of them. But one of those requirements which he mentioned was that we should seek a solution to any action that tended to break the peace by negotiating, by relying upon inquiry and by the use of arbitration. He referred also to a number of other courses of that nature, which he quoted from the charter. All of those things were approved .by those lionorable members who purport to follow him. of them has thought it proper that those rules might have been applied to the dispute which the right honourable gentleman has caused in the Labour party. Neither he nor his followers seem to know anything about those principles at all where that dispute is concerned. Undoubtedly the bludgeon was used; constituted authority was overthrown and rules of tbe party, which have been evolved at conference after conference, were simply scattered to the four winds. After intrigue and after threats, the minority of members of the party, who now comprise either the federal executive, or the federal conference of the movement, met and imposed their w ill on the weaklings in the movement. I say that without reservation. Now, f e a r f u l of further defections, they have, in a cowardly way, determined to defer taking similar action in New South Wales and Queensland unti l the first trench in Victoria has been consolidated. Although the offence committed in New South Wales was even greater than that which was committed in Victoria, none of the rules which the right honourable gentleman stated so majestically last night That is a dreadful thought; has been, applied to the dispute with which he has been intimately associated. Nor has any attempt been made at conciliation in the matter. In q u i r y was refused, negotiation rejected, and dictation took the place of arbitration. When we hear so much about these principles from the right honourable gentleman in a debate in this House on foreign affairs, it is relevant to examine the character of the individual who expounds them in this House in order to test the validity of his statements. Sanctions and penalties were inflicted willy nilly . One of his loyal lieutenants, the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) has repeatedly stated at places at which I have been present, "" AlthoughI do not agree with your point of view, I shall fight for your right to express it "" . Although he made that statement profoundly, he always made it on occasions when the Communists were affected. But, lately, he has not been prepared to apply that principle in respect of ordinary members of the Labour party. Followers of the Leader of the Opposition, who It is most signincant that none make so much of those principles, do not seem to be prepared to apply them except to the advantage of Communists hi this country. W h y were all these things done? The answer is simple. The chief stooge of the Leader of the Opposition, who is a gentleman by the name of Chamberlain, from Western Australia, decided that there was an unacceptable state of mind in Victoria. That was the offence committed by those who differed from the Leader of the Opposition. What was that unacceptable state of mind ? All that I am saying is relevant to a discussion of the foreign policy that has been enunciated by the Government. The Australian Labour party groups were eliminating communism and freeing the Australian economy of them and were thus helping in the defence of this country. That was precisely the offence that was committed by the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party. Members of that branch were determined that the Communists should be removed from key positions in the trade unions. Therefore, in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition, it was essential that the Australian Labour party groups should be suppressed. That is a pattern of what is taking place in the Labour movement in this country to-day. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition has the temerity to expound the principles of the United Nations to which I have referred, while he is still engaged in carrying out the executions that he designed. He will do anything to remove legitimate opposition to the views he holds in order to graft them on to the Labour party at all costs. His statements do not represent the mind of the masses of Labour people in Australia. There can be no resurgence of the Labour movement until the Asian position ultimately reveals itself. At that stage, the Labour party will realize what it has now let itself in for. Ultimately, that day must come. When it does, the position in Asia will alert the Australian people to the dangers that, undoubtedly, are being aggravated by a number of followers of the Leader of the Opposition. I have only pity for his weak camp followers who desire to be loyal to Australia, but have fallen for his bluff and bludgeoning and have been influenced by fear which has turned them into political termites. Let us look at the man who has enunciated this policy. When he stepped down from the High Court Cameron) -Order! I remind the honorable member that we are dealing with the subject of foreign affairs. remarks to that subject. I submit that there are two sides to foreign affairs make a desert, and call it peace. The policy. There is the internal side as kind of desert he desires to establish i well as the external side. I am relating undoubtedly a spiritual desert, because my remarks to the internal side. I am that is the very basis of communism itself. dealing with fifth column activity in How some of his supporters can sit with this country through which support is him, and justify their position, completely being given to external influenceswhich mystifies me. Surely this spiritual side are to-day a grave worry to Australia. of life, that which is the antithesis of When the Leader of the Opposition communism, means much more than a stepped down from the High Court to political seat, even if that was to bp participate in politics, many people asked endangered by their action. wlyy he did so. There are not many persons who now ask for an explanation subtle the right honourable member for of that fact, because the explanation Barton was in the course of his remarks. seems to be perfectly obvious. In my He did not say one word about colonialview, he has revealed his reason for taking ism, or imperialism, which was a common such action. Whilst the right honourable expression at one time in a debate of this gentleman has always claimed to be tbe champion of civil rights, he has acted in that role only in instances in which the Communists have been concerned. I refer to the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, his defence of Communists in the trade unions, the breaking up of the Australian Labour party industrial groups, and his participation in the Petrov affair in which his object was simply to discredit Petrov. When members of his own party expressed different points of view he indulged in foul propaganda with the object of representing patriotism as sectarianism. He has condoned execution without trial, or arbitration, or the holding of conferences to consider the views of those who disagreed with him. Now, we come to his pet baby, the subject of foreign affairs. On this issue he has wrecked the Labour party. In doing so, he has disregarded all history. He advocates settlement of disputes by peaceful means, by negotiation, inquiry or arbitration. In my estimation he desires to arbitrate between the robber and the robbed after the victim has heen robbed. He would leave the small nations in Asia to their fate. He would wait until they have been raped and then negotiate for peace. The ancients had a sound saying "" They make a desert and call it 'peace "".

248,Mr Andeews,"Yes, sir. He wouldkind. It is true that European colos ialism in respect of Asia is dead. Thr attempt of the French to preserve their place in Indo-China was simply an anachronism. The Geneva conference indicated that Northern Indo-China was the victim of international communism, the new colonialism, the new imperialism, which takes the place of the old colonialism and imperialism. So the learned right honourable member for .Barton says nothing about colonialism. He very conveniently drops colonialism from his speech. Instead, he prefers to refer derogatorily to America, and disregards the natural attraction of Australia to this new colonialism. The right honourable member does not point out to the House that Australia sells to Asia about Â£60,000,000 worth of wool annually, which is of considerable importance to a new colonialism. He has nothing to say about uranium finds in Australia in their relation to an Asian power. He does not speak of Australia as a potential base for America, or point out that if Australia is eliminated, America could be pushed back to Pearl -Harbour. None of those matters has engaged his attention at all, because he does not look at the new colonialism, thnew imperialism, on the continent of Asia. So Australia is something which is to be completely brushed aside in his consideration of this important subject. Instead, he speaks of a good neighbour policy when, quite positively, neither Australia nor America has any designs in Asia whatsoever. But he would leave the small nationals to an obvious fate able member's time has expired. not infrequently happens in this House, very doubtful whether the Government of the "" whips"" find themselves getting to the last-named country is in a position to their feet when nobody else has a particuresist the white-anting process which the lar desire to do so. That is the role which, Chinese Communists have developed frankly, I am fulfilling at the present there. That, surely, is the crux of the time. I have some apologies to make position confronting this country. We about it, too, because my views on foreign are menaced by a very great force of affairs are very simple, and I am afraid arms, and steps must be taken by those that I have expounded them to the House, responsible for the policies of this counfor what they are worth, on previous try to meet that situation. occasions. ThoughI am interested in, and have a to this matter in ihe debate this evening. certain affection for, some of our Asian On both sides of the House, I have heard neighbours, more particularly those who most sincere, earnest and honest attempts B -[12 ] stood by us loyally and sent .troops to help us in our time iof /trouble, .1 frankly admit that my main concern is not the welfare or otherwise of the people of Asia but the welfare of this country. It is against that background that I always see the problems that confront us, and the policies which we have to undertake. I suppose 'that no country finds itself in greater peril than we in Australia find ourselves at the present time. Reference has been .made to Asia and China., and I should like to enlarge briefly on that subject for a few minutes. The Communist Chinese army to-day is in the vicinity of 1,500,000 trained frontline men, nearly all of whom have had battle experience. The Communists are inducting men into the army, and discharging them at the rate of approximately 100,000 men a month. Therefore, it is quite obvious, as all honourable members must agree, that in less than eighteen months from now, the Chinese Communists will have an army of approximately 3,000,000 men. It will be one of the greatest armies that the world has seen, and certainly the most numerous of modern times. I ask myself why does any country commit itself to a programme of that sort. I put that question to the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron). Such a force is clearly a part of a pattern of world conquest. We have seen, in the post-war years, this mighty force come down into South-East Asia, through Indo-China, menacing Malaya, which some honourable members opposite and Burma, and already exceedingly active in Indonesia; so much so that it is I have heard two methods of approach",93,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out
249,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honorwould cheerfully give up, menacing Siam",94,Cameron Th E Kapitalthey Accepted Communism Out
250,Mr Gtjllett (Henty) [10.18],"A sto meet this problem, to explain it to the people of Australia, and to prepare them for what they might very well have to face in the protection of their own country. We have also heard some honorahle members who, I can only say, have put the Communist point of view in this chamber. I make no apology for using that harsh phrase, and I refer particularly to the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), and the honourable member for Hindmarsh. The argument which has been used by Communists has been advanced by those three honourable members. I can forgive the honourable member for Hindmarsh much, because clearly he knows little. He suffers from a complete ignorance of any understanding of the affairs of Asia. I have never in all my life heard such utter tripe as the honourable member has spoken to-night. As for the right honourable member for Barton, one expects no better. One of his erstwhile followers has clearly pointed out, that the whole of his history as Minister for External Affairs and subsequently has been one of championship and apology for Communist forces which threaten us. He has never failed to advance the Communist party line. He has never failed to attack what he calls British imperialism, American colonialism, and the like. I merely want to draw attention to that, because it is to me a terrible thing that a political party which represents, or once represented, so large a proportion of the Australian people and which ought, above all, to have the welfare of this country at heart, can express views of that sort. I do not believe that they are sincere for one moment. I find it dreadful to hear the honourable great deal of respect for him. He has member for Lalor, himself a man who knows something of war and the demands of defence, speak of sending Australian troops to be slaughtered in defence of British imperialism in Malaya. I do not think the honourable member himself believes that to be true for one moment. There is not one word of truth in it. I do not pose as an authority on the subject of Asia, but I have spent some years of my life in Asian countries, not as a deleMr Gullett. gate of governments or as a very privileged person, but as a very under-privileged person, if you like, because I was a soldier, and one does see, from that more lowly vantage point, things which more important people do not see. I believe that the Asian peopleI except only the Russians and the Japanese from this category-ca n thank western civilization for nearly everything which they enjoy to-day, which they value, and which is worthwhile. Any pretence to democracy which they have has come from Britain largely, from Holland in no small part, from France to a lesser degree, and from the United States in respect of the Philippines. Those are the facts, yet some honourable members have so little knowledge of the matter, and such lack of principle, that they will mouth the falsehoods to which we have listened. Who are the imperialists in the world to-day? Who have overrun countries? Who exploit coolie labour in the most scandalous way to carry packs for their armies? The honourable member for Hindmarsh knows the answer as well as I do. It is the imperialist Chinese forces. Millions of coolies are carrying stuff for the Chinese armies. There is a pattern of world conquest in that part of the world to-day which is as great and as terrible as . was that of Genghis Khan and Temujin in the past. I should have liked to hear from the Government a little about the way in which this very considerable force will be raised, if , indeed, it has to be raised. Two divisions, I think, were mentioned. I must say that it gave me great pleasure to hear the speech of the honourable member for Ballarat. I have many differences politically with him, but still I have a risen in his place -and in forthright language has given the House and the nation, as he should, the fruits of his convictions and experiences, instead of repeating some of the twaddle with which fellow travellers like Dr. Burton have filled those who still sit behind the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Ballarat did draw attention to one matter, and quite rightly so. He considered that nr>t, enough has been done to condition the people of this country to the gravity of their dauger, and to the necessity possibly for tliem to make very great efforts for their own salvation. I always consider foreign affairs in relation to national self-interest, and I make no apology whatsoever for doing so. It is bound up with defence, and I say now, as I have said before, that the Governnient, if it believes that great defence efforts may.be needed, and I gather from the statement by the Prime Minister that such is his opinion, should also have been expounding to the people the peril in which we lie, and the necessity for taking positive steps for our own defence. When I speak of defence, I immediately realize the impracticability and the undesirability of defending Australia policy, of England, to which we look for so much, has always been wherever possible,to fight its wars on foreign soil. England has not been defended in England except when it has been defeated, as you, Mr Speaker, know. England has defended itself on the continent of Europe, and we shall have to defend ourselves, if necessary, probably on the continent of Asia. Therefore, the government, wisely and courageously, is committing Australia, in our own defence and in certain circumstances, to provide a force bearing some relation to the threat to us and to our capacity to exert ourselves. there are honourable members opposite who are completely opposed to any form of defence, so responsive are they to red idoas. members honestly confuse communism, the rise of radical nationalism in Asia, with .perfectly legitimate socialist ideals such as many hold in this country. There is no connection whatever between those rabid nationalist movements and what, some honourable gentlemen understand to be legitimate political aims in this country.
