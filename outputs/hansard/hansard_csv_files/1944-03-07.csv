He was defeated at the general election in 1922, but was again elected for the same division at the general elections from 1925 to 1937 inclusive, during which period he held the offices of Chairman of Committees from the 17th. February, 1932, to the 7th August, 1934, and Speaker of the House of Representatives from the 23rd October, 1934, to the 19th November, 1940. He was a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the operations of the'Apple and Pear Marketing Board in 1941. The order of Knight Commander of Saint Michael and Saint George was conferred on him in 1941. At the expiration of the Sixteenth Parliament in September, 1943, he did not seek re-election. great courage and determination, we also knew him to possess a kindly and gentle nature. His outlook was wide and embracing, and his service to his country unselfish and devoted. His occupancy of the office of Speaker of this House for a period of six years was marked hy a wide knowledge and just interpretation of the Standing Orders, a strict sense of impartiality, and a poise and dignity which enhanced the prestige of Parliament. man of courage. This was exemplified, not only in his political life, but also in the. gallant service which he rendered to Tuesday, 7. March, 1944. 1 SIR GEORGE BELL. 1 The late Sir George Bell held the confiWhilst Sir George Bell was a man of I have said that Sir George Bell was a",8,Appropriation Act No 2 1043 4 4 No 22 Of 1944

2,Mr Ctjutin (Fremantle,"Primehis country as a soldier. He served with distinction in the .South African War, holding the rank of captain, being mentioned in despatches and receiving the award of the Distinguished Service Order; also throughout the Great War from 1914 to 1919 in Gallipoli, Egypt and Sinai, as well as with tlie Camel Corps in Palestine. He was awarded the Cross of Saint Michael and Saint George for distinguished services in the field in June, 1917, including participation in the capture of Jerusalem. His promotion to the rank of lieutenantcolonel was gained, together with a mention in despatches, in June, 1917. After the conclusion of the war, Colonel Bell continued his active interest in the Army, being appointed on the 1st July, 1920, to the command of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, which command he relinquished in June, 1927. I pay tribute to his sterling character, as well as to his outstanding work as a soldier and a legislator. The knowledge of the high esteem and regard in which he was held by his fellow men will, I ti;ust, in some measure comfort his proudly sorrowing family. Those of us who sat in this House under the Speakership of Sir George Bell will remember him, not only with affection, but also with infinite respect. .He' brought to that office the quality of gentleness, yet at the same time exerted a species of intangible discipline which not only contributed to the dignity of the Parliament but, indeed, was also a reflection of his own demeanour towards it. As a citizen, he rendered loyal and devoted service to his country. As a soldier he fought with great gallantry and exhibited exceptional gifts of leadership. I pay tribute to a man who deserved well of the people whom he sought to serve. As a mark of appreciation of his distinguished services to the Commonwealth, tlie deceased gentleman was accorded a State funeral. I move That this House records its sincere regret at the death of the Honourable Sir George John Bell, KCMG., D.S.O.,'V.D., a former member of tlie House of Representatives for the Division George Bell himself is no longer with us. of Darwin and Speaker of the House, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. the Opposition) -The Opposition supports, with very great regret, the motion submitted by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin). The right honourable gentleman has spoken of our late friend, George Bell, in such just terms that I hesitate to add very much to what he has said, because to add something might be to subtract something. M'ost of us in this House to-day, and all of us who were in the previous Parliament, knew George Bell very well indeed. To know him was tp have a sincere and a profound affection for him. He seemed to me to have all the great, simple qualities of a good man. He was not a complicated man, but saw things clearly and, I believe, saw them whole. What he believed in, he spoke for with unhesitating honesty. He liked good things: He liked to hear good speeches, and to read the best that had been written in the history of politics and, indeed, in the history of our race. Throughout it all, he had a simple directness and courage which, I believe, everybody must admire to the full-grea t physical courage, great moral courage, and a sort of rugged honesty which, one can well understand, commended him for so long to the people whom he represented. As Speaker of this House for a period of six years, Sir George Bell could clearly count on implicit obedience from all sides, not merely because he was Speaker, but also I venture to believe, because he was George Bell. He was a man who did not rush to conclusions, but gave his judgments with calmness and conspicuous fairness. Even though he might overrule or call one to order, one was convinced that he was discharging his duty in the most attractive and sincere way. He was a great success in the chair and, I consider, in all his public undertakings. There have been few men, if there have been any, in politics in modern times, who have exhibited a clearer patriotism in every thought, and in every act. He set a great example; and our regret on this occasion is that we must speak about that example as something derived from the past, and that Mi"".

3,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Leade r ofreverently and sympathetically, associate themselves with the motion. For my own part I feel that I have lost an intimate and dear friend. Sir George Bell was one of the first men I knew, apart from my Queensland friends, when I first came to Canberra, and I grew to like him immensely. In fact, to know him was to esteem him. He was a candid, forthright, trustworthy and honourable gentleman. He was loyalty personified, as far as the party that I was privileged to lead was concerned. His counsel was always wise, and his decisions always firm. His name must be added to the list of distinguished Australians who have served their country on the battlefields against our enemies and in the legislative halls of the nation. Australia is the poorer by his passing. We are consoled, however, by the fact that he has left a memory and an example that we can cherish and always honour. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) -It is a melancholy circumstance that during' the life of the present ' Parliament, which is only now in its second period of the opening session, the deaths have occurred of two former members for DarwinMr Whitsitt and Sir George Bell. I knew them both very well indeed. Throughout the years of my childhood, Mr Whitsitt was one of my nearest neighbours, and I think it true to say that even then, while he was still young and active, he was something more to all of us than merely a familiar neighbour and friend. He was already something of a legend, because of his great gift of friendship and his all-embracing charity. Sir George BellI knew much later, but for 25 years he was a very dear friend of myself and my husband. I know that I speak for every one in the district I represent, and particularly those who live in Burnie, when I say that they were very proud of the man who came out from among them, and who at this very hour is being taken to his grave. I know so well the road along which they are passing. I have traversed it so often in years that have gone, sometimes on a happy excursion, sometimes about"" my ordinary business, and sometimes on melancholy pilgrimages such as that to-day. The mourners will turn off to the right just outside the town and go down to the little cemetery. 1 wish that I were with them to-day to join in that last gesture, by all his friends and neighbours, of respect and admiration for a truly great man. He had many qualities of greatness. He had great courage, as has already been said, and great loyalty. He was a very true and admirable husband and father. He was a great servant of the Australian people, but I think that there was one quality above all others that marked him out, that of personal rectitude. I never knew a man who carried with him so much of the suggestion of wearing a shining armour of stainless integrity. It was inescapable and most remarkable, and the more remarkable because there was nothing flamboyant or even spectacular in his character. Throughout the quarter of a century for which he was before the public, never once did the breath of suspicion or scandal touch his name. The men of his district took the words of Sir George Bell as the standard of truth-telling. In this House, although at times many may have questioned his judgment, no one for a moment suspected his motives. I regret his passing more deeply than I can say. To his widow I have no words to express my .sympathy. Those of us who have tasted the bitter waters that she must now quaff can only stand aside in silence, but I hope that, in future, all that has passed in this place to-day may serve to stir some happy memory for her, pnd to comfort her with the knowledge' that in this Parliament, where he laboured so long, he was deeply and greatly revered. ciate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and other speakers. Sir George Bell had a likable personality and was a man of outstanding character. Full of human understanding, he always respected the views of his opponents, as be. expected his opponents to respect his opinions, which I am sure they did. He had decided views on most subjects, but he was honourable in all of -his dealings. He was a great Australian.

Works Council, acting through the Coordinator-General of Works, Sir Harry Brown, in consultation with the State authorities, through the State Coordinators, has asked various governmental and semi-governmental bodies to submit programmes of works of an urgent and important character that can be undertaken according to the material and labour available immediately the war ends.

At a later point of the bill tbe committee of this House took away from the jurisdiction of a production committee the right to refer direct to the local industrial authority an industrial dispute arising at a particular mine. That amendment was moved by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). This amendment is purely consequential upon what the committee has already done. T take this opportunity to answer the question asked a few minutes ago by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr When the bill was previously before this Menzies). I gave consideration to his suggestion of a general clause providing for compensation, and reached the conclusion that the present provisions in relation to compensation were sufficiently comprehensive to cover every reasonable possibility. which is found to be not provided for, I take it that the Attorney-General will take into consideration my suggested amendment? the view of my advisers, was that the present provisions were sufficient. However, should a situation arise which shows that not to be so, we would be prepared to give effect to the view expressed by the right honourable gentleman. suffer loss by reason of this legislation, the Government would see that he was justly compensated? the introduction of a system of control, the owner of a mine may sustain loss or damage. We amended loss or damage to include loss of profits, and we think that the wording now covers every possible head of loss or damage which may ensue as the result of the system of control. When the bill was previously before the committee, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) made a point in relation to loss due to negligence of the commissioner. We have again looked at that matter. If it could be shown that, through a negligent syswould be covered. words "" by reason of the control exercised in pursuance of any order "". cisely the same,but it is intended to cover loss through negligence and in our opinion it does. On the question of compensation, the bill has a just provision, first, that if through control the owner suffers loss, he is compensated, but equally if as the result of the system of control and for that reason alone additional profits ensue, those profits are taken into charge. cqmmittee, clause 22 referred to excess profits arising "" by reason of anything done"" in pursuance of the order made under section 21. I emphasize the word "" done"" in that clause. Clause 23 employed the same words, but it was amended so that different words are now used. This clause now refers to excess profits ""by reason of the control exercised "", and the point I make is that if it comes to a question of construction the court will assume that because different words are used, they are not intended to cover the same thing. Therefore, I submit that we should put the bill in order by having the same words in clause 22 as now appear in clause 23. in the meaning, the wider meaning will be given to clause 22 because it is the owner wider phrase; and therefore the compensation payable to the owner of a mine will be broadened. However, in our view, there is no difference. regret that further consideration was not given to the Senate's amendment before the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) indicated his willingness to accept it. The primary object of this measure is to try to streamline the method of arbitration by enabling disputes to be brought as quickly as possible before a tribunal. A production committee, upon which the management has representation, may have considered a dispute and may have arrived at a deadlock.

Evatt) and make some reference to the circumstances that led up to its introduction. In October, 1942, the right honourable the Attorney-General introduced a bill to amend the Constitution. This bill sought to clothe the Parliament with f u l l power to make laws on all matters which in the declared opinion of .the Parliament would tend to achieve economic security: and to give effect to the post-war reconstruction policy of the Government; to the guarantees of the Atlantic Charter; and without limiting its general powers, to legislate on a very wide range of enumerated matters, including employment, the production and manufacture of goods, the supply of goods and services and the establishment and development of industries; and provided that the Parliament should have f u l l power over all these matters, notwithstanding anything elsewhere in the Constitution of the Commonwealth or in the Constitution of any State. Eor reasons which seemed good to it , but to which I need not refer now, the Government allowed the debate on the bill to lapse, and a few weeks later the Prime Minister invited the Premiers and the Opposition leaders of the six States tc a convention to meet the representatives of the Government and of the Opposition-her e I quote the Prime Minister's own words:. . . to discuss proposals made with the object of giving the Parliament sufficient legal authority in relation to the great problems of post-war reconstruction. The Convention had before it a bill circulated by the Attorney-General and embodying the amendments which the Government deemed necessary to give effect to its post-war reconThisb ill differed substantially from the measure which he had introduced in this House. There was, as might have been expected, diversity of opinion both as to the need for constitutional amendments and the extent to which these should go. Broadly speaking, the representatives of the Opposition in this Parliament took the view that a referendum in time of war would inevitably distract the attention of the people from vitally important war work, and ought to be postponed until after the cessation of hostilities. The then Leader of the Opposition, the right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) moved to that effect, which was supported by all the representatives of the Federal Opposition, and by at least one of the representatives from each of the States. I pointed out in my speech on that motion that while I was very strongly of opinion that the Constitution needed radical amendment, I was opposed to taking a referendum in war-time. I reminded the convention that I had OD no fewer than four occasions-in 1911, 1913, 1915 and 1919-pilote d bills for the amendment of the Constitution through the House, and had submitted three of them to the people; and I said that, although none had been approved, in both",22,Standing Order Doubt On These Points Should Be
89,Mr Hughes ( N O R T H Sydney) [8.0].,"1913 and 1919 the proposed laws had been rejected by the narrowest of majorities-les s than one-half of 1 per cent.; in round figures, hy less than 9,000 votes in a 2,000,000 poll-whic h showed that tli ere was a very strong body of public opinion in favour of amendment of the Constitution on the lines then submitted to the people. All these proposed amendments included full powers over trade and commerce, corporations, trusts, combines and monopolies and industrial matters. I went on to say that my attitude to referendums in war-time was not new; that, when in 1915, as Attorney-General in a Labour government, I had piloted bills amending the Constitution through the Parliament, I had invited the Premiers of the States to a conference and sought their advice and aid . to avoid referring the proposed laws to the people, and that the Premiers, after discussing the matter at length, had agreed to refer the powers sought in these bills to the Commonwealth Parliament under section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution. Although they had not honoured their agreement, I still thought this was the best course to be pursued, and I commended it to the Government. Subsequently, as honourable members know, Mr Cosgrove, Premier of Tasmania, moved a motion to that effect, and the.Prime Minister, being satisfied that a majority of the members of the convention were opposed to taking a referendum, agreed to accept it, subject to certain conditions, and the convention unanimously approved. Speaking to the question at this stage, I said that I was glad that the Prime Minister had adopted the principles set out in Mr Cosgrove's amendment, and I added that full power over trade and commerce, corporations and industrial matters was essential if the Commonwealth were to deal effectively with postwar problems. It might be that further powers were necessary; if so, the Government ought to state plainly what it wanted. After discussion, Mr Dunstan, Premier of Victoria, moved thatThe convention i8 of opinion that adequate having discussed the bill, approved its powers to make laws in relation to post-war reconstruction should be conferred on the Commonwealth; that it is undesirable that permanent alteration of the Constitution should be effected at this critical stage of the country's history; that for this reason legislative power in relation to suitable additional matters in relation to post-war reconstruction should be referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliaments of the States under section 51, placitum xxxvii. Such reference to be for a period of not less than five or more than seven years from the cessation of hostilities and should not be revoked during that period. At the end of tlie period or at an earlier date a referendum should be held to secure the approval of the electors to the alteration of the Constitution on a permanent basis. Mr Dunstan's motion was carried unanimously. I invite the attention of the House and the country to the terms of this resolution, and to the fact that it was carried unanimously. The full weight of this most representative convention was behind it. All parties in all States and in the Commonwealth supported the grant of additional powers. A committee was appointed to draft a bill referring the necessary powers to the Commonwealth, and this bill, after approval by the convention, was to be submitted to the various State legislatures. The committee, which was composed of the Premiers of the six States, the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) and myself, met forthwith, and after discussion extending over some days, unanimously agreed to a bill for submission to the State Parliaments providing for a reference of powers under section 51. On the 2nd December, it reported to the convention that the Premiers had agreed that each of them would do his utmost to secure the passage of the bill into law as early as possible. The committee recommended the convention to approve the bill-that is, the bill now before the House. It is necessary to remind the House and the country that this is not the Attorney-General's bill; it is a bill drafted by a committee of the convention, and unanimously approved by the convention, on which each State was represented by its Premier and the Leader of its parliamentary Opposition, besides being representative of the Government and Opposition parties of this Parliament. A motion to that effect was made by the Attorney-General and seconded by myself. The Convention, submission to the State Parliaments. What happened subsequently is common knowledge. Two States-Ne w South Wales and Queensland-mad e the grant without qualification of any kind. One, Victoria, granted the powers subject to the other States doing so. Two, South Australia and Western Australia, made the grant with modifications more or less substantial. The Legislative Council of Tasmania, alone among all the legislative bodies in the Commonwealth, refused to make any grant of additional powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. Because of this the powers, which in December, 1942, the Premier and Leader of the Opposition of every State, and the representatives of the Government and the Opposition in this Parliament, agreed that the Commonwealth ought to possess in order to deal effectively with post-war nature of which we can only speculate, problems, have not been granted. The rejection of the grant of these powers by the Legislative Council of Tasmania does not make them less necessary now. It is true, of course, that they cannot be conferred upon the Parliament without the approval of the people at a referendum, but leaving this point on one side for the moment, let me say that I believe that additional powers are essenpeople. There ought to be vested in the tial if the Parliament is to deal adequately with post-war problems. It has been contended that additional powers are not necessary because, under its defence, external affairs, appropriathat their welfare may be assured, the tion and other powers, the Commonwealth has ample authority to deal with all the problems that will arise on the cessation of hostilities. IfI am asked if that be so, I say frankly that I do not know; and I add that no one else knows. There is no doubt that while the war lasts this legislature has for all practical purposes ample powers to do all that is necessary, but there is doubt whether the existing powers of the Commonwealth will be sufficient to meet the needs of the nation when the war ends. In time of war the defence power must, in the very nature of things, be adequate to enable the Commonwealth to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure the safety of the country, but when the war ends the power that, now covers the heavens may shrink until it becomes no bigger than a man's hand. Mr Hughes. The right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) expressed the opinion very forcibly that after the cessation of hostilities the powers of the Commonwealth jurisdiction would be adequate to deal with the problems arising out of the war; that what had been done under the defence power in time of war could be undone under the same power in time of peace. He may be right; but neither he nor any other man can be positive on that point. The right honourable member told us about the legislative ambit of the Commonwealth under its powers for external affairs, appropriation, borrowing, and taxation. No doubt, as he says, these are great powers; but no one is able to tell us to what degree they can be used to deal with post-war problems, upon the but which in their magnitude and complexity, and, above all, in their urgency, are likely to dwarf anything with which we have had to grapple hitherto. We ought to have full power to deal with them effectively, and that power ought to be expressed in the Constitution. I put the matter this way: This is a war for democracy; that is to say, for government of the people, by the people, for the people full power to protect their interests and promote their welfare. They ought not to be fobbed off by saying that, whilst certain measures are desirable in order legislative competency of this Parliament to deal with them is dependent upon a decision of the High Court. Surely the people of this country have the right to know what their powers are. There ought not to be anything^ that is necessary to be done in their interests that cannot be done. Just as there is nothing that the Commonwealth cannot do to ensure the safety of the country in time of war, so, in time of peace, there should be no limits to the power of the Commonwealth to deal with the problems created by the war. I say now, as I said at the convention, that I am opposed to the taking of a referendum in time of war, but I wish to make my position quite clear. Although that has always been my view I have, nevertheless, been in favour of widening tlie powers of this Parliament so that it shall have ample jurisdiction in respect of all national matters. question my attitude on that point. I said* just now that, in 1915, in order to avoid the taking of a referendum I had sought a grant of powers from the States. vention I advocated recourse to that expedient at the present time. However, a grant of powers has not been made, and the position remains much as it was before the convention, excepting that, as I have reminded the House, the Premier of every State as well as every State Leader of the Opposition and representatives of both parties in this House, decided definitely, and without unambiguity, that the ambit of the Commonwealth jurisdiction ought to be widened, at least by the granting of the additional powers set out in the bill. Whatever may be my opinion as to the holding of a referendum in time of war-and I have already made myself clear on that point -the Leader of the Opposition tells us that there is to be a referendum. There can be no doubt about it ; the state of parties in this House makes a referendum inevitable. And, therefore, I ask what attitude ought the members of this House to take in regard to the position which has am opposed to a referendum in time of been created? During the debate in the convention the Attorney-General deprecated a party political approach to this matter. The right honourable member for Kooyong has told us that he also has said the same thing at different times. It has been the invariable practice of men when in office to seek the co-operation of all parties, and to urge members to approach national questions from a non-party standpoint, notwithstanding that when they were in Opposition they had said something quite different. I have had a chastening experience in this connection. It fell to my lot, as a Minisparing the draft bill, in that whilst the ter in a Labour government in 1911, and in 1913, to introduce into the Parliament measures providing for an alteration of the Constitution to give to the Commonwealth Parliament wide powers over trade and commerce, industrial matters, and trusts, combines and monopolies. On each of those occasions, members of tlie then Opposition opposed 'those measures, although when in office they had made it abundantly clear that they believed that additional powers ought No one will to be granted to the Commonwealth. Later, the wheel having again turned, it fell to my lot, as Attorney^General in a non-Labour government, to introduce similar proposals. I found then that That is why at the conthose members of the Parliament who on the first two occasions had covered the proposals with eulogies, on the later occasion smothered them with execrations. The Leader of the Opposition is opposed to the holding of a referendum in time of war when, he says, the people are completely preoccupied with war matters, making it impossible for them to approach these subjects on their merits, or to give to them that calm, dispassionate judgment that their importance deserves. It is for that reason thai I have always been opposed to the taking of a referendum in time of war. But as there is to be a referendum, we have to decide what we are going to do about it. Are we to follow the bad example of previous Parliaments, and confuse the electors by indulging in partisan catch-cries, or are we to give to them wise counsel, so that they may consider the proposals or their merits? I have said plainly that i war; 1 have also said just as plainly that I believe that these powers should be vested in the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General will remember thai when speaking at the convention I expressed regret that wider powers had not been sought; but at the convention there was a spirit of give-and-take, with the result that the measure which emanated from it was a compromise. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that the compromise was arrived al largely because the States were at a disadvantage when the committee was preCommonwealth had at its beck and call a retinue of experts, the Premiers of the States were thrown back on their own resources. That was hot so. I recall vividly the debates that took place when the drafting committee was in session. At times some of its members infuriated me; the Premiers of certain States were most obstinate, and would not see the point in my argument. Naturally, I regarded them as a stubborn and ill-bred generation. I remind the House that the measure which emerged from the drafting committee differed substantially, not only from the biU introduced in this House, but also from the measure which the Attorney-General first submitted to the convention. The draft bill was a compromise, because, above all things, the representatives of the several governments at the convention desired that the Commonwealth Parliament should be clothed with additional powers. The representatives of the Commonwealth agreed with the representatives of the States because they hoped and believed that agreement would ensure the grant of wider powers, and that they were justified in making some concessions. The Leader of the Opposition endeavoured to create the impression that not only did the representatives of the States at the convention lack the advice of experts, but also that the Opposition section of the convention merely approved reference of the draft bill to the States, without approving the grant of the proposed powers. truth whatever in that contention, as is made perfectly clear by a study of the speeches delivered at the convention by me and by the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden). Speaking on the motion for the adoption of the draft committee's recommendation, I saidI second the motion and commend the d r a f t bill to the favorable consideration of the convention. As Dr. Evatt has told yon, the committee appointed by the convention is unanimous in recommending its adoption. That men holding such widely divergent views on highly controversial questions should have been able to Teach agreement w ill , I am very sure have great weight w i th the convention and w ill , I hope and believe, satisfy delegates that the powers proposed to be conferred on the Commonwealth by the States under section 51 (xxxvii ) are at once adequate to a post-war reconstruction policy, and yet so clearly defined as to remove those doubts expressed during the discussion on the Attorney General's bills, that under cover of a postwar reconstruction policy the principles of the federal pact could be utterly destroyed. Naturally secured without a spirit of give and take. On many points I myself powers on certain important be conferred on the Commonwealth. other hand, some members of the viewing the question from the angle of the States, were reluctant Mr Hughes. monwealth power over matters which they felt could be dealt w it h effectively by the States. Tlied r a ft b ill provides for the maximum cooperation of the States and the Commonwealth and confers powers which I firmly believe w ill enable the Commonwealth to deal effectively w it h the vastly complex problems with which we shall be confronted after the war, and I strongly recommend the adoption ot the committee's d r a f t bill by the convention. My right honourable colleague, the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden), after the convention had arrived at agreement and decided to approve the recommendation of the drafting committee, saidOn behalf of the Opposition in the Commonwealth Parliament, I desire to thank you, Mr Curtin, for the sentiments and the thanks that you have expressed. I also am pleased to have been associated with such a historic gathering. I think tlie b ill that \vihave just passed can be accepted as a monument of co-operation, and as evidence of unselfishness and compromise on the part of every one, particularly those Who have represented the States here. as I shall e x p l a in . We must appreciate that the States, who comprised the major portion of the drafting committee, have compromised to a great extent, as is shown by the terms of the b ill . All this goes to show that when Australians are required to get together and do a big thing for their country, they are prepared to exert every possible effort to achieve the result which is best calculated to serve the interests of the nation. The right honourable member for Kooyong paid a poor compliment to the right honourable member for Darling Downs and me when he said, in the face of that, that we are not in favour of granting all these powers and that all that the convention did was to approve their reference to the States. The right honourable gentleman has made some reference to the constitution of the convention. It is true that it was not a convention especially elected for the purpose; but I remind the right honourable gentleman, the Parliament and the country that it was the most representaunanimity could not have been tive constitution convention since the wished that wider historic convention which drafted the matters should Constitution itself; that the Leader of On the every State Government and State OppoCommittee, sition and representatives of the Commonto grant to the Comwealth Government and Opposition were",23,Standing Order Doubt On These Points Should Be

92,There Is No Mr Hughes,"He went onmembers, and that all approved this grant of powers in tbe measure now before tbe House. I deeply regret that tbe attitude of one State, in particular, is responsible for its rejection. It is true that tbe convention was composed wholly of politicians. That, I am sure, will not be regarded here as evidence of intellectual inferiority or incapacity to deal with public affairs. I invite my right honourable friend, if he still has any doubt of the competency of the convention, to have a look at the photograph of the personnel of the convention which drafted the Constitution. He will find that Australia can discharge. We must have the great majority were members of State Parliaments. If a convention were elected for this special purpose would any man contend that many, if not all, of those who sat in the 1942 convention would not find places in the elective convention ? We are to ask ourselves now whether these powers, or any of them, are necessary. My own opinion has been stated in a very definite way. It is said that our existing powei-3 are ample. The right honourable member for Kooyong said that under our defence powers, appropriation powers, external affairs powers, borrowing powers, and under section 96 we were able to do everything that was necessary for the repatriation and rehabilitation of the military forces and of the civilian workers in our war plants. I do not deny that those powers are very wide-the right honourable gentleman, indeed, gave us good reason to believe that they cover a most extensive field-but I certainly do not and will not rest content with those powers if I am asked whether [ think that they are adequate to deal with, not only the problems arising out of the demobilization of our fighting forces and a switchover from war to peace of our war workers, but also those other problems that must inevitably arise, upon the very nature of which we can only speculate. We are signatories to the Atlantic Charter. That commits us in many ways. I shall not trespass on the time of the House now to set out what f conceive to be the range and implications of those obligations, but content myself with observing that if I am asked what problems will confront Parliament and what powers we shall need [35] to deal with them, I shall say, "" I do not know "". I only know that they must be as wide as the circumstances require. I do not know what the terms of the peace treaty will be. I do not know to what extent our sovereign powers may be impaired through our acceptance of the Atlantic Charter, or as the result of the peace treaty. But I do know that we are already committed to enterprises, to reforms if you like to call them sopensions, family allowances, housing and what not-that saddle us with liabilities which only a prosperous and progressive power to deal with all the problems that will arise when the war ends, and that power must be expressed in the Constitution. It is not enough to say that under the existing powers we can do so and so, or may be able to do so and so. We must know quite definitely whatwe can do. I shall tell you some of the things which we cannot do. After all, the great problems that confront the world existed before the war and will continue after it has ceased, and perhaps beyond the period for which the powers are sought. Tbe great problems that confront the modern world are problems of development and growth of improved methods of production and communication, the application of science and mechanical invention to industrial methods which have effected changes in every phase of our national, social and economic lives. Two great forces are now struggling for mastery on the world stage-organize d labour and organized capital-and we have no power to deal with either of them. I remind the House and the country that under our peace-time powers this Parliament would have no power to do anything at all in relation to that reign of lawlessness which has existed on the coal-fields for months and which to-day has reached an acute stage. We could do nothing. All our powers with regard to industrial matters are covered by section 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution, and are confined to the establishment of arbitration and conciliation tribunals for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. [Extension of time granted.] Every honourable member on this side of the House was returned upon a policy of preference to returned soldiers. When the right honourable member for Kooyong was speaking, the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) asked him whether this Parliament had power to grant preference to returned soldiers, and the right honourable gentleman replied that we had abundant powers in that respect. If the right honourable gentleman means that we have abundant powers to grant preference of employment to returned soldiers in employment in the Commonwealth Public Service, I agree that we have that power; but the Commonwealth does not possess power to grant preference to soldiers in industry generally. Yet that was the policy upon which this party went to the country. I have stood in favour of this policy since 1915, when, of course, have been possessed by the as Prime Minister and Attorney-General of a Labour government, I granted preference to soldiers over preference to unionists, but owing to our lack of power this preference has been confined to employment in the Public Service. And, as I have said, there are very many other things which the Commonwealth cannot do. We cannot make an industrial law to deal with great corporations, aggregathese powers they have not even tions of capital, operating trusts, combines and monopolies. The right honourable member for Kooyong said that these terms were unknown to tbe law. I do not know whether they are known to the law or not, but they certainly exist. The Cabinet which governs England is unknown to the Constitution, but it exists; and these trusts and combines exist. Some are beneficent, but others are malignant, and, like cancer, they must be cut out. None should be beyond the control of this Parliament. We certainly cannot ensure the industrial future of this country unless we -have power to deal with industrial matters, corporations and combines. It has been contended that the powers sought in the bill may be abused. No doubt they may. reason why the people should not grant them. All powers may be abused. Under our existing powers, as the Attorney General pointed out, we could have wrought havoc with the existing order. We could have made it impossible for private enterprise to function. Our taxMr Hughes. ing power in itself would have sufficed to reduce private enterprise to extremities. It has, indeed, in many cases, already done so. Under our taxing power we could bring about a catastrophic collapse of land values by increasing the rate of tax on land values to a level which would absorb the whole economic rent. The single taxers held this to be a great and necessary reform, but it might well have disastrous effects upon those engaged in primary industries, react most seriously upon financial institutions, and imperil the foundation of our national economy. We could do all this and much more, I say, under our present powers, but we have made no attempt to do it. I invite the people to note that the powers sought in this bill and many more, British Parliament for centuries. Our sister dominion, New Zealand, has these powers, as have Canada and South Africa. But no one would suggest that they have been used for any improper purpose. Furthermore, these powers have been possessed for at least three-quarters of a century by every State Parliament in Australia, and so far from abusing through attempted to use many of them. People talk about the amendments of the Constitution to widen the ambit of the Federal Parliament as though the people of the Commonwealth and those of the States were separate national entities. But the electors of the States are the electors of the Commonwealth, and all they are asked to do is to vest these powers in the instrumentality best fitted to safeguard their interests. There is another point which needs emphasis. All power springs from the people. By giving the Commonwealth -jurisdiction over the subject matters in this bill, the people will surrender nothing and gain much. They are not asked to grant new powers, but to distribute those already granted so that they may be used to promote their own interests-to empower the CommonBut that is no wealth to deal with questions which, because they are national in character, cannot be dealt with effectively by the State Parliaments. That is why all the State Premiers agreed to surrender their powers over them to the Commonwealth. There are some things the States can do better than the Commonwealth, just as there are others that municipal and shire councils can do better than the States; and there arc some things that are better done by co-operation between the States and Commonwealth. This bill provides for such co-operation. It is contended that these powers are not necessary, that they are sought to give effect to the Government's socialization policy, that even if they are necessary we should oppose them. Frankly, in the face of recent, happenings, I cannot understand this attitude. Have those who adopt it forgotten that the grant of every one of these powers was not only approved by the Constitutional Convention on which the Premiers and Opposition Leaders of all the States sat, but also by the representatives of both parties in this House? course, that these powers were to be referred to the Commonwealth under section 51 (xxxvii), but representatives of both parties in this and all State Parliaments agreed that it was necessary that the Commonwealth Parliament should have tbese powers. They surely would not have done this if they had thought that the Parliament would have used these powers for an improper purpose, although they must have known that it could put them to any use it thought fit. I repeat, the representatives of the Government and Opposition parties of this Parliament agreed that these powers should be vested in the Commonwealth, and, of course, the Government could have put its party programme into effect under this reference of powers by the State in exactly the same way, and, to the same degree as it would be able to do if the people approved the grant of powers at the referendum. The point is that whether the powers in this bill are vested in the Commonwealth under section 51 (xxxvii), or by the people at a referendum, the uses to which they could be put are not affected. The National Parliament has no power to deal with great national matters; the people are to be asked to give it that power. Their interests will not be endangered by granting this power. The supreme merit of our system of government is that the people retain control of Parliament in their own hands. If a government ventures to do anything to which .the people take strong exception it is swept o«t of office; and the power of the people cannot only make itself felt at general elections, but continues day by day. No human institution is so sensitive to public opinion as Parliament, which reflects from day to day as well as at elections the opinions and desires of the people. This is the best guarantee the people can have that these powers if granted will not be put to improper uses. I confess that this talk about the possible abuse of powers has always sounded to me very hollow. I hope the people of Australia will treat it with the contempt it deserves. It is at best a smoke-screen put down to conceal the real motives of those who oppose the grant of additional powers. It is true, of In and out of office I have supported every attempt to clothe this National Parliament with national powers. I have never been a unificationist; but I have supported every attempt to bring about such a distribution of powers as would clothe this Parliament with adequate authority to legislate on all truly national matters. That is my attitude to-day. I shall oppose the taking of a referendum; but if a referendum is to be taken, I shall advocate the acceptance by the people of the amendments in this bill. Minister and Minister for Defence) [8.59] -The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has made a speech to-night which in broad principle is consistent with his advocacy on this subject during the last 30 years. Out of the wealth of his experience he has given us the testimony of one who can bear witness. In peace and in war he has had very great responsibility, and he believes, as he has said to-night, that the powers of the Commonwealth are not adequate to enable it to grapple with the problems that war will bequeath to this nation. It was for that reason that the Government some time ago brought down proposals to extend the powers of this Parliament.

The essence of this matter, I consider, can be reduced to a clear statement; it is this: The Government, having read of what has happened in more than 40 years of federation, having familiarized its mind with the successive judgments that have been given in the various cases for and against that have been put to the people by different governments-on e case having been, advocated by the Leader of the Opposition himself when he was Attorney-General in the Lyons Government-cam e to the conclusion that the war would leave for this or any future Government so grievous a situation that at least the legislative authority of the Parliament should be adequate to enable the Government, to act, decisively. The Government decided that employment, trade and commerce, action in relation to trusts and combines, control over prices, measures dealing with inflation, and the necessity to ensure that industry and production shall be maintained, are considerations which involve in order to ensure that the Parliament shall be competent to deal with them. It considers that the history of this matter is one of opposition, of a disposition to say "" No "" , of a refusal to give to this Parliament the powers which successive governments have regarded as necessary. It therefore considered that the practical approach to the question was to invite the representatives of the State Parliaments, to assemble at Canberra. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, the Premiers and do .we, oddly Leaders of the Opposition in each of the State Parliaments were invited, making twelve representatives of the Parliaments of the States, and ensuring that there would be six representatives of each predominant political party in each of the States. We added to that number twelve members of the Commonwealth Parliament-eigH t from the House of Representatives and four from the Senate. The Government, having the earnest desire to get a reasonable and practicable settlement of the problem, ensured equality of representation for the political parties in this House and in th Senate.

It consisted not only of the political leaders of each State and of the Commonwealth, but of the Leaders of the Opposition in each State and of the Leader of the Opposition in the Commonwealth Parliament. It consisted of representatives of both sides in this Parliament, and ensured a perfect balance of political representation as between the anti-Labour and the Labour parties. deliberated and it appointed a drafting committee. I need not recite the conclusions of the Convention except to say that the bill now before us emerged from this completely assembly of the Australian' Parliaments. It is true that the Convention was not elected directly, but every representative owed his place to the fact that he had been, not only elected by an electorate, but had been chosen by his political party to hold a representative office. It was in every sense of the word an experienced electoral college. It included not only men of political experience, but also representatives who had had considerable administrative experience. views were expressed, but ultimately the drafting committee presented a unanimous report, to the Convention, and the Convention accepted the bill. It was to lie a bill which the Parliaments of the States were to pass, but all of those Parliaments have not carried through the requisite part allotted to them. Why is this bill now before this House? Because the passage of this measure by this Parliament is necessary in order that the only authority left in Australia can be invoked to give legislative effect to the agreement at which the Convention arrived. A referendum is proposed to be taken because it is the only machinery left to give effect to the decision which, whatever be the circumstances of the calling together of the Convention, was tit least reached by the most competently balanced authority that the Australian nation possesses at this juncture to arrive at such a decision. elected convention? a popularly elected convention, but such a convention would take a great deal more time in reaching a decision than the Convention which sat and it would include among its representatives men who knew little of the subject under consideration, but in a democracy that is not a disqualification of their right to decide matters of this kind.

There will be much dislocation and there will have to be much improvisation in the transfer from war to peace as was found necessary in the transfer from peace to war.

140,Mr Fadden (Darling . D O W N S,"Curtin) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hughes) laid great stress and, indeed, the Prime Minister finished his speech, on the assertion that the bill now before the House is the same in all particulars as that agreed to at the Convention held in November, 1942. ""With all due respect I point out that that bill is different in a very important particular from the measure now 'before us. The bill which was the outcome of the Convention had an important safeguard which is absent from the bill now under consideration. It provided in clause 3Tli is act shall not be repealed or amended to 'prevent the Commonwealth from abusexcept in the manner provided in this section. ing the powers referred to it.

Obviously, that provision constituted a safeguard which is absent from the present bill. Following is an extract from the report when that particular clause was under consideration by the Convention :the provisions in the acts of the Parliaments of New South Wales and Queensland, which are designed to prevent the repeal or amendment of a law without the consent of the electors of the State. It has the approval of all the draftsmen. [30] tically an invitation to the States to either repeal or amend? tion which says that the thing cannot be done at all without a referendum having been taken. I draw attention to the fact that it was that bill, in which that safeguard was included, which I supported at the Convention. It was designed to prevent the States from revoking the grant. what I said, and by the vote I cast, but I draw the attention of honourable memThat, while this Convention recognizes tlie need to confer increased powers upon the Commonwealth, it is of opinion that the war prebecupation of many hundreds of thoufighting services and prisoners of w a r ) , who have a vital interest in improved post-war conditions and a right to an informed vote, renders it impracticable to secure a deliberate judgment on the complex problem of such a fundamental change in the whole system of government in Australia as is proposed. Accordingly, it expresses the view that(ft) the war powers of the Commonweal th being very extensive, advantage should be taken of the opportunity during the war of securing practical experience in co-operative Commonwealth and State action in relation to social and economic questions; so that in due course specific constitutional changes may be made wit h the greatest possible knowledge; (6) the consideration of what changes should be made in the Commonwealth Constitution to meet new circumstances should, at an appropriate date, be referred to an elective convention representative of the people. After discussion, the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Cosgrove, moved a further amendment. I quote the following from the official record of proceedingsI now formally move the following amendment of which I gave notice last evening:That all words after "" T h a t "" be deleted with a view to inserting the following words:"" this Convention is of opinion that(a) adequate powers to make laws In relation to post-war reconstructSn",35,Standing Order Doubt On These Points Should Be

That amendment was carried unanimously. member for Darling Downs withdrew his amendment. the amendment moved 'by Mr Cosgrove. The Government representatives at the Convention supported Mr Gosgrove's amendment also, which opposed the holding of a referendum in war-time for the reasons stated in the amendment. honourable member for Darling Downs has failed to carry out his obligation. water has run under the bridge since then. Since November, 194'2, the people of Australia have learned something of the way in which the Commonwealth Government exercises its powers. They have had experience of bureaucracy and centralized control of a hind very detrimental to certain of the States, at any rate. It was a good thing that the safeguard to which I have referred was included in the bills submitted to the States, and passed by some of the State Parliaments. Before the Convention was able to reach a decision the Prime Minister made this statementI iput these three questions to the Convention this morning, involving(1) the extent of the additional powers to be granted; (2) the method by Which they are to be granted; and (3) the period of the grant. With this in mind the drafting committee met, and eventually prepared the bill of which the Convention approved. Under monwealth seeks the same powers which for this reason, legislative power with the States were prepared to refer to it in 1942, but I again emphasize the fact that the safeguard which enabled the States to repeal or annul the powers referred to the Commonwealth is absent from the present measure. That, in itsuch reference should be for a period self, is a definite alteration to the bill which left the Convention-the bill which I supported in 1942. I am one of those who believe that the Commonwealth Goat the end of such period of seven vernment should have increased powers, but the extent of those powers, and the have not been sufficiently considered. I opposed in 1942, and I still oppose, the holding of a referendum in war-time, and in this I have the support of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). He stated, however, that apparently no other course was now open to the Commonwealth but to hold a referendum. I submit, with all due respect, however, that the Commonwealth Government . has not persevered sufficiently with the States with a view to obtaining the necessary powers without throwing the people into confusion by the holding of a referendum. Any one who has heard the speeches delivered on this bill must have been struck by the difference of opinion among those who have spoken. Five speeches have been delivered, four of them by eminent constitutional lawyers, including King's Counsel, and the others by the Leader of the Government which is seeking the additional powers. There is a difference of opinion as to whether the additional powers are necessary, the extent to which powers, if any, are necessary, and how they should be obtained. When trained constitutional lawyers cannot agree upon a common formula, how is it to be expected that the people can cast an informed and intelligent vote on such an issue? The State Premiers, in their wisdom, decided that certain specific powers should be referred to the Commonwealth, but they included certain safeguards, those in clauses 3 and 4 of the bill that left the Convention.

151,Mr Fadden,"No, but a lot of this House should take a broad, national view of tbe subject. It is easy for an honourable member, who represents a constituency in the great industrial city of Sydney, to take what he describes as a broad, national view. The three speakers who have preceded me, the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt), the honourable member for Warringah and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr mania, .alone of all the States, has deHughes) this issue. same political reason that the Attorneyto national, public and local governGeneral himself is on that side.

153,Mr Eadden,"Yes, and for the agreed to transfer powers with respectof the power relating to distribution, namely, the rationing of goods in short supply. Both of those States would limit the financial control to control through or by the Commonwealth Bank of the rate of overseas exchange. South Australia would include also the control over rates of interest by the Commonwealth Bank. The remaining six powers would substantially be transferred by both States without major alterations, -subject to the proviso that the transfer to the Commonwealth shall not be permanent. ""With the exception of Tasmania, common ground has been reached by agreement with regard to the transfer of many of the powers sought by the Commonwealth. Every mainland State has agreed to transfer the powers regarding reinstatement of the fighting services, air transport, uniformity of railway gauges, national works, national health, family allowances, and aborigines. That is to say, the States, with the exception of Tasmania, are willing to transfer seven of the fourteen points. Having regard to the fact that the differences are of a minor character, I urge that the Commonwealth persevere with the States in regard to the matters still in dispute, if only for the purpose of reducing to the minimum the number of matters to be submitted to the electors. cision. There is no need to submit I believe that the less the electors are confused the more likely they are to grant the really necessary powers. On the other hand, should the people be asked to grant to the Commonwealth the fourteen powers sought by it, I believe that not one of them will 'be granted. One has only to consider the varying views that have been expressed in this chamber by eminent constitutional lawyers to realize how confusing these issues must be to the public. able gentleman agree to the bill which emanated from the Convention? were agreeable to refer certain powers to the Commonwealth so long as the safeguards I have mentioned were provided. between giving powers to the Commonwealth for five years and handing them over for five years with the right of any State to annul its decision. If there were no other difference between the bill now before us and the draft bill which emerged from the Convention I should not be inconsistent in opposing this measure. Whatever may be the legal principles involved, it is obvious that practical difficulties would make impossible a retransfer of many of the powers to the States after the specified period had elapsed. Take, for instance, the subject of a uniform company law. After such a law had operated throughout the Commonwealth for five years, is it likely that the States would then seekto administer their own laws on the subject? If they did so, there would be confusion. The same may be said in respect of uniform laws to control trusts and combines, and some other matters. My point is that I have always opposed, and always will oppose, the holding of a referendum during wartime, particularly when I believe that greater perseverance with the States would make it unnecessary. The States should refer to the Commonwealth certain powers which the Commonwealth ought to have. If they will not refer those powers to the Commonwealth, their number should be reduced to a minimum, and such matters should be submitted to the people for their defourteen points to the electors. honourable gentleman get over the difficulty due to the obstinacy of the Legislative Council of Tasmania? mula could be evolved to meet that situation. There is very little difference between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to the major matters concerning which a transfer of powers to the Commonwealth is generally regarded as indispensable and urgent. The other matters could be referred to the people at the right time. The best course to follow is to have an elective convention to survey the whole field and recommend alterations of the Constitution, so that the electors may be well There is a great difference informed of what is intended. Party political considerations should be avoided, so that necessary amendments of the Constitution would have a reasonable chance of being agreed to.

By submitting fourteen points to the electors, the Government would probably destroy any further chance of an alteration of the Constitution for another quarter of a century. A t the appropriate time. I shall provide an opportunity for action to be taken to decide whether a further conference with the States shall be held in order to remove remaining points of disagreement, and to reduce to a minimum the number of questions to be submitted to the people. I repeat that I. am opposed to a referendum in wartime, and also that there is no necessity for a referendum in view of what the States are prepared to concede.

Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [9.55] -We have listened tonight to addresses by honourable gentlemen who are probably well qualified to deal with the technical aspects of the subject under discussion. I wish to refer to a few points of considerable importance to which I think more attention should be given. It is admitted by honourable members on both sides of the House that the transfer of additional powers to the Commonwealth is a matter of considerable importance. I do not regard myself qualified to deal with the legal aspects of the proposed alterations-othe r honourable members are more competent to deal with them-bu t I am afraid that the issue may be clouded so that a wise decision may not be made. I support the bill because it aims at so altering the Constitution'as to enable the task associated with post-war reconstruction to be tackled' effectively. sought are for a period of five years after the war in respect of fourteen subject-matters. We on this side believe that a transfer of powers to the Commonwealth is essential in order to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in regard to the social security of the people by providing them with employment. I shall confine my remarks chiefly to the subjects of air transport and the unification of ' the railway gauges. The prospects are that there will be a considerable increase of civil air transport in the immediate post-war period. A large number of Royal Australian Air Force personnel will desire to continue in aviation, and it is safe to say that civil aviation will play a great part, not only in providing speedy transport for passengers and valuable goods, but also as an avenue of employment. It is incongruous that under the existing Constitution the Commonwealth cannot deal with civil aviation except wi'th the consent of the States. quires in that respect. withdraw the power and llius wreck the whole scheme. I shall deal with that aspect later. It is too obvious to require stressing that the proper method to control civil aviation is to arrive at the best plan on an Australia-wide basis, and hand the administration to the Commonwealth Government. Otherwise we may have conflicting sets of conditions and regulations governing commercial aviation. If there is one thing that is calculated to strangle the expansion of Australia's internal air-lines, it is six State codes all placing different obligations and responsibilities on aircraft, the crews who fly them, the passengers who travel in them, and in respect of the goods carried. The High Court, in the case of Rex v. Burgess, held that the Commonwealth Government has no general control over the subject-matter of civil aviation within the Commonwealth of Australia. That decision was plainly stated, and permits of only the one interpretation, that Commonwealth rights are subordinate to State laws. I do not think The alterations that any man who claims to be a representative of the Australian people in this Parliament would agree to the rights of the Commonwealth in this respect being subordinate to State laws, but that is what the present position",39,Standing Order Doubt On These Points Should Be

160,Mr Drakeford,"On e State couldamounts to. The legal position is that the New South Wales Government, if it so desires, can force aircraft to be registered under its State Transport Co-ordination Act of 1931. Just before the Goya Henry case, the Australian National Airways declined to pay to the New South Wales Government a tax on its aircraft operating in New South Wales. agreed to pay a nominal tax of 5s. per annum. The point is that that State Government nominal tax into a very substantial tax that could conceivably have a serious effect on an air-line by greatly increasing fares and operating costs. I ask honourable members to consider that. A State is imposing a tax of 5s. per annum. It could increase the tax to £5 or more if Legislatures agreed to pass a law providit liked to do so and thus do a great deal which would be detrimental to civil aviation in Australia. An alteration of the Constitution to give the full powers to the Commonwealth Parliament would prevent the likelihood of that. The Western Australian transport authorities levy a tax of on all gross passenger and freight earnings by aircraft, plus a Id. duty stamp on all tickets issued in that State. New .South Wales and Western Australia impose a registration fee on aircraft, in addition to a tax on seating accommodation. This indicates that at least two States have taken steps to preserve their sovereign powers over civil air transport. In the Burgess case, to which 1 have already referred it was held that section 4 of the Air Navigation Act is invalid so far as it purports to authorize control of civil aviation by the Commonwealth Government within the Commonwealth, but is valid so far as it authorizes could upset a Commonwealth plan for the Executive of the Commonwealth Government to carry out within Australia the regulations of the International Air Convention. under the Convention internationally and pany -Honourable members see the the States have given us all the powers confusion which would occur in such internally, although the powers required circumstances.

Mr Drakeford. employment as would be offered by standardization of the railway gauges'. It would range from highly qualified technical experts down to the humblest, but essential, forms of unskilled workers. All the materials used, such as steel rails and fastenings, would be of Australian manufacture, and the railway sleepers would be hewn in Australian forests. The actual changeover to the standard 4 f t . Si in. gauge as well as the alteration to rolling stock would represent practically all labour. The powers asked for should be voted to the Commonwealth Parliament by the people, not only in order that our gauges may be standardized, as soon as possible, but also to make certain that in the future State Governments shall not worsen the position by building new railways on other than the standard gauge. The scare-cries of "" bureaucracy "" and specifically for use in war-time and the ordinary means of law-making Another depression in the post-war They would laugh at a plea that there was no money to provide work after they have seen countless millions of ' pounds expended at short notice on war. When we banish depression we banish the soil on which fascism and revolution thrives. It is idle,, however, to suppose that we can sweep away unemployment without controlling other social forces which often make for unemployment. iSome concerted plan that takes in all States and all industries is required. This is a job for the Commonwealth Government. 'The Nazis found a way to diminish unemployment. They overcame unemployment for an object-to smash trade unions and use the subject workers to build a military machine that would conquer the world. All the labour power they had was needed for their military machine, so none was wasted through unemployment. workers in peaceful pursuits embodying the principles of the Atlantic Charter. In war, the Commonwealth Government will not tolerate the spectacle of able-bodied men without jobs. It has made swift use of its powers to put men and women into work which helps the war effort. The Government will not tolerate in war-time wealthy combines withholding supplies of. which the nation is in need. The dire needs of war have awakened the national conscience. In peace, also, the Government will not tolerate an army of idle_men. Every citizen who is willing to work is entitled to a job in peace as well as in war. But the unemployment problem has its roots in other factors. Government must have power to examine and, if need be, legislate on the fourteen matters set out in the bill, for all these things have a direct bearing on the problem of unemployment and national welfare. If each State were consulted and asked to draw up a scheme to reabsorb the members of our fighting forces in industry, the result would be six separate and conflicting plans. If this bill be passed the increased powers which it seeks to give to the Commonwealth Parliament by means of a referendum will, if granted, automatically cease to operate at the expiration of five years after the war provided, of course, that no further alteration of the Constitution occurs. No one can say that the Commonwealth Government has proceeded with its plans hastily. It convened a special Constitution Convention which deliberated at Canberra from the 24th November to the 2nd December, 1942. Representatives of the Government and the Opposition parties in each State Parliament and this Parliament were given equal powers at the Convention which formed the opinion that the Commonwealth Government's powers were inadequate. That Convention decided that power to legislate on fourteen matters should be transferred by reference to the Commonwealth Parliament by the State Parliaments as prescribed by the Constitution. Every State Premier who attended the conference undertook to We must absorb our exert his best efforts to induce his particular State legislature to pass the bill, unanimously, agreed upon at the conference, as being necessary to achieve proper post-war reconstruction. The dissension and obstruction that arose in respect of the bill in State political spheres is itself eloquent testimony to the need for a central governing authority such as the Commonwealth Parliament on these vital fourteen matters. If the six State Governments had passed the bill agreed to by their representatives at the Canberra Convention, a referendum would not have become necessary. Only two State Parliaments, those of New South Wales and Queensland, have carried out the agreement The Commonwealth made by their respective Premiers at the Convention and for various reasons other State Parliaments have not passed tlie measure in the form accepted at the Convention. The refusal of State legislatures to ratify the agreement reached by representatives at Canberra leaves the Commonwealth Government with the alternative of endeavouring to perform the immense job of post-war reconstruction with inadequate powers or else taking steps in the interests of Australia to secure those powers by means of a referendum. Some people are opposed to the Government's proposals, because they are under the erroneous impression that the signing of peace will be synonymous to Australia's return to the conditions prevailing in 1939. The idea that when peace is signed we can simply turn back the hands of the clock to 1939 ignores the fact that there is a second world war in progress. It ignores all the vast social and economic changes this war has brought in its train. Let us look at a few of these drastic changes. ""Women have been absorbed into industry in great numbers and many are receiving larger incomes than ever before in their lives. It seems certain that many women will want to continue to work in industries which, prior to 1939, were closed to them. The Commonwealth Parliament was the chief instrument in organizing Australia for war. Logically, it must organize the nation for peace. The Government which has planned and directed the change-over of our social and economic life from peace to war will be expected by the Australian people to smooth out the difficulties of converting the nation back from war to peace. To do this immense job, the Commonwealth Parliament must have powers in peace, for at least five years after the conflict, revolution, I point out that the Commonnot less than those it exercised in war. I doubt seriously whether it will be possible during the transition from war to peace to guarantee full employment to members of the armed forces being demobilized unless there is an Australianthat the best form of government for wide plan to train and place them in jobs for which they are suitable, to expand some industries and curtail others, to prevent the indiscriminate exercise by the employer of the power to hire and "" fire "". portance are left to the State legislatures. Some people may ask themselves what the Commonwealth Government could accomplish that the State governments could not also accomplish. The facts are that on certain matters, the States have laws which conflict with each other. They have produced no legislation, uniform or otherwise, which could contribute substantially to a solution of post-war reconstruction problems. The Commonwealth Government. is the only instrument that can possibly produce a uniform plan respecting the fourteen matters set out in the bill. The Commonwealth Parliament which legislates for the whole of Australia is the only political instrument which can Mr Drakeford. formulate a post-war plan applicable to the whole of Australia and administer it with an even hand. Uniform laws for Australia on matters such as national public works,' housing, marketing, prices control and unemployment are essential to any scientific post-war plan. The cry of "" State rights"" is a misnomer conjured up to appeal to ingrained conservative prejudices. The Commonwealth Parliament does not seek to deprive the States of any of their law-making powers. All that the bill aims at is that the Commonwealth law will override the State laws should they overlap on any of the fourteen matters outlined in the bill. National planning for the nation is the key principle of this bill. Six State instruments in their own watertight compartments inevitably will produce dissension irrespective of the intentions of the State legislators no matter how sincere they are. To those scaremongers who say that the transfer of the powers asked for to the Commonwealth Parliament would be almost tantamount to a wealth Government has already acquired considerably increased powers in wartime. The exercise of those increased powers has produced a war effort which is the admiration of our Allies. I submit Australia in the post-war period is a form in which all major national problems would be dealt with by this National Parliament while problems of lesser imI t is inevitable that the old bogy of socialization will be raised in an effort to stampede the people into voting against granting the Commonwealth Parliament the legislative powers for which it asks in order to grapple with unemployment. Granting additional powers to the Commonwealth Parliament strengthens immensely the democratic qualities of government in Australia. Electorates in some States, notably Victoria, are gerrymandered. In at least five States there is an Upper House notelected by popular adult franchise. Some of these State legislatures have increased the period in which the Parliament shall function, whereas this Commonwealth Parliament cannot do so without a referendum. Enlarging the powers of this Parliament enlarges the capacity of the Australian people for self-government. Above all, these problems must be grappled with by the Commonwealth Government on the basis that Australia is one indivisible nation. They should not be tackled piecemeal as if Australia were six separate territories each requiring its own particular code of social justice and its own special measure of work for its citizens. The results of State muddling in the past, the perils of the present, and the vital problems awaiting solution in the immediate post-war period combine to make it imperative that the Commonwealth Parliament shall be competent to carry out the will of the people by means of a constitution from which the shortcomings and obsolete features that have become manifest during the past 43 years will have been removed. The proposals embodied in the bill will commend themselves to every „ democrat in this country. I am certain that so long as those who oppose the Government's proposals do not succeed in confusing the issues at the referendum, our people will give to this Parliament powers which will enable Australia to achieve greatness among the nations. I support the bill. Australia is indeed fortunate that in it3 constitutional travail it has the assistance of so renowned a jurist as the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt). His speech was temperate, wise and compelling. The problem of the constitutional development of this country is of such paramount importance, that the Attorney General deserves the strongest support of all members of this Parliament for these proposals. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) made a speech whicli lasted for more than two hours. He spoke forcefully, as he-invariably does, but he spoke to us as if we were members of the High Court Bench. He gave me the impression that he was making his speech from a well-prepared brief. He. was technical and deliberative; but his arguments did not sound one broad national note. He offered a pertinacious and provoking opposition to the wise changes proposed under the measure. He would have us believe that if the people of Australia granted to their National Parliament the powers which this Government now asks them to grant to it, we would use those powers to shake the very foundations of our society. Indeed, he implied that this Government has already laid plans for that purpose. That the right honourable gentleman is opposed to the bill is a happy circumstance which augurs well for the success of the referendum, because the electors of Australia have come to accept our statement that he speaks on behalf of the exclusive and privileged. few, and fights their battles consistently. That this referendum is to be opposed for party political reasons is obvious. I am prepared to accept that challenge, because if the matter were to be fought on the political issues of the last election, the referendum would certainly be carried. The friends of the monopolists and myrmidons of the capitalists are now receiving wide publicity in the press. These include many gentlemen who, last August, were buried under an avalanche of public opinion; they are again coming to light and are receiving great publicity indeed from certain organs that are favorable to vested interests. The Curtin Government, which has a substantial majority in this House will soon have an outstanding majority in the Senate. Those who are opposed to it fear that the extra powers that are sought would, if granted, be used to implement the policy of the Labour party and to soften-up the positions of the capitalists in preparation for further attacks upon them. In any event, they fear some change of the system under which so many owe so much to so few. It is important that we should keep in mind that the Government is asking for further power to curb monopolies, trusts and combines, to prevent these legal entities, which have neither a body to be kicked nor a soul to be damned, from filling their greedy maws from the tables of Australian families. The .States cannot deal effectively with monopolies, but",42,Standing Order Doubt On These Points Should Be
177,Mr Williams (Robertson) [10.28].,"the Commonwealth could do so. The Curtin Government will have real power from the commencement of July. It will bo the first occasion on which the Labour party has had real power since the late Andrew Fisher adorned the Prime Minister's chair and the Government which he led established the Commonwealth Bank. Therefore, vested interests are apprehensive; they seek to frustrate, to baffle, to balk, and to confuse the Government, and to defeat it if possible. For this purpose they will resurrect and take out on to the hustings most of the issues which were decided at the elections that were held last August. I have no doubt that they will fight that contest over again, and that the result will be the same. The Government has the sacred duty of protecting the many against exploitation by the few. It asks the people to assist themselves by assisting it to gain further powers. I trust that the electors will view the matter in a broad national way, and that they will take the trouble to understand why the Constitution should be altered. I hope that they will realize that the greatest power which they possess-the power to change the Government every three years if they so desire-ca n never be taken from them. for the honourable gentleman. in the same boat as the honourable member who has interjected, I should no doubt compass my political destruction. The power to change the Government is the greatest protection which the people could have. They are to be asked to grant to themselves additional powers as a nation, in order that the Parliament may legislate collectively, decisively and quickly. They should remember that "" a house divided against itself cannot stand "". They are to be asked to agree that the very powers that they now exercise as citizens of a State shall still be exercised by them as citizens of the Commonwealth. That the Constitution should be altered in order to keep pace with the rapid progress which the world has made during the last few years, is a natural circumstance. The founders of the Constitution foresaw the probability of its having to be altered, and for that reason included in it directions as to the manner of its alteration. They did not desire that it should be lightly changed, or that powerful States, with large majorities, should be able to have it altered in opposition to the wishes of the smaller States in order to suit theirown ends; but they did provide a safe and democratic way by which it might be altered. Let us consider for a moment the constitutions of other countries. The Canadian Constitution, like ours, is an act of the British Parliament, but it does not provide for its alteration, yet no ""difficulty has ever been experienced in having it amended, because the British Parliament has always been prepared to amend its own enactment when it has been shown that the amendment was desired by the Dominion of Canada. Doubtless, that desire has been expressed in appropriate resolutions of the Canadian Parliament. The Constitution of South Africa does not contain any impediment to the subst-antial alteration of it. The Constitution of the United States of America makes provision for its amendment, and, as honourable members know, it has been amended on very many occasions in order to keep pace with national progress. The Constitution of New Zealand is a statutory enactment, and the articles of that statute can be changed by the Parliament that it has created, exactly as any other law can be made or changed. The Constitution of Great Britain, consisting as it does partly of statutes and partly of judicial decisions, can be changed by any act of the Parliament of Great Britain. Are we then in Australia to be in the position of never being able to alter our Constitution? Are .we to continue for ever without making any progress? Are we to remain static throughout the years? I exhort honourable members to support the bill in order that the Constitution may be altered so as to keep pace with the times. The Government is to be commended for its action in introducing the bill. Having pledged itself-mor e than that, having dedicated itself to care for those who have fought to keep this country free from terror and devastation, and knowing the w ill ' of all our",46,Standing Order Doubt On These Points Should Be
178,Mr Harbison,That will be bad luck,47,Standing Order Doubt On These Points Should Be
179,Mr Williams,"If I were to sailAllies as to fighting forces-it has carefully examined the position and has come to the conclusion that it requires extra powers in order to carry out its undertakings, and it has taken every reasonable step to obtain an alteration of the Constitution. It has given deep and earnest consideration to the matter of governing Australia after the most formidable conflict with foreign enemies in which this country has ever been engaged has been brought to a triumphant close. Constitutions change with the times, and it is reasonable that they should. There is an old Latin quotation which says that times change and we change with them. The times have changed considerably since the Australian federation was inaugurated. Much that is commonplace in our lives to-day was little dreamt of 44 years ago. With the march of time, Australia has become a strong and resolute nation, and 70,000 of its brave sons lie dead on foreign battlefields, having died that democracy might live. The life of the federation has stretched from the days of the coaches of Cobb and Company to the aircraft of Australian National Airways Limited, from the days of the muzzle-loader to those of the Owen gun. Throughout all our vicissitudes, our Constitution has worn well, but it is well worn. AgainI say that times change, and we change with them. No word is more in the minds of the people tp-day than is that of ""progress"". Progress has been described somewhere as "" the stride of God "". It has been said that all that is human must retrogress if it does not advance. In many respects, as the Hunter. That river is cradled in a the world has advanced 50 years in the last four years. The mind of man has been streamlined and speeded up. Progress is everywhere. advancement was never imagined before the war. Even the Spitfire has been surpassed for speed. We have called forth all the power we possess as a nation, and have summoned to our aid ""all of our resources. Whether the representatives of the people here assembled like it or not, we are about to stride forcloser settlement, and any means by ward politically and socially. I venture to forecast that should these alterations which the Government requires be not the future of their granted by the people, then the destiny of Australia will be guided by decisions of the High Court, in which event we might well find that large and important national questions, affecting the lives and happiness of millions of people in Australia, will depend upon the state of the digestion 'of the members of the High Court. It is altogether fit and proper that the future welfare and destiny of our country should be entirely in the hands of parliamentary representatives, who have been elected by the people of i this country. When speaking of the future of Australia, one inevitably has in mind constant employment for the masses at good and safe standards. Eew will disagree with me that one of the most important powers for which the Commonwealth is now asking is power in regard to national works. I am not a great deal concerned with the actual wording "" Post-war reconstruction "". Those words have for me no magical significance. They might have better application to countries across the seas, which have felt the cruel scourge of war, and in which countless houses, roads, -railways, bridges, churches, halls, dams and the like have been destroyed and will have to be rebuilt after the war. In Australia, principally owing to the blessing of Providence and the strength of our Allies, nothing has been destroyed or laid waste. What we need, socially, politically and physically is construction, not reconstruction. May I illustrate briefly WhatI have in mind? In the northern part of my electorate there flows a river which is known beautiful valley which is known as the Hunter Valley. The land of which it consists is as fertile as may be found Our present anywhere in the world. For more than 40 years the people of Singleton have urged upon the Government of New South Wales the necessity to provide for water conservation on the Huniter River. Successive State Parliaments have welcomed the proposal. They favoured water conservation and which those fertile lands might be irrigated, and as a consequence multiply their .production tenfold. It seems that the State Governments have admitted the need for water conservation and closer settlement, better production and flood mitigation, but they have always pleaded that they cannot afford to pay for the work. Nobody would ever talk of reconstructing that dam except in his imagination, but when .the increased powers stought by this bill are granted. I authorities, in co-operation with New South Wales, will construct it . The now power relating to national works should be implemented immediately it servation schemes take years to complete. This great and important work would be an admirable task for the Allied Works Council. And why not? I shall vote for the bill , but I cannot help regretting that it imposes a limitation of five years from the termination of hostilities upon the use of the extra powers, However, in all the circumstances we may suppose that the Attorney-General has seen the wisdom of Solon's remark that no more good must be attempted than the nation can bear. Debate PAG E) adjourned. ON LEAVE PEANUT INDUSTR Y Motion (by Dr. EVATT ) proposedThat the House do now adjourn. and Ministerf o r Post-war Reconstruction) [10.48] -The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) recently asked the Minister representing the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs among other things whether it is a fact that, although the Queensland State Arbitration Court has refused to reduce wages by Is. in accordance with the recent cost of living decline, the Commonwealth Government has reduced its subsidy to manufacturers as though the wage had been reduced, and, by compelling them to charge pegged prices, is making them carry the whole effect of this loss of subsidy. In reply, I would inform the honourable member that the purpose of the Government's price stabilization plan was to stabilize prices and the cost of living at about the level for March quarter, 1943. A ceiling was imposed on prices as at the 13th A p r i l , 1943, and stabilization was to be achieved by the aid of Government subsidies. It am sure that the Commonwealth was found impossible to adjust all in creased costs in the first quarter of the plan. Taking Brisbane as the case in point, the Commonwealth Statistician's "" C "" series index of the cost of living is granted, because water con'at the 31st March, 1943, stood at 1063 and the basic wage was 95s. per week. The objective was stability of these two levels. The index for June quarter showed a'rise to 1083, which warranted a rise of 2s. in the basic wage, and this increase was approved by the Queensland tribunal. In August, 1943, the assistance given by the Commonwealth Government amounting to several millions of pounds for the whole Commonwealth, was provided by subsidy on tea and potatoes, and reduction of sales tax on clothing from 12£ per cent, to 7 i per cent. As a (on motion by Sir EARLE. result of these and other subsidies the cost-of-living index for Brisbane fell during the September quarter to 1074, and on the basis applied at the end of March and again in June should have resulted in a f a l l of Is. in the basic wage. The Queensland tribunal, however, refused to reduce the basic wage in accordance w i th the f a l l . in the cost of livin g as measured by the index during the quarter. I would add that the index shows a further f a l l to 106S at the end of December, being only five points above the position at 31st March last year, but the Queensland basic wage, although increased in June, 1943, in accordance with the variation during that quarter, has not been reduced in accordance with the reductions shown in either the September or December quarters. In making payment of the special refund arising out of the increased cost of livin g for t i e June, 1943, quarter, this Government can only have regard to the relative positions as measured by the Statistician's index figures of the cost of living and it cannot be swayed by the refusal of the Queensland tribunal to vary the basic wage downwards in",47,Standing Order Doubt On These Points Should Be

Last year, I understand, application was made to the Minister, and also to the Municipality of Bankstown, by a man named Fitzpatrick, a contractor in that district, for permission to erect certain buildings. Prior to the war, he was a small, backyard contractor, but he seems to have achieved affluence since the outbreak of war. In a recent court case he claimed that his plant was worth £70,000. He made application for additions to a galvanized iron shed, in which lie housed his motor lorries. Approval was given for the erection of additions estimated to cost £100. The matter was brought to my notice by certain local bodies. Although the approval given by the Municipality of Bankstown related only to a few additions to a galvanized iron shed, we find that that structure has disappeared and in its place is a building of considerable proportions. This is located in a large yard which has been concreted in recent months. The dimensions of the structure are estimated, from photographs placed before me, at a length of 140 f t . or 150 f t . , a width of 60 f t . and a height of from 30 f t . to 40 f t . The building is of steel girder construction and has a concrete floor, the sides and roof being of corrugated fibro sheets. In the roof are 24 glass windows. According to estimates supplied to me, this building would cost between £3,000 and £4,000. price according to Allied Works Council standards ? question. I have drawn attention to this matter, not merely because it appears to show a breach of the approval given by the department, but also because there seems to be something sinister for aeroplanes, but f a r too large for motor lorries. In addition, a double garage has been built on the premises, fronting a new concrete road. This is constructed of texture bricks, and has a tiled roof and steel roller shutters. The plans were submitted to the Bankstown council and the work was estimated to. coat £27. I understand that roller shutters consist of materials that are frozen, but they alone would have cost more than £27. I do not know whether the council has approved the erection of this building, but I understand that the estimated cost is from £250 to £300. Another building on the same premises has been reconstructed. It was removed from another part of the district and rebuilt on a site adjoining the large building to which I have already referred. Even the local aldermen seemed to be unaware of any approval having been given for the work. It would be interesting to know whether only a few individuals are concerned in this matter or whether people who should have protected the interests of the ratepayers and the community are also implicated. A concrete road was recently constructed past the premises.

The honourable member brought this matter to my notice some time ago, and it is now under investigation by my department. Many of the points which he raised do not come under my jurisdiction at all. For example, the construction of a concrete road by a municipality does not come under the jurisdiction, of any federal department, and I do not think that it would be wise for the Commonwealth Government to interfere in such a matter. Investigations of this kind take some time. One must make certain first of all that the work does in fact come under the. building regulations. has approved the work, that is sufficient done. proof that it comes under the regulations ? ber mentioned the concreting of a yard.

We have to learn who erected the building, whose land it stands on, and all this information must be collected after the building has been completed. My department cannot maintain an army of inspectors, and we must rely upon the local government inspectors to keep us advised of breaches of the regulations that occur in their municipalities. If breaches occur without action being taken it is probably because we have not been advised by the local authority. Once a building has been completed, much investigation is necessary before the offence can be sheeted home to a particular person. be easy to ascertain who applied for the permit. of the materials used? Is that not the concern of the Department of War Organization of Industry? are concerned only with whether the expenditure on a building is in excess of the amount fixed in the permit.

On the 29th November last the Director of Service Foodstuffs told us that we could depend upon obtaining labour even if it was necessary to make soldiers available. We were content with ihat assurance, because last year we had obtained the services of 200 servicemen of eighteen and nineteen years of age, as well as of a number of aborigines. We consulted regularly with the chairman of the District War Agricultural Committee, who regularly advised the manpower authority in Brisbane regarding the requirements of the industry. The crop is a good one, and harvesting operations must commence at once. The growers have done their part, but so little co-operation has there been between the department in Melbourne, which gave us the assurance with regard to labour, and irs office in Brisbane, that the Brisbane office was not even advised of what our requirements were. No action was taken by the head office or by the State office, and the only help we received was from the State department in control of aborigines. Some months ago the appropriate authorities . were advised of the approximate date when the labour would be required. A minimum of 600 men is required, but, so far, only 80 aborigines and nineteen soldiers aged eighteen or nineteen years have been supplied, despite the assurances given on which basis plantings were made. The crop is worth about £500,000. Already the September planting has been lost, and the October planting is in process of being lost. It is probable that five-sixths of the crop will be lost to the country. Man-power, Commerce and Agriculture and the Army are involved. On four successive days last week I sent telegrams from Kingaroy to the Minister for the Army( Mr Fordo). After the receipt of two of them, the Minister replied that the matter was being investigated and he would let me know with what result. 11 took him to the end of the week to say that his department was not responsible, and that I should consult the Director of Man Power. Surely, he could have told me that in the first instance. I had also sent telegrams to the Man-power Directorate in Brisbane, but they were not even acknowledged, notwithstanding Mr Adermann. that I am the member for the district and chairman of the Peanut Board, and also that labour for the work was definitely promised.

Peanuts will not keep on the bushes for more than a week. I did not wish to bring this matter forward in the Parliament, but the peanuts have been grown at the request of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and growers have cooperated with the department to the full. They have informed the department of the action they proposed to take, and yet Three departments, namely, they are in danger of losingfive-sixthsof the crop. One difficulty associated witli soldier labour for this work is that soldiers have to volunteer for it. They are not keen to do so. One soldier told me that soldiers had had a raw deal when working in the sugar industry and did not want a repetition of it. I do not know whether that is correct or not. I understand that a colonel has been engaged to recruit men for this work. at award rates? ments have been made for the proper accommodation and treatment of the men.

It is possible to earn £2 a day at this work; £1 a day can be earned easily. The growers are prepared to do almost anything to save the crop. Committees have been appointed to protect the interests of all concerned, so that one grower shall not outbid another, and that no worker shall be fleeced. I am concerned about this industry and want to save the crop for the country. I hesitated to bring this matter forward tonight, but I did not wish another 24 hours to elapse without something being done. did well to bring it, forward. As soon as the House adjourns I shall see what can be done in the matter. for Information) [11.18] -Earlie r today the honourable member for Hume( Mr Puller) directed my attention to a. Melbourne Herald editorial reflecting on the censorship. I have a further reply which, with the approval of honourable members, I shall incorporate in Hansard. The article contains the stupid allegation that censorship of overseas messages was unduly strict and resulted in the presentation of an' inaccurate picture of conditions and opinion in Australia. I have now read the article, which is a tissue of misstatements, obviously inspired by Sir Keith Murdoch, whose distorted pictures of Australian conditions and our Australian outlook, unfit him to express an unbiased view on any matters of national importance. I might add that there is general agreement in Australia that this frustrated knight is not, in his present state of mind, capable of forming a balanced judgment in regard to censorship or any other matter. It costs this country £66,000 a year to subsidize press cablegram messages sent from Australia to America.. That expenditure was agreed to in the belief that the true story of Australia's heroic effort would be sent round the world, with consequent advantage to this country. Some benefit has resulted from this expenditure. A number of visiting overseas correspondents have sent out fine stories about us. But, unfortunately, there are a few righteous Sir Keith Murdoch, who would, if not watched, do incalculable harm to this country. References in Japanese broadcasts to Murdoch's articles prove that his efforts in this direction have been noted and approved. It is unfortunate that considerations of national security prevent disclosure to this House of some of the bad and damaging stories which have been lodged in Australia for despatch at the subsidized rate to America. In due time, when such disclosure can safely be made, censorship will be proved to be right. The one object of publicity censorship is to protect Australia's war effort against all forms of subversive activity. That job is being done fearlessly, impartially and satisfactorily.
