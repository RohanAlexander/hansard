As a slight memento of the occasion, I have issued instructions that every member of the Federal Parliament shall have a complete set of Australian stamps presented to him. of the 6th October, in a paragraph headed, ""Experience in Adelaide: Calls reduced, Subscribers increased,"" that the introduction of the toll system has resulted there in a reduction in the number of calls, and that in Melbourne it has had a bad effect on the number of new subscribers connected during September. I wish to know if that statement is correct? Is it borne out by the official figures, or has.the Age information not in the possession of the Postmaster-General? ment that the number of subscribers had decreased by reason of the introduction of the toll system, I caused inquiries to be made, and ascertained that in September of last year there were 159 applications for telephones in Victoria, and the new lines actually connected were 182 j in September of this year the number of applications was 194, and the new subscribers actually connected 220.

The berthing accommodation at Williamstown, hitherto allowed the Defence Department by the State authorities, has been encroached upon to such an ex1 tent that Captain Cresswell has reported that there is not sufficient room at our disposal to carry out tlie work.

Yes, but the Regulation in question applies to the Military Forces only, and does not apply to Cadet Corps. 2. The Regulation came into force on the ist March, 1904 (the date on which the Commonwealth Defence Act 1903 was proclaimed!, consequently no period of command would terminate, under the Regulation, until 28th February, 1909. Since that date fifteen Commanding .Officers have been transferred to the Unattached List, or retired on termination of their periods of command. 3. The Victorian Rifles were formed on the 27th November, 10,06, and the present Commanding Officer has been in command of the Corps since that date. 4. From ist November, 1901, to 26th November, 1906. 5. It is understood that the Victorian Rifles on formation were recruited chiefly from the Victorian Senior Cadet Battalion.

E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N BILL. move That this BiU be now read a second time. In submitting this measure, I shall content myself with stating a few facts which I think will prove that it should be enacted. The White Australia principle is one to which we are all proud to give our arjhesion. We are also proud of the fact that this Parliament was called into existence for the particular purpose of crystallizing the opinion of the people with regard to White Australia legislation. We carried out the duty as well as was possible in the circumstances, but it remained for us to discover in the course of time certain defects in our legislation, and one of these I intend to draw the attention of the House to very briefly. So far as lay in our power we have preserved the purity of the citizenship of Australia within our borders. laid down the principle that only people of the white race shall have the full rights and privileges of Australian citizenship. But we have not followed up the principle as we should have done. It is a very remarkable discovery to me that people, especially young persons, can and are being deprived of their rights as citizens in a way for which the law at present affords no remedy. I have a concrete illustration to put before the House. tralian girl who has been taken out of Australia by a native of India, and, as far as I can see at present, permanently deprived of her rights of Australian citizenship. In addition to that, she has been apostasizecT. to Mabonupedanism, and is going to be brought up in that faith. WhilstI do not wish to accuse those who are responsible for so training the little girl, of any deliberate intention to be cruel to her, or of improper dealing with her, still those who understand anything about the customs, habits, and ideas of the people of India, will realize that the fate in store for her is something which Australians cannot contemplate with equanimity. I do not know whether there are many more cases of that description, but it is within the bounds of possibility that such cases have happened, and that many more will happen. It is for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of such' cases that I ask the House to pass this measure with as little delay as possible.' I have, of course, sought to find a precedent in the laws of the Mother Country. [11.50] I While there is a great mass of legislation in connection with the protection of children from unfair treatment, I am unable to find any particular legislation which would deal with such a case as the one I am putting before the House. English law is very definite in its protection of children from actual cruelty'. But I am not able to say in connection with the case I cited that there has been any positive cruelty according to the ordinary interpretation of the word. As regards minors who are possessed of property in England, the Court of Chancery was expressly constituted in order to take charge of their interests. The laws and regulations by which the Court carries out its duties are very specific in regard to the rights of its wards. One condition which is rigorously observed by the Court is that no ward shall be removed from its jurisdiction unless with its consent. Putting together the existing English laws with regard to the prevention of positive We have cruelty to children and the precaution taken by the Court of Chancery against the removal of its wards from its jurisdiction, I think I can fairly claim a precedent for my measure, even in English law. I want to preserve for all White Australians their rights as citizens of this country. I think"" that, even where parents fail in their duty to their children .in this respect, we ought not io allow the ordinary accepted rights and powers of parents over children to stand in It is tbe case of a little Ausour way. Parents certainly are the guardians of their children, and have a very considerable power indeed. But the law always puts an end to that",16,Federal Capital Model Of Site Molongl O River Locality Map

40,Mr Fowler (Perth),"power at the point where ill-treatrnent or injustice is meted out to a child. And with regard to the position I am now indicating, I contend that no greater injustice can be perpetrated on a little white child than that it should be taken into a heathen country and there taught in a religion other than the one which it was born to and would have been brought up in had it been allowed to remain in its native country. And when we contemplate the fate of such a child, especially that of a little girl, in view of the life of women in India, surely we need not hesitate in placing my proposed measure on the statute-book at the earliest possible moment. I have also introduced into the measure protection for the aboriginal natives of Australia. taking of an aboriginal native out of Australia for any reason whatever. I remember in the old days, in Western Australia, having heard it stated more than once that aboriginal natives of the north-west were decoyed on board pearling vessels, ancl frequently marooned on the shores on the southern parts of Asia, after they had served the purpose of those who had taken them away. I have no proof that such has taken place; I .have only the talk of those who claimed to have some knowledge of the facts. A t the present time, however, there is no protection against aboriginal natives being taken out of the country, and they may be practically kidnapped. .a native out of Australia not have to be obtained from the Protector of Aborigines? would be necessary. brought a native on to a ship about to leave Australia, there is no law to prevent may explain that it is over a year ago since that native being taken away.

I remember, as a boy, going into one of the shows or exhibitions popular at fair time in the country towns of the Old Country, and finding there an aboriginal native of Australia who performed certain antics, and thus earned money for his employer, or, as I believe now, his master. What became of him I know not, but it is hardly likely that he, having served the purpose of those who had the poor creature on exhibition, trouble would be taken to return him to his native land. At any rate, I am only proposing to do now for the aboriginal native of Australia what has already been done for the native of Papua. It may surprise honourable members to know that under an Ordinance of Papua it is aI desire to forbid the penal offence to take a native out of the country; but we here, representing the people of Australia, and having duties to perform in regard to aborigines, have neglected, up to the present time, to preserve to them those rights of domicile which are given to the natives of Papua. I have to thank the head of the Attorney-General's Department, Dr. Garran, and his subordinates, for the assistance they have so willingly rendered in drafting this Bill in consonance with the Constitution, and with a view to making it as effective as possible. All through I have endeavoured to meet the circumstances as nearly as possible, with proper regard to justice and fair play. I do not think that I have gone any further than I am f u l ly warranted in going, at any rate, no further than I believe the people of Australia will expect this Parliament to go in the protection of their I do not think that children.

There is one portion of the report from India which demands some further attention. It is the statement "" in the same house is the native wife of Nawab Khan."" I thought it was somewhat singular that this man, having a. native wife in India, should come to this country and marry a white woman without let or hindrance. I inquired from the Secretary to the Crown Law Department, State of Victoria, as to whether there was any official record of the marriage between Nawab Khan and the mother of this little girl. I may add that the State authorities have given me very willing assistance in going into this matter, and I wish to mention particularly the names of Mr Callaway, the permanent head of the Chief Secretary's Department of this State, and Mr Anderson, the Secretary of the Crown Law Department. Writing to me on the 24th August, Mr Department statesAnderson saysDEAR SIR, Tn continuation of my note of the 16th inst., I am desired by the Minister lo inform you that he has caused a search to be made in the office of the Government Statist, but no record can be traced of anv marriage contracted in this State by Noab or Nawab Khan, who is alleged to be married to the mother of the white girl Leontene Adell, mentioned by you. In the absence of strict proof that a valid marriage has taken place and that his lawful wife was living at the time he (Nawab Khan) went through the form of marriage with the woman referred to in this State (which does not appear to have happened), it will be seen that a prosecution for bigamy could not succeed. Yours faithfully, W. R. ANDERSON. I suggested that the mail had committed bigamy in marrying a white woman whilst having a native wife alive in India. As there was no record of such a marriage, and as I knew that this woman regarded herself, and passed herself, as the wife of Nawab Khan, I suggested to the Underwoman herself could throw some light on the subject. He wrote to me as follows :Chief Secretary's Office, Victoria. Sth September, igio. DEAR SIR, With reference to previous correspondence on the subject of the case of Noab Khan, of Leitchville, who is alleged to have taken a white child to India and returned without her, I have to forward herewith, for your information, a copy of a recent report received from the police officer at Cohuna in connection with the case. Yours faithfully, Under Secretary. The report is as followsStation, North-West Police District, 6th . September, 1910. Report of Mounted Constable Docking, 5032, relative to alleged marriage of Mrs. KhanI have to report that I interviewed this woman and she stated she was married to Noab Khan according to the rites of the Mahommedau religion, on the 6th January, IQO6, by Mever Abdullah, at 60 Cardiganstreet, Carlton. There were two witnesses present at the ceremony, one of them bein* Marmdeem Tellie, Exhibition-street, shirt manufacturer. She has no marriage lines or any documentary evidence of the marriage. . . . . .1 Noab Khan has now sold his farm to the Closer Settlement Board, and will be giving up possession in March, after which he and the woman intend leaving for India. Having received this letter and its enclosure, I asked the Victorian Crown Law Department whether this was a case of bigamy. Evidently there is some doubt about the matter. ' The Secretary of the I think whatever ceremony was performed by M. Abdullah had no validity unless Abdullah represented himself as a minister of religion and cither of the parties to the marriage bond fide believed that he was a minister of religion (vide section 17, Act 1166). I made these inquiries regarding the validity of the alleged marriage, in order to ascertain the position in which Nawab Khan stood towards this little white child. If the alleged marriage is not lawful, be is not the stepf ather of the child; and, I think, it is a monstrous state of affairs that an alien can come into Australia, leaving a native wife behind him in his own land, and contract an alleged marriage with a white woman, and that there should be difficulty as to whether he is punishable or not. At any rate,-in the present uncertain state of the law, I cannot ascertain definitely whether Nawab Khan is the legal custodian of the little girl. I intend to follow up the matter somewhat further. ' I think everybody will admit that the position is very unsatisfactory. I have had the utmost difficulty, and experienced much surprise and disgust in arriving at anything like an understanding of the law as it applies to such a case as this. As far as any offence against the child is concerned, the Secretary to the Crown Law Department intimates to me that the law, as nearly as it applies to such a case, is as followsWhoever shall unlawfully take or cause to be taken any unmarried girl being under the age of sixteen years out of the possession and against the will of her father or mother or of any other person having the lawful care or charge of her shall be guilty of a misdemeanor; and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the Court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years. (Act 1079, section 52.) The comment of the Secretary is as followsThe position, therefore, is that if the mother chose to appoint Naob Khan as the guardian of her child she had f u l l power to do so. But even if she did not formally appoint him her guardian, it is clear from paragraphs 1 and 2 that Naob Khan committed no crime so far as the State of Victoria is concerned in taking the child to another country if the mother was a consenting party. That is the case. I have brought it to a point at whicli I must leave it for the present; but I think I have given enough evidence to justify the proposals I put forward in this Bill. Here we have an astounding state of affairs. In spite of our regard for the White Australia principle, in spite of the steps we have taken, as we imagined, to safeguard that principle, a native of India, leaving a native wife behind him, comes to this country and takes up with a white woman who has already had a child by a white man.

All this is done apparently without the man incurring any great danger from the law. I think these facts prove, in the first place, that a measure of this kind is urgently required to protect white children born in this country from such a fate; and, in the second place, the relationship set up between this man and the mother of the child emphasizes the necessity for the Federal Parliament taking up, at the earliest possible moment, the whole question of the marriage laws and putting them upon a uniform and more satisfactory basis than they are at present.

The honourable member has been at pains to ascertain the conditionsunder which the little girl was taken away by a coloured alien, and the circumstancesof her life in India. He was extremely anxious to cause her return to die Commonwealth, and I think the House will agree that it would be much better for the 1 child to be brought back and reared amongst people of her own race. There are many difficulties associated with the case, the initial difficulty being that of removing a child from the guardianship of its mother. It is a matter over which this Parliament has no control. The mother in this case is properly the legal guardian, and unless it could be shown that she was a woman of dissolute or drunken habits, unfit to take care of the child, we could not take her from her. Mv. FOWLER -There is no such imputation in this case. every reason to believe that the mother is kind to the girl, and is fit to control her.

At the request of the honourable member for Perth, the Department of External Affairs communicated with the authorities in India to ascertain whether the child was being properly treated, and received in reply the letter whicli the honourable member has read to the House. letter the following short quotation:The child has been taught Hindustani by a European woman, now living in the neighbouring village of Kahdir Khan. The woman is reported to be the daughter of a bandmaster at Mardan, and to have run away from her home several years ago, and married a' tum-tum driver, and become a Mohammedan. There is no suspicion that the child Leon Adell is ill-treated, but her education is being entirely neglected, and the people with whom she is living belong to a low social order, and are very poor. The statement that the girl is living with people of low social order, who are very poor, does not in itself disclose a sufficient ground for a request for her expatriation, more especially as we have the written declaration of the mother that she desires that she shall be brought up in India. The Department of External Affairs endeavoured to induce the mother to have the child returned to Australia, and the Secretary in the following letter intimated to her its willingness to pay the costMadam -In consequence of the interest taken in the circumstances of your child, Leon Adell, the Government recently caused inquiries to be made in India, and have now ascertained that she is living in the house of Gulab Khan, a brother of your husband. The report states that while there is no suspicion that the child is ill-treated, her education is being entirely neglected, ancl the people with whom she is living belong to a low social order, and are very poor. The reference is to inquiries made from the motherIt was understood, when inquiries were made in September last that you intended shortly going to India yourself with a view to living there permanently. In the event of your having altered that intention I am instructed to inform you of the above facts in case you might like to have the child brought back to this country. Should you desire to do so and require any assistance from the Government, I shall be pleased if you will communicate with me. To this communication no reply was received. In response to inquiries made by the Department, the woman had stated that she intended shortly to leave for India, and that with that object in view she proposed to dispose of the farm.

I need not harrow the feelings of honourable members by reading further extracts dealing with this case. From the letters of some of the children to their parents here, it is clear that they were cruelly and wrongfully treated. Another case of Ihe kind was brought under the notice of the Department only quite recently, and this has reference to the treatment of the children in another Liliputian Opera Company. A letter was received from the Consul-General at Manilla, referring to the treatment of a boy, named NeilI Connelly. This boy is eleven years of age, and his parents reside in Melbourne. He applied to the Consul for assistance, stating that he had been a member of Liddiard's Liliputian Opera Company, now touring the Philippine Islands, and that, although his contract was only for eighteen months, he had been detained for Court held two years, and, in consequence of this ancl of bad treatment, he had run away from, Mr Liddiard and his company are in Mindanao, and will be there for another month or so. Connelly's story has been confirmed by a Mr Posner, who was a passenger on the same boat on which the Liliputian Opera Company travelled from Manilla to Mindanao. This gentleman gives me a very unsatisfactory account of the manner in which the children are second at 5, and have to reheaTSe every morning for some three hours before they get anything to eat. They get practically no schooling, and At a performance on Tuesday some of them can barely read or write the simplest English words. Moreover it appears to me extremely reprehensible on Mr Liddiard's part to take these children to military camps and out of the way I deem it my duty to bring the above to Your",23,Lillie Khan WA Callaway

I have never heard of cases of aboriginal natives being taken away. the stable door after the horse is stolen.

The proposal I have referred to will cover the case of aboriginal natives. titled to our thanks for having brought the case to which he has referred under the notice of the House. He has very properly suggested that Commonwealth legislation should be passed to deal with such matters. Certainly the facts which he has narrated regarding the expatriation of a white girl from Australia, and her introduction to India in charge of an Indian, are sufficient to shock one's conscience, and show the necessity of doing something to prevent the repetition of such an outrage. It can hardly be said that the Indian in question had any legal rights -per se, or through the alleged marriage.

Sir JOHN QUICK I think the power to control emigration would be sufficient to permit of the passing of laws interfering even with parents taking away their children in circumstances in which that may be deemed advisable or according to the exercise of some Ministerial or judicial authority. 'No doubt, as has already been suggested, such a power would have to be exercised with great caution.

It may be a special case which may not very frequently occur, and it is to be hoped that it will not. But the Minister has drawn attention to a number of other cases that should properly be dealt with in any proposed legislation relating to the deportation or emigration of children under what are known as contractural conditions. I presume that the children composing those Liliputian operatic companies were originally taken out of the Commonwealth by and with the consent of the parents. been contracts made under fair, reasonable, and proper conditions.

I am very pleased at the action of the honourable member for Perth in citing a specific case and going so fully into the matter, and am also glad to be able to congratulate the Ministry upon their determination to legislate to meet that case and others that have been mentioned. That twenty-four children should be taken away in one company and badly, even harshly, treated in various places, and in another company an indefinite number of away from Australia, certainly shocks my imagination. The Ministry may feel assured that they will have the whole of the people of the Commonwealth behind them in their desire and determination to so legislate that these things cannot be in the future. I have risen principally to tell the Ministry that they need have no fear of opposition to such a measure. I am satisfied that there will be no delay or objection on the part of any member of the Opposition to putting a Bill of that sort through al! its stages. Of course, as has been Power ought to be rewell said, such a measure will have to be very carefully drafted, but as soon as it is drafted it has only to be introduced to be carried and become law without delay. The people of Australia are loyal to their own.

113,Mr Fowler (Perth) [12.13],"IIt will be observed that the only crimes for whicli deportation is provided under the Act are crimes of violence against the person. We all know that there are many other crimes just as objectionable. Indeed, there are many which are even worse in the interests of the community than those regarding which deportation is specified by the existing law. sired to meet those cases by framing a small measure, which would extend the powers of the Commonwealth in the matter of the deportation of criminals. The result of my efforts in that direction is now before the House in the form of this Bill. But after the measure had been framed, I discovered, somewhat to my surprise, that we are even behind tlie laws of Great Britain in this respect. In 1905 an Aliens Act was passed by the British Parliament which empowers the Secretary of State to expel any alien from the United Kingdom on conviction practically of any crime. The portion of the Act which deals with this matter is sub-section 1 of section 3, which readsThe Secretary of State may, if he thinks fit, make an order (in this Act referred to as an expulsion order) requiring an alien to leave the United Kingdom within a time fixed by the order, and thereafter to remain out of the United Kingdom(a) if it is certified to him by any Court (including a Court of summary jurisdiction) that the alien has been convicted by that Court of any felony or misdemeanour or other offence for which ren are not qualified to become electors. the Court has power to impose imprisonment without the option of a fine. Seeing that this legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom so recently as 1905,'I think I am perfectly justified in asking this Parliament to place our law in regard to the deportation of criminals upon an equality with that of the Old Land. In order to achieve that object, I propose at a later stage to move to amend clause 2 of the Bill by inserting after the Word '' offence'' the words ""or on summary conviction of any offence for which the Court has power to impose imprisonment without the option of a fine."" That amendment would have the effect of bringing the provisions of the Bill into uniformity with the legislation which has been enacted in England in regard to aliens and their deportation. Nobody can accuse us of being extreme if we go no further than that. In order to bring the measure into conformity with the Commonwealth law as regards those matters, I propose, in clause 2, to make an elector's right the proof of citizenship.

I feel sure that we need have no hesitation in going thus far in the matter of deporting from Australia criminals who have no right to be here, who in the best of circumstances are here only under toleration, and whose presence must certainly be undesirable when crimes are committed by them. The country ought not to tolerate their presence any longer than is necessary to make arrangements for their deportation. only just glanced at this Bill, and while I sympathize with the motives of the honourable member for Perth, and agree with him that, as far as possible, we ought to prevent the immigration of the criminal class and provide for their deportation, if they do come here, I question whether we ought to go to the length of British legislation in regard to the matter. 1905 the Imperial Parliament, acting upon a fear that alien immigration-especiall y the immigration of anarchists-migh t lead to unfortunate results if it were not checked, enacted die legislation to which our attention has been directed. Some of the weekly newspapers described it as "" panic "" legislation. Conservatives. not make it right. Very often the Conservatives pick up the unconsidered trifles' of the Liberals. there was a general desire in the Old Country to limit the so-called invasion of aliens who, having left the Continent perhaps for reasons which affected their relations to the State, would be out of sympathy with the principles which guide domestic government at Home. The Imperial Parliament thought that the best way to get at these persons was to provide for their deportation when they committed crimes of violence. Buti f we are to apply such legislation to all cases in which men are summarily convicted, it will mean that a man who is proved guilty of insulting behaviour in the streets, or who has been convicted! of conduct calculated to provoke a breachi of the peaceI am citing the words of theSouth Australian Act-ma y be deported if he be an immigrant who has not a certificate of naturalization.

I find from a perusal of the documents which have been placed before us, and the informative articles which have been publishedfrom time to time, that the Territory is a very important part of Australia, and I believe that with railway communication and proper administration it will become a very valuable asset, though it may be some years before it will return a profit on the expenditure. monwealth, and development under the control of this Parliament, will lend importance to it, and will enable it to progress by leaps .and bounds. the community think that the Territory is a huge waste, wbereas it possesses a very fine river system, ships of the largest class being able to navigate the Victoria River for a distance of 50 miles from the mouth, and -on the banks of that river there are at least 100,000 square miles of splendid agricultural and pastoral country. understand that the approaches to all these Tivers are exceptional. dredging may be required to remove sand bars. putation on matters of this sort by publishing statements for circulation broadcast throughout the Commonwealth would place himself in a foolish position if his opinions were erroneous. experts are asked to support proposals which will not stand fair investigation, but I do not think that such opinions as are then called for would be given in regard to a big matter like this. der, runs 100 miles inland, and through a large extent of rich plains and valleys and 'forest land. -done a great deal of exploration, particularly in Central Australia, is one on whose opinion we can rely, and he says that land on each side of this river is destined to carry a large agricultural population.

I understand that gold, silver, and copper lodes have been found, but that, . owing to the difficulties of access and the impossibility of getting supplies, nothing Even intelligent members of has been done to work them. The mineral wealth and good water supply of the MacDonnell Range country make it advisable for the Commonwealth to give it close consideration. It has been pointed out that the Territory lies within the tropics, and therefore will not be easy to settle with white people. I have long held the opinion that the Britisher can live in any climate if he will only diet himself correctly. WereI I do not know. I going into an exceptionally hot climate, T should not, like many Englishmen, indulge Probably some in bull-beef and beer, my experience being that you must be careful about your food in the tropics.

I find that the map which is exhibited in the chamber was merely drawn for the purpose of indicating the route of the railways, the railway systems of the States, and a river here and there. If it were taken as a criterion of what Australia is like it would deceive persons very much indeed. It certainly gives a fair idea as to what the continent is like, but as regards the river system, the lake system, the mountain system, and other things, it is sadly deficient. scale. I am not quarrelling with the draughtsman. I understand that it is practically a copy of a map, which was brought in hurriedly during a discussion last session. The map I hold in my hand presents a very different picture. It is studded with lakes, creeks, and rivers, in parts which, according to the large map, appear to be almost desert country. While one need not The Government traverse the whole length of the Territory to point out its many advantages, this map diswater whicli is found on the surface is not I could the ocean, and contains an area of 335,000,000 acres.

On the grounds of morality alone, it will be wise for the Commonwealth to acquire the Territory. I believe that, owing to the customs of the people, a mongrel race is growing up, which is not a credit to Australia. From that point of view it will be very wise to have control of the country. Chinese and aborigines. tains even a greater mixture than that. Indeed, it is hard to tell the colour and the breeds of some of the people. That is very undesirable. Seeing that we have a White Australia policy, we ought to keep the country free from a mongrel race of that type. I find from this pamphlet that the Territory contains splendid deposits of gold, silver, copper, wolfram, ancl many other minerals which might be mentioned It has been proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by pastoralists and others that vast areas are admirably adapted to agriculture and pastoral pursuits. In view of that fact, and of the mineral wealth which' it contains, it is very desirable that the Territory should be taken over by the Commonwealth.

Will they become Federal voters, with power to send representatives to this Parliament to vote moneys which are paid in the form of taxation by the people of the other States in order to benefit the Northern Territory, or, seeing that the Territory forms part of the Commonwealth property, will they be debarred from any share in elections ?

Then we have the Roper, the McArthur, the Adelaide, the Daly, and many other rivers, all of which are navigable. Of course, in some of them the draught of vessels must be very light, but our largest steamers could navigate, for a certain disstance, several of the bigger rivers. say whether the land is taken up along those rivers? large leases along the Roper fell in lately.

Before supporting the measure, one wants to know something about the conditions of the country. I happen to follow the occupation of a farmer. We were told from the Opposition benches recently that no man on this side of the House is interested in the land. in the land, and before taking over this tract of country one wants to know that it is worth taking over. In the Territory the following areas have been taken up:-Are a held under lease in 1908, 1.29,628^ square miles; in 1909, 108,2441 square miles, showing a decrease of 21,384 square miles. That is accounted for by the fact that two leaseholds on the Roper River have been forfeited, and have been reserved for pastoralists. The area held under permit in 1908 was 33,848 square miles. In 1909 this had increased to 45,379 square miles, or an increase of 11,531 square miles. The leases surrendered or forfeited in 1908 comDavid Lindsay, prised 6,194 square miles, and in 1909 21,384 square miles, or an increase of 15,190 square miles. Permits expired comprised 6,064 square miles in 1908, and 2,060 square miles in 1909, or a decrease of 4,004 square miles. Permits applied for in 1908 were 8,423 square miles, and in 1909 14,936^ square miles, or an increase of 6,513! square miles. The rents received from all this great extent of councountry did not reach a very large sum. They totalled, in 1908, £8,329 12s. 9d., and in 1909, £8,895 S-, or an increase IC| of £565 17s. 3d. The reason why more of this land has not been taken up is the suspension of the granting of land tenures. Although that, to a great extent, has been justifiable, it has at the same time checked the pastoralists from taking up a great extent of country. I hope that when the Federal Government takes control of the Territory and opens up the country with a proper railway system, the population will go ahead by leaps and bounds. To men who are asked to go on the land and work it to the best advantage, the matter has twice the of transport means a great deal. In my district, great numbers of farmers are found congregated in different localities, simply because in those parts good roads are provided, and better facilities are obtained for the transport of produce. In the Northern Territory, we have the Pine Creek railway running several hundred miles south, and then there is the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway coming north for some 688 miles, but in between there is a great stretch of country, mostly in the temperate zone, the southern . part of which has no means of transport whatever.

208,Mr Ozanne,"I hear these ""LittleEuropeans have increased by 193. It has tbeen said, and to a certain extent rightly, that the country is unsuitable for Europeans. Corporal C. Power, a police officer of nine years' experience in different parts of the Territory, has made the following statements. Any steady robust European can work all the year. Does not know whether he could compete with Asiatics. Has seen Europeans wellsinking, mining, fencing, & c , on both high and low-lying lands. They are more subject to fever on the low than the high country. Mr C. J. Dash wood, formerly Government Resident in the Northern Territory, statesThe climate around Port Darwin is not particularly unhealthy for the male sex, but it is not very healthy for women and children. These are points on which people differ, but if we can improve the surroundings and give settlers better means of transport, while introducing proper sanitary conditions, I have no doubt that Europeans could live there happily and comfortably. tion is the rainfall of the country. parts of Victoria, especially the Werribee district, we have had a rainfall as low as 16 inches, but that has been sufficient to insure us fair crops. In the Territory, over 6,300 square miles of country have a rainf a l l of less than 10 inches, while 2113,430 square miles have a rainfall of from 16 to 20 inches, 96,790 square miles a rainfall of from"" 20 to 30 inches, 120,600 square miles a rainfall of from 30 to 40 inches, and 86,500 square miles a rainfall exceeding 40 inches. Therefore, all that is needed is proper conservation to make droughts of little consequence. The country between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta has been described as a desert, but I found that, although in places the land is thickly covered with stones, and there is .much diorite rock, over two-thirds of it , if there were water, would be as fine as any in Australia. A t Beresford, the Government have made a reservoir, which at the time of my visit was filled to overflowing. Four miles from Oodnadatta I saw a Chinaman's garden, the proprietor of which has conserved in the bed of the creek enough water to last him until next April should no rain f a l l until then. He was growing lucerne, lettuce, peas, and all the vegetables required in the district. family ? aboriginal woman, and is helping to increase the mongrel races referred to by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. Although my lucerne in Victoria had not commenced to grow, that at Oodnadatta was 3 feet high at the time of my visit, showing what could be done by irrigation. In general conversation, I picked up all the information that I could, and learnt that round about the MacDonnell Ranges is some of the finest country in Australia. The rainfall in the coastal districts of the Northern Territory is very great. During thirty-two years it has averaged 62 inches; the largest f a l l for any year being 81.72 inches, and the lowest 42.44 inches. Unlike Victoria, where every climate may be experienced in a week, the Northern Territory has only its wet season, from October to April, and its dry season, from May to September. The heat is not excessive, the maximum day temperature in the dry season being 89 degrees, and the minimum night temperature 56, while in the wet Another important consideraseason the maximum day temperature is 96, In and the minimum night temperature 65. It would be necessary to instruct agriculturists going there in the proper treatment of tropical crops. Experts have reported that there are great facilities for the grow. ing of both lowland and upland rice. To show what can be done by tlie aid of artesian water, I would instance the date plantations at Hergott Springs and Lake Harry. At the latter place there are about 2,000 palms, planted 50 to the acre, and irri gated from a bore. From thirty-five trees 2,000 lbs. of dates were obtained, and the manager told me that the f r u it sold in Adelaide at 6d. a lb. I ate some of the dates, and found them remarkably good. Geologists declare that there is very richmineral country in the Northern Territory, but, because of the dearness of transit, not much mining has been done there. In 1909, the value of the gold won was £34>9° > and of the tin £ 3 7 , 4 9 6 . Very2 little copper has been obtained during 1909, owing to the low price of the metal, and the same remark applies to wolfram. Wheni t costs from £3 to £5 a ton to transport ore to the battery, a very rich yield is necessary to give a profit. With railway communication, the difficulties of transport will be reduced. There are great possibilities for pastoralists in the Northern Territory. A",37,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill No 2 Second Reading

210,Mr Ozanne,"He is married to anestablish a trade with the East, but, unfortunately, a consignment of cattle sent to the Philippines were infected with pleura. Proper inspection, and the guarantee that the cattle sent away are free from disease, is essential to the success of the meat export industry. there were 360,000 head of cattle in the Territory, while on the 30th December, 1908, Victoria Downs station had 76,540 head, and those branded during the year numbered 17,298 head. The cattle sold, however, numbered only 6,000 head. This was due to the cost and difficulty of transit. Dr. Holtze, the Director of the Adelaide Botanical Gardens, and formerly Curator of the Palmerston Gardens, says that there is quite enough suitable land in the northern part of the Territory to make it prosperous. He says that there is land suited for tropical products all along the sea coast, and on the banks of the rivers, and that within 80 miles of the coast there is an area of 80,000 square miles, or upwards of 51,000,000 acres, capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of persons with its produce. Victoria, it may be remembered, supports over 1,000,000 persons on an area of 56,000,000 acres. Farmers there could engage in the cultivation of rice, into account the cost of the line projected tobacco, maize, Indian corn, cassava, cotton, and many other tilings. Some of the bore water is mineralized, but some of it is quite fresh, and fish have been found in a number of springs. South Australia took over the Northern Territory in 1863, since when she has built the Adelaide to Oodnadatta railway, which has a length of 688 miles, at a cost of £2,242,000, and the Port Darwin to Pine Creek railway, at a cost of £1,266,000. On the Oodnadatta line is a splendid piece of engineering work, the Angebuckina bridge, which is 1,900 feet long, and cost something like £60,000. As doubts have been expressed as to the condition of the permanent-way, let me say that, although I travelled over it at express speed, the easy running of the train was in marked contrast to the violent oscillation of the Adelaide-Melbourne express. sleepers appeared to be in perfect order, and the railway is one of the finest and smoothest that I have had the pleasure of travelling on. line at a rate exceeding 40 miles an hour. is properly laid, ancl in good condition. a very big problem when it took over the Territory in 1863, and has endeavoured !o the utmost to cope with the responsibilities of the position. Large sums of money were spent in prospecting votes, and on surveying and exploring parties; and South Australia has to be congratulated most In 1907 heartily on the fact that she tried to keep, and has succeeded in keeping, this great Territory white. Had the example of another State been followed and black labour introduced, there might have been some financial gain, and probably it would not have been necessary to ask the Commonwealth to take over the administration now. To her everlasting glory, however, South Australia, as I say, has kept this vast part of Australia white. Furthermore, while other States pursued the policy of alienating as much land as possible, South Australia, out of a total acreage of 353,000,000 acres, has parted with only 473,809 acres. There are at present under pastoral lease 99,000,000 acres, with a currency of from twenty-five to forty years, and provision is made for resumption on giving two years' notice and paying compensation. It is proposed by South Australia that the Commonwealth shall assume all the liabilities in respect of the Territory, taking in order to connect with the Pine Creek line, and ultimately to form a transcontinental line from Adelaide to Port Darwin. The yearly deficit on the Northern Territory is at present £164,398; the sinking fund 011 the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta is £77,694; and the interest, at 3J per cent., on £4,500,000, the estimated cost.of the railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, represents £157,500. The Commonwealth will thus, under the agreement, haye to meet a total loss of £399,592. The public debt on 30th June, 1909, amounted to £2,718,939; the deficit on advance account to £779,734; the cost of the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway was £2,242,342; and the estimated cost of the railway from Pine Creek to Port Augusta is £4,500,000a total of The £10,241,015. On the total acreage of the Territory, this works out at an average of 7d. per acre; and, in view of the facts we have before us, we may conclude that the Commonwealth is getting a great barover the gain. Of course, against the £10,241,015, there are assets. So far as the loans are concerned, they will only be taken up as they mature; £8,000,000 is represented by railways, and the balance by lighthouses, wharfs, and developmental",38,Smith I S He Rearing A Few Years Back An Attempt Was Made To

It is advisable that we should know what is the responsibility we are taking over. seven years the South Australian Government have been trying to develop this Territory; and in 1895 Royal Commission a was appointed to inquire into the reason of the failure. Its report is included in the memorandum drawn up by the ex-Minister of External Affairs, who was very friendly towards the movement. In regard to the reasons for failure, we have this statement in the memorandumWhat causes have led to these results? Have the measures been inadequate, or their execution faulty? Does the country not justify the glowing accounts which its enthusiastic admirers have so freely circulated? After nearly forty years had been spent in The reasons for failures in connection withi attempting to develop the Territory, the mining are given as followsState Government were furnished by a Royal Commission appointed in 1895 with a report giving the following general reasons for the failure of their efforts(a) Most of the township blocks and agricultural lands within 40 miles of Palmerston were bought from the Government in the first instance by speculators, who demanded excessive rents or prohibitive prices from those who were willing to utilize them.

If I have misunderstood the honourable member, I beg his pardon. This matter ought to be approached with an absolute forgetfulness, if possible, of what State one belongs to. It should be regarded from two points of view only ; first, that it is absolutely essential to get railway communication with Port Darwin in the most direct manner, and as rapidly as possible, for the purI am entirely opposed lo pose of defending the whole Continent; and, secondly, that it is necessary to develop the Territory. No one will have the temerity to deny the necessity of rapidly making provision for the defence of Australia. One has only to look at the map to see how ridiculous some of the suggested If we take over the schemes are. I take it that the object of South Australia, in building the railway, was to develop the Territory. She incurred a large debt by constructing a line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and another from Port Darwin to Pine Creek. On the last occasion that this matter was discussed in the last Parliament, parochialism was just as rampant as it is to-day. The honourable member for Parkes, on that occasion, made some extraordinary statements about the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. Some of them have been refuted to-day, and I shall not refer further to them, except to say that the honourable It was with him member's assertion that it was absolutely unsafe to travel over the line at a greater speed than 15 miles an hour is absurd. I The have demonstrated that to my own satisfaction by travelling over the line at 40 miles an hour, and can say, without hesitation, that I never travelled on a smoother line. A great many statements have also I said nothing of the been made about the Territory itself, and the country between Port Augusta and T h a t was the inOodnadatta. It is useless for any honourable member to take up the time of the House by making statements which cannot be verified, regarding matters of this kind. I have been connected with land all I am approaching my life, in pastoral and agricultural pursuits. I know what land is, and what it is capable of bearing. It is quite true that, on a great part of the land traversed by the line which it is proposed to take over, no grass is growing, but some of the I understood the best grazing and fattening country in Australia is not grass, but bush country, and on the land in question any amount of bluebush, saltbush, and other edible plants are growing. Part of that country is also one of the finest grounds that I know of in Australia for the breeding of horses. I have not had the opportunity of traversing the country between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek, but I have conversed with a number of men who have been in that territory, and particularly with men who have been to the MacDonnell Ranges for mining purposes.

I hope to see the gauge difficulty settled by the Commonwealth getting control of the railways of Australia, and introducing uniformity. Western Australia -seems to be forgotten in the proposal under -consideration. It is intended to connect Kalgoorlie with Port Augusta, and we need the aid of Western Australia for the defence of the continent; but if the central line were diverted to the east, troops travelling from Perth to Port Darwin would have to take a very roundabout route. -think that the enemy will let us pick our battle-ground ? will attack us where we are weakest, and at present Port Darwin seems to be the likeliest spot for an attack. We must, therefore, strengthen it with fortifications, and provide railway communication from the various centres of population. The sooner the Commonwealth takes control of the Territory, the better it will be in the interests of the whole people. South Australia could not be expected to burden herself by the construction of a transcontinental line for the defence of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, the agreement entered into by a former Government is a fair one. It has now been before Parliament on several occasions, and I trust that this Bill to ratify it will become law as soon as possible. The present and future interests of Australia make it necessary that we should obtain control of the Northern Territory at the earliest moment. I cannot allow this important measure to pass without having something to say about the proposals before us, though I should have preferred to hear the views of others before continuing the discussion. I must preface my remarks with an appreciation of the indebtedness of Australia to the State of South Australia for its courageous action in taking over the Northern Territory in 1863, and preventing its occupation by coloured races. No praise can be too extravagant to apply to the action of Northern Territory [REPRESENTATIVES.] Acceptance BUI (No. 2). the State in that regard. Unfortunately her forty-seven years of administration have been an admitted failure. Although o v e r £5>ooo,ooo has been spent in the Territory during that period, development has been very slow, and there is an annual loss of nearly £250,000. One of the worse features of the matter is that the population is decreasing. South Australia, in 1880, had a population of 276,393, and in 1907, a population of 392,664, while the population of the Northern Territory in 1881 was 3,435, consisting of 670 Europeans and 2,765 coloured persons, and in 1909, twenty years later, the population was 3,014. This is a saddening state of affairs, though, fortunately, the figures show that the European population has increased by 1,274, while the coloured population has decreased by 1,740. According to the memorandum on the Northern Territory, issued in July, 1909, by the honourable member for Darling Downs, who was then Minister of External AffairsThe net result of the land legislation is seen in the table showing the areas over which the Crown, either temporarily or permanently, has parted with control, but although the pastoral industry has in parts been well established, the population returns show that the country is still practically uninhabited. The Government Resident, in his report for 1.909, says that we are faced with a grave responsibility by reason of the ever-increasing number of half-castes. In 1895 a Royal Commission, appointed from South Australia, summarized the opinions of witnesses regarding the causes of the unsatisfactory condition of the Territory in the following wordsThe failure of the Government to recognise in its management of the Northern Territory the distinctly tropical character of the greater portion of the country. The absence of a bold and vigorous Government policy in the administration of the Colony. The non-success of mining was said to be due toMismanagement, inexperience, extravagance, and the erection of obsolete and other unsuitable machinery. Lax administration of the law in regard to working conditions. The pastoral industry did not prosper because ofSpeculative gambling in leases.

Bad management, extravagance, and incompetency. I have no desire to find fault with the administration of South Australia. Indeed, when one looks at the map, and sees the immense distance between Adelaide and its settled districts and the Northern Territory, with no other communication than that provided by steamers, one cannot wonder at the result. Although South Austtalia has borne the burden of administration bravely for many years, it is thought the time has come when the whole Commonwealth should take it over. It has been stated that the expenditure, which it is proposed that we shall take over, amounts to only 7Jd. per acre, which seems a ridiculous price to pay for the land, but in view of some of the reports upon the country, the price might well be extravagant. I am not so much concerned about the bargain that is being offered to us. It is not only the cost now that has to be considered. We have to face the fact that not only is there a heavy loss on the administration at present, but that the expenditure to which we are asked to commit ourselves means an increasing lossone whicli no one has been able, or has attempted, yet to calculate. As to the character of the country, I shall content myself with reference to a map issued under the direction of the Minister for the Territory, Mr O'Loughlin, and prepared by the Government Geologist, Mr Brown. This map divides the Territory according to the character of the lands into pastoral, good pastoral, and first class pastoral country. As to pastoral country, we are toldPastoral country well watered, good soil, along I propose is to show the absolute absence rivers and creeks; tropical vegetation and coarse grass, good feed after burning; subject to tropical rainfall (54 inches Port Darwin, and 19 inches Daly Waters, for 1905); parts metalbearing and probably coal-bearing. Approximate area-158,00 0 square miles. I do not know very much about the pastoral business, and its technical details ; but I know that if grass is good only after burning, it is coarse, rank, and practically of no use when not burned. not having sufficient stock. country is thus described:Good pastoral country, often rich volcanic soil, well grassed; basalt', sandstone, and limewatered ; subject to intermittent tropical rains. Approximate area-34,30 0 square miles. Of the first-class pastoral country, we are toldFirst-class pastoral country, open, wellgrassed, rich soil, possibly agriculture; subject to intermittent tropical rains. Approximate area-29,00 0 square miles. T h a t is what is know n as the Barkla-y tableland. Downs country. sible for the statements made in this document. That land is, I believe, really first class country, and is admitted to be so by all experts. We are further toldPatches of g'ood country for pastoral purposes, chiefly along creeks and rivers; patches of spinifex scrub and sand hills; uncertain rainfall; parts metal-bearing. Approximate area-148,00 0 square miles. Honourable members will see that that is the part which will be traversed by the proposed transcontinental lineSpinifex scrub and sand-hill country, witli patches of inferior pastoral country; badly watered and uncertain rainfall ; parts metalbearing. Approximate area-162,10 0 square miles. ' That is all I propose to say in regard to trie character of the country. I should be quite prepared to vote for the second reading but for the unfortunate conditions that are attached to the Bill. Honourable members seem to be practically unanimous that it is our urgent duty to take over this Territory, but there is one point of difference which is so absolutely important that, unless it is removed, 1 shall be prepared to vote against the Bill at every stage than the taking over of the Territory? of any necessity for this proposed railway -to show, not only its ihopportuneness^ but its uselessness.

Very soon after an invading force hacl landed in Northern Australia, the British naval power would cut o(f its line of communication, and we should have it entirely at our mercy. power is in the North Sea. Pacific. In any event, why are we proposing to expend. £2,000,000 on an Australian navy unless that navy is to be available to cut off an enemy's line of communication when it has succeeded in effecting a landing on our shores ? If the Minister of External Affairs were directing the expansion of Japan, and in that capacity seeking a foothold for an army in Australia, he would be the last to suggest that the invasion should be made at an unoccupied point. It is only reasonable to assume that an invading force would strike at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, or one of the other State capitals. No enemy would think of landing an invading force 1,000 miles distant from a centre of population. would aim a blow at one of our large centres. Is it reasonable to assume that an invading force would be landed at a point from which it would have to march 1,000 miles with a view of striking at one of our large centres and of capturing the strongest place that we held? No invading force would lie likely to land in the northern part of Australia with that object in view. The only danger is that an enemy might land, and become permanently located there, because of our difficulties in sending up an army to dislodge him. On this point, let me make a quotation from the report presented by Lord KitchenerI would also mention that railway construction has, while developing the country, resulted in lines that would appear to be more favorable to an enemy invading Australia than to the defence of the country. to the break of gauge. that. Different gauges in, most of the States isolate each system, and the* want of systematic interior connection makes the present lines running inland of little use for defence, though possibly of considerable value to an enemy who would have temporary command of the sea. In one of his speeches here, Lord Kitchener advised the people to decide upon a definite railway policy for Australia. railways north and south ? suggest such a foolish scheme. He urged that we should proceed immediately to develop an Australian railway policy, and to form a railway council of war. He emphasized tlie point that we should decide upon a standard gauge; that we should link up our State railway systems, and have our railways so controlled that we should be able to rapidly concentrate our forces and aim an effective blow at any point on the coast. It seems to me that for defence purposes we should have railways constructed, so to speak, in a semicircle, running at an irregular distance from the coast, and linking up the lines stretching inland. In this way we should have at the termini of our present systems railways that would not only provide facilities for the people, but be of material assistance for defence purposes. They would greatly facilitate the work of dislodging an invading force at any point. Our coastal regions will necessarily be for all time the It most populous parts of Australia, and if we have an army it must be drawn from the populous centres. Unless we have reasonable railway facilities to convey, that army from those populous centres to any likely point of attack, our scheme of defence must fail. We need to link up our existing railway systems and make them feeders of one grand Federal railway scheme that will enable us to command any and every point. Before we adopt a railway policy of any kind we must determine the question of a",47,Smith I S He Rearing A Few Years Back An Attempt Was Made To

298,The Mr Finlayson,"I am giving mythe building of a railway is closer settlement, which is an' urgent necessity in Australia. made by honourable members opposite, either in the House or through the press, I say. emphatically, as a member of the Labour party, that I should welcome any scheme of immigration that would settle the people of the older countries on the lands of Australia, and put those lands to profitable . use. We are not opposed to immigration, but are prepared to give a hearty and cordial support to any reasonable scheme that means the opening up of the lands. Closer settlement will, of necessity, extend from the coast inland. The idea suggested by the building of the transcontinental railway is that we are going to settle the Northern Territory from the centre outwards. As a matter of defence, it is necessary to settle the population of Australia along the sea-coast; indeed, the only closer settlement possible in Australia is in those districts. Our worse difficulty lies in the fact that the most valuable agricultural lands, which have easy access to the sea, are locked up; and men desiring to go in for agricultural pursuits have to go any distance from 100 to 500 miles out into the back country, where they are handicapped by having to draw their supplies long distances and pay extravagant railway freights before their produce can reach the markets. The extent of the agricultural development of Australia will depend on the possibility of finding markets for produce. I am sure that the Federal Parliament will not follow the foolish policy adopted in New South Wales of centralizing all the trade of the State into one port. I believe we are willing, to let the trade of the country find an outlet at its natural ports. It is, therefore, our business to see that easy access to the sea is provided for the men carrying on agriculture in the interior. But does any honourable member know of agriculture in the form of closer settlement that is being carried on at a very great distance from the coast? outside distance.

At a distance varying from 100 to 400 miles from the coast, are to be found rich river flats and valuable agricultural areas, on which close settlement is possible. If settlement increases in the Northern Territory, it will be situated chiefly in the coastal districts. It is not likely, however, while extensive areas are available in other parts of the continent in reasonable proximity to markets and centres of population, that many persons will isolate themselves in the Northern Territory. People will not bury themselves in tbe wilderness when they can get land in settled districts close to market.

The natural outlet of the produce from the Barklay district would be by the water-courses whicli run into the Gulf of Carpentaria, on which small steamers or lighters could carry it down to the larger vessels, which now trade from there to the eastern coast of Australia. Furthermore, the Queensland Government contemplate making a railway from Cloncurry to Camooweal, which will tap the Barklay tableland. continental railway would not serve that district at all. Settlers on the tableland would not send their produce 200 . or 300 miles in preference to sending it 100 or 150 miles. Naturally, they would select the cheapest, easiest, and speediest means of transport. The Queensland Government is to-day more alive to the possibilities of the northern parts of Australia than that of South Australia seems to be. Produce grown on the Barklay tableland would either find an outlet by way of Camooweal, VVinton, and Longreach, to Rockhampton, or go north to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The history of our railway construction is the history of attempts to divert trade from its proper channels, and in the case of New South Wales the result has been the aggrandisement of Sydney at the expense of the State. the past in this connection will not be continued in the future. I object to the Commonwealth Government undertaking a spasmodic or partial railway policy. Before we construct railways, we must know what is to be done. I do not understand what right the Constitution gives us to conno mOre than South Australia is carrying struct railways in State territory without State authority, but, in any case, difficulty is likely to arise where Commonwealth and State railways are in the same district.

It would be a good thing to have a uniform gauge, and the freest intercourse between the States; but it is questionable whether the time is ripe for the federalization of the railways. The passing of the Bill, however, will commit us to a partial railway policy, and no Commonwealth railway policy is commendable which will not be national and comprehensive. While I am opposed to heavy loan expenditure for some purposes, I would welcome the borrowing of money for the development of the country by railway construction. Nothing tends more to progress than the providing of railway communication. Although no time is specified in the Bill for the construction of the proposed transcontinental line, we should be expected, if the agreement were ratified, to make it within a reasonable time. It is estimated that the line would cost about £5,000,000, but we The proposed transshall have to provide also for rolling-stock, and meet an annual loss of £250,000 on the administration of the Territory, together with the loss on the existing line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta and on the line that has to be made. At a very low estimate, this would mean an annual deficit of £500,000. We must pause before committing ourselves to such an arrangement. The expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing by leaps and bounds, and one of the arguments used against Federation is that it is increasing the cost of government enormously. Our revenue is' expanding, but our expenditure is also increasing very rapidly; and yet it is coolly proposed, on the invitation of South Australia, to load ourselves with another £500,000 of expenditure per annum in order to make up a deficit. I I hope that the policy of think I have established the fact that there is no hope of any return from this railway in the near future in the way of providing revenue towards the deficit, or towards the repayment of the original loan. now.

I am quite prepared to be misunderstood and misjudged. I cannot see that the proposals before us will conduce to that Federal and fraternal spirit which we are all so anxious to develop. We should encourage each State to develop its own territory as far as possible consistent with the rights and privileges of other States. I suggest that our South Australian friends should, if possible, abandon their "" stand and deliver "" attitude, and should allow the route of the railway, which is the only question dividing the House, to be determined by experts. Whether the line goes east or west-straigh t through the Northern Territory or diverging into .Queensland, or even Western Australiathat is a much more reasonable proposition than the one now before us. But we are asked to take "" the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill ""-it is not a double-barrelled gun, but a six-chamber revolver, fully loaded. If the South Australian Government are, indeed, Nationalists-and I am willing to give them every credit in this connexionthey will allow the Federal Government to decide, through their own experts, after a full knowledge of the facts, what is the best route. to face the fact that there has been no survey of the route, and that this is an absolutely unknown territory, so far as railway construction is concerned. I have proved, more or less effectively, that the railway line suggested will not be useful for defence, and will not assist mining or pastoral occupation, and least of all will it assist closer settlement. It has not been my good fortune to visit the Northern Territory; but I have sought information in the best way open to me on this great and important question. One of the best authorities I know is Professor Baldwin Spencer, whom I had the privilege of hearing lecture on the subject of the Northern Territory. The lecturer, who had a cinematograph which vividly represented the portions of the country he had visited, said that the Territory consisted of excellent pastoral and agricultural land, and was fit for a white population. I am indebted, not only to Professor Baldwin [162] Spencer for information, but also to the Lone Hand, the Sydney Mail, the Review of Reviews and, lastly, but not least, the Melbourne Age. It will probably be within the memory of honourable members that a Commissioner from the Melbourne Age accompanied the Federal Parliamentary party which visited the Northern Territory in 1907, and he has supplied information that has proved invaluable to all of us. I read his articles at the time of their publication with great interest, and took care to preserve them. Dealing in the first place with the question of climate, he expressed the opinion that the climatic conditions of the Northern Territory were for the most part excellent, and well suited to a white population. He also stated that there had been discovered in the Territory some very rich mining country, one reef having yielded as big a return as 1.0 ounces to the ton. It was owing to bad management, he declared, that mining companies had failed. Expensive machinery was erected, and large sums were devoted to building elaborate houses for the mining managers, instead of being used in deep sinking and general developmental work. The honourable member for Moreton, the honourable member for Brisbane, and several others have suggested that the Northern Territory is dry and arid. The fact is that it has sixteen excellent rivers, some of which are navigable. I am informed that the Victoria River is We have navigable for a distance oT about 60 miles by a boat drawing about 10 feet of water. I should like now to draw attention to a statement published by the Age Commissioner in 1907, relative to Victoria Downs, a portion of the Territory outside the area described by the honourable member for Brisbane as comprising the only rich lands to be found there. The Commissioner admitted that he went up north prejudiced against the Territory, but returned a convert to the proposal that the Commonwealth should take it over. Writing of the rich country on the Victoria River known as the Victoria Downs station, he statedAn indication of the value of this property' is shown in the fact that the stock last year .were returned at 60,000 horned cattle. They exported 21,000 during the year, and brandeel 15,000. The stock now on the property is 75,000; therefore, the total increase is 36,000, representing an enormous fortune. That one station was feeding 75,000 head of cattle, and in the year 1907 branded no less than 15,000 head.

The Lakewood basin comprises 200,000 square miles-o r nearly two and a half times the area of Victoria-and the whole of it consists of good pastoral, and some of it of good agricultural country. When the present Leader of the Opposition first advocated the taking over of the Territory, I stood almost alone in Tasmania in support of the proposal. I spoke in its favour at many public meetings, and had to encounter much opposition, due to the fact that the people of my State knew no more of the country than the honourable member for Brisbane apparently knows of it. But after we had educated the people to a true knowledge of its possibilities a change came over the scene, and. on the 13th April last I was returned to this House by an enormous majority pledged to support the transfer. I stated throughout the campaign that if returned I should advocate the taking over of the Territory and also the building of the proposed transcontinental railway, believing that it would tend to the advantage not only of the Northern Territory itself, but of the whole Commonwealth. We are told by a recognised authority that there grow in the Northern Territory 600' plants which could be put to economic uses, and also that portion of the Territory is well suited to the production of cotton. An honourable member has informed the House that the Territory is very' dry, and that in some parts horses would have to scratch for a living. The truth is that there are splendid grasses. There is good grass all the year round in many parts, and the cattle are always in excellent condition. A writer in the Sydney Mail or the Lone HandI forget for the moment which-sai d that he had ridden a horse off the grass in the Northern Territory a distance of 70 miles, and an animal fresh off the grass that could carry a man over that journey at one stretch must have been in-good grazing country. Another illustration of the capacity of the country to carry stock is in the fact that herds of buffaloes exist there, and have proved a source of considerable revenue. A resident of Palmerston pays native boys 6d. a head for killing buffaloes, and has made a large fortune by selling the buffalo hides in London at an average of £ 2 each. I am told by a reliable authority that the hides are sent to determine. for ourselves how the money thence to Russia, where they are tanned, and that the manufactured article is then returned to Australia and sold for bookbinding purposes as the best Russian Mr Laird Smith. leather. Most of the so-called "" best Russian leather "" used for book-binding purposes has come from Australian buffalohides. Leather merchants are crying out for an export duty to encourage the tanning industry, yet the export trade in hides is being encouraged by our failure to take over the Territory. hides have been exported, yet we cannot exterminate the animals. tion on the pointMr Lawrie is a butcher monopolist at Palmerston, where he resides. He keeps about joo store cattle on the run for butchering purposes, but does not breed cattle. He uses his enormous holding simply for the buffalo running wild there, which he employs black boys to shoot, supplying them with cartridges and paying 6d. per hide, of the average value of 40s. each on the London market. Last year he killed' 800 without causing any sensible diminution in the herds, which breed faster than they can be shot down. These buffaloes exist in so-called arid country where one would imagine, after listening to the honourable member for Brisbane, there is not enough feed for a. goat. a statement? of tlie honourable member's speech was in the direction of showing that the Territory is not worth developing. The honourable member made a "" come-in-out-of-the-rain ' r sort of speecha speech which would enable him, while supporting the second reading of the Bill, to propose in Committee an amendment that would make it not worth the paper it is printed on. A great deal of emphasis has been laid on the cost of developing the Territory. Doubtless the expenditure will be very great, but can we, as Australians, avoid it? If we leave South Australia to develop the Territory,, will not die people of Australia still be responsible for the debt which it incurs in that way? At no distant date the Commonwealth will take over the debts of the States, and create one funded stock, so-that if South Australia retains possession of the Territory, and develops it by means of a loan policy, we shall eventually have to bear the cost. I suggest to honourable members that we should take over the Territory, bear the first cost of developing it, and be able shall be expended. That would be a truly national policy.

If the construction of the proposed railway were allowed to remain an open question, we should have in this Parliament a big fight as to the route to be adopted. The honourable member foT Brisbane said that no State would allow the Commonwealth to construct a railway within its borders, but if a line were constructed through the Northern Territory to the Queensland border, the Government of that State would very quickly connect it with its own railway system. The Northern Territory line would thus act as a feeder for the Queensland railway system, and would not be a paying concern, since the most profitable portion of the trade would be secured by the adjoining State.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -The Attorney General says not. ofiicers of South Australia have reported to their Government that it does. Was there ever an agreement entered into between two Governments regarding which, on so vital ar. issue, the Crown Law officers of the contending parties held such entirely divergent opinions? Speaking from memory, I think the report of the South Australian Crown Law officers was reconsidered before being finally issued. It lays down definitely that, under this Bill, the Commonwealth will be obliged by the contract to construct the railway entirely through South Australia and the Northern Territory. Let me read the clause for the benefit of those honourable members who say they are going to support the Bill, and then support an amendment to carry the ranway outside the Territory, through Queensland. It is as followsThe State in consideration of the covenants and agreements by the Commonwealth herein contained shallAt the time of such surrender authorize by legislation the Commonwealth to do all that is necessary to enable the Commonwealth . to construct or cause to be constructed a railway in South Australia proper from any point on the Port Augusta railway to a point on the northern boundary line of South Australia proper to connect with that part of the Transcontinental Railway to be built in the Northern Territory from Port -Darwin southwards to the northern boundary of South Australia proper.

MrM c WILLIAMS constructed the railway. When I hear the '' f u d g e ' ' talked by the honourable member for Denison and others about our owing a debt to South Australia for keeping the Territory white, I reply that South Australia cannot claim credit for that. She spent £ 5 , 0 0 0 , which we are now asked to pay back to her, on importing Cingalese into the Northern Territory to work the mines. me. MrM c WILLIAMS members will take the trouble to turn up the records of South Australia's connection with the Northern Territory, they will find a great deal that will be new to them. South Australia gave the contractor die option 01 constructing the Pine Creek railway with white labour at a certain price, or with coloured labour at another price. Millar Brothers, who had the contract, after attempting for a while to do the work with white labour, sent Mr Sadlier to China, and he brought down hordes of Chinese. The railway, practically from Palmerston down to Pine Creek, was constructed by Chinese labour, and as many of the Chinese as liked to remain in Australia could do so. Thousands of them did remain. The South Australian Parliament has passed Bill after Bill to secure the introduction of coolie labour into the Northern Territory. question, anyhow? MrM c WILLIAMS extent, that amongst the claims put forward on behalf of South Australia is one that we owe her a debt of gratitude for keeping the Territory white. We owe nothing to her on that account, because she never has kept it white. For every white man in the Territory to-day there are three or four coloured people. When she was building the railway, she deliberately imported coloured labour. There were 3,000 miners employed in the Territory some eighteen years ago between Palmerston and practically Pine Creek, but I venture to say there are not 500 whites employed in the mines there to-day. According to the records, almost all the agriculture and mining of the Northern Territory is in the hands of Chinese. Chinese in the Territory now. The honourable member should read the report. MrM c WILLIAMS I have read every The whites never report on the Northern Territory on which I could lay my hands, and I commend to honourable members generally the exceedingly valuable collection to be found in the Commonwealth Library and the Petherick collection.

Honourable T. King, in introducing into the South Australian Parliament the Northern Territorv Immigration Bill, to permit the importation of coolie labour for work in the Territory, saidIt is a well-known fact that, unless we obtain coolie labour, we will never have any plantations. That statement is to be found in the Hansard report of the debate. Mr Quinn., the first Labour member who sat in the South Australian Parliament a Labour member? Mr Newland. Mr Quinn said that hethought it was necessary that they should have black labour in the Northern Territory, but the persons who bought land in that part of the country should pay all the expense of getting the labour there. That passage is to be found in the South Australian Hansard. In 1880 the Morgan Government, in 1891 the Playford Government, and in 1895 the Kingston Government, passed measures through the South Australian Parliament to permit of the introduction of coolie labour in the Northern Territory. ' Mr Playford, who was for many years a senator, and twice a Minister in Commonwealth Governments, visited India and the Northern Territory in 1891, to report regarding the employment there of black labour. In his report, he saidThe Northern Territory must have cheap if tropical products are to be grown and This is admitted by all who have any special knowledge on the subject. Only tropical products can be grown in the Territory. European labour is not cheap. Therefore, if Europeans could stand the climate, tropical products could not be produced at a profit by them. Therefore, firstly, on the ground that European labour is not cheap, and, secondly, on the ground that Europeans cannot stand the climate, it i's impossible to employ Europeans at tropical production.

398,Mr Mcwilliams,"There was noestimate could not have known much about his business. MrM c WILLIAMS one of the ablest experts that Australia has ever known. I refer to Mr afterward s Sir Charles-Todd. The South Australian Government let the southern and northern ends of the line by contract, the central section being carried out as a Government work. however, to construct the northern section, and the Government had ultimately to carry out the work itself. It abandoned Port Darwin, the terminus of this line, and went up the Eoper River, 100 miles inland from Port Darwin, where it commenced operations. which throws an interesting light on this magnificent country, which it is said South Australia is foolish to part with. We were told to-night that there is no dead heart of Australia-that all this Territory is magnificent country. member if there were a dead heart, and he did not reply, because he did not know. reply by quoting from an official report on the construction of the overland telegraph line, which appears in Mr J. S. Knight's interesting little book on The Northern Territory of South Australia. sented over twenty years ago. MrM c WILLIAMS character of the country has not materially changed since then. Referring to the central section covering a distance of 600 miles, the writer made this statementThis region was so utterly unproductive with regard to. game and other articles of sustenance that every ounce of food required had to be taken with them, and poles had to be carted in some cases over 100 miles. That gives us a fairly good insight into the character of the country. What sort of country is it in which no game can be found over an area 600 miles in length ? MrM c WILLIAMS I have taken the statement from an official report. to assure the House that I have obtained all my quotations from South Australian records, or from books written for, or at the instigation of, the South Australian Government. total cost of the line was £ 4 2 0 , 7 2 1 , whereas the estimated cost when the proposal to construct the line was before Parliament was £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 . A word now as to South Australia's position. The Government of die State submitted a proposal; to construct the overland line with the coI t was made by operation and assistance of the other States. Like some of our cables, it wasto be upon an Australian basis. But theSouth Australian House of Assembly by seventeen votes to twelve rejected the proposal, and ,'nsisted that South Australia should construct the whole of the line, No less than three parties failed, accept the responsibility, ancl retain control over it . MrM c WILLIAMS It was either pluck or greed. The contract worked out so badly that South Australia now asks us I have here a report to shoulder the responsibility, and seeks to impose conditions with which it is not fair to ask us to comply. One of the first petitions presented to the State Government on the Territory being taken over by South Australia, urged that it should also annex the Albert River District, comprising portion of the Gulf country within the State of I asked tlie honourable Queensland, and bordering on the Territory. It was pointed out in this petition that there, were ports within the three degrees am going to which the State was requested to annex, which were essential as an outlet for the Territory. An outlet in that direction, it was asserted, was necessary. In view of the divergence of opinion existing in the House and the country, this statement on the part of the men who had taken up land in the Northern Territory is certainly A t all events, the very interesting. We are told we must take over the railway for defence purposes. I am one of those who think that too much' is made of the bogy of invasion. For centuries the Malays have been landing, ancl have been establishing stations on the r-oasts of Australia. Flinders found them in 1802, and Searcy in his very interesting little book, In Tropical Australia, describes how on different parts of the coast Malay stations were found. It was discovered that the Malays came over at different seasons to obtain trepang, and departed almost immediately. For centuries there has been nothing to stop these people from remaining in the Northern Territory and making I wish homes for themselves there, but they have not done so. There would not be a chance of this B ill passing if it were not for the bogy of invasion. On that point it is well to point out that two-thirds of Western Mr Knight states that the Australia, comprising much better country than does the Northern Territory, is more defenceless to-day from the stand-point of want of population, than is the Territory",61,Smith I S He Rearing A Few Years Back An Attempt Was Made To

Darwin would no more help us to prevent the landing of an invading party at Wyndham than would the presence of troops in Melbourne enable us to prevent a landing of a foreign force in northern Queensland.

'has not always held this opinion of the Japanese. held the opinion I have just expressed with regard to Japanese effecting a landing :in the Northern Territory. I opposed this Bill when it was brought in by the late. -Government, of which I was a supporter, just as strongly as I do to-day. tention is that it does not give the Commonwealth a fair deal. It does not enable us to decide the route of the proposed railway, and it ties down the Commonwealth to a large expenditure in constructing a railway through what is known to be the opinion. most barren portion of Australia. No matter how barren the reports of our experts may show the country to be, the Commonwealth will be bound, under the terms of this Bill, to construct the line through South Australia and the Northern Territory. No precaution has been taken to protect the Commonwealth in the matter of leaseholds. During the discussion on the Land Tax Assessment Bill, I pointed out that practically the greater portion of the Northern Territory worth holding is to-day under lease. An area of 103.419,428 acres is held under lease, much of it for forty-two years, and for is. per square mile. We are going to build the railway right through those leaseholds, and enhance their value enormously, but not tlie slightest precaution is taken to protect the interests of the Commonwealth by saying that any leases resumed shall be taken over at the valuation prior to the construction of the railway. expressly provide that, in paying compensation for resumption, no public works are to be taken into account. tice of a clause upon which I intend to test the feeling of the House. If we take over the Territory, and construct the railway at a cost of millions of pounds to the people of Australia, the men holding these enormous areas, locking up the country for forty-two years at a rental of is. per square mile, will have die value of their leases enormously enhanced, andsome provision ought to be made to allow the Commonwealth to resume them, if necessary, at the original valuation. vided for in the Act under which the leases were taken up. that we need is not taken. Regarding the railway, there has never before been a proposal made between two Governments where tiiere has been such a difference of opinion between the contracting parties. We are taking not the slightest precaution to prevent our entrance into the High Court immediately we commence the construction, unless we absolutely subscribe to the conMy conditions imposed by South Australia. The Attorney-General of tlie Commonwealth says that under this Bill the Commonwealtii has power to deviate the line outside South Australian territory.",62,Smith I S He Rearing A Few Years Back An Attempt Was Made To

417,Mr Fuller,"That is a ridiculousMrM c WILLIAMS 1hat is going to carry the Bill through this House. -officers of South Australia is that we have not that power. In face of that direct conflict of opinion between the legal advisers of the two contracting parties, we are going straight ahead without making the slightest attempt to see which is correct. I believe the South Australian contention is .correct, and it will mean that the House is leg-roped irrevocably to constructing .the railway, no matter what we may find the country to be. If with our eyes open, and in the face of tlie legal opinion of .South Australia's advisers, we pass the Bill as it stands, we shall be guilty of a dishonourable repudiation if we afterwards try to vary the South Australian contract. Strongly as I am opposed to this condition being imposed in the B ill, disastrous as I believe it will be if carried into effect, nevertheless, so far as I am concerned, if the Bill is passed as it now stands, I shall never be a party to deviating the railway outside of South Australian territory. The national honour of Australia ancl the honour of the Commonwealth. Parliament will be pledged to the agreement. I should not be a party to any attempt to get the Bill through under a sort of false pretence, and then to turn round on South Australia, and deprive her of that which she has publicly claimed as her right, and which she has given us ample time to consider before the passing of the B ill . I have no feeling in this matter beyond what I believe to be the duty of any member when a project of this importance is before us. I have found in my researches tiiat every attempt to settle tropical Australia by white labour has failed. It failed in the mines, on the railway, ancl in the plantations'. My object in putting these facts before the House is that we shall know our exact responsibility in passing this measure. We already have an enormous responsibility in Papua. We have had the control of that Territory for ten years, ancl he would be a bold man who would say that our success has been very great. The result of the control of Papua by the Commonwealth Government does not redound very highly to our credit. I have ou more than one occasion pointed to the extremely lax conditions able member must not discuss that matter. MrM c WILLIAMS myself with saying that the enormous responsibility we have taken on in Papua, the It is the opinion Federal Government ancl Parliament: have not been able to successfully shoulder. Our 'ihe opinion of tlie Crown law responsibility in that connection should make us seriously pause before we take upon ourselves another enormous burden in this agreement. It is not the payment for the overland railway, or for the overland telegraph line, or the railway to Oodnadatta, or the railway to Pine Creek, that I am afraid to face. It is the enormous problem which will devolve upon us of the future development and settlement of the Territory when we have taken it over. Rather than undertake die construction of the overland railway, which, from all reports, is doomed to failure from its very inception, rather than incur the responsibility of constructing the line willy-nilly, no matter what its prospects of payment may be, or what desert country it may have to pass through, I would prefer the Commonwealth Parliament to assist South Australia to make a fair trial of whether the tropical parts of northern Australia can be successfully settled by white people. South Australia, having that enormous responsibility upon her shoulders, would have a perfect right to say to the-Federal Parliament that the burden was more than any one State should be called upon to carry. If we solve the question of settling the tropical portion of the Northern Territory we shall settle the same problem in regard to northern Queensland ancl the northern portion of Western Australia. Instead of 'the Federal Government pressing on with this Bill, and undertaking the construction of a railway which may cost up to £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, it would be infinitely better for us to say to South Australia, "" Leave your railways as they stand at present; make a development from Port Darwin in any direction you like, and we will back you in securing the right class of white labour, ancl see if we cannot solve the greatest of all problems confronting Australia-the settlement of our tropical regions with white people."" With the people in their present temper, and having regard to the temper of practically every member of this House, there is no fear of the Federal Government or Parliament, or the public of Australia, at present consenting to an inferior coloured race being brought in to settle any portion of the Continent. We have started out on the lines of a White Australia policy, and the temper I shall content of the people is to maintain it .

425,Mr Poynton,"fairly warm, shows a great difference between winter ancl summer temperature. In this respect, it differs very much from the tropical country on the coast-line, where the average heat is 80 or 90 degrees, with very little difference between the summer and winter readings. Midway we encounter climatic conditions whicli mark the temperate zone; and here is country equal to any in Victoria. Some of the country south of the MacDonnell Ranges may be regarded perhaps as the poorest portion; but yet there is useful country which has for many years sent some of the best stock to the Adelaide market; and a policeman, who was stationed at Alice Springs for seven years, assured me that when he was out in search of some blacks who had been interfering with some cattle he saw near the Western Australian border some of the best country in the Territory. I should now like to refer to some of the tropical products which are possible in the Northern Territory. Under the supervision of Mr Holtze, who had charge of the Botanic Gardens of the Northern Territory, experimental plots were established. Amongst the products dealt with was sisal hemp, in regard to which all the experiments up to date have been very successful, showing a luxuriant plant, containing a very fine fibre. Australiaimports annually 10,000 tons of binder twine made of sisal hemp, while in the United States there is imported 200,000 tons, at a cost of £8,250,000. very little doubt that in time there could be produced in the Northern Territory sufficient sisal hemp to meet, not only all Australian requirements, but to establish an export trade. The latest reports on this product are given in one of the documents laid before Parliament; and there Mr Hawaii Experiment Station, writing in the June, Holtze, who is a son of the Mr Holtze who was an officer in the Northern 'Territory, saysIt is too early yet to speak of the results of our fibre-making experiments. I may say, however, that a very fine sample of fibre is being produced, and the results so far show that the leaves grown here contain a larger percentage of fibre than has been obtained in Queensland. A bale of fhe fibre produced will be exhibited at the forthcoming Chamber of Manufactures Exhibition in Adelaide. In regard to upland rice, he saysSeveral plots were planted last season with the variety of upland rice which was so successf u l l y grown the previous season, and which I propose to distinguish in future under the name of No. 1 White Upland :-No. 1 yielded at the rate of 55 bushels of grain to the acre; Mr Poynton. No. 2 plot yielded at the rate of 39 bushels of grain to the acre; No. 3 plot yielded at therate of 30 bushels of grain to the acre. No. 1 plot has received a light dressing of stablemanure, and the above result very plainlv shows, the worked-out condition of the soil in {he garden ancl the necessity for manuring in futureresults. All the plots received the same cultivation, and the natural rainfall was not supplemented in any way. The seed was planted. 24 in. x 20 in. But this was too far apart; too much ground was thus wasted, ""and if planted closer the yield per acre would have been, greater. The average height of the plants was 4 feet, and the yield of straw i i , tons per acre. The straw, after the rice was threshed off, was. converted into chaff for the Government horses. The time that the ground was occupied with the crop was four months, and I believe the., best time for planting is towards the end of December. Then he deals with harvesting machinery,, showing that in Louisiana and Texas, modern appliances do away with the necessity for such cheap labour as is employed in China and India, and that some600,000 acres are there under crop. He goes 011 to sayIt is, therefore, of interest to read the following remarks in an official publication issued by the United States Department of Agriculture :"" The employment of machinery in the rice-fieldsof the south-west, similar to that used in the great wheat-fields of California and the Dakotas, is revolutionizing the methods of cultivation and 1 greatly reducing the cost. The American ricegrower employing higher-priced labour than any other rice-grower of the world, will ultimately be able to market his crop at the least cost and the greatest profit."" Rice straw is worth preserving. As a fodder The experiments leave for stock its value is about equal to good hay. Rice-straw contains 4.72 per cent, crude protein, 32.21 per cent, of carbo-hydrates, and 1.87 per cent. fats. The sweetness and excellent flavour of well-preserved rice-straw adds very materially to its practical feeding value, because slock will consume large quantities of it. Jared G. Smith, special agent in charge 1908, issue of the P h i l if f i ne Agriculture Review, says of rice in Hawaii :"" Even with the expensive, primitive methods employed, rice cultivation is a very profitable industry."" I should now like to quote Mr Holtze on the subject of the yieldThe yield of rice varies with conditions of soil and climate and methods of cultivation. However, the yield in South-west Louisiana issaid by good authority to range from 28 to 63 bushels per acre.

Mr Holtze goes on to sayAccording to the Year-took of the American Department of Agriculture for 1908, which is the highest authority of its kind in the world, rice is the twelfth crop in point of value in America. It states there were in America in 1907 627,300 acres under rice cultivation, producing 18,738,000 bushels, valued at»85.8 cents per bushel, or a total farm value of 16,081,000 dollars-ove r three million pounds of English money. The average yield per acre was 29.9 bushels. 310.000 acres were in Louisiana anil 284,000 in Texas. Much more could be said in regard to tropical products; but I have no desire to unduly occupy the time of the House, recognising the desire to close the session.

The whole of the valley of the river is here of a character exactly resembling the best downs in the interior. ' We have never seen better or more richly-grassed country in any latitude.

There is a large tract of territory comprising land of the same nature as the best "" D o w n s"" country in Northern Queensland-in fact, equal to such places as Of the acreage under cultivation, Lansdowne, Terrick Terrick, Northampton, and Portland Downs, which are recognised as the cream of the Barcoo country. This is all tableland country, the main slope starting about l 7 deg. 30 min. S., and running thence almost east and west until reaching the overland telegraph line. Fully one-third of the Northern Territory is pastoral country, admirably suited' for great tableland stretches for hundreds of miles. Mr W. . H .

The southern limit is 2,500 feet above the sea; thence it gradually falls until it meets the coastal ranges bordering the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Indian Ocean. Owing lo the elevation above the sea, the climate is perfect, and there seems no reason why agriculture should not flourish, the rainfall gradually increasing over vast plains of rich soil, from about 10 inches in the MacDonnell Range, to 45 inches at Pine Creek and 62 inches at Port Darwin.

The Skinner Creek runs through the Murray Downs, providing a fine supply of water. We camped -that night alongside a waterhole about a mile long, 60 yards wide, and some 18 feet deep. Further on to the eastward is the Spence Creek, -and as we ride along the valley of the Spence we almost forget that we are some 1,300 miles north of Adelaide, and in the very heart of -the Continent. We have seen nothing to equal this valley we are now in. On either bank of --the Spence grow large trees, confusing in their very variety, luxuriant grasses, wild flowers, and delicate ferns. Large snow-white lilies grow -to the water's edge, while the screeching cockatoos and beautifully plumoged birds that fly -overhead all tell us we have come into a new -country. What is to be said now of the statement by the honourable member for Franklin, that there is no bird life there?On our Tight, about a quarter of a mile away, Tunning parallel with the creek, is a high range of hills rising Abruptly and overlooking the valley, with white lime-trees and vegetation growing to the very tops, and flowering creepers overspreading the rocks. The sky, sun, air, and eloquent waters, inspiring mountain-tops, the murmuring and glossy woods, are all evidence that here in this valley nature deals with a bountiful hand. We rode for 35 miles along the Frew, which at the time of our visit was Tunning. Altogether, the country is the best watered and the finest we have yet seen. At places the Frew is almost wide enough and -deep enough to be navigable. I would impress upon honourable members that this report relates to the lower portion of the country running westerly from the route of the proposed railway as shown on the map, and not to the extreme northern part of the TerritoryWhere the Frew head statio""n is situated the river widens out, and there are several splendid sheets of water. It is evident, from the vegetation, that the Frew country has a good rainf a l l , and as the river contains a variety of fishThe honourable member for Franklin said that there is no game or means of sustenance in this part of the countrysome of them being several pounds in weight, it is pretty good evidence that droughts are unknown. hands have caught sufficient fish in the waterhole close by the station-Tootoowa, natives call it-in two hours to last all hands for a week. Birds are very numerous on the Frew. Twenty-five miles below the station we saw a sight to delight in-a moon-lit lake some two miles long; on either bank the typical Australian gum trees towering above the water in majestic splendour, making, with their evening Mr Poynton. beautiful. The natives have christened the place with a pretty name-Arralooloola . Nature's gifts are plentiful here, and we saw wild ducks, pigeons, emus, and kangaroos, and, no doubt, in the water are fish in abundance. I have here an interesting telegram from Sydney, which appeared in the Argus last week, and has an important bearing on the question of the climatic conditions of the Northern TerritoryProfessor David has received a letter from ' Dr. Danes, lecturer in geography to the University of Prague, who was commissioned to investigate the physical geography of limestone countries, especially those in tropical areas. Dr. Danes travelled about 6,000 miles in Northern Queensland. He was strongly of opinion that the climate was healthy and the general geographical (Conditions so favorable that the vast region to the north-west of Cloncurry could be successfully peopled by a white race. In the opinion of Dr. Danes, two measures should be taken for the amelioration of the present conditions, and as preventives against immediate future dangers :-(1 ) Proper medical sanitary supervision of the alien elements and greatest possible restriction of their evil contact, not only with the aboriginals, but also with the white population itself; and (2) the improvement of the living conditions of the white population within the tropical and sub-tropical parts of Australia, with special regard to houses, food, and water. Three years ago I travelled over portion of the Territory with Mr Speaker and the honourable member for Illawarra. We -rngaged in a riding trip extending over . ten days, and traversed a wide area of country. We rode from the Katherine to Brock's Creek, skirting the Flora Falls, and thence down the Daly River to the Douglas. We passed stream after stream, and saw some of the finest country that one could wish to look upon. The honourable member for Illawarra having travelled, like the honourable member for Cook, on the railway line, from which nothing is to be seen but mineral country, had formed a very bad impression of the Territory, but after this riding tour he candidly informed me, in the presence of others, at the last night's camp-and he repealed the statement at a public meeting at Port Darwin --that in the course of our trip he had seen some of the finest country on which protracted he could wish to clap his eyes.

430,Mr Poynton,"Let me give my ownpedition to which I have just referred, we were travelling through grass so high that we could tie it over our horses' withers. On one side of our route there was a fence-the only fence that we saw on the journey-and in the paddock we saw grass growing so high that it looked like a vast wheat field. There was a fine mob of horses in the paddock, and they were in splendid condition. On the following day Mr Bime, the owner of a run, having learned of our approach, sent out a black boy to pick up our party, and the lad guided us to his station. Mr Birne inquired which track we had followed, and asked whether we had seen any horses along the route. I told him of the mob we had seen in the paddock, and he replied, "" All that country is mine."" When I asked him whether he had burnt off the country, he said, "" No, there has not been a fire there since the fence was erected, and that splendid grass is the result of stocking."" He had been living in the district for about seventeen years, and when I asked him how he liked the climate, he replied, "" Look at my wife and my children. Some of the children were born here, and I invite you to say whether they look as if the climate did not agree with them. 1 came from Wagga, but would not change my present home for Wagga or any other part of New South Wales."" I can understand the fascination that this great, rich, lone land has for the explorer. I never travelled over a piece of country that was more fascinating to me. We could not but be impressed by this land of promise, as mile after mile we met with magnificent lagoons, billabongs, or running streams covered with game of every description. In the buffalo country, known as the black jungle, we saw magnificent animals in fine condition feeding on buffalo grass such as is used for lawns in Victoria, and which grows in great abundance. No wonder that it is regarded as a great pity that such grand country should be so little, occupied, with its great resources in land and its abundance of rivers, t do . not think there is any part in the whole of Australia better, watered than is the Northern Territory. A relative of mine has been on that side for the last eight years, and I learn that the wool produced on CruthrieDowns has realized the highest price in the London market. I am sure that where the water is not on the surface an abundance of good semi-artesian water can be got in the limestone country at a [163] depth of 60 feet, over a large tract, right"" through from the Victoria River to Camooweal, and to the south by Tennant's Creek. The time is not far off when it will carry more sheep than Victoria, and South Australia together now have. I have said that we are not mendicants in this matter. Honourable members think South Australia is trying to press this agreement hard, but the honourable member for Angas told the honest truth yesterday when he spoke of the great difference of opinion there is in South Australia on the matter. Petition after petition is being presented to the South Australian Parliament asking them to go back on the agreement. It allows of a deviation from the centre, say, to the Queensland corner, but further than that I do not know what it does mean, ber will not catch us with that. fluence on the honourable member is so strong that I would not attempt to catch him. We want finality in this matter. Since 1897 we have not leased 1 acre of the Northern Territory except on an annual permit. No man could get a bit of land to put his house upon there tomorrow on' any other terms. We have retarded the development of the Territory so as to leave the Commonwealth free to deal with itin its own way. I grant that a number of pastoral leases, have been let at a very low rental, but I shall be one of the first, when we have to deal with our own' Territory, to help to get at them in another way if we cannot get at them Under the conditions of the lease. Most of those leases can be resumed now on two years' notice, and on payment of compensation for improvements, but the lessees have never had to put any improvements, even a' fence, on them. I trust that honourable members will bring this matter to finality, and I ask them, at any rate, not to discredit the Territory if they do not want to accept it. [9-3S]--On listening to the speeches of several members, it has struck me that this' question is like the other great, .projects that we have lately considered, such as the Federal Capital site and the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. If we believed all that was said by one section, we might say, "" Oh, happy Australia,."" but if we believed the others, we should exclaim, "" Oh, unhappy Australia.""

433,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"of the Northern Territory, and another section strongly deriding it, one naturally seeks.'themiddle course, and regards both partiesas guilty of exaggeration. That method-leads one to the conclusion that the Northern Territory, taken as a whole, might be fairly used by the Commonwealth to' the advantage of Australia. While I do riot think that it is all that it is painted that there is a strong section of politician's by the representatives of South Australia, I am not going to believe the strong condemnations hurled at it by the opponents of the measure. We have got rather into the habit in this House lately, when advocating a measure, of claiming that we are the Nationalists, and branding those who are opposed to us as parochialists. When I hear certain honourable members claimingto be actuated by strong national feelings on this question, I cannot help remembering that on other questions on -which, I entirely disagreed with them they have also made claim to national pretensions. I have never visited the Territory, and have to view this matteT in the light of what I read and what I hear from honourable members ar.d from gentlemen who have traversed portions, if not the whole, of the Territory. I have come 16 the conclusion that it is essential for the Comijionwealth to acquire the Territory in the interests of Australia as a whole. I cannot help paying my meed of praise to the people cf South Australia for keeping it as clean as they have up to the present. In spite of what the honourable member for Franklin says, I believe they could have materially benefited their revenues by getting rid of the Territory .on the land-grant system. It is to their credit that they resisted all attempts in that direction. We know that those gentlemen whom we sometimes call untra-Conservatives are willing to adopt any course in placing their money out, and I feel sure that we could get a company strong enough, if not in England, at any rate, in Europe, if we wanted it, to take the Territory over, as long as it was allowed to develop the country as it thought fit. We cannot help conceding to the people' of South Australia the credit for having, as far as possible, kept the Territory white. While Chinese have been greatly used in opening up the Gountry'and building the railway, yet the Chinese population is decreasing, and the white population, is increasing. credit to South Australia on those points, I must admit that the South Australians, as Mr Mathews. a people, are driving as hard a bargain as they can in their own interests. I do not complain of them for doing that, seeing that almost every other State in the Union has done something similar, and has, unfortunately, got what it has asked for. I do not know that South Australia is asking too much. I am quite willing to believe in South Australia who woul<3 be only too willing, even now, to breakthe agreement and resort to the land-grant system for the building of a railway to open up the Territory ; but, of course, this Parliament would have a say on the black labour question. I believe that-a majority of the people in South Australia would fight against a landgrant system if this Parliament were so foolish as not to come to some arrangement"" with the State for taking the Territory over. Of course, the old bogy that we have in every State, in the shape of a House of landlords, will be trotted out. Those individuals are always interested in the holding of large 'landed properties in the interests of a few. The whole of the fight has centred in the question of the proper route for the railway to follow; but I do not think there is one man in the House who can give a conclusive opinion on that matter. He would require, firs: of all, a full knowledge of the whole of the Territory; and 1 do not think many men have that. One alternative route that has been suggested by many would not tend to the development of the Northern Territory at all. It would simply be for the development of the eastern States. I do not think a deviation to the east would matter much, because the other section might be placated by going afew hundred miles further west, and touching the eastern boundary of the MacDonnell Ranges; but with regard to' the suggestion to start from Mildura, on the Murray, and carry a line into New South Wales, almost through the centre of Queensland, and then across to Pine Creek, it is, of course, very evident that those who put that forward are doing so with a view to the eastern States benefiting. I could not help thinking that Brisbane interests were actuating the honorabliinembcr for Brisbane in the strong attack he made upon the route through the centre of the Northern Territory. The fact that Tasmania recognises that she has no possible chance of any material benefit from a Having conceded railway probably explains the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Franklin this afternoon. able member think that it might make a market for our products? lieve that Tasmania will get the least material benefit of ail the States from any railway, whatever route it follows. She can only share in the general national benefit. I am inclined to think that, wherever the railway goes in the Territory, it must be built to develop the Territory, whicli, it must be remembered, will be Federal property after being acquired by the Commonwealth. Regarding the matter as a layman, I am of opinion that the line should not be taken by way of Hergott and Oodnadatta, but continued north from Tarcoola, and kept to the west of the MacDonnell Ranges, until it gets somewhere near Tanami, where we are told there is gold-bearing country; from there it could proceed north. That would provide for the opening up of country., which is not likely to be touched in the near future by State lines. New South Wales will, of course, push her railways westward, and Queensland will continue to do so. It does not heed much imagination to suppose that the line to Longreach will ultimately be pushed westward to meet the Commonwealth line. traffic' from the Northern Territory before the Commonwealth line does so. to extend her. railway from Cloncurry to Camooweal, which will develop her"" own country, and attract trade from ""the Northern Territory between Pine Creek and the Roper River and Camooweal, which is the best known portion of the Territory at present. Queenslanders who object to the transcontinental line being taken through the centre of Australia are a little selfish, seeing that their railways will tap the Territory before the Commonwealth line can do .so. In voting for the Bill, I accept' the statement of the honourable member for Ballarat that, when he made the original agreement with representatives of South Australia, it Was decided that the transcontinental line might be deviated to the east or to the west as might be necessary in the interests of Australia. South Australia would have lost nothing had it left it to this Parliament to settle the whole matter, though I do not blame the people of the State for refusing to trust us, seeing that the eastern States endeavour to get all the material benefits of the expenditure of the Federation. The advocacy of the central route by representatives of South Australia, who are all of one mind in this matter, though differing widely in their general politics, is evidence that the people of South Australia desire that the Territory should be transferred to the Commonwealth, and wish. for the material benefit to be obtained by the construction of the transcontinental.railway. I expected that the honourable member for Ballarat would have done more to prove that the original agreement allowed a deviation. Of course, the people of the State may say that that was riot intended, but Mr O'Loughlin's opinion' might be asked, seeing that he took part in the Conference. After serious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the Northern Territory must be acquired by the Commonwealth for several reasons. In the first place,"" South Australia cannot develop it. I do not think that any nation would make a military landing in the Northern Territory with the object of ultimately securing possession of the continent'. Mr J. H . CATTS -No army could be got overland a landing were made, and trie invaders were not driven out, they would in time establish themselves there, as the African negroes have established themselves in the United States of America, by living there for generation after generation. I do not look upon the proposed railway as of much advantage for the conveyance of troops. The difficulty of'conveying troops over 800 miles of railway was shownin the South African war. Japanese war over 1,000,000 men were transported by the Siberian railway. sonable precautions.. The eastern nations, and especially Japan, desire to expand. I hope that Japan will confine her efforts to Korea, China, and Formosa. The honourable member for Grey spoke of the' millions of coloured people within a comDaratively short distance of the Northern Territory. It is a wonder that they have not come to Australia already. But western ideas are beginning to spread, and the eastern nations are beginning to follow the example of European nations by trying to' enlarge their territories. As I feel that the only way out of the difficulty with which we are ""faced is for the Commonwealth to take control of the Northern Territory, I shall vote for the Bill.

440,Mr Mathews,"We must take reacourse, making a good bargain, but she has alienated as little as possible of the Territory, and we shall have no coloured races to drive out when we take possession. The question' of taking over the Northern Territory, has been before the people of Australia ever' since the accomplishment of Federation. It. has been the subject of discussion in this House in two sessions. The whole matter has been exhaustively debated on both sides, and one feels irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that the time has come, that the hour has struck, when we must'definitely'decide' whether or not we are' going to take over the Territory on the terms available to us. It is just as Well that to-day we have had the case presented from' both sides. The case against the adoption of the agreement has been fairly stated by two honourable members in particular; by the honourable member for Brisbane and the honourable member for Franklin. But I think that after considering their pessimistic utterances and giving due weight to their arguments the case for the Bill must be regarded as overwhelmingly strong. Their speeches have not in any way refuted the strong case presented in support of the agreement by the ex-Minister of External Affairs, the honourable member for Darling Downs; by the present Minister of External Affairs; by the ex-Prime Minister the Leader of the Opposition, by the honourable member for Grey, and by several others. Those speeches, considered together -with the literature which is available to all honourable members, have, in my opinion, made out a strong and convincing case. They have shown, first of all, that the Northern Territory is worth taking over. It is worth fighting .for, and when we acquire it will be worth holding, worth spending money, upon to develop it, and worthy of the consideration of the highest and best statesmanship that Australia can devote to it. The objections that have Been made to some of the terms of the agreement particularly relate to the question of the railwav. But I think .that we ought to give due credit to the negotiators who arrived at the agreement, representing respectively the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia, for having done their best for th<: interests with which they were charged. It was hardly to be expected that the representatives of South Australia, who had to conduct the negotiations -on behalf of their State, would on the one hand disregard utterly, her interests. Nor could the representatives of the Commonwealth have ignored its interests, or failed to do their best for them. After listening to the explanations given by the Leader of the Opposition-clear , lucid, and straightforward as they were-as to the circumstances in which the agreement was entered into, and the considerations and inducements affecting both sides, one must feel convinced that the very best was done.' It may be' that there is, to some extent, an ambiguity in the agreement. ' I will refer to it later on'. But that ambiguity may be got over by friendly negotiations at a subsequent stage between the two Governments. I think that the Northern Territory, as portrayed on the map hanging in the chamber, is an inheritance which the people of Australia ought to be proud to have an opportunity to participate in . . I am convinced that we should not be doing common justice to the Government and the people of South Australia if we did not give them full credit for the way in which they have so far managed and conducted the affairs of the Territory under trying and ' difficult circumstances, retaining it without seriously hampering it by exces-' sive burdens or unnecessary debts and obligations, and certainly avoiding the dangers to which the honourable member for Grey has referred-danger s which would have accrued from a hostile or coloured population being located there. We take over the Territory free from any such taint, difficulty, or danger. The money borrowed, for which we have to assume responsibility, may not all have-been spent to the very best advantage; but all young communities naturally make financial mistakes. Such mistakes have been made, and will be made again, without necessarily reflecting upon the capacity for self-government of the early pioneering Governments that made them. At any rate, it is obvious that South Australia, with her limited financial resources, has not been able to bring to bear upon the Northern Territory that great power of development and government which will be at the command of the Commonwealth of Australia. Therefore, the Commonwealth is not only justified, but bound, to take it over, and to do so without any further delay. Because delays are, and will be, dangerous. Negotiations for a supplementary agreement in modification of the existing agreement would probably involve a delay of years; and that delay would not",72,Smith I S He Rearing A Few Years Back An Attempt Was Made To
441,Sir John Quick (Bendigo) [9.5s],"in any way free the Commonwealth from any of the difficulties or_ embarrassments which at present confront iF. If this agreement were defeated by a hostile amendment being carried, I entertain no doubt whatever, from what I have heard in this House, and from the manifestations of public opinion in South Australia, of which I have read, that the Legislature and the people of that State will make a fresh start with the Northern Territory, will launch upon fresh enterprises, will probably begin to construct a railway in a manner, and in the direction, and under -conditions which suit them best, without consulting the Commonwealth. Inevitably the time will come-the time must comewhen the Commonwealth will take over this area of country, either as a Territory or as a new State. If the Territory be incorporated as a new State, probably by that time the railway that we have been talking so much about will be an accomplished fact, and we shall have to take it over without having had a voice in its construction. I should like to point out that the agreement as it stands, with the admitted ambiguity in it, may not prevent the realization or the carrying out of that deviation from the direct route through the MacDonnell Ranges, to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred, and which he said was apparently concurred in by Mr Price and by Mr O'Loughlin, as a possibility. provided for in the Bill? unfortunately, there is an ambiguity in the Bill. If , however, the matter were to be determined by paragraph 1, sufi-paragraph b, of the agreement, there would fce no ambiguity. The mandate is not to be found in that portion of the agreement, but in a subsequent portion, which is slightly inconsistent with this paragraph. graph b, which, I would point out, deals with the obligations and powers of the Commonwealth, readsThe Commonwealth .. construct, or cause to be constructed, a railway line from Fort Darwin southwards to a point Australia proper from any point on the"" Port on the northern boundary of South Australia proper (which Tailway, with the railway from a point on the Sort Augusta railway to connect connect with that part of the Transcontinental therewith, is hereinafter referred to as the Transcontinental Railway).

There would be nothing to prevent it from go:ng out into the adjacent .portion of Queensland and coming in at the northern bounday of South Australia. paragraph ? apparently, the dominating paragraph, and the only one which defines the obligations of the Commonwealth. I am not now endeavouring to give an authoritative legal interpretation of the agreement. That has already been done by authorized officials, namely, by the Attorney-General of South Australia on the one hand, and by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth on the other hand. I am merely pointing out what may be-the parts of the agreement on which those authorities rely in support of their respective contentions. I have nd doubt that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth relies on that paragraph in support of his view in favour of a deviation to the eastward, and probably the Attorney-General of South Australia relies on the paragraph which was quoted by the honourable member for Franklin, and' which he described as the recital paragraph.

The Commonwealth will be the master of the situation. It can decide when and in what circumstances the railway is to be started. It seems almost inevitable that the eastern States should show a disposition to have a ""'cut in , "" so to speak, or to tap this transcontinental railway, and make it an avenue directly or indirectly communicating with their own western borders. 'But we ought to realize that the problem is which' railway and which route would best develop the Territory, not which railway or which route Here is an ambiguity which would best promote the interests of Victoria, or New South Wales', or Queensland. It is of no use to construct a railway to divert traffic into Queensland for its benefit, or into New South Wales for its benefit, or into Victoria for its benefit, if such diversion would not benefit the Territory. We want-the railway to go. through the principal portions of this country-to be able, to make such deviations as may be necessary to include the best portions of the Territory. The interests even of South Australia should be subordinate to the interests of the Territory In deciding the route of the railway. I suppose that South Australians will admit that.

But since Recently, I had the honour the advent of Federation, we seem to have become abnormally alarmed about our defenceless condition. Any honourable number who desires a transcontinental railway to be constructed anywhere in Australia, usually, pleads that it is necessary for the defence of the country. In my opinion, we have to apprehend no danger at present west of from Japan. That nation has Korea, Manchuria, ""and Formosa to settle; and it is extremely unlikely that a country which has had its hands very full with Russia, aud which still has to pay off a considerable war debt, will attempt an invasion of Australia.

Even the British have acted the part of tyrants by forcing the opium trade upon China. We owe a debt of gratitude to South Australia for the hold' she has kept upon the Northern Territory. I remember reading that in 1898 it was proposed that a very considerable area of land in the Territory should be granted to any syndicate provided they settled there a colony of at least three Japanese to every acre. If that proposal, which was agreed to by the British Government, had been carried into effect, we should long before this have had thousands of Japanese settled in the Northern Territory. The proposal was opposed by the Government of which the Right Honourable Charles Cameron Kingston was the head, and it never reached fruition. But because South Australia has held the Territory for us, and because there is a great wave of national sentiment at present passing over Australia, that is no reason why the people of South Australia should endeavour to exploit that sentiment in order to compel the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to find ^4,000,000 or .£5,000,000 for the construction of a railway which may not pay. Minister in charge of this Bill, and other Labour members who are supporting him, and intend to accept the agreement as it stands, are desirous of pressing upon the Commonwealth a huge burden of debt. I am satisfied that not one of these honourable members, if they realized that it would handicap the Labour movement of Australia, would urge the adoption of a proposal which will involve the Commonwealth in a debt of some millions, the interest on which must be met by Commonwealth taxpayers, wherever they may reside. ber thinks that those interested in the ritory has, within the last few years, sent Labour movement should never take a' his sons to Queensland to get land if the national view. members of the Labour party hold national views.

But, even if the land were poor, I should raise no protest against the taking over of the Territory by tlie Commonwealth. I hold that we should take it over. My objection is to the demand made in the agreement that the Commonwealth shall construct a railway southwards, from Pine Creek to a point on the Port Augusta railway. I claim that ""southwards"" has only one reasonable meaning in this connection, and that is that the line must be taken by the direct route indicated on the map exhibited in the chamber. I was interested yesterday in listening to the honourable member for' Ballarat referring eloquently to the national sentiment, and saying that he thought the Federal Parliament ought to have the power to construct the railway by the best route. The Minister of External Affairs cheered that statement to the echo, as did other South Australian representatives. But tlie moment the honourable member for Ballarat proposed that there should be an addition to the agreement to say that the Federal Parliament should have the right to take the railway where it pleased, repreprogress made in settlement in Queensland, sentatives of South Australia said, "" No, you must not alter a comma in the agreement, because, if you co, you will spoil the whole thing, and the Conunonweallh will not be able to get the Territory."" Honourable members must have heard often enough that in our Courts the Judges consider only the wording of the sections of tin Act of Parliament, and take no notice of the speeches which may have been delivered in Parliament in connection with them. It is not to be presumed that, in the event of any dispute as to the route by which this Hue should be constructed, Judges called upon to decide the matter wou:d read the.speeches delivered on this Bill. They would take the words of the agreement, and 1 submit that it is cleat from the wording of the agreement that the line must be constructed southwards, as some of the supporters of the agreement have frankly admitted. It is useless for honourable members supporting this measure to try to persuade Western Australian representatives that the line may be taken towards Western Australia, or Queensland representatives that it may be is carried. I shall vole to take oveT the Northern Territory, but I shall"" try in Committee to secure for this Parliament the power to construct the railway along the best route, to be decided after u thorough investigation by engineers. I should like honourable members to consider what we are to do with the Northern Territory when we get it. How is it proposed that we should settle it? There is any amount of good country in New South Wales and iu Queensland yet to be settled. in Western Australia. deal of land yet to be settled iu Western Australia. We have only to look at ihe map to sec that (he area in Western Australia still unsettled is as large as tlie Northern Territory itself, and if there is any force in the argument that we are likely to be invaded in tile north, that part of Western Australia is as open to invasion as is the Northern Territory. The only way 10 settle and develop the Territory would be to advance considerable sums of public ir.orrjy to people prepared to live there. Judging by the slow good as the lands are there, I think that in the Northern Territory we should not only have to advance money for Ihe building of houses, but assist the settlers in getting their produce to marketber docs not object to that? that that is what, in my opinion, we shall have to do, and we shall no: be able to find the money if we spend several millions in constructing a Tailway which may not pay.

The South Australians are asking the Commonwealth to recoup them all the money they have borrowed in the past for public works in the Northern Territory, and later on, when the people in the north establish their own local Parliament, which, I hope, will be at the earliest possible time, they will, be asked to take upon themselves the expense previously borne by the whole Commonwealth in opening up the country. .If we are to develop the Territory as it should be developed, there will have to be an agricultural policy, with a Minister of Agriculture; a railway policy, with a Min-ister of Railways; a land policy, with a Minister of Lands; together with a Minister of Education and a Minister of Mines, and so on.

I quite agree with the honourable member for Capricornia that this agreement should not be trammelled by a railway stipulation. This question has not been placed before the House in a proper light. A threat is held out that the transcontinental railway to Kalgoorlie will not be approved unless this agreement is entered into.

489,Mr Hedges,"That is one of thewe take it over ? South Australia has done its best to open it up during the last thirty years, and has failed. When I went to South Australia thirty years ago I found that the southern portion of the State had been nearly ruined by the efforts of the Government to open up the north. Sons of old settlers had been sent up there to try to make a living, but had either died or had returned impoverished or ruined. Some of the smartest and best men in Australia have endeavoured, without success, to develop the Territory. The failure was ascribed in the first instance to the want of a railway, and a line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek was accordingly constructed. We are told that South Australia is entitled to every credit for having kept the Northern Territory white. She went a strange way about the work of keeping it white. The State Government rejected a tender to construct the Pine Creek line by white labour, and accepted one which made provision for the employment of coloured aliens. The Northern Territory is the only part of Australia where aliens have worked in harness. The Chinese engaged in the construction of the Port Darwin to Pine Creek railway line worked in harness; they wore collars like horses, and dragged trucks from the cuttings to the tips. The country was so bad that as soon as the line was constructed the Chinese left. for that line? Millar Brothers, who, under their contract, were _ allowed to employ Chinese labour. The Chinese are not the only race who have been in the Northern Territory and have deserted it. As far back as the fifteenth century the northern part of Australia was known as Great Java; , The Portuguese first held it, but could not settle it. In the sixnot have been chosen had the surveyors teenth century the Spaniards sailed through Torres Straits and tried in vain to settle the country. The Dutch likewise failed, and South Australia, having made fruitless efforts to develop the Territory, now asks the Commonwealth to take up the burden. This proposal is all very well from a South Australian point of view, and if I represented that StateI should probably be found supporting this Bill just as vigorously as are my South Australian friaids. I should recognise that I was doing my best for the State in trying to induce the Commonwealth to shoulder the burden. the proposed Western Australian transcon[164]2 tinental line. Why attack the Northern Territory ? impersonal sense. The honourable member for Grey knows that some of the cleverest men in Australia have tackled the problem of developing the Northern Territory and have failed. A blunder was committed in the first place in constructing the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. That line was intended originally not to open up the Northern Territory, .but to rob Queensland of the traffic from the Diamantina and the Cooper. A line was surveyed to the Queensland border. When the railway reached Hergott Springs, however, it could go no further owing to the flooded state of the country, and even the surveyed route was lost. A route was then chosen towards Oodnadatta. Later on it was found that another blunder had been committed in aiming at the construction of a line over the highest part of Australia. With the exception of the big Dividing Range, there is only one ""pimple"" in Australia which reaches an altitude of 3,000 or 4,000 feet. I refer to the MacDonnell Ranges, and we are asked to put a railway through that country. Pictures are exhibited showing a gap through which a railway could be carried. The largest rocks immediately abutting on this gap are 60 feet high, but they are as nothing compared with the ranges running up as high as 3,000 or 4.000 feet. Would any sensible people try to run a railway over that elevated country when an easier route could be found? The route starts east by north. After reaching Hergott Springs it runs in a westerly direction, and then turns due north. Hacl any more deviations been made a complete circle would have been described. A more devious route could been paid for their work by the mile. The route chosen suggests the flight of carrier pigeons; they fly in a circle and )'ou never know where they will take off. We are now asked to take over this railway. Beggars should not be choosers. Surely South Australia should not impose conditions as to the route to be followed, and' attempt to dictate to all Australia? As to tlie attempt of South Australia to compel the Commonwealth to build the western railway vid Tarcoola, I would point out that the South Australian authorities would not agree to the survey of a line running straight to the west.

Last month I was talking to a man who told me that on the second day after his arrival in the Northern Territory the heat was so great that the leather was burnt off his boots. Life in the Territory is no picnic. We are told that a big population is to be brought from the Old Country and settled there. It would be cruelty to settle new arrivals in the Territory. Since people from other parts of Australia have refused to go there, how can we reasonably expect new arrivals from the Old World to settle there? I know of no means of settling that country. We are asked to build a line hundreds of miles long, and terminating at a point where there is a population of only 1,000 white people. If those people could afford to travel up and down that line every day, and pay their fares, it would not earn working expenses. It would never pay to run wool, wheat, or any other product over such a long length of railway. such products over the proposed Western Australian transcontinental railway? of over 300,000 in Western Australia, as against a population of only 1,000 in the Northern Territory.

We have a growing population there, and yet at present there is no railway joining that State in the east. was unknown before the discovery of gold. some honourable members clearly show that they are prepared to vote in the dark, and know nothing about this question. They talk about Western Australia not being discovered until gold was found. Are they aware that it was discovered before Vic-, toria, New South Wales, or Tasmania? New Holland, as it was called, was discovered by the Dutch people before they got as far as Tasmania, and then they found ' Tasmania by accident. Dirk Hartog sailed down the coast of Western Australia in 1616. Had that portion of. Australia which was discovered back in the fifteenth century by the Portuguese been the paradise that we are led to believe today, it would have been settled, and instead of the people now going from the We are told that south to the north, they would be coming from the north to settle the southern portion. I hope honourable members will consider seriously what .they are going to saddle the Commonwealth with. There is, perhaps, not much harm in a State being unable to do better than South Australia has done, but it would be a standing disgrace to the Commonwealth if it took the Territory over and could not do better with it than has been done in the past. Other portions of Australia require defending as much as the middle of it. My idea is that if we had the four corners defended, the middle would look after itself. I am certain that nobody is going to interfere with the MacDonnell Ranges, anyway. Even the 'South Australians have not yet had the pluck to build the railway up to them. I do not think they ever made up their minds where that railway was really going to. It reminds me of JeromeK . Jerome's story about the porter telling the stationmaster that there was a strange train in the station. The stationmaster told him to ask where it came from, and he replied, "" I do not think it knows itself; it to run seems a little dotty."" Similarly, this railway is a little dotty. It does not know where it came from or where it is aiming at. If the Commonwealth dares to take over the proposition of running the traffic such as would be required on a line of that The fact that the length on a rickety 3 f t . 6 in. gauge railway, built as this one has been, it will be the worse enterprise that was ever started in Australia. When we do build a line we shall want a proper gauge and proper rails. Let us have at least 80-lb. rails and decent sleepers, so that we can run the trains at 40 or 50 miles an hour. We should want to get over these long stretches as quickly as possible. This is an ill advised proposal, and it is a shame that it should come before the House when only a few members are present.
