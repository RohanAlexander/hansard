I hope that our' present efforts will have the same result. know from the Attorney-General if the State Governments possess the constitutional power to impose these inspection charges? Is not the imposition of such charges an interference with the freedom of trade between the States which is provided for by the Constitution ? Mr W. H .

We should very much resent the action of the State authorities in expressing opinions as to the validity of onr laws. The validity of any law can be tested by those affected by it .",11,Setup

It is well known that elections very frequently what takes place a few days, or even a day, before the voting; and a large number of postal votes, recorded a week or a fortnight ment action, or inaction, which are not action or inaction that ultimately mine the verdict. Under the while we may get a legal, we do not get a logical, or actual verdict of the people. We all recognise that an election be permitted to sprawl all over the year; such a suggestion is at once as an absurdity. general election is the determination the whole of the electorates on one particular day. Further, postal voting is an actual violation of the secrecy of the ballot, safeguard it as we may. I do not think that any one was more anxious I was to have postal voting, or who advocated the principle, long as I did myself. in my own town of Gympie, as is well known to the honourable Lilley, the postal votes of two maids in one of the principal hotels were collected by a justice of the peace, that the maids Mr Fisher. did not vote as that justice of the peace desired, and that the postal votes were never delivered, but were subsequently discovered in a lower part of the sewer.

127,Mr Webster (Gwydir) [11.30],"capabilities. the fighting capabilities that should characterize the Labour party are fast becoming a thing of the past. There is nothing I deplore more than the fact that the Government should be able to masquerade as reformers, and carry into the presence of the Governor General measures which have been admitted by the Prime Minister to. be trumpery, and to be simply trifling with the time of the country and the interests of Democracy, with a view to securingwhat? Not a reform. This is no reform. It is a backward step; a step to undermine Democracy and take away the rights and privileges of our fellow beings, manner they have always adopted, maniwho have fought for those rights in days gone by. When I think of those days, when we were fighting for manhood suffrage and for securing a hold on the political machine so that the voice of the mass of the people could be heard in Parliament; when I recall those days, thirty years ago, when we were fighting an unpopular battle for the masses; when the propertied classes, with-plural voting, could multiply votes in every electorate; when I look back on the sacrifices that were made by men who were practically exiled for their efforts to updeath, and no other course is worthy of l if t the masses of the people and give them the power that their education enabled them to use to the best advantage --whe n I think of all these things, I realize the attitude honourable members should adopt in regard to this Bill. If the Government should be successful in their endeavours, tbe Labour party take a considerable risk-n o one can deny itthe risk of allowing' the first step to be taken towards pulling down the citadel which our forefathers have built up for the good of humanity. I do not regard the matter from the point of view of a politician, or one who is anxious to return to the Treasury bench, or who seeks for some advantage that may be gained by manoeuvres, political or otherwise. I realize that there is a greater thing ahead, and that it is a nobler aim to maintain and retain that which was handed down to us by our forefathers to guard, care for, protect, and maintain as a precious heritage given to us, not for our own sakes, but for the sake of our children. Yet the party born among the workers, and sprung from the people who have fought to gain political freedom, now propose to allow the Prime Minister to secure the passage of this subtle thing that has had its birth in the brains of the Attorney-General, and which can-I will not say it will -secur e a double dissolution. I say that there is an element of risk in this. No party knowing their business .would even allow a risk to be taken when the rights of the multitude they represent are in danger. Let us assume for a moment that the Governor General will grant a double dissolution. What will be the result? The party behind politicians on the other side will certainly act in the pulating the rolls and following the tactics they are pursuing day by day with the aid of the money of those who are always oppressing the masses in any country. save them. says, ""Calvary, O Calvary1 I believe in Calvary."" That is not going to save us. The only thing that would save the Labour movement would be to fight to the the man who carries the Labour flag. But I was looking at the possibilities of passing this measure. Assume that the Bill is carried, and that the Governor General may grant a double dissolution. In that case, the advantage will lie with the party in power. They are capable of many things, as we have proved all along the line, and as I have known them to be in the days before Labour came into existence. It is the same old Satan on the Government bench that sat there in the fifties. They know well how to manipulate the electoral machinery and throw dust in the eyes of the people, and practically belie the situation and misrepresent it at every breakfast table in the country, as they did last time by misrepresenting the whole situation and slandering the Labour party, and blaming them for being responsible for the high cost of living, in this way appealing to the pockets of the multitude and gaining a shady majority over the party that would not stoop to such tactics.

131,Mr Webster,"I like the man whoto face the position and see what will happen by what has been done in South Australia and other places. In South Australia, the Liberals, having seen that the Labour movement is solidly entrenched, that the aspirations and hopes of Labour men have, to some degree, been realized, and that the Liberal power ie dying, what did they do? Having gained power by methods which I have just related, they proceeded to undermine the whole electoral system and gerrymander the electorates, reducing the value of votes in the Labour centres, and giving 1,000 people in one electorate as much power as 2,000 in another, and so making it almost impossible for some years to come for Labour to have a hope of succeeding in winning the seats so gerrymandered. That is what lies behind the subtle method that has been so cunningly initiated by the Attorney-General, and I say unhesitatingly that the risk is too great, and that the disabilities that will be placed upon us are something we should not accept. No party is justified in taking a risk in regard to matters intrusted to it as a sacred trust. In the face of the corruption, improper manipulation, and other malpractices that have been experienced in connection with the postal vote, the party that urges its restoration is not the come through many fights, having had to friend, but the bitterest enemy, of the people. Ministers say that they want to get the Bill through quickly. I remember the way in which the postal vote was manipulated when it was provided for in a Federal Act. Justices of the Peace were paid by the day to go from door to door persuading persons who had no right to do so to vote by post, misleading them as to the casting of their votes. They were paid, not to obtain postal votes in a legitimate way, or rather not to merely witness the signature of sick persons entitled to and desirous of voting by post, but to deceive the electors, and to ascercotted, and persecuted to gain the libertain how votes were being cast. It is on record that thousands of votes collected in who was present at the birth of the movethis way by party organizations never saw the ballot-box. land? evidence that similar practices have obtained in other places where the postal vote system has been in operation. The Liberals desire the opportunity to "" down "" the Labour party by any means possible. They cannot defeat us on our policy, nor attack our principles, nor undermine our platform. policy. gentleman has no policy for the betterment of the people, but merely a secret, cunning, deep-laid plot to rob the people of the rights and privileges handed down to them by their forefathers. That is the desire of those who are to-day trying to work political points, aud are neglecting to bring forward measures of legislation which are urgent, and would enable matters of primary importance affecting the homes of the people to be dealt with. But I have never been one to take part in a sham fight, and I shall not do so now. In real warfare, I am prepared to fight to the death for my home and my country. But one cannot fight when there is something holding him back, paralyzing his arm when about to strike an effective blow. Whatever may be the fate of this test Bill, and whatever may be the decision of the Governor General, it shall not be said of me, a Labour man, who has contest six battles to gain entrance into the parliamentary arena, that I did anything to injure the movement of which I am so proud, and which I value as I would a father or a mother. In days gone by, thirty-four years ago, before Labour took any part in politics, we used to meet in the Trades and Labour Council, moulding what was destined to be the Labour policy of the future. The Labour movement has built itself up by gallant fights, and the sacrifice of time, money, and opportunity by those who supported it. They have been victimized, boyties at stake to-day. I am one of those ment. I was there at its delivery, watched its growth from boyhood to manhood. I saw it reach its majority, and, at last, assume control of the government of this in Queenscountry, putting up a record during three years' administration of tlie public affairs that will never be equalled by that of any other political party.

CATTS (Cook)' TIL55] I am glad that tlie motion has been moved, and I hope that the Bill will have a speedy despatch. It is the second of the two test Bills by the rejection of which the Government hope to induce the Governor General to grant a double dissolution. By our action in the Senate last night, we took the Liberals completely by surprise, and if we deal speedily with this Bill, it the Prime Minister would never have got will remain to be seen whether Ministers really want a dissolution.

Under all the circumstances, the best thing would be to grant a single dissolution. Ministers will not do business, and we cannot do anything.

Many honourable members on their side, and all on this, are pledged to support a social insurthis Bil l will be speedily dealt with. I ance scheme, but the Government have done nothing towards proposing it. A Bankruptcy Bill, an Insurance Bill, the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture, are all non-party matters with which this Parliament could deal, but which Ministers will not give us on opportunity to consider. for the alteration of the Constitution, which honourable members opposite have admitted to be necessary, are not presented to us. The only House prepared to do business is the Senate, where members of the Labour party have introduced a Bankruptcy Bill, an Insurance Bill, and a set of Bills proposing alterations of the Constitution. As the Government refuses to do business, let us take it at its word, and put this Bill through quick and lively. There will he no obstruction from me.
