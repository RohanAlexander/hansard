17,Mr Harper (Mernda) [2.36],"B ywith the assumption by the Commonwealth of the debts of the States. The questions which he has well entitled the financial problems of the Commonwealth are, to my mind, of surpassing importance, and I think that there is a general feeling amongst honourable members, and throughout Australia, that they should be faced and dealt with in the interest of the States and of the people. I have, since the passing of the Constitution Act, taken a considerable interest in these matters, and it has been one of my chief objects in remaining in politics to give my aid and help, if possible, in their settlement. TheJ from the difficulties arising between the States in connection with financial adjustments, ought to be pressed upon the attention, not only of honourable members, but also of the public at large. During the fourteen years from 1907 to 1920 no less a sum than £124,000,000 , or an average of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, will have to be provided for in connection with loans falling due-in addition to any requirements for new works and obligations. Honourable members will thus see that it is important that this question should receive not only serious, but immediate, attention. We are approaching the time when the first of the gieat obligations contracted by ths various States during the years of so called prosperity will have to be met. We have had the pleasure of spending the money, and we shall soon have to face the less attractive duty of meeting our obligations. The outioolk for the immediate f u ture is not a pleasant one, and I think that ' the Treasurers of the States, when they realize what is before them, must come to the conclusion that it is their duty to join with the Commonwealth Government in facing the situation. I observe that some of the States Treasurers are making arrangements on the assumption that they will-not meet with difficulties. But we have to remember the enormous sums that are about to fall due, that the lending classes, who have given us the use of their money, are well aware of the obligations that the States have to meet, and that during the next fourteen years there will be not one borrower, but in .many cases five, in the London market. Therefore, the competition between the States in order to secure the renewals of their loans must of itself bring about the most serious and dangerous difficult v. Mr Harper. that the people who ha.ve lent their money in the past will not continue to do so. point later on. For the present I would merely tell the honourable member that it is impossible for us to say what the lending classes may think twelve or fourteen vears hence. We know, however, that the money market is managed by a comparatively small circle in London, to whom our necessities are well known, and that if the States compete one with the-other in endeavouring to obtain renewals of loans, the financiers will endeavour to make the best seriousness of the position, as possible terms. They may be quite willing affecting future loans, altogether apart to lend their money, but may require high rates of interest. It has been said by representatives of the States, at the Premiers' Conferences and elsewhere, that the credit of the States is as good as that of the Commonwealth. I think, however, that if they rely upon that assumption they will find themselves most grievously mistaken. I am in entire accord with the Treasurer, who, as the result of inquiries made by him in London recently, has come to the conclusion that it is most dangerous to seek to obtain large renewals of loans in the London market, when there are a number of competitors, each endeavouring to do the best he can for his own State. In my opinion, if the States compete one with the other in obtaining renewals, they will probably not only be unable to do as well as in the past, but have to renew their loans at a rate of interest considerably higher than they are paying at present. Therefore, the question of placing the finances of the States on a satisfactory footing should be dealt with without delay. I believe that without some organization, and the assistance of the Commonwealth, the States will run very serious rislks of disaster. I have already referred to the statement of the Treasurer in this connection, and I may further point lan in the paper that he recently issued on the question of the States debts. He saysThis is a most serious clanger-on e which can only be adequately met by the Commonwealth intervening and taking up the renewal of these loans, and dealing with them in the future. It 'seems to me that the time has come when this Farliament ought to grapple with the question, and decide upon the best course to be adopted. The following table shows",14,Forrest

Treasurer for having brought the matter forward upon the present occasion. In delivering his last Budget, it was scarcely .to be expected that he would be in a position to deal with it, inasmuch as he had only assumed office a few days previously. However, he has since been giving it his consideration, and the result of that consideration is before honourable members in the memorandum which he has included in the Budget papers. right honourable gentleman for his attitude towards me in connection with the discussion of the question.

He afterwards stated that he disagreed with me because he did not think that the I think we are indebted to the scheme which I proposed-and which is designed to secure finality as far as that is possible, because there can be no absolute finality in a matter in which Parliament is concerned-wa s practicable. He added that there was plenty of room for criticism and for differences of opinion in respect to this matter, and declared that he merely desired that those who did not agree with him should suggest some better scheme.

The indicated able assure both himself and the Committee that the criticisms to which I shall in a few moments subject his proposals, are only such as I deem to be necessary in order to show why I differed from him ab initio. The Treasurer's proposals seem to me to be dominated by the opinion expressed in the remarks which I have just quotedthat no scheme of finality would at the present time meet with success, and that to secure some settlement of the question it was better to allow things to continue as nearly as possible under present conditions until public opinion was better prepared to deal with a final solution of it, and until we had begun to think federally. I admit that there is a good deal of force in his contention. many respects we have not yet acquired the habit of thinking federally. to me that the best way to encourage, not only the people, but the Governments of the States, to think federally is to propound schemes which are Federal in their principles, and which will, by their beneficent effects, induce them to conclude that, after all, Federation is the right thing. they will begin to think federally. way task which we have to face in dealing with this question will, I trust, have the effect of inducing a more favorable view to be taken of the aims and objects of our Federal Government. the position which I have indicated, the ideas to which I have referred dominated the Treasurer's mind. In drawing up his scheme, so far as I can judge, the right honourable gentleman had constantly pressing upon him the obligation to meet the objections which have, from time to time, been urged against any action in the direction o.f altering the existing state of affairs, which is dominated what is known as the "" Braddon clause."" IfI may be permitted to say so without giving offence, and without any sinister meaning being attached to my statement, I would say that, in dealing with this matter, the Treasurer, Owing to the pressure of these ideas upon him, has followed what I might call the provincial lines, whereas I Iir. think-and here is where the difference between us comes in-thi s question should, and That being, so, I am relieved of can, be approached from the Federal standpoint. I propose to deal first with the finanright honourable gentleman having cial relations of the Commonwealth to the bis views in this reasonStates, because it seems to me that the secand friendly manner, I can tions of our Constitution which relate to this matter dominate the position. The Treasurer's proposals cover a period of ten years, namely, from 1910 to 1920. Dealing with the question of the financial arrangements the other question, that to which the honourable member refers would regulate itself, I think. other question at a later stage. I am quite willing to deal with it first, but perhaps it will be better if I am permitted to work the matter out in my own way. The Treasurer's proposal is to pay annually to each State from the end of 1910 to 1920 I acknowledge . that in a fixed sum equal to the average annual amount of three-fourths of the net But it seems revenue from Customs and Excise which that State has contributed during the five years preceding 31st December, 1910. In addition to this, he also proposes that if the three-fourths of the total net revenue collected by the Commonwealth exceeds the aggregate amount of the fixed sum so payThen able to the States, it shall be distributed The among them. basis. fact makes very little alteration in the position. It might affect individual States, Having taken up but my opinion is that it would not do so. plication. the stand-point of the Treasurer, it is necessary to do something in that direction, but it is an exceedingly embarrassing, proposal. While it would do away with the Braddon section, it would re-create it by i,:i a more objectionable form. That can be easily demonstrated. The Treasurer's proposal is, I think, inequitable to the Commonwealth, and I propose to give an illustration in support of that view. Let us assume, for the sake of simplicity of calculation, that the fixed sum is based oa a revenue' of ^8,000,000 per annum. Three-fourths of that amount is Har'fer. .£6,000,000.

31,Mr Harper,"I recognise that from the right honourable gentleman's scheme, would be the fixed sum payable to the States for ten years plus any increase beyond the total revenue of £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. It might well be that for some years the revenue would reach £9,000,000. In that case the States would receive not only the £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, but £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 , representing three-fourths of the additional amount of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, or a total of .£6,750,000. On the other hand, the Commonwealth would receive £ 2 , 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 instead of the £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , which it would retain if the revenue were only £8,000,000 . We have to consider, however, what would be the position if in any one year the revenue fell, away to £7,000,000. It is not unreasonable to assume that such a decrease, which represents only 12J percent, may take place. I have known the revenue of this State to f a ll away for a number of years to the extent of something like £2,000,000 per annum. What would be the result if , under the Treasurer's scheme, the Commonwealth had a similar experience? The position would be that we should have a net revenue of £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; that the fixed proportion going to the Slates would be £ 6 , 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 , and that the balance of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 would be retained by the Commonwealth. In other words, the whole of the shrinkage would come out of the proportion retained by the Commonwealth, with the result that this Parliament might suddenly find itself in a position of very grave difficulty. In such circumstances, the only wav under the Treasurer's scheme, so far as I can see, to overcome the difficulty, would be to impose a special tax, which would be ear-marked to make good the deficiency. Sir JOHN FORREST the Commonwealth would have to do what every Treasurer ihas to do when faced with a deficit. there might be a deficiencv in the revenue, but the gravamen of my objection is that under the right honourable gentleman's scheme the whole of the deficit would be borne by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Parliament would thus have to adopt one of two courses. could not, under the Treasurer's scheme, impose a general increase of duties to raise the sum necessary to make good the deficiencv. it would have to promulgate a new tax on some specific article or articles and ear-mark the revenue so obtained to make good the deficiency or impose a direct tax tor the purpose. Sir JOHN FORREST O r curtail expenditure. no inducement to the States to curtail expenditure. right honourable gentleman to enlighten the Committee as to the course he would pursue in the contingency I have named. How could he so curtail expenditure surer curtail his expenditure from £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ? is enormous, and is one that ought not to be run. It is all-important that the Commonwealth-if it is to take over the liabilities of the States, as we know it ought to do-shoul d show the outside world that it can meet its obligations, and that it is not subject to the danger of deficits which may disorganize its finances and upset its general business arrangements. When, the right honourable gentleman considers this phase of the question-as he will do if he has not done so already-h e will see that this is a position that would be absolutely subversive of the best interests of the Commonwealth. As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, the Treasurer's scheme would impose on the States no obligation to economise. Sir JOHN FORREST As the population increases, our Customs revenue must increase. pathy with my right honourable friend. He has spent the greater part of his life in a State which began to ascend rapidly only The Treasurer of during his career as its leader and guide. For many years Victoria and other States also experienced a constant accession of prosperity; but the day came when there U n d e r any scheme was a great reverse, and all who had any responsibility, however sanguine they may have been before, had then a lesson which they will never forget. Whether it be in regard to the affairs of an individual or a State, we can never reckon upon continual prosperity. We may rest assured that the Since it greater the prosperitv the nearer we are to a. reaction. That is the experience of Australia, and in view of that fact it behoves us to be careful that in arranging the finances of the Commonwealth, in its infancy we shall proceed on lines that will be suited not only to fair weather",17,Forrest

I hope that we shall not be diverted by any consideration of that sort to the right or the left in our decision regarding what isj or should be, a business proposition. Sir JOHN FORREST posed, there would be a community or partnership in losses, as well as in profits. It would be far better, so far as the point under consideration is concerned, to permit the Braddon clause to continue, than to .adopt the proposal of the right honourable member. Sir JOHN FORREST have no security. question of security Sir JOHN FORREST attained, as I shall show in a few words. Sir JOHN FORREST Ms. HARPER very often have objects, and do not take the right way to attain them. I shall show that the scheme does not give the certainty that the right honourable gentleman thinks it gives. For the sake of argument, let us take another illustration. I trust that honourable members will forgive me ""for using illustrations, but, in dealing with this matter, they bring more clearly before us the working out of any particular proposition. Let us suppose that we have a series of prosperous years"" after this scheme is adopted, and that the revenue, instead of being £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , remains steadily at £9.000,0 0 0 for a number of years. Let us f urther suppose that in each of the years, the States are receiving, not only their guaranteed amount, which is a certain and fixed sum, but £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year in addition. Under such circumstances, if there were a sudden change, and the States began to receive only £6,000,000, their finances would be more or less deranged. Does the right honourable gentleman think for one moment that the States would then be satisfied? As a matter of fact, they would be crving out. as they are now, that their finances were deranged, and that we ought to have done something different. The right honourable gentleman has only diminished the margin of variation; he has not removed it. In our ever.y-day life, a man W h y doss the honwho is receiving £ 4 0 0 a year may grumble, but if his salary is raised to £ 5 0 0 , and I hope this is not reafter remaining a few years at that figure, is reduced by £ 2 5 , he feels more aggrieved than if his position had never been improved. A nd so it would be with the States. We must look at this matter from a reasonable ' and sound business standpoint, and I contend that the scheme is He a r , hear ! inequitable to the Commonwealth, and does In the case I have supnot give stability to the finances of the States, except to a limited extent. member must remember that the amount returned would not be influenced by our expenditure, but only by our receipts; the position would not be as it is now, when, if we spend the money, the States do not The States would get it. W it h regard to the point I am discussing. My point is that the scheme does not give fixity to T h a t is the object. the amount received by the States. The n the object is not I am not going into the causes. That is a different matter altogether. I come now to T h a t is the object. the proposal relative to ear-marking special T h a t may be, but we items of revenue to provide for certain specific objects. I submit that it is one that ought not to be adopted. It is a clumsy and unsatisfactory way of attaining the object in view. The case of old-age pensions was mentioned by the right honourable gentleman. Suppose that under his scheme certain duties were imposed, and were ear-marked for the purpose of paying old-age pensions. What would be the effect? Parliament would impose certain taxation which it would be assumed would meet the object in view. If it should happen that the amount estimated was not obtained-that the amount required for the object in view was larger than the amount of the duty realized-the n either the payments would have to be limited to that extent or the duty would have to be increased, or some other duty would have to be imposed. The result would be to disturb all commercial transactions, so far as concerned the article or articles affected by the duties. If , for instance, n duty were placed on tea for the purpose of providing old-age pensions, and 3d. per lb. were the amount of the tax which was estimated to be sufficient, and if it were found not to be sufficient, would not every tea merchant in the country say"" Parliament will now be imposing a. duty of 6d. per l b ?

54,Mr Harper,"T h a t does not meet theindications-woul d know that something else would have to be done. Another objection is this: Suppose the amount of the duty imposed for the purpose of old-age pensions proved to be more than sufficient for the purpose. Then it is likely that the whole amount would be absorbed, perhaps by extravagant administration or in some other manner. I cannot conceive a more mischievous way of endeavoring, to give reasonable facilities to the Commonwealth than this, because it would, in my humble opinion, be always a disturbing element in business operations. The proper and systematic way to attain the object is that the Commonwealth Parliament should provide enough out of its general revenue-ou t of the whole proceeds of its taxation-to meet the object in view. I think that these questions are deserving of the very careful attentioii of Parliament. I am sorry that I have not had an earlier opportunity to put my views before honourable members, but I express them now with confidence that the considerations I put forward will receive attention. As to the inconvenience of the present position, I am in thorough agreement with the right honourable gentleman that the Braddon and bookkeeping sections have caused, and are likely to cause in the future, considerable embarrassment to this Parliament in carrying out its legitimate duties. The reason for that is that we in this Parliament cannot do anything as a matter of policy with the freedom we ought to 0 have as men responsible to our constituents, and to them alone. In seeking for an illustration of this inconvenience, it struck me that I might take the right honourable gentleman's proposal to institute penny postage. I am in thorough agreement with it, because I think that it is in accordance with the spirit of Federation that the same rate of postage should prevail in all parts of the Commonwealth. It does seem to be absurd that in Adelaide one should have to pay 2d. to send a letter from one street to another, whilst in Victoria a letter is carried to any part of the State from any other part for i d . There are similar inequalities in other directions. When I make the remarks to which I am about to give utterance it will be understood, therefore, that I am not hostile to the proposal to reduce the postage rate. But I wish to use the proposal as an which will be caused; and my reMr Harper. -marks' are applicable not only to this, but to any other proposal which this Parliament, as a matter of policy, may favour under existing circumstances. I find on looking into this question of the postage, and reading the paper circulated by the Postmaster-General .after the Treasurer's Budget speech, that he says that it is estimated by the officers of his Department thatIf penny postage were established, the immediate reduction in revenue would be £265,000 a year if limited to the Commonwealth, or about .£300,000 per annum if extended to all places within the .Empire and to other parts of the world. The proposal of the Government is to adopt the higher scale, giving penny postage, notonly within the Commonwealth but outside of it, involving a loss at first of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 en year. I find, on looking through the paper circulated by the Postmaster-General, that a curious mistake has been made. I discovered it only this morning. It does not alter my position, nor does it affect the desirableness of carrying out the proposal; but it is just as well to point out the error. Three instances are quoted as precedents for the proposed action in reducing the postage rate. The first is Canada, the second New Zealand, and the third Victoria. In each case statistics are given, but the curious thing is that in each instance the average increase stated is wrong. In Canada the returns are set out, and are said to show an average increase of 51.18 per cent, per annum. The average should be 15.18 per cent. In New Zealand, the average increase is stated to be 54.04 per cent., whereas it is 13 per cent, per annum. . In Victoria, the increase is said to be 35.25 per cent, but it is 9.87 per cent. total increase from the beginning which is meant? master-General in the unfortunate position of saying, "" In view of the experience in other countries, which has just been quoted, I venture to think that the increase of 40 per cent, in correspondence in the first year may be safely anticipated, which would reduce the amount for that year to £150,000."" illustration of the embarrassment found that the percentages are correct. num or for the total number of years?",20,Forrest

But the debts, as they were assumed, should be practically unified. In that case, as they fall due they would become Commonwealth debts. seems to me to be very much more desirable to manage the debts as one common fund, than to deal with, each one ear-marked for a particular State, and so make special arrangements for the liquidation of the debts separately. gentleman proposes to meet these obligations by the establishment of consols at 3 per cent., interminable, except at the wish of the Commonwealth, or, upon six months' notice, in thirty years. In regard to that proposition, I find myself entirely at one with him. I believe that it would be wise to have only one denomination. that the consols might noi at first reach par, because, being a new stock, they might not attain their proper value. tetter to fix a stock at a rate of interest like 3 per cent., which, as things go, is a fairly given for the stock from time to time would indicate its value in the market. it might not fetch par at the commencement, still I believe that with proper management and the fact being made absolutely evident to the investing public that it was a first class security, the time would not be far off when 3 per cents, would be floatable at very close to, if not at, par. I therefore thoroughly agree with the proposition. Treasurer obtained in London is valuable, because he has ascertained beyond question that anv movement in the direction of the unification of the debts or the taking over of them by the Commonwealth would be received with the greatest favour in London financial circles. rived at the conclusion, after inquiry, that 3 per cent, stock is the one which would be the best for the purpose which we have in view. embodied in my paper, which has been circulated to-day, and which a few honourable members have had the opportunity of looking through since we last met by getting early copies, I may say briefly that the objectives I had in view in dealing with this problem were first of all to take over Mr Harper. all the existing debts, and practically unify them. ber mean to include those debts which have been incurred since Federation? proposes to do the same thing, but only after an alteration of the Constitution.

As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth will in time become the creditor of the States, because the existing debts will be paid off, Commonwealth bonds taking their place, and the interest will be met out of the revenue of the Commonwealth.

Instead of returning money to the States, as we do now, we shall pay the interest on their debts as it falls due.

In short, my proposal is to make use of the terminating annuity principle. I am assuming that if the Commonwealth credit were established upon a 3 per cent, basis, and the States paid back at the rate of 3J per cent -the y would not be able to borrow upon their own account for less than that-the y would in the course of sixty yeairs pay not only the interest, but the whole of the principal. It seems to me that we have a unique opportunity in public finance, one which has not been enjoyed by any other country. with £233,000,000, and we can provide for paying that sum out of our revenue by making a permanent annual appropriation of £8,500,000, the sum the States have heretofore paid for interest alone. should gradually pay off the entire sum by means of the savings which we effected. In this connection I may mention that Mr Coghlan, in his paper, says that by-and-by we could effect a saving of £1,300,000 per annum. would need to be re-invested. ' It couldunder the scheme I have outlined-be reinvested either in our own obligations or in loans to the States, and the latter would simply be required to annually pay to the Commonwealth 3^ per cent, upon such loans, which rate, in sixty years, would not only cover the interest charges, but also wipe out the principal. The result would be that in forty or fifty years the original debt of £233,000,000 would be greatly diminished, and it is quite conceivable that sixtv or seventy years hence we might have public works valued at £500,000,000 , upon which there would be a debt of not more than £250,000,000. It seems to me that now is the time for us to face these ques-' tions in a broad patriotic spirit. We should deal with them as large questions which affect not only to-day, but the future. The works for which the Commonwealth would raise loans must be reproductive works, and I have defined that term in my paper. In regard to other works, or to temporary loans, the States should be at libertv to borrow within their own borders, as they would be responsible for them able member call non-productive works? Mr Tlarfer. The State would asylum, or a school-house, or anything which did not return a> revenue, a nonproductive work. Honourable members will By doing that for observe that, under my scheme, the fullest liberty would be given to the States. I do not think that we ought to hamper them, but, on the contrary,we ought, by evenmeans in our power, to stimulate them to develop their own territory. For that reason I make no proposal to interfere with their railways. Under my scheme they would have all the railway revenues with which to do the best they could, and they would be able to obtain more money whenever they had a sound proposition for which they were prepared themselves to accept responsibility. They would merely be called We have to deal upon to provide interest and sinking fund, which would enable both themselves and the Commonwealth to wipe out their obligations within sixty years. Sixty years is a long time in the life of We an individual, but it is nothing in the life of a nation. If we lay down proper lines, and build upon a sound foundation, this country, .a couple of generations hence, will have great public works, and comparatively little public debt. Surely that is That money an object to be sought for, and, if possible] attained. To the uninitiated, itseems an uncanny statement that if they have a debt of £ 1 0 0 . and pay it off at the rate of \ per cent, per annum, in sixty years they will wipe it out; but it is a mathematical fact. The point is, of course, that that result is achieved by means of compound interest. If we got in any money in respect of the States debts of £233,000,000 , we should immediately invest it in the purchase of either State or Commonwealth loans, or by way of loans to the States. In this way we should derive 3 per cent, interest, so that the money would be fructifying from the first, and the result would be that sixty years after taking over these obligations, we should have our debt paid off. If we reinvested, the monev, the resuit would be that 111 a comparatively short period we might have a very large amount of public works with a very small debt upon it, and that debt mainly owing to the Commonwealth.

It will thus be seen that there would be granted annually to the States relief aggregating a very large sum. The relief so received would be quite as much as could be fairly expected under the Braddon section, or any other scheme. sum upon which the States could reckon, and the States Treasurers could make up their Budgets twelve months ahead if they chose to do so, since they would know exactly what they had to pay back to the Commonwealth in a particular year. The Commonwealth would undertake anv [84] risk that might accrue; but that risk would not be very great.

Making a fair allowance for that fact, however, I think that the Commonwealth would be perfectly safe in undertaking to pay back to the States a large sum annually/ My proposal really means that a large sum annually would be returned to the States. Although it would take the form of our remitting the charges which we had upon them, still, when reduced to its simple elements, it would mean their receiving a large sum annually.

In order to avoid expense, I have provided for the appointment of debt Commissioners, who would form practically a branch of the Treasury.

135,Mr Harper,"The Commonwealthwealth's credit would enable the States to get such terms that they would probably pay no more than they would have to pay if they borrowed on their own account, and the debt would be cleared in sixty years. I am afraid I have trespassed too long on the time of the Committee; but I feel, as I said at the opening of my remarks, that it is the duty of a public man to give these questions the utmost consideration. promulgate these views earlier, because I quite admit the difficulty, in dealing with such a huge subject, of being able, in one speech, or even half-a-dozen speeches, to meet all the points that may arise. trust, however, that honourable members will give me credit for not seeking, as a faddist, to bring forward a proposition simply because it is my own, or anything of that sort. out as a business man, and I desire to place my views before honourable members in a business aspect, with the desire that I shall be given the credit, at any rate, for having simply submitted these views as a matter of public duty-for no other reason, and with no other purpose. I am sure that the Treasurer will feel that the remarks I have made about his scheme are the result of conviction and of the necessities of the case. That scheme is, I think, intended to solve in a temporary way a question which, in my opinion, ought to be settled finally. The difficulties that have been created in the Treasurer's scheme are, I think, as I said at the beginning, the result of the difference between his position and my own. The position I take is that the question should be settled now, without the delay of an hour. paper I say that by the 30th June, 1907, the whole matter ought to be settled; but, as a matter of fact, it ought to be settled at once, because £12,000,000 falls due next year, and then follow £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, £10,000,000, and so on.

I replied that if people believed it, they might make us pay more for tlie use of their money. But I express no opinion whatever upon the point. fact is that people who wish to lend money generally look to the security, and if they think that the Labour Party' is likely to impair their security, they will form their own opinion, and act accordingly. If they -do not think so, they will take no notice of the legislation referred to. I express no opinion upon the point. "" If it does, it does."" and if it does not, it does not; and there is an end of the matter. [4.32] I think that the Committee is indebted to the honourable member for Mernda for a very able and very lucid speech. In my experience of Parliament, I have before to-dav learnt that a House is never better occupied than when listening to an honourable member who has made a subject peculiarly his own. That is one of the reasons which induced me, not merely to stand aside for the honourable member this afternoon, but to urge him to take an early opportunity to explain his scheme more fully to the Committee than he had already done in his memorandum that has been circulated. After listening to him, I feel that I have been well repaid in inducing him to deliver at this stage a speech of the character and calibre of that to which we have just listened. I do not pretend to any special financial ability, and, therefore, my observations upon the proposals of the Treasurer will occupy only a very short time. There is one matter to which I wish first of all to allude, and I do so the more readily because neither the Treasurer nor the honourable member for Mernda has touched upon it to any great extent. I refer to the book-keeping question, and the determination of the book-keeping period which takes place this year. this vear, but need not. ally speaking, I think every honourable member will arrive at the conclusion that the present financia'l arrangements with the States cannot continue. They are The interjection was whether not upon a satisfactory basis. They are anomalous. The}' were never intended to be permanent in their present form. As the honourable member for Mernda has mentioned quite clearly in his paper, they were only intended to meet a temporary The and tentative condition of things until a more permanent order could be safely ushered* in. The anomaly consists in this, to put it briefly: that the less we have to spend the more the States have to spend. If we give them more, the tendency is for them to spend it upon an extravagant basis -and I am speaking plainly now, I hopeas witness the political Largesse which is It amounts to this: being distributed now out of the surplus by the .two large States in particular. OnI f it does, it does, the other hand, if we give them less, there is a tendency ' arising within the Federal arean, towards extravagance. I am afraid that we have (Parramatta) more than a suspicion of that in the Budget proposals of my right honourable friend the Treasurer. No one, I think, will, for a moment, say that they are of an extremely simple and economical order. Rather do they take a plunge in the direction of extravagance, as I hope to point out a little later on. A t present we have one authority whose obligation it is to raise the money, and another authority whose function it is to spend it. The Commonwealth raises the money; the States spend it. Each authority is at present watching the other with a degree of jealousy and irritation which, if it be continued, cannot bode any good either to the States or to the Commonwealth. The inevitable tendency, wherever there is plenty of money to spend, is, of course, to spend it. The Treasurer never said a truer thing than when he said the other day that that was his own experience in connection with his own affairs. H is experience is that of every one else. Where there is plenty to spend it becomes the easiest thing imaginable to live up to the amount of the income, and so naturally extravagant ways are entered upon. A question arises in connection with this Budget as to whether we, as a Commonwealth, may not as well spend some of the money, which results from our booming trade and conditions just now, as hand it all over to the States, and leave ourselves in an attitude of Spartan simplicity as regards exY e s . Generpenditure, while they are doling out money in a very extravagant way. The present arrangements cannot continue.

I have already said that the present arrangements were intended to be temporary. That is made plain by the book-keeping sections, which, it is contemplated, will expire at a later period of this year. admit that these book-keeping provisions, as long as they remain in> force, constitute neither more nor less than a negation of the Federal principle. We are put by them in the position of mere trustees for the States. Nay, more, they put us in the position of mere book-keepers-mer e clerks-for the States. The result can only be a continued derogation of the proper dignity of this Commonwealth; and, as I have already said, there must continue to be irritation between the two entities. arises in this way: have absolutely no Inter-State free-trade. There is no such thing as Inter-State free trade to-day. It is true that the barriers at the borders only exist now for the purpose of regulating the disposition of imported goods. In other words, after we have collected the duties on imports into this State, we have to follow the goods to their point of consumption, and credit the consuming State with the amount of such duties. I suppose that the adoption of the bookkeeping provisions was necessitated by the diverse conditions of the various States, and a feeling of jealousy regarding their own revenue and financial stability. We have had an experience of Federation extending over five and a half years, and, as the figures show, there has been a constant effort at equality in the financial conditions of the States. We are coming more and more to a per capita basis in regard to spending and earning. To my mind, the question is whether the time has not already arrived when we should put an end to the bookkeeping system, and destroy at once the irritation and trouble consequent upon its operation. Here is one of the troubles which it occasions. I am told that last year 90,000 entries, relating to Inter-State trade had to be put through the Sydney Customs House, and that in each year 300.000 entries are passed through the various Customs Houses in the Commonwealth. When we think that each entry carries with it a liability to prosecution for error we can understand the degree of irritation which is produced throughout the trading community. Not only is there that liability to error in the making up of the entries.,but there is also involved therein a very acute and detailed analysis of the various dutiable articles which enter into the manufacture of composite garments. For instance, a suit of clothes has to be analyzed for bookkeeping purposes. It We must all is necessary to assess the duties which have been paid on the buttons, the thread, the cloth, and every other dutiable article which has entered into the manufacture of the suit. We can readily see what enormous expense, trouble, and irritation are involved in making the analyses, and the risks which are run in consequence of the liability to which persons are subjected. member propose to adjust the matter? At present we I have not a proposal to submit. aware that the greater proportion of the goods is landed in the big States-Victori a and New South Wales. only be done, I think, by a rough and ready striking of a balance as between the various States. If all the factors to which the bookkeeping system relates were taken into account, I do not think that it would be very difficult to strike a balance. But even if we could not balance, the matter without resorting to some other method of adjustment, I do not see why offers could not be made to those States which would be the heavier losers by the transaction. After four or five years' experience of the system we could very readily strike an average as to the loss that would probably occur to the large States. I do not think, however, that a narrow view ought ta be taken. Suppose, for instance, that to-morrow we were to sum up the pros, and cons of the effects of the bookkeeping system upon the various States. The first point which strikes bne is that in the year 1904-5 Queensland paid £ 8 4 , 0 0 0 more than her proportionate share of the defence expenditure. Again, take the case of South Australia, which, for very many years, has been struggling with the Northern Territory, at an enormous cost, for its upkeep. We are all interested in the upkeep of the Northern Territory, if only from the stand-point of defence alone.

154,Mr Joseph Cook,"Yes. It couldcircumstances. The expenditure on defence in Victoria last year was, I believe, very light which the Postmaster-General contemplates. indeed. head has been very much more in other States than it has been in that State. in the matter of defence, the States are equally interested. If we were to make up the sum, it would not be very difficult to strike a balance such as would enable us to be within easy reach of the solution of the bookkeeping system. Again, suppose that the large States would be affected adversely. It must never be forgotten, as the honourable member for Mernda has just pointed out, that, from the manufacturing and producing point of view, the two large States are becoming very rapidly the manufacturing centres of Australia. That is one of the outstanding features of our Federal evolution, so far: Both Queensland and Tasmania have been hit very hard indeed, from the manufacturing point of view. Indeed, one of the things which handicap Tasmania so much to-day is the fact that her manufacturing interests have been so heavily hit by Victoria since the abolition of the Inter-State borders. Thereforej one does not need to take too narrow a view in order to be just with regard to the abolition of the bookkeeping system. would contribute so much to the development of good-feeling between the States as would the abolition of that irritating condition of affairs. In this connection I should like to say I am not sure whether we have any moral right to institute penny postage while the bookkeeping sections of the Constitution continue in force. As I have said, we are only in the position of bookkeepers for the States while those provisions operate, and I doubt if we have any moral right to begin to spend the moneys of our principals in a way such as is contemplated by the Postmaster-General. If we were free, and we had no bookkeeping obligations to the States; if we were each independent in our own sphere, I should hold up both hands for penny postage the more readily as being a great and immediate gain to the bulk of the people within the Federal sphere. But I doubt whether we have anv right to so cut into the revenues of the States while those provisions exist. I propose to say more about that matter directly, and I only make these remarks in passing. At the present time our principals are the States, and there arises a question of political morality in taking their reMr Joseph Cook. venues and disposing of them in the way orable member mean that New South Wales, Yet, with a surplus of £1,000,000, cannot afford the cost of penny postage? Wales and Victoria can both afford to bear the cost of penny postage, and under our present anomalous condition of affairs it i= just a question, particularly as regards the larger States which have surpluses, whether we should not spend the money available to the Commonwealth rather than allow them to distribute political largesse as they are doing. Every one knows how Mr. Bent, the Premier, is acting the part of My Lord Bountiful in Victoria. We have to consider not only the view point of the States which have surpluses, but the view point of the States which are in financial difficulties. We ought never to forget that we are, in the broadest and highest sense, trustees for the solvency and security of the States, and should give the most earnest and close examination to the weakest links in the financial chain. I shall not make more than one or two criticisms of the general financial proposals of the Government. I agree with the honourable I believe that nothing member for Mernda, and the Treasurer, that there is no room for dogmatism, or for an autocratic, know-all attitude in regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. On the contrary, there is need for the fullest inquiry, and the most complete scrutiny of any proposals that may be brought before us. The importance of the subject will not be questioned. Much depends upon striking out upon right lines in the first instance. If we commence upon wrong lines, our troubles may be incalculable and interminable, while, if our financial machinery is properly started, the gain will be an increasing one. Our finances in the future will be better or worse, as the scheme adopted is a .good or a bad one. According!}', the Treasurer very properly invites suggestions, and all who can should try to help him in the elucidation of. the problems which have to be faced. I agree with the honourable member for Mernda that they are neither very clear nor very simple. The ideal to be aimed at is independence on the part of both Commonwealth and States.

Last year the States paid in interest on their London debts ,£7,291,000, while the amount returned to them by the Commonwealth was £7,308,000, so that if the Commonwealth had paid the interest due in London it would practically have squared the ledger.

The honourable member for"" Mernda has spoken eloquently of the chaos now existing, and of the foolish and' excessive competition which is damaging Australian credit in London. The Commonwealth The y have to pay it to could regulate borrowing as the States cannot, and that would increase our security and credit in London. The first Yes ; but the thing that we have to do is to establish a Commonwealth credit such as we have not to-day, judging by the utterances of authorities on the subject. Our first task At the present time there is to make for the Commonwealth a credit superior to that of the States. We must do that before dealing with the difficulties in which the mechanical part of the scheme will involve us. The monopolization of the London market is the first step towards It has ocestablishing a Commonwealth credit. F o l lowing upon that will come the ability to convert at a decreased interest, and the substitution of the Commonwealth consol, suggested by the honourable member for Mernda. We should offer a stock of greater attractiveness than any now placed upon the LonIt is a proposal to take over so don market by the States. The States would then have an inducement to cultivate the Commonwealth instead of fighting shy of us. If we had something of a tangible character to give to them, the public would soon compel the States to come to the Commonwealth, instead of it being necessary for the Commonwealth to run after the States. In other words, we should be able to give the States greater facilities for the transfer of the balance of their loans, and they would be swift to take advantage of the situation. We should at once be able to do away with the necessity for the back payments which are contemplated under The Commonwealth paid the schemes of both the Treasurer and the honourable member for Mernda. The honourable member for Mernda proposes that the States should ear-mark, for the purpose of paying interest to us, revenue amounting to-nearly £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. If any such action were taken, it would be bound It might do s 0 to create dissatisfaction and friction between the States and the Commonwealth.

Our States are a great deal more like sovereign States. States stand in a position resembling that of our city corporations. Sir member has not been to Canada or he would not say that. ing of their general importance, but of their financial relations with the London money market, as compared with that of the Dominion. There is no analogy between our case and that of Canada, as I shall show when I refer to the precious penny postage scheme of the Postmaster-General. However, I do not wish to be diverted from the thread of my present argument. The first essential is that we should create our London credit-and this cannot be done by financing alone-a t least, so Mr Coghlan says. He is clear and emphatic that political considerations are affecting our credit in London at the present time. They may be doing it improperly, but they are doing it, and it is with facts rather than with reasons that we have to deal in our financial relations with the mother country. before we can hope to create a better credit in London, we shall have to pay some respect to the government of Australia, and to the legislation which we enact from time to time. I should like to read an extract from his paper in this connection. Speaking upon the subject of the causes which are influencing the price of our stock, he says: No class of persons are less influenced by sentimental considerations than are the investing public and their brokers; nevertheless, there is no class whose political predispositions and prejudices more largely affect their dealings. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that, of the considerations affecting the price of Australian stocks, not the least important, so far as concerns the London market, is the repute of the State to which they belong, and the policy of its Government. If for any cause that repute should be low, then the conjunction of various other conditions usually looked upon as favorable would not avail to maintain the price of its securities. Such being admitted, it is therefore evident that so long as Australia seeks further money from the London market, either foT new undertakings or for renewing old Joans, attention will have to be paid to the opinions of the British investor on certain political matters. W h y do they not I think that that statement is as clear as language can make it. He continuesIt must be confessed that the difference in the attitude of the British investor towards Australia can be accounted for only on the suppositiou of mistrust arising from considerations, not of The Canadian the resources of the States, but of their politics. Nothing can be clearer than that. It means that our Commonwealth legislation JOHN FORREST -The honourable is affecting our credit in London. orable member quoting? Coghlan's paper which reached Australia a few weeks ago. I do not think that the lan of belonging to the "" stinking fish"" party. If the latter has any sympathy at all, it is with radical. Australian democracy. Yet, with every disposition to make the credit of Australia stand as high as possible in London, that is what he writes concerning the causes influencing the prices of our stock. Mr Coghlan, who spends almost every week c f his life in answering the animadversions of our"" critics in London, declares that our politics are unquestionably influencing the price of our stock, and that before we can hope to improve our credit, we shall have to pay. more heed to our legislation. I now propose to quote another statement of his Mr Coghlan points out that bearing upon the same matter. Speaking of the transfer of the State obligations to the Commonwealth. He says:If the Commonwealth were to take the place of the various States in the London loan market, it would probably not be able at first to obtain money on better terms than the States could do for themselves. Some of the leading brokers who deal with Australian stocks in this country -me n of wide knowledge of financial conditions -hav e been consulted in this matter, and their views are in agreement with those herein expressed, which have been formed from independent observation; but they also say that in the course of time the Commonwealth will undoubtedly stand in a superior position to that of any of the States, provided that the confidence of the investor in the policy of the Government remains unimpaired. Should there be an immediate transference of the States debts, the Commonwealth must be prepared, for n few years at least, to content itself with results no better from the point of view of price than the States new obtain. That is another declaration that our credit in London at the present time stands at zero-that , in point of fact, we have no credit beyond that which the States themselves enjoy.",35,Forrest W O U L D Not The Hon Some Of The States From The Very Outset

One of the -neans which he suggests for accomplishing that object is the consolidation of the States debts. We need to rehabilitate our credit Sir commenced operations in London. How can the honourable member use the word "" rehabilitate""? bilitate our Australian credit-the credit which compels us to borrow to-day at 4 per cent, where we used to borrow at 3 per cent.

We must do that before we can Hope to create a Commonwealth credit. When we have done that, we shall begin to beget confidence there. After all, the chief difficulty which we have to encounter does not lie in the formulation of financial schemes, but in-securing their acceptance. I admit that the Treasurer has formulated a scheme which will stand a much better chance of acceptance by the States than will that of the honourable member for Mernda. The right honourable gentleman drags political considerations into his proposals, pays a good deal of respect to the feelings of the States as such, and leaves them loopholes by means of which .they may escape from the thraldom of Commonwealth financial control if they choose to do so. Yet it does not follow that in its essence the scheme propounded by the Treasurer is sounder from a financial stand-point than is that of the honourable member for Mernda. supreme difficulty which must be f a c e d by anybody who is charged with the practical sortition of this problem lies in formulating a scheme which will be acceptable to the States. This leads me to say a word or JOHN FORREST The honourable two in regard to the plan which has been outlined by the honourable member for Mernda. I am afraid that it is too good a scheme-that it is too ambitious and too Mr Coghlan complete, that it involves too much in the way of surrender on the part of the States, and too complete a .control of their present functions by the Commonwealth, for them to accept it within, a measurable period. The scheme rises to boldness, and even to audacity, in some particulars, with its Board of Commissioners, Board of Arbitration, its payments by the States, its rebating by the Commonwealth, its practical determination .of the railway building of the States, and its exaction of guarantees. The scheme seems too much like putting in JOHN FORREST We have not yet a receiver upon the States, with regard to some of their financial undertakings. these are only details, and I must confessthat the more I look into the principles, underlying the scheme submitted by the honourable member for Mernda, the more fully I concur in their soundness.

As I interjected when the honourable member for Mernda was speaking, if we could settle the debts problem satisfactorily the Braddon section would solve itself-ther e would be no further need for it. But during the transitional period, there is need for further consideration being given to the continuation or otherwise of what is known as the Braddon section. The honourable member for 'Mernda has already pointed out the defect, in this connection, in the Treasurer's scheme; and, after all, it is a very serious defect. The Treasurer proposes fhe abolition of the Braddon section, and the substitution of a fixed amount on the basis of the yield for the five years preceding 1.910. That is to be the minimum guarantee to the States-it is to be an invariable guarantee-and that is the trouble. If three-fourths of the revenue exceeds the guarantee, the Treasurer proposes to distribute it per capita; and, in my opinion, that would set up a troublesome system of bookkeeping to begin with. Sir JOHN FORREST simple. so simple. We should have to deal with there always have been, very serious fluctuathe States in two distinct relationships; we tions in the revenue of every country. should have to distribute one part of the revenue on the basis of a fixed amount, will increase. and distribute another part on a per capita system.

We have to do the suffering. I point out as the honourable member for Mernda did, that it is not merely a question of paying liberally to the States. This may prove to be in itself the very essence of an illiberal proposal.

Speaking, of the Budget as a whole, it indicates a period of great prosperity. My right honourable friend said that last year was the best year that we had had since we entered into Federation. Looking at both sides of this Budget-expenditure and revenue-it occurs to me that the revenues of the Commonwealth at the present moment furnish an unanswerable reply to the extreme protectionists of Australia on the one hand and to the Socialists suggestion for increasing taxation, whether My right honfor ear-marking purposes or any other.

236,Mr Josephcook,"I would notchain. We must give heed to their, needs when discussing the question whether our revenue is too large or too small. But ing feature of the situation is that we have a booming revenue, bocming trade, and a great commercial expansion. From time to time we have heard a great deal about the injured and strangled industries of Victoria. Here, it seems to me, is am answer to all these allegations. The figures of the Budget show that Victoria is advancing by leaps and bounds from every point of view, and from none so much as from the manufacturing point of view. That in itself is an unanswerable reply to all the statements made about her strangled and crippled industries. I admit that on the fiscal platform the note is constantly changing. changed very rapidly. The other day the Prime Minister went to Sydney and told the people that all their prosperity was due to the Tariff, that all they wanted was ""more Tariff, and still more prosperity."" But when he returned to this State, and went on the fiscal platform, he brought in quite other considerations. The great outstanding argument for protection nowadays, particularly in Victoria, is derived not so much from the condition of things obtaining within the State as from the condition, of things obtaining outside the State. In this respect the note is changing altogether. booming prosperity in manufacture which is seen in Victoria, perhaps more than in any other State, at the present time. So we find honourable members saying now "" We want more protection, for the purpose of peopling Australia, making, ourselves self-dependent in case of war,"" and pointing to the international menaces and perils from outside, both racial and military, as reasons for further interference with the fiscal conditions of the Commonwealth. The Budget shows that manufacturing development is not fettered or hindered; but that on the other hand, in spite of what is called a low Tariff, it is going ahead by leaps and bounds. the Treasurer read more like a story in the Arabian Nights than a confirmation of that terrible tale of woe which we constantly hear from some of the platforms of the country in fiscal controversy Taken from anv stand-point, the figures denote the throb of those gigantic natural forces which are making Australia great, in spite of all the gloomy vaticinations of the Socialists on the one side, and of the pessimistic statements of the protectionists on the other. From the protectionist, in some quarters, at any rate, the outstandwe hear nothing but tales of woe and disaster; but as Alacaulay said concerning England at one time, "" We see nothing but prosperity and progress on every hand."" Listening to the recital of these interesting facts by the Treasurer, it would seem as though the blue skies of Australia laughed in derision at those persons who are making such a fuss about nothing to-day, and for purely political purposes. I can conceive of nothing which, in my judgment, will tend so much to dissipate the pessimism of the moment as will this Budget. In the financial columns of the Sydney Morning Herald, the other day, I read an article on the Of late it has value of hope and enthusiasm as a commercial factor. There is no gainsaying the fact that the pessimistic, gloomy business man is one who very soon will find himself upon financial rocks. All those honourable members who have had to do with large business operations know the value of hope, springing ""eternal in the human breast,"" when they are beset with temporary difficulties. I can conceive of nothing so calculated to stimulate the hopes, and to dissipate the pessimism of Australians, as will this Budget. ""I hope I may be forgiven for saying that all this booming prosperity must not be attributed to the Government. It must do so, because of the policy. Sir JOHN FORREST I did not sav that. speaking apropos of the statement made by the Treasurer's leader in Sydney, that the policy of the Government had led to this prosperity.

239,Mr Josephcook,"We are all, inof the steel casing of repressive Socialism, and so strike a blow at their present prosperity. The great lesson of the Budget is a lesson of individuality, of freedom to take advantage of the throb of these great forces, guiding and moulding them for individual ends, always seeking, of course, in its broadest aspect the prosperity of the country as a whole. In a period of prosperity like the present, the usual temptations follow. My honourable friend was absolutely accurate when he said that his experience was that the more a man has the more he spends. That is the experience of nations as well as of individuals, and I am afraid that the Budget furnishes evidence of that. Sir JOHN FORREST I have left a good balance-£311,228 , I think. wealth is enjoying an era. of prosperity, and the policy of the Budget is to let fly and make things hum merrily. And in consequence, we have, what I think I shall be pretty safe in describing as nothing more nor less than an electioneering Budget. Sir JOHN FORREST that. brief glance at the revenue returns for last year. We are told by the Treasurer that the receipts amounted to £11,879,000, there being an increase of .£199,000 in the amount raised from Customs duties. That increase may seem a large one, but it is really small in proportion to the increase in population. The figures have been alluded to as an indication that the rates of duty are too low, and that, consequently, our importations are too high; but, in reality, the increase is a normal one for a time of prosperity such as we are now passing through, having regard to the increase which has taken place in the population. The returns of the Post and Telegraph Department are a better index to the prosperity of a free country than any other revenue returns, and ours unmistakably point to the existence of booming times. Last year the receipts from duties of £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, but I venture to say that, when Federation was first accomplished, it was not thought that those figures would be so soon reached. T902'-3, the year of the drought. cause of abnormal conditions. There has been nothing exceptional to inflate the revenue of iast year. It is instructive to note that the large increases have taken place in New South Wales, where they amount to £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and in Queensland, where they amount to ,£87,000. Those States naturally import more than do the other States, because their exportations are larger, since they rely greatly upon primary production. In Victoria the increase is only_ £""48,000, and in South Australia only £""9,000; while in Tasmania there was a decrease. The inference which cannot be escaped is that a Tariff facilitating exchange with the markets of the world is the best for a young country like Australia. Where there is an abundance of virgin country, and few hands to till it, there The Commonmust be a great surplus for export, and the more facilities given for the exchange of our surplus products in the markets of the world, the more nearly is an ideal condition of things for our people brought about. To fasten upon a particular State, and argue from its conditions that our CustomsN o t at a l l . duties should be materially and radically not say altered, is to take a one-sided view of a very big and complex question. The figures I have given freely indicate what is L e t us take a the right policy for Australia as a whole, and make it apparent that we should not fetter or hinder the exchange of our natural products in the markets of the world. It is estimated that next year the increase in our revenue will amount to only £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 , or £ per cent a very small increase. The receipts from Customs duties are likely to be larger by £ 1 1 5 , 0 0 0 than those of the .financial year just concluded; but the introduction of penny postage and other proposed expenditure will bring down the total increase to only about i per cent. In this connection it is worthwhile to consider the effect of Federation upon the revenue of the States. New South Wales has had a roaring, roystering, time ever since Federation was inaugurated, but some of the other States have had to suffer stress and strain. For instance, the Treasury of New South Wales has received from the Commonwealth £""7,500,000 more than it would have reCustoms and Excise exceeded ceived had there been no Federation. The Victorian Treasury has also received a slight surplus ; but the Queensland Treasury has lost, in the aggregate. £2,600,000. most solvent State in the Commonwealth.",42,Forrest W O U L D Not The Hon Some Of The States From The Very Outset

There is no need for despair. But there is reason for the exercise of caution and prudence. finances of Tasmania have been entirely dislocated by the Federal Tariff. I have been told that her direct taxation amounts to-day to 24s. 3d. per head. South Wales imposed direct taxation at the same rate, she would be raising £1,800,000 from direct taxation, while Victoria under the same conditions would be raising more than £1,500,000.

M!r. WATSON themselves say that the best thing that could happen to the State would be the imposition of a land tax. honourable member thinks so; but I differ from him. In my opinion, seeing that the direct taxation of the State provides 60 per cent, of its total local revenue, the time is not opportune to propose to increase it. member and his party I do not think justification nor principle to recommend it. It has-no justification so far as financial considerations are concerned, and no principle from an economic point of view. I make these remarks merely in passing. The financial position of Tasmania requires all the sympathy that we We have paid our can give. The people of that State are shouldering in a manly and heroic fashion The falling off the burdens which have been imposed on them by Federation. Turning to the expenditure side of the balance-sheet, I should like, in the first place, to refer to what I consider the misleading statements of the Treasurer and the PostmasterThese figures have an imGeneral. misleading. The Treasurer, for instance, mentioned the fact that last year we gave the States£ 8 2 9 , 9 2 5 over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under the Constitution. Sir JOHN FORREST T h a t is right. surer put it in this wayWe returned to the States £829,925 more than was constitutionally obligatory. If New That is a very misleading way of putting it. We are constitutionally obliged to return to the States every penny that we can. The obligation rests upon us to return every penny above the three-fourths limit, as well as every penny under it. Sir JOHN FORREST The Constitution merely provides that the Commonwealth shall not spend more than one-fourth of the total Customs and Excise revenue. It shows the unwisdom we are obliged to return to the States a l l we can over and above the three-fourths to which they are entitled. Sir JOHN FORREST No t if we spend it ourselves. to the way in which the Treasurer has put the matter. The Postmaster-General falls into the same mistake.

There ing way of putting the matter, and the sooner this little bit of cant is obliterated from the Treasurer's Budget the better will it be for all concerned. The cost of Federation is that whi'ch has been incurred because of Federation, and which would not have been incurred but for Federation. That is the only test which ought to be applied to the question of what constitutes Federal expenditure. to discuss what Federation has cost, we ought to consider the question from the stand-point of the taxpayers. Prime Minister and the Treasurer have told us that the taxpayers of the States and the Commonwealth are the same persons. Applying that argument to the cost of Federation, what is the position ? The cost of Federation seems to me to be the difference between the total cost of governing Australia before we entered into the Federal bond and its cost to-dav. of population ? that point presently. To-day, the cost of governing Australia-Stat e and Federalis 20 per cent, more than it was when we entered into the Union.

I am not altering the basis of the computation in When we come any way, and I am not bringing in anyextraneous matter. I simply say that the cost of governing the whole of the States Both the when we entered into Federation was £28,000,000, whereas it is to-day nearly £34,000,000. In other words, there has been an increase in our expenditure of 20 per .cent., and an increase in our population of only 8J per cent. If we could point to an increase of population corresponding with the increase in our expenditure, the position would not be so bad, although, as a matter of fact, any increase of population ought to mean a decrease in the cost of government. of government due to extravagance on the part of the States? matter. I am merely pointing out that the same taxpayers have to pay the ininto Federation was only creased cost. It does not matter whether the States are extravagant or not. The total cost of Federation is the cost by which the government of Australia as a whole has increased, between the period when Federation was accomplished and the present time. The figures show an alarming rate of increase in our expenditure-a n increase of 20 per cent-as against an increase of 8| per cent, in our population. That increase, I think, is due to the financial relations which exist between: the Com\ a monwealth and the States. The latter are receiving the moneys which we raise. They have no obligation to raise them for themselves. Theirs is the privilege of spending them.

The first objection is the loss of revenue involved, and the second is the fact that the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department has each year exceeded its revenue, and that, therefore, to incur anyserious loss would be inadvisable. The Postmaster-General deals with the first objection in a very easy way, by declaring that the experience of countries which have adopted the penny .rate, shows that the idea that there is a loss of revenue involved is fallacious, seeing that an increase in the amount of correspondence immediately commences, and, in a short time, restores the equilibrium. But has that been the case in Victoria? Later on, the figures of the Postmaster-General show that that result has not followed in the StateI have mentioned. Victoria is now higher than it was when penny postage was established. to ask the Postmasters-General what the expenditure is in Victoria to-day as compared with the period to which he refers? orable member take the case of Newj Zealand, in regard to which we have exact figures. in passing, to ask the Postmaster-General whether the view expressed in his memorandum is departmental, or whether it is his own personal view? If the honourable gentleman were able to assure us that the Department believes the loss of revenue to be a matter of no concern, I should attach the greatest possible weight to that view; but I am not prepared to accept his individual opinion. honourable member mean by "" departmental view "" ? view of the officers of the Department. Is the comment in the memorandum that of the officers of the Department, or that of the Posmaster-General himself? Sir naturally very conservative. with abundant justification, particularly in matters of Estimates. Sir JOHN FORREST We expect an old Postmaster-General to support penny postage. that I am not going to support penny postage. I am concerned with putting the matter straightforwardly and clearly before the people of this country, and I do not think that that has been done in this memorandum. Reference is made in it to foreign countries which have adopted a penny postage rate. We are told that penny postage prevails in tlie United King dom. But the Postmaster-General does riot tell us that when it was adopted there the United Kingdom had a population of 17,000,000. Nor does he tell us that in the United Kingdom the cost of distributing fhe mails is a mere, fleabite compared with the cost in a continent like Australia In the ^United Kingdom the utmost distance to be covered is only 400 miles. Here we have 3,000 miles over which to distribute our mails. Our expense -per capita is, therefore, much in excess of the expense in the United Kingdom. I point to those facts as worthy of consideration-that in the I should like United Kingdom there was a population of 17,000,000 when tlie penny postage rate was adopted, and that there the mails have to be distributed over a country whose greathave 3,000 miles to cover.

383,Mr Austin Chapman,"We are refusingbetween Federal and State finance. My only object in criticising his memorandum is to show that as a basis for any forecast it is worthless, because it furnishes no means for making a comparison, and that if we are to have the penny post inaugurated, we must make up our minds to face a very substantial loss. This is not: a matter which would affect the large States appreciably, but it would affect very materially the small States, whose Governments are straining every nerve to make both ends meet. In Tasmania, for instance, the people are bearing direct taxation to the tune of 24s. 3d. per head, and still the Government cannot make ends meet. Here is a proposal to take from them immediately £ 1 5 , 0 0 0. From the view-point of the smaller States, the position is a very grave one indeed. The larger States could afford to meet the burden, because in view of their surpluses the introduction of the penny post would not make any material difference. If things were equal I should applaud the proposal as being as good a way of spending the surplus revenues as any I know of within the Federal purview. I make these criticisms now because I feel that, while the bookkeeping system continues, we are but trustees and clerks for the States, so far as their finances are concerned, and should be careful how we dispose of large sums of money belonging to them, and not to the Commonwealth. the States and the people of the Commonwealth is being produced here in much wealth are one and the same. must honour the bookkeeping system so long ditions of the people. Although there is a as it remains in force. Sir JOHN FORREST The Commonwealth is entitled to spend one-fourth of little time ago, much remains to be done the net revenue from duties of Customs and but there are put forward ini the right honourable gentleman's Budget proposals for the ear-marking of special taxation, which show that he expects that the time will soon arrive when he will spend more than one-fourth. financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States will never be satisfactory until the different entities are financially independent, and the sooner we approve of a scheme which will place the relationship on a proper and independent footing the better. By doing so, we shall create a better feeling and more harmonious relations, paving 0 the way for each, within its own sphere, to move onwards to a prosperous future. though the honourable member for Parramatta differs from the Treasurer on some points, he views a satisfactory 'Budget from practically the same aspect, the general effect upon both gentlemen being almost identical. The Treasurer sees in the record of a good financial year the opportunity to throw money about, careless of what the consequences may be, while the acting leader of the Opposition takes it as an indication that all is well with the country, and nothing more requires to be done. According to him, ail excuse for social legislation disappears with the presentation of a Budget disclosing a handsome surplus. honourable member, if he substitutes "" Socialism "" for social legislation. member must be aware that the condition of the public revenue is not an unfailing index of the condition of the people. He ought to know that, only lately, in England, a period of the greatest prosperity, judged by statistics of imports and exports and of manufacturing, activity, was coincident with the greatest destitution and want of employment. Mere statements of revenue and expenditure showing a surplus do not go to the root of matters. The fact that we in Australia are able to raise The people of enough money to pay our debts, and that larger measure than was previously the Yes ; but we case, is no complete criterion of the congreater measure of prosperity amongst our people to-dav than they were enjoying a before the condition of the masses will be reasonably satisfactory. done in the equalization of the distribution of wealth. production of wealth is one thing, and its distribution another.

If honourable members will look at the expenditure of the last few years, they will see that a steadily-increasing amount has been laid out by the Federal authorities. I am bound to admit that some of the expenditure has been inevitable from the stand-point of policy. We entered upon the payment of the sugar bounties with our eyes wide open, and in other directions there were increases that were impossible to avoid.' Some of these were due to a better recognition of the rights of public servants to fair treatment at the hands of their employers, the people, and some were attributable to other causes.

Take, for instance, the additional £ 7 7 , 0 0 0 which it is proposed to expend upon the Military Forces. Some four years ago the leaders of different parties in the House came to an understanding-and in the absence of any disclaimer from individuals, we may assume that honourable members were unanimous-that the Military Estimates should be limited to £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 . That amount was to be exclusive of any votes for special armaments or war materiel of a specific character. added ,£96,000 to our Defence Estimates on the account of the Naval Subsidy, and as that increase was approved of by a distinct vote of the House, no exception can be taken to it, so far as the administration is concerned. Since then, however, there have been steady and repeated attempts to increase the vote until we find that the present Estimates exceed the amount previously agreed upon by £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 . Sir JOHN FORREST mates amount to only £ 6 7 6 , 0 0 0 , because £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 is payable under the Naval Agreement. increase of £ 9 6 , 0 0 0 under the naval subsidy, there remains a net addition to the outlay upon the Military Forces of ,£80,000 over and above the sum previously agreed upon. I think that we should be prepared, at the earliest possible moment, to make Something like adequate provision for coastal defence. It is utterly nonsensical for us to spend such a large amount upon our Military Forces, whilst we are making practically no provision for coastal defence. I do not wish to discuss the policy of the Naval Agreement. It is there, and we have to adjust our arrangements in view of the continuance of the agreement for the f u l l period. We must, however, provide for local coastal defence, which the Imperial Squadron on the Australian Station does not pretend to give. The Imperial authorities look upon the squadron as being intended for general defence purposes, and as available for service in the China seas at any moment if occasion should require. he in the highest decree suicidal for us to spend no time or money in making provision for the defence of our harbors and coast line. If there is to be anv increased expenditure, it should be UDon the Naval side of our defence. If the Government had proposed t ° spend £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in building suitable craft for the protection of our harbors, I should have been very glad to give them all the assistance possible. While, however, remaining silent upon that important aspect of our defences, they propose to increase the estimates for the Military Forces, which, after all, are only our second line of defence, by £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 . rifles to be provided for. Since then we have ing of the expenditure upon rifles or war materiel, but of the annual expenditure upon the training and maintenance of the Military Forces. I make no complaint with regard to the money proposed to be spent in the purchase of rifles or field .guns or ammunition, but I submit that it is altogether unjustifiable to so largely increase the Military Estimates, and leave the Naval side of our defence unprovidedi for. Apart from the question of spending The Military Esti,£100,000 or £1:50,000 per annum upon the development of our Naval defences, there is need for the establishment of an ammunition factory, a small-arms factory, and the nucleus of an arsenal. All these are items of extra expenditure for which monev will have to be found at no distant date. ,1 find that it is proposed to spend an additional £167,00 0 upon works and buildings.

Then there is the question of the construction of the transcontinental railway. If that undertaking is to be regarded as a possibility, it will involve the Commonwealth in a fairly large deficit for some years after its completion. I do not think that even our optimistic Treasurer will argue that it will pay from the start. Sir within three years of its completion, I think. would be a most remarkable circumstance if it did. In any case, we should have to face a deficiency in connection with it. The engineers who reported upon it as men who are accustomed to making estimates of that character, bearing in mind the country which it would traverse, and the population which it would serve at either end, calculated that it would involve us in a loss of £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 annually for ten years. I am net arguing that that is a loss which the Commonwealth should not be prepared to face. The New South Wales Government constructed a line of railway dewn the south coast upon which they lost £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 annually for a good many years, and upon which they still lose a very large sum. For the Commonwealth to be called upon to face a similar annual loss upon a railway constructed for developmental purposes would be a comparatively small matter. Sir JOHN that the loss would be anything like that amount. opinion. I have merely quoted from the testimony of experts. There is no doubt that some loss would have to be faced in connection with that line, and it is well for A goctl torpedo boat us to keep it in mind. Then there is the sugan bounty. The Treasurer estimates that during the current year we shall have to pay about £ 2 7 8 , 5 0 0 in this connection. There is a very large increase in the sum payable this year, as compared with the amount expended last year, owing to the C o u l d net we hire the expected increase in the quantity of sugar produced by white labour. No doubt the Treasurer anticipates that next year the expenditure in that direction will be still larger. As I have said, it is estimated that the expenditure this year, when black labour will be in some measure available for the production of a large proportion of the sugar, will amount to £278,500. But next year black labour will not be available in the same degree, and consequently we shall have a larger expenditure, since every grower who employs white labour exclusively will naturally apply for the bounty. As we receive only £ 1 out of the £ 4 per ton Excise duty, and have to pay from the Federal Treasury£ 3 per ton by way of bounty, JOHN FORREST -It would pay it stands to reason that there will be a largely increased demand upon the one-fourth of revenue retained by the Commonwealth. I do not know whether the I do not think so. It Treasurer has looked ahead to ascertain how far his revenue will be affected in this way. I am inclined to think that, owing to the greater proportion of sugar grown by white labour, he will expend next year at least ^£150,000 more than he is paying away this year in respect of the bounty. will get it. pointing out that we have ahead a number of commitments: that will affect our power to expend the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue to which we are entitled. make the payment a rebate. it was passed as a rebate, but the Crown Law officers said that that was unconstitutional. We had therefore to retrace our steps, and describe the payment as a may find some method of overcoming the difficulty.

They have very important duties to perform ini the interests of the people, and it is only natural that the number of their officers should be increased as opportunities for benefiting the people present themselves. We have, for instance, such proposals as the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture in connection with the Department of Home Affairs, and the taking over of the Department of Meteorologv, which will involve an increased expenditure. That increased expenditure is essential to secure increased efficiency. And so in other directions the Departments will naturally grow. We aTe told by the Government that it will cost something to advertise the Commonwealth in connection with the immigration proposals; and a much larger matter which will demand attention in the near future is the taking over of the Northern Territory.

He put forward many other admirable suggestions. For instance, his proJOHN FORREST -The Constitution posal to establish a sinking fund, and to place the money in the care of debt commissioners-that is, permanent individuals, with the assistance of the Treasurer, but -in the main independent of politics^is an excellent suggestion.

For that reason, there ought to be some constitutional barrier placed in the way of their' appealing to that market, perhaps in competition with the Commonwealth acting on behalf of all the people of Australia. through the Commonwealth. to think that some such arrangement would be a wise one.

The Treasurer has adopted a policy upon lines similar to those suggested by me during the previous Budget debate, and has approached solution of the problem than has any of his predecessors in office. However we may differ with regard to the details of his proposal, there is no doubt that the right honourable gentleman has applied his mind to this matter, and has contributed some valuable suggestions. I am glad to gather from the Prime Minister that there is no truth in the statement published in the newspapers this morning to the effect that he had stated that no proposal would be made for taking over the States debts until 1910. If that were true, this would be nothing more than a mere academic debate. I think that the Prime Minister, and the honourable member for Mernda. recognise that the questibn of reducing the burden of interest payments upon loans is of tremendous and immediate importance. we could reduce the rate of interest payable on our loans by \ per cent., we should save the people of Australia over -£1,000,000 per annum. If we could reduce the interest charge by 1 per cent., we should lighten the burden of the taxpayers by ference to the Budget papers will show that next year ^5,000,000 will have to be provided for the repayment of loans. In the following year, £7,000,000, in the next year, £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; in the succeeding year, £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and in the ensuing twelve months, £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , will have to be found for the renewal of loans. Thus, every year large loans are falling due, and the whole question will have to be tackled. If the situation.is not faced by the Commonwealth, the States must act on their own behalf under all the disadvantages attached to having to go into the London market as competitors, without the backing of the Commonwealth. This problem can be dealt with, irrespective of any amendment of the Braddon section. That provision in the Constitution is an important one, but its amendment is not essential to enable the Commonwealth to take over the States debts. The Braddon section provides that the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which is now . paid over to the States, may be disposed of either in that way, or by being applied to the payment of the interest on the States debts taken over by the Commonwealth. [86] The Treasurer clothed the dry bones of his figures with a good deal of flesh and blood. He has put his whole heart into his subject, as he always does. Having said that, more closely to a it is, perhaps, quite pardonable to find that he devotes one of his valuable two eyes to Western Australia, and a good portion of the other also. At all events, I shall show presently that, very naturally, he feels great concern lest his State should get the worse of the bargain. Sir JOHN FORREST I do not want to see any injustice done to it. tant feature of the Treasurer's scheme which differentiates it from all other schemes-it has the approval of the Government. That means that it is to be taken up by the Government, and it is extremely important, therefore, that honourable members should offer such critiques as they may think necessary before it is placed before the people in a definite form. For instance, if The Treasurer proposes to make one amendment only of the Constitution. Sir JOHN FORREST T w o .

The result was that the creditors would not accept less than 20s. in the pound. Of course, I recognise that I am putting an extreme case; but, after all, this is only a matter in which we must exercise common sense. The meaning of the words "" take over"" is perfectly clear. They do not mean that a State shall not continue to be liable to its creditors. It will still be liable. But the Commonwealth will have practically said, "" We will also be liable.""

Rightlv or wrongly, I hold that there will be a most material improvement in the stocks of the States, when once they are backed by the Commonwealth -guarantee. It now appears that the Treasurer, as the result of the interviews which he had with financial men in London, has come to a similar conclusion. The point which, the late Treasurer ignored in all his interviews with the Premiers has been seized very thoroughly and clearlv by the present occupant of that office. The only thing that tage will there be to the States or to the I wish to say to the right honourable gentleCommonwealth if we do not take over man is that he must recollect that the their indebtedness at once? only power which the Constitution .gives us for taking over the States debts is conholders of £ 1 0 0 worth of these Queenstained in section 105.

When tlie Constitution was being framed, the fear was expressed that one State might get more advantage from T h a t is, if they are conthe Commonwealth backing than would another State. That was the reason why No . If the Commonthe clause was drafted in its present form. If we take over all the debts of the States at one swoop, we shall be giving the existing bondholders a ' big premium for nothing. Let us suppose that a Tasmanian bond carrying interest at 4 per 1 cent, is worth £ 1 0 0 , or par to-morrow. If the Commonwealth were to declare, "" We will assume responsibility for the payment of that bond,"" I venture to say that it would be worth at least £ 1 0 2 . either the Commonwealth or the Tasmanian Government? thing to bargain with, and that as a result the Commonwealth could give a bond carrying a lower rate of interest. I have in my mind an instance of a Queensland loan which will mature in 191:5. In that year a debt of .£11,400,000 will fall due. If that debt were taken over in, say, 1907, the State of Queensland would still remain liable for it, but the ComB u t a creditor cannot monwealth would have pledged itself to see both the principal and the interest upon it paid. In other words, there would be the honourable behind that debt, not only the Queensland promise to pay, but also the Com-, monwealth promise-the better security of all the States. Moreover, in London, the I embodied my conclusions in an stock would be more marketable, because Daily we should have a large uniform stock. I am told upon very good authority that just as consols are used in London to-day for mercantile transactions-in the knowledge that there are plenty of consols available so long as people are willing to pay the price demanded for them-w e shall find, so long as Commonwealth stock is uniform and invariable, and there is plenty of it to be had upon the market in time of stress, that not only investors, but financial men also will purchase it.

Sir the probable increase of population. lation increases, the more women and babies there will be, and, therefore, the less revenue per head. Sir JOHN FORREST I was taking into account new people. is such an expanding revenue in Western Australia is that in that State there are more men who drink and smoke; and I must say that the Treasurer is right when he reminds us that it is the drinking men and the smoking men who keep the Commonwealth solvent-that but for such men we should be in sad case. As a solution of the difficulty to which the honourable member for Mernda alluded, I suggest that there should be some slight modification of the Treasurer's proposal for fixed payments. 105. That proposal has much to recommend it, inasmuch as it would make for certainty for giving the Commonwealth power to lend the States Treasurers, and would tend to do the States money. away with quarrelling and trouble. Every year we are told that we are spending too aspect of section 96, which I thought was much, but if there were fixed payments well worth looking into, and I have come to the fact would diminish immensely the fricthe conclusion, right or wrong, that we cantion between the Commonwealth and the not give financial assistance in that way by States. I should like, however, to see some practically taking over the debts. If there provision made by which, if the revenue were no section 105 in the Constitution, were to fall considerably below, say, for there would not be so much difficulty in example, £8,000,000, there should be a coming to the conclusion presented to us by proportionate reduction in the fixed paythe honourable member. ments. Sir that occurring. the Treasurer say that, and I hope he is right. I only say that I should feel more 'secure if there were a provision that if the revenue fell considerably below, say, the £8,000, 0 0 0 standard, which the honourable member for Mernda mentioned, there should be a proportionate reduction in the pavment to the States. Sir such a provision, because I do not think the circumstances are likelv to arise, and, in any case, do not think it necessary. Treasurer has no objection to any suggestion which may help his scheme to a consummation.

A t the same time, if a crisis ever does occur, I do The reason that there not want the whole brunt to f a ll on the Commonwealth Government, because any difficulty ought to be shared by both States and Commonwealth. I think I am not wrong in saying that the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda depends on his reading of section 96 of the Constitution. The honourable member regards that section, which gives power to the Commonwealth to grant financial assistance to any State, as involving the further power to take over the debts, practically irrespective of section Air. HIGGINS T h a t was to me a new But section 105 sets forth the conditions under which we effect to that section equally with section I am very glad to hear 96-w e must read them both together. I have no doubt that the Court would come to the conclusion that section 105 provides the only way in which we can take over the debts, and that the granting of financial assistance was meant primarily to apply to the case of a State which threw out the flag of distress, and asked for help.

I do not know who was the exact propounder or proposer of section 96, but I apprehend it must have been the honourable member who leads the Opposition. of section 96, namely, to avoid the pressure of the argument that there' must be much Customs taxation in order to meet the needs of the poorer States. I admit that the historv of the section does not affect its interpretation; we must take a section as it stands in the Constitution. But I have little doubt that the interpretation of the two sections would be that the only power to take over the debts is that conferred by section 105, and that the only application of section 96 is to enable fhe Commonwealth to hold out a hand to a State which cries for aid. simply. that it is not enough for our purposes to exercise a power which we believe we have. It is too doubtful a power to exercise. In London investors and others will obtain advice about these things, and if a doubt is thrown upon what we are doing, it will mean that many investors will fight shy of this security. It is not enough for us to make a safe security, but we must make a security which also seems to be safe. On these grounds, I do not think that it would be well for us to attempt the experiment the honourable gentleman has referred to. My feeling is that the sooner we get to a per capita distribution, the better, and that we ought not to be deterred by any difficulties with regard to small sums, of money. Still, it must be remembered thlat Western Aus-' tralia is in an exceptional position. Her revenue for next year is estimated to be £ 3 14s. rod. per head of the population, We all recolwhilst that for New South Wales is only jQz 3s. 4d., and for Tasmania£ 1 16s.

As On behalf of New South Wales the Treasurer properly says, the greater part of our revenue is derived from the consumption of alcohol and narcotics. consume less than men. children there are, the smaller the conNo doubt that was the intention sumption, because women and children do not consume drink and tobacco as men do. Why, I myself, in company with the Treasurer, saw in Kalgoorlie, men four deep waiting for drinks* around a bar. The Treasurer need not think that his favourite Western Australia will always consume at such a great rate. He himself has told us that in the first year of the Commonwealth the consumption in Western Australia was not £ 3 14s. iod., but £ 5 16s. 4d. per head. In other words, when the Commonwealth started five or six years ago, Western Australia had per head two and a half limes the revenue of Tasmania. Now she has only one and a half times as much revenue, a falling off of 50 per cent. I expect that when we reach the year 1910 the States will have approached very near to an equalitv. The Treasurer, at page 2032 of his Budget statement, saidMy confidence is somewhat shaken, however, when I notice that resolutions have been passed in Conference and in Parliament asking for a fer capita distribution, under which the State of which I am a representative would suffer a loss of about ^300,000 a year. Those figures show that we are approaching very near to the state at which we ought to have a per capita distribution. .For that reason, I think that the Treasurers scheme based upon a five years' average is not a sound one.

They get no advantage, direct or indirect, from our White Australia legislation, but they wish to see Australia kept white. Victoria has paid £219,000 to keep Australia white and free from the Kanakas, and she has not grumbled a bit. Tasmania has paid £32,000 up to the present for the same purpose, and there is no grumbling. I merely suggested a larger bill.

I feel certain that whether the -Commonwealth borrows or not, it should never borrow until it has begun to float) loans for the conversion of the States debts. It wants to get its foot firmly established on a creditable foundation in the London market. This system of paying from revenue for post-offices and the like is a strong factor in the economy which has marked our Federal system hitherto. Some years ago, I went into calculations, and I found that, notwithstanding that the object of borrowing is to relieve the tax-payers, yet they have actually paid more in interest than they would if ttvsy had paid for all their works from revenue. I have verified the figures for Victoria in particular, but the same remark applies in a greater degree to the other States, because Victoria has borrowed less per head. It is an extraordinary thing that what was meant to be a relief to the tax-payers has not been so in the long run. In conclusion, I feel that we have good reason for hopefulness in regard to Australia. A country with an oversea trade of £95,000,000, a trade per head of £ 2 3 9s. od., is one which, although it has only 4,000,000 people, is not to be despised. We have great troubles and great difficulties to face; we have our problems to solve, but there is no doubt that Australia is a country which is as likely to make ptogress as is any country in the world.
