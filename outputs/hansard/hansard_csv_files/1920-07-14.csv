The indications we have received since notice was given of this motion are very hopeful for honourable members on this side of the House. On Thursday we were accused by the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) of giving notice of motion simply because the Ballarat election was pending. That honourable member did us a very good turn by postponing or preventing the discussion of the motion, for if ever you get the people outside imagining that Parliament, or a section of Parliament, desires to prevent free discussion, the people will give an effective answer, as they did in 1910. In that year they felt that the Labour party, to which the Prime Minister and myself then belonged, were not heing given a fair deal in the House. They believed that we were being closured and prevented from putting our case before them, and they resented the fact accordingly. The peoplo resented the Government tactics on Saturday last, when they thought the Government intended to burke the discussion on this motion hy postponing it. I referred last Friday, on a point of order, to a statement attributed hy the Melbourne Herald to the Prime Minister. The following paragraph, which appeared in that paper on the 8th July, was my authority:"" -MB. HUGHES SOUNDS WABITIXG.

Mr Hughes, replying to greetings, sounded a note of warning as to the dangers that beset the Nationalist Government from a few extremists and disloyalists.

The House was not permitted to debate this motion prior to the Ballarat election, but the discussion of it is more than ever necessary to-day. Taking the figures for the Ballarat by-election, and assuming that the same results were to occur in the remaining seventy-four constituencies surely would not be so foolish as to suggest anything of the kind. it ; the same thing would happen in many other electorates. The figures so far to hand in respect of the Ballarat election prove, if they prove anything at all, that the party to which the honourable member belongs either did not put up a very strong candidate, or that its principles are not approved by the electors there.

The result shows that the Age has a capacity for selecting candidates in the wrong way. The first two candidates on its list have lost their deposits, while Mr Kerby, who was selected by the Argus, is second on the poll. The Ballarat newspapers also opposed the Labour candidate. Labourites have not to thank the newspapers for any political or industrial gain secured by them.. Every success achieved by Labour has been in the face of bitter opposition on the part of the press. The ivorkers have nothing for which to thank the press. The Prime Minister who, in the old days, fought in the political and industrial ranks of Labour knows that my statement is correct. Labour has had to contend against the undying hostility of the press, and when the Age and the Argus stated that I was wrong in giving notice of this motion, and that the party which I lead was wrong in deciding that that action should be taken, I felt more than ever convinced that we were on the right track.

The profiteers are going on their way rejoicing, knowing that no action has been taken to deal'with them. very bad example by this House. who is referring to the increased allowance to honourable members, should speak for himself. When I was in Ballarat three weeks ago the electors were anxious to hear what I had to say on the subject. I dealt with it at length before a meeting of 3,000 persons, and was not greeted with one hostile interjection. £800. Is that not profiteering? part in the discussion on the question of making a special allowance to the Leader of the Opposition, but amongst those who supported the proposal were the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), and the honourable member for Darwin( Mr cause it was the profiteer who furnished Bell).

I do not know, however, whether under cover of this motion, wide as it is, we may discuss the building of the Federal Capital. During the last election the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) at one of his meetings referred to the National Federation, to which the supporters of the Government and some members of the Country party belong. He saidThe National Federation is an organization ol vested city interests drawing a colossal fighting fund from the manufacturers; and Flinders-lane, and perhaps other sources. . . . . The Federation employs a secretary at £1,250, and organizers at £500 a year. It published a pamphlet telling the people that if they wanted tlie cost of living kept down they should elect the Nationalist candidates. I have not seen a copy of the pamphlet; but, no doubt, the honourable member quoted it correctly. He went on to sayIt claimed 'that the National Government had reduced the cost of bread to 6Jd. In England bread was Is. It had arranged cheap and regular supplies of butter by forming a Butter Pool. It had given sugar at 3£d. per lb. In Europe it cost 7d.; and wheat was cheaper in Australia than in any other country. Not a word was said about cheap clothing or the thousands of articles sold by the people it stood for. That was the party which said it was going to ""shoot the profiteer."" Those profiteers could be shot with a shortrange gun from an upstairs room in Parliament House looking east, but they were nut likely to shoot the goose that laid such golden eggs. That is an opinion of the Ministerial party expressed, not by a representative of Labour, but by a representative of the Country party. The suggestion is that the Ministerial party were drawing a big fund for political purposes from Flinders-lane and the manufacturers, and they would not deal with profiteering be the .money to pay their election expenses. We know that no action has been taken by the Government to deal with the profiteer. The Prime Minister will say, as he has said before, that the Government As a matter of fact, I have not are prevented from taking action by our constitutional limitations. On that point we received, in connection with the Commercial Activities Bill, an opinion from leading constitutional lawyers, including the present Chief Justice of the High Court, to the effect that with regard to controlling the prices of wheat, sugar, flax, butter, and one other commodity which I do not recall at the present moment, the Government have the necessary power to control those prices in some cases up to the 30th September next, and, in other cases, even longer than that. So far as sugar is concerned, the Prime Minister has stated that because the Queensland Government entered into an agreement'in connection with the control of sugar, we were able to obtain that commodity at a cheaper rate than we could otherwise have done. It has been complained that so far as wheat, meat, and some other commodities are concerned, they have been sold more cheaply overseas than to the people of Australia.",21,Nationalist Aims

Mi-. TUDOR -If he is, I say good luck to him. When the Prime Minister introduced the measure to provide for the erection of silos in various parts of Australia, he said that they would represent, an assurance to the people of Australia that one or two season's wheat would be kept here as a guarantee against drought. Has that been done? We know that New South Wales is the only State in which any silos have been erected. that they built them there. whether the honourable member's interjection is accurate or not. It was understood that by the erection of the silos, at a cost of f d. per bushel added to the price of wheat, the people of Australia would have a guarantee that there would be no shortage of the commodity in this country. But the people of New South Wales, the only State in which silos have been erected, are complaining to-day that there is an insufficient quantity of wheat on hand, or that an insufficient quantity is being brought into the silos. I was very glad to hear the statement made, in answer to a question put by an honourable member, that sufficient wheat would be in hand until the next harvest was gathered. the New South Wales Government, who control their own wheat. shortage in one State, and not in another; and, in that case, the supply of wheat in the State in which the shortage existed [110]2 ""We are becomes a national matter, and it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to see that all are supplied. That duty should not be left to a State Government.

67,For Mr Tudor,"I cannot guarantee the man means to say that that was done by the butchers ? We cannot help that. growers of meat conld help that. It is well known that there are four staple commodities required in every homebread, butter, sugar, and meat. I obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician some years ago certain figures showing the quantity of each of these commodities used per head of this community. I found that during the period 1903-12 the local consumption of bread amounted to 4 lbs. per head per week. An investigation is being made of what the people use to-day, and I can give the quantity consumed by each individual, according to a tentative estimate based upon an investigation now in course of tabulation. Department informs me that the consumption to-day is 5 lbs. ner head per week; that means that the people axe using more bread than they were in 1912. A t that time, the average consumption ' of butter was half a lb. per head per week-roughly , 1,000 tons per week for the whole of the Commonwealth. consumption to-day is only 7 ozs. per head per week. cannot afford to buy butter. consumption of sugar has decreased from 2£ lbs. per head per week in 1912 to 2 lbs. per head per week. Eveni f the sugar contained in the immense amount of jam sent overseas were included, the orable member support the new sugar consumption per head of the people of agreement? Victoria would not be more than 2 \ lbs. The consumption of meat has decreased from 5 lbs. per head per week to 4 lbs. to the retail price. TwiceI tried to get per head per week. As recently as 1914 a vote of the House on the question, and the average price of bread throughout twice I was blocked by Ministerial memAustralia was 3.3d. per 2-lb. loaf. Tobers. I held the view that if the growers day the average is over 6d. member think that the price ought to be to the price before the article reached the cheaper, in the circumstances? I say again, that whilst some honourable the price to the consumer, some persons members are making human life cheap are making a big profit. by rendering it more difficult for peoole to get a living, they are adding to the also to bread. value of land and beef. Thomas Bent used to say that he "" took stated in July of last year that the millers off his hat to a cow "" ; T prefer to take had so combined that they could charge off my hat to a human being. If the Creator had intended that beasts should be considered of more importance than human beings, He would not have endowed us with superior powers of thought and reason. There is an endeavour on the part of a section of the community to make land and animals' of more value than human life. My policy is the reverse of that member's belief, he would take off his hat to the farmers in the north to-day. opinion that the honourable member for Yarra, when Minister for Customs, imposed a duty of 2d. per t in on New Zealand milk food for infants? ber is asking whether Glaxo should not be imported free of duty, The Statistician's and whether I was r i g h t in continuing protection to an industry which produces the same kind of food at Bacchus Marsh.

80,The Late Sir Mr Tudor,"That may be true. Ithe people any price they chose for their flour, and that they refused to supply any baker who sold bread at less than the price fixed by the millers. There was a co-operative flour mill at Wedderburn, in the electorate of Grampians, which was selling below the price fixed by the Combine, and its product was prevented from coming to the city. also the cases of the Civil Service Cooperative Bakery, which was (prevented by the "" Car-gear"" Committee from obtaining supplies of flour, and of customers who were not allowed to change their bakers. product of the Wedderburn mill out of the market, and subsequently the mill was burnt down.

I know that the butter exporters have never forgiven me for my action in connection with the embargo. member think they should? the people of Australia appreciated what I did. I objected to the exporters creating an artificial shortage of butter in Australia in order to force up the price. The people of Australia consume 4 lbs. out of every 5 lbs. produced locally, and they are entitled to first consideration. They consume, too, more beef than is exported ter, and wheat cheaper from any other country? nor could we import more cheaply than' we can produce a lot of articles which the honourable member thinks should be brought into the country duty free. The farmers say, ""Give us a big duty upon products from other countries; let no potatoes come from New Zealand and no onions from America or anywhere else. Place a big duty on onions and potatoes, but let us import all our farming implements free of duty.""

How absurd it is! prices, and you can put on all the other items of Protection that you like. men now want import parity, and at a time when freight is higher than ever before.

I wonder, too, seeing that When some members of the Country party good care to say that they are Protectionists. lost his deposit, perhaps. the Ballarat electors considered he was no good. With regard to the item of meat, the increase has been greater than upon ail the other domestic lines which I have mentioned put together.

How many head of stock have died to any more inane interjections. I would like an opportunity to say that meat, which cost 22s. per 100 lbs. in 1914, was quoted in January-Jun e this year at an average of 53s. 2d. per 100 lbs. Will any honourable member say that the average retail price to-day is only 6id. per lb ? The honourable member for Indi knows the position in which the unhappy consumer finds himself, and he must have some idea of the purchasing power of the sovereign to-day, compared with 1914. The people are not concerned with Mr Knibbs' statistics, or with weighted averages, and that kind of thing. But they know how much it costs to procure a loaf of bread to-day, compared with a few years ago. When I have spoken to metropolitan audiences, and to the people at Ballarat and elsewhere, and I have set forth details of the sugar agreement, showing that the producer is getting only a penny out of the increased price, the people have naturally wanted to know what has become of the rest of it . And they have every right to know why the price should have gone up 2£d. per lb., although the sugar farmer and miller get only I d . per lb extra. Now, let us take the item of bread.

119,Mr Tudor,"I have taken trouble torelation to bread, sugar, butter, and meat. The increases are not my calculations, but are the figures of Mr Knibbs and his staff, and the particulars upon which they were based were obtained direct from retail shops by the Statistician's officers. On the basis of consumption of 5 lbs. of bread per head per week -the increase being 3d. per 2-lb. loafit means an average individual increase of 7£d. for bread alone in the bills of an ordinary family of five. On an average family consumption of 2 lbs. of sugar per week, the cost has gone up 6^d. Butter has increased more than Is. per lb., and meat has increased at least 6d. per lb., so that on the 4 lbs. allowed to each individual per week there is a defiuite increase of 2s. per head. for the average family a total increase of over £1 per week on these items alone, apart altogether from house rent and clothing. groceries and food, states that what could have been bought for 22s. l i d . in 1913 costs to-day 37s. 7d. which cannot be controverted, and every honourable member will admit that Knibbs' figures are never over the mark. In regard to house rents, he states that a house which could have been rented for 22s. 4d. in 1913 is worth 25s. 8d. to-day, an increase of only about 15 per cent. But all honourable members know that house rents have gone up 50 per cent, in some cases, and the difficulty in many localities is in getting any house. Every honourable member who represents a metropolitan division, as I do, must be aware of the position. The Inter-State Commission inquired into this problem some time ago, and arrived at the conclusion that we were 25,000 houses short in the Eastern States. What has been done with that report? Nothing. knows that the housing difficulty in the metropolitan area is largely due to the drift of population. the same in many country towns. houses are being pulled down and carted away. carted to?

I believe the manager was brought before the Commission, and told that he had to sell the tweed at a cheaper rate. up at auction, and brought a much greater sum than that which the firm was charging.

In this respect it is very much like the Basic Wage Commission, and it will shortly cease to exist. Originally its term expired on the 30th June, but there has been an extension u n t i l the end of the year. a further extension. torian Government will not take kindly to any such proposal. A t any rate, the Commission is only there for a limited time. Another fact was brought before the Commission, and was thus dealt w it h in the Age of ten days or a fortnigh t ago:A most .glaring instance of profiteering duroperative societies in the country unless ing the demand caused by the strike for emergency illuminants was exposed before the Fair Profits Commission yesterday. The instance is the more remarkable in that it embraced several transactions in the one line of goods on the one day-som e within ten minutes of each other; that three middlemen as well as the importer and the retailer handled the goods before the consumer was offered them; and that between importer and consumer a difference between the landed cost (4s. 4d. each) and retail price (15s.) of 10s. 8d. had occurred. The transactions centred round a line of Windsor hurricane lamps imported from New York at invoice cost f.o.b. of 31s. 6d. per doz. (2s. 7id. each) and lauded cost of 52s. 8d. (4s. 4d. The Commission proposes to each) by the Vacuum Oil Company. Evidence regarding the subsequent transactions was given before the Commission yesterday by representatives of the various firms named, who had been summoned as witnesses. It was deposed that S. R. O. Allen, importer, Williamstreet, bought from the Vacuum Oil Company on 14th June seventy-two dozen of the lamps at 58s. 6d. per doz. The same morning Mr Allen sold ten cases to George Russell Proprietary Limited, Flinders-street, at 77s. 6d. per dozen; also twenty cases to James McEwan and Company at 80s. per dozen ten minutes later; thirty-one cases to Brandt Brothers at 80s. ten minutes later again; and ten cases to JamesI do not know.

About a fortuight ago, a letter appeared in the Age, referring to dealings in other commodities, and containing the following:We hear it remarked everywhere that the cost of living has advanced 50 per cent., but the fact is that the cost of living has advanced somewhere approaching 200 per cent. In support of that assertion/ let us examine a few items of necessaries, omitting luxuries and fancy items, many of which have advanced 500 per cent, or 600 per cent.:: Pricesin 1913 £ s. d.

It was shown before the Inter-State Commission that there are certain firms in Melbourne, known as the ""Holy Seven,"" who absolutely control the wholesale grocery trade here. evidence given, these firms refuse to supply any goods to traders who have dealings with outside firms. Many firms have tried to get into this inner ring, but have been prevented. It is preserved in the same way as the United Shoe Machinery Trust is preserved. This latter Trust controls certain machinery in Australia and other parts of the world, and will have no dealings with any firms who venture to use other machinery. Fori n stance, if a shoe manufacturer has one of their machines for sewing welts, he must also use one of their machines for doing' the eyeletting. This"" Holy Seven"" has absolute control in the same way of the wholesale grocery business; and I have no doubt that in this regard the Inter-State Commissioners referred to the necessity for the Government taking some action. The Government did take some action in regard to meat, but the Ministry were frightened by a demonstration of the producers concerned, who chartered seven special trains to bring a deputation to town.

Williams work out at 170 per cent.; so, to put it mildly, it must cost each man, woman, and child at least an. additional £10 per annum to live. In regard to the question of sugar supplies, the Government have exhibited their utter incapacity. As far back as September of last year, Ministers knew, within 10,000 tons, what would be the yield of the Queensland crop. As a matter of fact, while I was discussing this very question, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) interjected that the Government knew to within 5,000 tons what that crop would be. If they knew that the Australian production would amount only to 186,000 tons, they must have known that we should require to import about an additional 100,000 tons. But instead of importing that quantity, they imported only 70,100 tons. Some time ago I asked a series of questions in this chamber, with a view to Eliciting exactly how much that sugaT cost, because I say deliberately that the retail price of sugar should not be what it is to-day. The people are paying an unduly high price for that commodity owing to the incompetency of the Government. for Trade and Customs, the Government landed 60,000 tons of sugar from Java for £22 per ton f.o.b., they imported an additional 6,000 tons from there at a cost of £23 per ton, and a further 4,100 tons from F i j i at £25 per ton. quiries regarding the freight which was paid upon these importations, I was informed that it was 35s. per ton from Java, and 27s. 6d. per ton from F i j i . Insurance upon the 66,000 tons of Java sugar varied from 9s. 9d. per cent, to 10s. l i d . per' cent.; say, from 2s. to 2s. 4d. per ton extra under that head. The insurance upon the F i j i shipment was Mr Tudor. Motion. at the rate of 8s. per cent. The exchange in connection with the Java purchases was 15s. per cent, and 17s. 6d. per cent., and from F i j i , nil. The whole of the 70,100 tons of sugar imported, was landed at less than 3d. per lb. I repeat that in September last the Government knew that they would require to import at least 100,000 tons of sugar, and that they should have made their arrangements accordingly. I blame them for Those given by Mr Arthur putting into the sugar agreement a condition which prevented the Queensland Government from increasing the capacity of the mills there. all. presentatives from Queensland that it did have an 'effect. effect. the Government insert that condition in the agreement; and, if the course they adopted was the right one, why did they afterwards take that condition out of the agreement? The Government have admitted that they made a mistake in regard to the matter. I come now to the question of industrial unrest. Upon the 10th April, 1918, the present Minister for the N a v y ' ( Sir Joseph Cook), whilst acting for the Prime Minister, read a statement of Ministerial policy which had been read in another place by Senator Millen the previous day. I recollect the occasion so well because the censor prohibited the According to the Minister publication of the statement in the press until after it had been Tead in this Chamber. In that statement, as will be seen by reference to Hansard of 1918, page 3726, Sir Joseph Cook statedTo establish"" and maintain better interests between capital and labour, it is proposed that the Attorney-General shall also he MinI n reply to inister for Labour; and an Advisory Council, representing employers and employees, will be appointed to keep touch between the Department and the industrial interests affected. Two years later, we were assured, in the Governor General's Speech, which is set out upon page 7 of Hansard of the 26th February lastHy Ministers will introduce a Bill to amend the law relating to the prevention and for the settlement, of those industrial disputes which",29,Nationalist Aims

In speaking upon that question, I pointed out that there are nine cases which for months have been awaiting a hearing before that tribunal, cases involving industries the cessation of which would paralyze the Commonwealth. The Judges have stated that certain amendments are necessary in the Arbitration Act to facilitate its better working. It is well known that when a plaint is filed before the Court, even though the cost of living has increased in the case of an average family, to the extent of £ 1 2s. 6d. per week upon only four articles, it is difficult to get it heard with reasonable expedition. what would be' the increase in the cost of living to-day? Who knows what it w i ll be three years hence? drought, we cannot tell what it wilT be. before in Australia, but there has never previously been such increases in prices as those with which we are confronted to-day. I gather from the June number of the Victorian Agricultural Journal that the number of sheep in Australia to-day is 84,000,000 odd. From another Government publicationI think it was the New South Wales Agricultural JournalI learn that before the war, in 1912, when there were 92,000,000 sheep in Australia, the wool clipwas worth £22,000,000. Since then, in 1916 or 1917, the number of sheep has diminished by about 18,000,000, and yet tbe wool clip is worth double what it was previously. right in saying that the value of the clip in 1912, when we had more sheep than we have to-day, was only about half that of the present clip. On Friday last the Prime Minister told us that he had had to advise the organization with which he was connected to strike because they could not get to the A r b i know that the seamen and the marine engineers have recently taken the same course. When they find that employers Only last Friday we were refuse to meet them in conference the organizations cannot be blamed for taking the matter into their own hands. In May last, when I was dealing with this subject of the projected conference of emWe had submitted to us a list ployers and employees, I pointed out that tice Powers had made the following statement:There are three complaints, at least, against the Court for which the Court is not responsible. The first is that the Judges appointed to do the work cannot keep pace with the many claims brought before them, and serious delays are sometimes caused in settling industrial disputes. Parliament can, if it thinks fit, rectify that. The second is that the Court cannot, because of section 28 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, settle industrial disputes arising during the term of an award, however serious the dispute may be, or however much the cost of living has increased since the award was made. Parliament can, if it thinks fit, rectify that also. The third is that proceedings in the Court are expensive. The unions can rectify that by avoiding fhe Who knew three years ago expense of plaints, as is frequently done, limiting their claims to what they really intend to insist upon (if section 28 is amended), and by not calling witnesses to prove what the employers admit. COOK -If we have a As Mr Justice Powers points out in regard to two of the complaints, Parliament itself can rectify them, and, im my opinion, should do so at the earliest possible moment. I believe that the Justices of the H i g h Court are unanimously of opinion that this Parliament has power to clothe the Arbitration Court with authority to settle an industrial dispute arising during the term of an award. Speaking on this subject in May last, I quoted the case of the gas employees, who could not have their plaint amended because they had asked for 13s. a day. They are now submitting a plaint for £ 1 a day, thus making sure that they will have ample margin to come and go upon during the three years currency of their award. However,'Parliament has the opportunity to rectify this I believe that I am matter. On the 13th A p r i l , a few days after Mr Justice Powers ""had made these remarks, Senator Fairbairn, the President of the Employers' Federation of Australia, wrote to the Argus as follows: Mr Justice Powers' statement "" in reply to criticisms "" is most interesting and instructive. He suggests three ways in which the",30,Nationalist Aims

171,On The 10th A P R I L Of This Year Mr Jus,"Arbitration Court could be improved, as follows :1. Greater expedition in dealing with cases brought before the Court. 2. That power be given to the Court to deal with an industrial dispute arising during the currency of an award. 3. The reduction of the expense of the Court proceedings. Mr Justice Powers suggests remedies to No. 3, but feels, I suppose, that it is outside his province as a Judge to indicate legislative alterations. I therefore make the following suggestions, which I think have the support of all employers, and I hope most of the employees :1. Greater expedition in dealing with cases could be obtained (a) by appointing ab least three Judges; (6) by giving the Court the power to delegate to a Board appointed by it the authority to decide a dispute when requested to do so by one' of the parties to the dispute; (c) by a clear definition of what are Federal and what are State disputes. Much of the Courts' time at present is taken up in deciding whether the dispute is Federal or State, and no sooner is a case settled in the Federal Court than it is brought before the State Court, or vice versa, and the state of unrest so hurtful to industry is prolonged. 2. The chief, cause of industrial disputes at meeting their workmen in conference, present is the ever-changing cost of living, and power should be granted to the Court to make awards contingent upon the rise or fall of the cost of living. The Prime Minister has promised early amendments of the Arbitration Court Act, and it must be apparent to all that they are urgently required. Mr Hughes has had for some time before him the carefully considered views of the employers on what changes are required, and he has also consulted the employees on this matter. Before the Government brings forward its amendments I think it might help matters if he would call a conference of represome quarters that if a ballot of emsentatives of employers and employees to see if harmony cannot be achieved, as there are many other amendments besides those dealt with by Mr Justice Powers that would benefit the Act -Yours, &c, President Central Council of Employers. 12th April. On the next day the following paragraph appeared in the Argus : Consideration was given by tbe Federal Cabinet yesterday to arbitration matters. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) said that the Cabinet had discussed the position that arose through the Deputy President of the Arbitration Court( Mr justice Powers) going on leave. It was also hoped to introduce at an early date legislation to amend the Arbitration Act. When the proposal by the president of the Employers Federation (Senator Fairbairn) for a round-table conference on industrial matters was mentioned, Mr Hughes said :-"" Two years ago we proposed to bring in a measure which were made to our soldiers when for a Grand Council of Labour, on which both they went away from Australia have been sides would be represented. That idea we hope to embody in our coming legislation. kept. A few days ago I received from a Mr Tudor. But such a proposal will be useless without the hearty co-operation of both sides. We propose to call a conference. We will not put a cutand-dried proposition in regard to the constitution of a Council of Labour, or to industrial legislation before them, but will seek to have a free discussion of matters and find out the ideas of both sides. Then we will try to formulate proposals, to secure industrial peace and harmony."" The sooner we know what the Government proposals are in this direction the better it w ill be tor all concerned, but they made the promise more than two years ago, and, so far, have done absolutely nothing. It was also promised that the Prime Minister would act as Minister for Labour, but nothing has been done in that matter either. The employers have also failed in their duty. Representatives of the tannery employees of Australia have informed me that they had the greatest difficulty in getting the employers to meet them, and I am told that in ' t h e hat trade the employers are offering excuse after excuse to avoid although the award has expired. A strike in the hat-making industry would not affect the community as would a strike amongst transport workers or engineers: but the fact that there are two sides to a question ought to be made known. The workers in all industries have very little chance of putting their case before the people through the press. The opinion seems to be held in ployees is taken a proposal to strike w ill be turned down; but the Prime Minister knows as well as I do that, taken as a whole, the rank and hie in an organization are far more militant than are the officials. The newspapers claim time after time that strikes are fomented by the latter, whereas, as a matter of fact, they are chiefly concerned in trying to do their best for their members, and will exert all their influence to avoid trouble. What has been the result of some of the ballots recently taken? In the case of the seamen the decision was to strike, and in the later cases of the marine, engineers and the engine-drivers and firemen of Victoria the result was the same. I do not consider that the promises gentleman whom I knew some years back, appeal again in writing, I wrote the fola letter in which he saysI wish to place in your hands a letter which I received from the Repatriation Department, conveying the decision of the Repatriation Committee, the first paragraph of which should be of very considerable benefit to you in reference to your censure motion. The paragraph to which my attention was thus directed reads as follows:The Department at no time has undertaken, or has contemplated undertaking, an obligation to reinstate a man in his pre-war position. I am under the impression that the promise was made to those who went to the war that they would not suffer for doing so, and that when they returned they would be given positions at least as good as those they leftThe Department, however, will, as far as it reasonably can do so, endeavour to assist a man to obtain a position equal to his pre-war occupation. I have had letters from men who were in business before they went to the war, sistance from the Department. last month I wrote to a correspondent sayingI received your letter, and will at once make strong representations to the Repatriation Department on your behalf. diately I hear anything I will advise you. In writing to the Deputy Comptroller of the Eepatriation Department at Melbourne, I said, referring to this casePrior to enlisting in 1914, this man owned and conducted a printing business at Brunswick and Abbotsford for nearly seven years. He then enlisted and handed over his business to the care of a master printer, who, after two years, closed down, and sold part of the son may not have sold his business, he certainly disposed of it, as it is not in his possession to-day. I am told that his application has been reinformed to her surprise that she would fused; but he is appealing against the Board's decision. In reply, the Deputy Comptroller informed me thatMr Kidson's application was declined in view of the fact that he did not dispose of his business to enlist, and he is, therefore, ineligible for assistance to commence again. He has been informed that, on receipt of an appeal in writing, his case will he resubmitted to the deciding authority. In regard to the suggestion that I should inform my correspondent that he must lowing letter to the Minister:On 2Gth instant I wrote to the Deputy Comptroller here regarding a man named Win. A. Kidson, of 173 Vere-street, Abbotsford, and have received the enclosed reply, which, you will see, is signed by an officer of the Department. In my letter of the 26th instant I gave the whole of the facts, and asked that the matter be reconsidered. I frequently get similar replies to the one enclosed, insisting on the applicant making an appeal, hut, in my opinion, it should not be necessary for the man to make an appeal when I do so off his behalf. Naturally, this causes the applicant further trouble and delay, which seems to niu entirely unnecessary. WheneverI write to the Pensions Office and ask that a case be reconsidered with a view to increasing or granting a pension, it is done without asking the applicant to also write in. I shall be glad if you will look into this matter, with a view to expediting business and eliminating a good deal of red-tape. AlthoughI wrote that letter on the 30th of last month I have not yet received an acknowledgment of it. I wish now to give honourable members who, on their return, could not obtain asan illustration of the way in which war Only pension applications have been treated. A f riend of mine received towards the end of 1918 a letter in which the writer complained of "" the very unjust way the Defence Department treated mothers who Immehad raised large families and who applied for pensions in regard to sons who had been killed at the war."" According to the statements contained in that letter, the man and his wife had four sons who enlisted, of whom two were killed in action, one died at sea on a transport, and one was still in the fighting line. After the first son was killed the usual papers for a pension were sent to them and the wife was called to Melbourne, and gave her replies to the questions asked of her. After some time she was he paid a pension of 5s. per week, which she regarded as an insult, because she knew that other mothers were getting pensions of 10s., 15s., and, in some cases, £1 per week, because of the death of their sons. She regarded the offer of the Department as "" making little of her brave boy who died fighting for his country."" The second son was killed in action on the 9th August, 1918, when the usual pension papers were again sent, and the wife again went to Melbourne and replied to",31,Nationalist Aims
172,,"plant to pay certain debts. Whilst Mr Kidthe questions asked of her. She then received what she considered a bigger insult from the Department, because the pension was nil. It was the intention of the writer to tell his wife, when the penallowed to cash the bonds, and that sion papers came in respect of the lad who died at sea on a transport, to reply that as she had been so badly treated in the past, she could live without their Lisaid to them that they were not promised suits. The ground for the rejection of these pensions in respect of the second lad instated in their pre-war positions; that killed was that the parents were not dependent on his earnings for the twelve months immediately prior to his enlistment. The writer points out that, although they were not dependent on their son for their living, he being then nineteen years of age, and learning a trade, a family of ten had been raised on a wage of 6s. 6d a day, and the lads who had been killed would have been earning £3 per week at the date on which he wrote had they not gone to the war, and would, of course, have helped their parents in their old age, a matter which the Pensions Department ought to have taken into consideration. before the Department, and eventually got a pension of 7s. for each of the two sous, though that was not enough. The complaint has been made that widows who were getting £2 per week war pension have had their allowance reduced to £1 Is. These reductions have been made recently, and are not fair. Many complaints are being made about the restrictions on the war gratuity. The insurance offices have now been prohibited from cashing war gratuity bonds, but men have told me that if they go to cermake as would prove tlie Government tain furniture selling firms, they can get their war gratuity bonds* cashed, so long as they spend 33 per cent, of the proceeds upon furniture. are asked to spend 60 per cent, of the money on furniture. ing through the House, I said that I did not think it would be possible to provide for bonds that could not be cashed. Men have come to me offering me half the value of the bonds if I would cash them, but I have declined to do so, because the law says that they cannot lie cashed, and I have not the money to buy these bonds, even if I desired to do so. The Government have failed to treat the men properly in regard to the war gratuity. It is for the Government to see that those who wish to use the gratuity for insurance purposes are fairly treated. It is said that some insurance offices are others are prohibited from doing so. My desire is that our returned men shall get a fair deal. It should not be that, on their return, they would be repromise was made to them. The Governmen have failed to deal fairly with the soldiers. They have failed to treat our returned men and their dependants as the community would wish. The public do not ask for the saving of a few shillings by the reduction of the pensions of war widows. The Government have also failed to prevent profiteering. Then two years ago they promised to establish a Council of Labour to deal with industrial unrest, a promise which they have not fulfilled. I hold, therefore, that I have justification for moving the motion. Honourable members on this side, and members of the I put the matter Corner party will, no doubt, deal with those questions arising under it which I have not had time to mention. Those who vote against the motion will have to show cause for supporting a Government which has failed in its duty in the manner I have indicated. ister and Attorney-General) [4.50] -In giving notice of his motion last Thursday, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) led the country to believe that he had disclosures of such a character to unworthy of the confidence of the House. For that reason, and because by no other means can I reply to what he has said,I think it proper to treat the motion as one of censure. The honourable member, in speaking to his motion, occupied an hour and thirty-five minutes. He 6poke, yet said nothing. I ask honourable members generally whether, if they were a jury, and the Government collectively were on its trial, and the counsel for the prosecution had presented the case as the honourable member has done, they would hesitate a moment before giving a verdict of acquittal? The honourable member has been in Ministerial office with me for many years; he has been my friend for many more.

175,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Minalthough I listened attentively to his speech, and, so far as one in my position could, with an absolutely open mind, I heard no reason why the Government should be censured, or the time of the Legislature wasted in repeating at such length what he has already said on' so many occasions, and what we shall probably hear on many more if we are spared to live long enough. This motion of censure is divided into five parts, and differs in this respect only from its predecessor, which, like all Gaul, w.as divided into three parts. Although the honourable gentleman consumed the full time allotted to him with his speech, he occupied nearly the whole period with irrelevant observations. I propose, as briefly and clearly as I can, to show why the House should not agree to the motion, First of all the honourable member says that the Government is deserving of censure for its failure to prevent the inordinate rise in the cost of living. ""What are the facts? The honourable member knows what they are perfectly well. He was in .office with me for about two years and four months during the war, and the Government then had great powers under the War Precautions Act. When the honourable member moved his previous censure motion, I pointed out that, although he was the Minister charged with the administration of this Act, he took no action whatever so far as I knew to deal in any way with the high cost of living. He may have done so, but if he did I was not aware of it. The reason he gave was the only reason he could give. It was the reason he gave previously when he was my colleague, and really he gave it through my mouth. I explained that we had not done anything in that direction, because we were of the opinion that we could not effectively deal with the high cost of living until we had power to deal with combines, trusts, and corporations. The party to which the honourable member and myself belonged had pressed this view very strongly before the electors for many years, and regarded the amendment of the Constitution to give the Commonwealth power over these vitally important matters as of such urgency as to justify them in putting it on their fighting platform. In 1915 I was present at the Adelaide Labour Conference, where the question of the high cost of living was brought up. It was regarded as a matter of vital importance, and the Government of the day, at the head of which was my friend Mr Fisher, and of which I was a member, was urged to press on with the referendum in order to clothe the Commonwealth Parliament with such powers as would enable it to take action. It was never for one moment suggested then that there was any other way of doing it. Until the honourable member for West Sydney (Mv. Ryan) made a statement to the contrary, no one had ever suggested that this Parliament had any power to deal with combines, trusts and companies, or to fix prices except under the War Precautions Act, unless and until such amendments of the Constitution were made as would clothe the Commonwealth Legislature with the necessary power. The late Mr Cohen, who was one of the representatives of Victoria, said at the 1915 conference, "" Surely they were not going to allow a handf u l of Tories in the Federal Parliament to stand in the way of the people's interests; everything should be done to put through the work quickly; the Government would be justified in taking such action as would insure the passage of these measures in a reasonable time, seeing that the carrying of the referendum meant so much to the people, who were being fleeced right and left by the combines and trusts in everything concerned."" He moved an amendment, a long debate took place, and the conference affirmed the necessity for pressing on with the amendments to give the Commonwealth power to deal with these matters at the very earliest possible moment. The Leader of the Opposition was then a member of the Government, of which I wasAttorney-General, and he was still a member of the Government when in the tail end of 1915 a proposal was made by the States to grant us certain powers temporarily upon condition that we postponed the referendum. The honourable member was strongly in favor of that course, and voted for it, and, at a meeting of the party upstairs, there were I think"" only six or seven dissentients out of a total of 72 members. These two facts stand out: one, that it had been clearly recognised by the Labour party for years that there was no way by which the Commonwealth could deal with trusts. combines, and prices except by tbe amendment of the Constitution, and, two, that in 1915 the high cost of living was a matter of such grave and pressing concern as to make it imperative in the interests of the community that the Constimatters, combines, trusts, corporations, tution should be amended forthwith. Yet, as I have said, the honourable member ment of the referendum, and when the States did nothing he followed their example, nor was it until he left the Government and a new Government was constituted, that anything was done to reduce the cost of living to the people of Australia under the War Precautions Act. I shall come later, as I deal with these matters, to the reasons which led the honourable member and his colleagues to act as they did in regard to the last referendum, but I would point out that tbe High Court has laid it down again and again that the Commonwealth has no power to deal with trusts, combines, or companies. And as nine-tenths of all commercial transactions are carried on by these means it is abundantly clear that unless we have plenary power over them we can take no effective action to deal with high prices. The honourable member has spoken this afternoon of rings. and of a man being at once frozen out and burnt up as the result of the operations of one of' those rings. knows that the only way in which we can deal with any ring or combine is by amendment of the Constitution. cannot deny that he agreed to the postponement of the referendum when he was a member of the Government, in which I had the honour to hold a portfolio, nor can he deny that at the last election, when a referendum was taken, an overwhelming majority of the members of the Labour party were led by the misrepresentations of their leaders to vote against that which for the last nine years the Labour party had declared to be the very corner-stone of their temple. I have here the referenda figures for 1913 -and 1919. They show that in 1919 the majority at the referendum against the Legislative Powers Bill was under 20,000, proving conclusively that had the Labour party voted as they were bound to do by the planks of the platform to which they solemnly pledged themselves, Mr Hughes. this Parliament would to-day not have the excuse that it has no power to deal with these things. That a great National Legislature like this should not have the power to deal with industrial « companies is, I say now as I said in 1911, when I was the mouthpiece of the agreed to . the postponeLabour party, a disgrace to the intelligence of the people of this country, and a menace to their security and welfare. I ask, and I shall continue to ask while I am on my feet, why the Labour party at the recent election did this thing? Why did they deliberately reject that which they had declared for the last ten years to be the one thing essential to the well-being of the people? The honourable member said we had done nothing to deal with the high cost of living during the war, when we had the power. I deny altogether that under 'the War Precautions Act as it stands to-day we have the power now. It may be that I am wrong; no one can tell that until a case is decided in the High Court. But I venture to say that"" ho one reading the judgments of the High Court on those cases in which it was held that we had the power during He spoke of a flour ring, the war would say that we had the power to-day to fix prices in regard to those commodities which, unlike sugar, aro outHe side our own control. During the war we regulated the price of eighty-eight commodities, and the effect of our action, He as has been admitted even from the Opposition side of the House, was to reduce the cost of living most materially to the people of this country, saving them' very many millions. But now we can do nothing. I do not hesitate to say that had Labour voted in 1919 as it did in 1913 this Parliament would this day have authority to deal with these vitally important matters. To-day I say most emphatically, despite what the honourable member for West Sydney may claim, that it has no power to deal effectively with them. Why have honourable members opposite abandoned those principles which they declared again and again to be vital? At every election since 1910 they have been in the forefront of their platform, yet when opportunity offers they denounce that which they have for years declared to be necessary for the salvation of Australia. Why? sons why they did this thing. The honourable member speaks of the cost of living in this country in regard to wheat, meat, butter, and sugar. He could not have selected four articles more unfortunate from his point of view, for it so happens that the people of Australia have cheaper flour, cheaper meat, cheaper sugar, and cheaper butter than any other people in the world. I shall leave it to members of the Country party to set out the facts in greater detail; but this I will say, that every man has a right to be rewarded for his labour. Whether he is a pick-and-shovel man, a legislator, or a farmer, the same principle must apply. I do not claim for one moment to have an intimate experience of the lot of the man on the land; but, since it is vital, in the interests of this country, that we should attract people from the great cities to the country, and since there is no better way of doing that than by making life on the land profitable, we should be doing this country a mortal injury if we drove people from the country into the great cities by making life on the land unprofitable. The Leader of the Opposition professed astonishment that we should now be paying 6d. per lb. for sugar, which, before the war, cost only 2fd. per lb. For that increase he apparently would make this Government responsible. The fact is that but for this Government the price of sugar to-day would be far more. I have no time to discuss in detail the sugar question; I fully set it out some weeks back, when dealing specifically with it. is a still more important article of food, there is in Australia to-day, despite the drought, a supply of wheat ample to meet the requirements of the people until next harvest. If there is a shortage in New South Wales, it arises from two reasons-(1 ) the appalling drought, and (2) the mismanagement, perhaps, of the local Wheat Pool, whereby good wheat was sold, and sent out of the country, regardless of the welfare of the people of that State. For that, neither the Commonwealth nor the people of the other States are responsible. And. even as it is, the people of New South Wales today are buying wheat at less than one-half of the world's price. These are facts I shall indicate later some reawhich cannot be denied. When we are told that the farmer is selling his produce locally for more than he can get for it overseas, I can only say that these are the facts, and that they speak for themselves. The local price of wheat today is fixed by agreement between the farmers and the Government at 7s. 8d. per bushel, while the price of wheat in the markets of the world to-day is quite double that amount. So much for that point. In regard to sugar, as I have said, the people are obtaining it at a price below that ruling in any other part of the world. There is no country, save New Zealand, which secures its sugar so cheaply. In England the people are paying Is. and Is. 2d. per lb. for it, and in America the price is quite as high. I come now to butter. The dairy farmer works, not six or seven hours a day, but a great many morel I am not an advocate of long hours; but if a man works long hours, he is entitled to be paid for them. Let the Leader of the Opposition take a turn as a dairy farmer, and we shall see whether he will be prepared to sell his butter for less than it costs to produce. honourable gentleman's experiences as a dairy farmer has kept me out of the industry. rather unfortunate. The honourable member has sought to make the Government responsible for high prices. I have shown quite clearly where the blame lies. But the causes of high prices generally are so utterly remote from those put forward Coming to bread, which by the Leader of the Opposition that one is surprised that he would not, at least, have admitted to the House that they are for the most part beyond the powers of the Legislature to touch. They arise out of great economic factors that are affecting the whole world. They arise out of the war, out of the scarcity created by the war, out of the excess of paper money and the scarcity of products. The scarcity of' goods and the excess of paper money, and tlie consequent depreciation of money and appreciation of the prices of goods are the two main factors. For the evil of high prices there are but two. effective remedies-on e to reduce the quantity of paper money, the other to increase",34,George Fairbairn
176,Mr Tudob,The relation of the right,37,George Fairbairn
177,Mr Hughes,"My experience wasproduction. Let the honourable member say whether he has given wise counsel to the unions and the people of Australia in regard to these matters. He speaks very loosely about the consequences of issuing on the markets of this country another £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 of paper money. The effect of such an issue would fall, as all these things do, quickly and certainly upon the very class that he seeks to benefit. The present high prices would become still higher. So much then for the first of his five points. I turn now to his second charge. The Government is deserving of censure, he says, because of its failure to keep its pledges to the returned soldiers and their dependants. Sir, the honourable member's, charge is utterly without foundation. Let the facts speak for themselves. The. honourable member made some reference to war gratuities, pensions, and repatriation. I do not contend for one moment that in the demobilization and repatriation of over 360,000 men there are not some cases of hardship and injustice. But the repatriation of our soldiers will compare most favourably with that of any country. The pledges given by me on behalf of the Government have been carried out not only in the letter hut in the spirit. Let me quote a few £46,088,737. figures in proof of my statement. Up to the 10th instant 83,758 war gratuity bonds, representing a total of £7,254,874 had been issued, of which the bonds issued but uncashed £6,075,298, and the gratuities paid in cash by the Treasury amounted to £1,179,576. What was the position put before the electors at the last general election? They were promised by the Leader of the Opposition, and those who stand with him, that if they were returned to office the soldiers would be paid the war gratuity in cash? they would be paid in bonds. We said that we would cash up to £6,000,000 worth of bonds, and we made other proraises, all of which have been carried out. The people deliberately rejected the proposal of the honourable member, and accepted ours. We should not be where we are to-day had not an overwhelming majority of the soldiers, their dependants, friends, and relations supported the party which I have the honour to lead. We promised that a gratuity should be paid Mr Hughes. on a certain scale; that it should be paid in bonds except in certain cases which were clearly specified; and we promised that the legislation necessary to give effect to these pledges should take precedence of all others in the new Parliament. All these pledges have been most faithfully kept. And now as to repatriation. Ever since my return to Australia. I have had coming to my office every day hundreds of letters dealing with this matter, and I have sought as well as possible to help the returned soldiers. The honourable member has read to the House two or three letters on this subject. I invite him to let me have them. If any man has been treated unjustly he shall have justice. But the great basic facts in relation to repatriation are that' for the year 1919-20, which has just closed, £6,103,061 was spent on repatriation, of which amount £3,869,827 was an absolute gift to the men. On land settlement we expended £11,235,716. The amount to which the Commonwealth was committed but has not yet been applied for by the States for land settlement, is £17,764,284. For war pensions, we spent during year 1919-20, £6,032,000; on war service homes, £4,953,676, making a gross total for the year ended 30th June last of These figures are unanswerable. They supply a complete and crushing refutaton of the charge made by the Leader of the Opposition that we have not dealt fairly with our soldiers. amounted to The like of this record cannot be shown by any other country. The provision made for 1920-21 Estimates is as follows:-Repatriatio n proper, £5,800,000; land settlement, dependent upon the forthcoming Conference with State Ministers of Land to be held on Mondav next, £17,000,000; war pensions, £7,500,000; war service homes, £7,175,000; or a gross We promised that total of £37,475,000. In the face of these figures the honourable member's charge vanishes into thin air. On the 28th June last the total amount expended in respect of war service homes was £6,678,151. Seven hundred and sixty-seven houses had been completed, 2,461 were in course of erection, and contracts had been let for an additional 341. Five thousand three hundred and thirtyfour houses had been purchased, and 1,296 mortgages had been lifted on behalf of returned soldiers or eligible dependants. Our men were demobilized in record time. of 361,000 only 662 men were on the J Australian Imperial Force strength. The number of returned soldiers unemployed has been steadily diminishing. While there were on 31st October last 13,000 soldiers unemployed, to-day on the unemployment return there are only 6,049 men. The Leader of the Opposition say3 we have not kept our pledges. These figures and facts speak for themselves. We said that we would increase the amount devoted to waT pensions by £500,000 or £600,000. We have actually increased it by £1.500,000. The gratuity that was promised is being paid very rapidly. honourable member says that the men cannot in all cases obtain cash for their gratuity bonds. They knew that very well. That was set out plainly, and reasons were given for the inability of the Commonwealth to cash the bonds, or permit them to pass current from hand to hand. I say, now, that to put £30,000,000 worth of bonds on the market to-day would create a crisis the like of which has never been seen in this country. referred to what certain firms dealing in furniture are doing' in the way of cashing war gratuity bonds. In answer to that, all I have to say is that if he will supply me with the names of the firms who are doing this, I shall make the necessary inquiries. which it was stated that a returned soldier was compelled to give a war gratuity bond for £120 to purchase £60 worth of furniture. That, I think, occurred in the electorate of the honourable member for Yarra. at that. whether it was in the honourable gentleman's electorate or in that of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). I believe it occurred in Collingwood. ing our electorate is in the electorate of Batman, and the other side in the Yarra electorate. complained of in this connection is against the law. A reference has been made to the cashing of bonds by insurance companies, and in that matter the Treasurer is safeguarding the interests of the men: In the action he is taking he is protecting On 30th June last, of the total the interests and' welfare of the soldier. He is right in taking' up that attitude, because he is the guardian of the soldiers' interests. I promised the soldiers, on behalf of the Government, that they should have one representative on the Eepatriation Board and the War Gratuity Board. On the Eepatriation Board, the returned soldiers have not one representative, but three; and of the eighteen members of the Central and State Boards, ten are returned soldiers. The War Gratuity Board consists of three members, and all are returned soldiers or sailors. In The stead, then, of giving the returned soldier merely representation on these Boards, we have given him control of the whole of the machinery of the war gratuity; while on repatriation, of three members of the Central Board and eighteen on the State Boards, ten are returned soldiers. The Government, then, has not only fulfilled its pledges to the soldiers, but has gone much farther than it promised to do. As The honourable gentleman has for what the returned soldiers themselves think of what has been done, the following is a quotation from the issue for the 2nd July, 1920, of The Soldier, one of the organs of the returned men in New South Wales: Of all the promises made to returned men One letter was sent to me in by politicians, those made by Hughes stand out alone as having been honorably fulfilled. So much, then, for the second charge. I say that it has failed completely. I come now to the third charge: tliat we have failed to take steps to deal with the causes of industrial unrest. I think I have already shown, in dealing with the first charge, that the Legislature has no power to deal with industrial unrest except by way of arbitration, «and then only in regard to certain disputes, and in a certain way. Many honourable members opposite have stood upon platforms up and down this country, bewailing the unhappy condition of the people because the National Legislature was denied the opportunity to deal with these great industrial matters, and demanding the amendment of the Constitution. But what did these honourable members do when the opportunity was given them to secure for the Legislature the power",37,George Fairbairn

So much, therefore, for the honourable gentleman's charge that the Government have done nothing in regard to industrial unrest. I venture to point out that if 1 e and his followers took their courage in. both hands and would preach to the workers outside the only gospel that can bring about industrial peace, to produce more, and to seek peaceful and harmonious means of effecting an adjustment of their mutual interests with their employers, they would do something to bring about a state of affairs which would be lastingly beneficial, not only to those whom they claim to represent, but to the whole community. there is a strike? What honourable member opposite has ever had the courage, when there has been a strike on, to go out and tell the men that they were wrong ? dreds of times. I was the bell-wether who was always sent out for years. the coal strike I never got one man to stand up with me, although men. who represented the coal districts knew that I was' in the right. I was lef t to go out and fight the battle for the cause of the Labour party, whilst the red-raggers, who along with another section have destroyed the Labour movement, strove with all their might to bring about a general strike and paralyze the community. I ask why honourable members opposite do not go to their industrial unions and political leagues and preach the only gospei that is of any good to Labour? In his next charge the honourable gentleman asserts that the Government have failed to secure an adequate return to the Australian people for their wool and other primary products sold overseas. In some respects this charge is the most extraordinary/and the least supported by facts. I listened to the honourable gentleman while he strove to make out his case. iSof a r as I could follow him, what he said was in effect that the farmer is deserving of censure because he is selling his goods at a higher price in Australia than he obtains for them overseas. would be to compel him to sell his produce at a price below the cost of production. Yet he poses as a friend of the farmer, and says that we have not protected the latter's interest. Let me point out what we have done. Paragraphs d and e of the honourable member's motion road(d) For its failure to secure an adequate return to the Australian people for their wool and other primary products sold overseas. (e) For its failure to make definite binding contracts for the sale of such products which would have prevented any possibility of profiteering overseas in Australian products at the expense of Australian producers, and would have made it possible to secure a prompt adjustment of accounts in connection with such sales. I take those two things together. FirstB u t what do they do when of all, it is utterly untrue that the present Government or the preceding Governments of which I had the honour to be a member did not do everything in their power to secure for the producer the highest possible return for his product. The Wheat Pool has handled 468,807,000 bushels of wheat, and the prices received I have done so hunranged from 4s. 9d. to 6s. 3d. per bushel f.o.b. The average price of wheat for In years previous to the war was 3s. 9d. a bushel. The total amounts received from local and overseas sales by the Pool up to the 5th July was £120,969,000. It was shown in evidence before the Royal Commission which sat in this State that the farmer had received £10,000,000 above London parity by the operation of the Pool during the period of the war. So much for that. In regard to wool, sales have been made at prices 55 per cent, above those ruling before the war, and the four clips have realized to date £170,000,000, whilst under arrangements made by the Government it is estimated that the growers w ill receive approximately £40,000,000 as their share of the profits on re-sales. The Wool Committee has handled 7,000,000 bales of wool. Those figures speak for themselves. They show that, including the half-share of profits^, the growers w ill receive nearly double the pre-war value of their wool. It has been said -that those arrangements were not definite and precise. Nothing is farther from the truth. The arrangements were most definite; the contracts made in regard to wheat were all in the form of ordinary This way of helping the farmer contracts, and set out most minutely the duty of each party. The interest of the",40,George Fairbairn
185,Mr Mathews,They are never wrong.,41,George Fairbairn
186,Mr Hughes,"Australian producer has been most carefully safeguarded., I, myself, have sold for the producer 5,200,000 tons of wheat. In those contracts, as with the contracts made direct through the Board, the interest of the farmer was protected in every particular. It is entirely wrong to suppose that the contracts were made in a loose manner. I have not time to set out the details, but I have telegrams here which show with what meticulous care the details of the contracts' were covered by the telegrams which passed between the British Government and the Government of the Commonwealth. I need only remind honourable members that during the war there was but one buyer of wheat, and unless that buyer could have been induced to buy it was impossible for us to sell our wheat anywhere else. That created a situation without precedent, and one which could not be endured without relief; relief was to be obtained in only one direction, and we obtained it. with wheat, so with wool. made available to the producer before the wheat and wool were shifted from our shores. procedure followed in all overseas sales of our products I may quote one or two instances. wheat deals in 1915 there was, firstly, an inquiry from the British Government by telegram. finite offer from this end, and subsequently an acceptance in precise terms by the British was with each deal. was an offer and acceptance, and a confirmation In regard to wool, the same procedure was followed. 1916, contained a definite offer from the British Government whole of Australia's clip of cross-bred and merino wool. I think it proper to state here that it is clearly shown in this cable that this is the result of representations London during that year. out quite clearly what the British authorities ' were prepared to do. That offer was laid before the representatives of the wool-growers; they agreed to sell on the basis of Is. 3d. per pound for greasv wool. I cabled on their behalf an offer to sell at Is. 3$d. per lb., and this was accepted by the British Government. Mr Hughes. I obtained for them ;that extra halfpenny per pound, which, apart from anything else, has yielded to the wool growers £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 above what they would otherwise have received. A cablegram sent on the 4th December set out the duties of the parties, the machinery by which the transaction was to be carried out, and, in short, followed the method invariably adopted by business men in connection with such contracts. In a cablegram received on the 13th December, the British Government accepted the offer. There was then a definite contract made. The price, conditions of sale and duties of each party were clearly set out. And this applied to every renewal of the contract. So much for the charges made by the honourable member in regard to the sale of primary products. The interests of the primary producers have been carefully As safeguarded: they have sold their proMoney was ducts under unique circumstances-whe n there was only one effective buyer, and no means of shifting their goods-a t prices As examples of the which speak for'themselves. The contracts for the sale of these products have been carefully drawn, and have protected In connection with the first the interests of the producers. The honourable member's charges fail utterly, as he expected them to do. He indeed inThat was followed by a dedicated so much in his final statement that those who voted against the motion would have to account to their Government. So it constituents for their vote. ' Of course In 1916 there that is quite true; they will have to account for every one of their votes The of such acceptance. honourable member's motion fails, as it was fully expected by him to do. ButA cable dated 14th November, there remains behind all this smoke some fire, or behind this fire some smoke.

That same party to-day has a strength in both Houses of twenty-seven, whilst I lead a party of seventy-two. not say too much about that. it that the Labour party, whose record for years and years was an uninterrupted series of victories, has fallen on such evil days ? Let me remind honourable members opposite of what they know only too well: In 1901, the Labour party numbered in the House of Representatives 16, and in the Senate 8, making a total of 24; in 1904, in the House of Representatives 24, and in the Senate 14, or a total of 38; in 1907, in the House of Representatives 26, and in the Senate 15, or a total of 41; in 1910, in the House of Representatives 41, and in the Senate 23, or a total of 64; in 1913, in the House of Representatives 39, and in the Senate 29, making a total of 68; in 1914, in the House of Representatives 42, and in the Senate 31, making a total of 73; in 1917-whe n the party appealed to Csesar-in the House of Representatives 22, and subsequently 23, and in the Senate 13, making a total of 36; and in 1919, in the House of Representatives 26, and in the Senate 1, making, a total of 27.

I call attention to a rule which is one of the most stringent that we have for the guidance of business. I may say that an ordinary interjection here and there is not usually taken notice of by the Chair, but a constant stream of interjections is decidedly disorderly. Standing Order No. 280 statesNo member shall interrupt another member whilst speaking, unless-(1 ) to request that his words be taken down; (2) to call attention to a point of order or privilege suddenly arising; or (3"") to call attention to the want of a quorum. This is not merely a rule for the guidance of this Parliament, but is under constant reference for the governing of the procedure of the House of Commons; and there is no order which is more strictly enforced and adhered to, for without it the proceedings of Parliament would become impossible. I point out to honourable members who are so constantly interjecting that their words almost assume the length of speeches in themselves; and that every honourable member has the right to speak actually at great length upon the motion before the Chair; and I again emphasize that any interjection, coming from no matter which side of the House, is disorderly.

205,Mr Hughes,"In 1910, the figures1,830,353, and for Independents, 166,676; majority for Labour, 190,737. say that, in none of the comparisons which I ""am now about to make between the two parties are the votes of Independents included. In 1913, the Labour vote was 2,802,529; Liberal, 2,840,420; Independent, 109,248; majority for Liberals, 37,891. In 1914-the year of the double dissolution-the Labour figures 5,500,223; Independent, 9,799; majority for Labour, 723,677. Labour votes totalled 2,776,648; Nationalist, 57,368; majority for the Nationalists, 739,706. In 1919-and here I shall quote first preferences only-the figures for official Labour were 795,858; NaT tionaliste, 868,016; farmers, 172,626; Independent, 21,323; majority for Nationalists over Labour, 72,158; combined vote against Labour, 1,040,642; combined majority of Nationalists and Farmers over Labour, 244,784. As I have said, independent votes are not taken into account. The figures speak for themselves. They demonstrate that at every election from 1901, every year, an increasing number of Labour supporters entered this Legislature until that black day in 1916, when i.he action of the majority of the party, taken at the bidding of those who had captured the machinery of the Labour movement, rent the united Labour party asunder. From that day to this, Labour -owing to the actions of those who have led it-has the wilderness discredited and powerless. It has betrayed all those great principles of which it was so proud, and which it had held up to the topmost heights in the years that have gone. It has turned its back on those things which it had declared as being beyond price. It stood here stalwartly advocating an amendment of the Constitution; yet at the bidding of some of its leaders urged the people to vote against it. pulsory training emanating from the Labour party, and declared by it to be -the one thing necessary for the salvation of the country has been trampled-under foot. But a few short years since the Labour party was never tired of boasting that it had placed compulsory training on the Statute Book. But the gentleman who is to be returned here from Mr Huglies. Ballarat in a few days openly proI may claimed himself opposed to it. We were inordinately proud of what we had done for the Australian Navy, and we declared that any man who would do anything to weaken it would be thrusting a dagger at the heart of our national safety. Yet the man who is about to return here says he is not in were 6,223,900; Liberal, favour of an effective Australian NavyT Why have they turned their backs on In 1917, official these great principles which they advocated so long and with such earnestness?' 3,516,354; Independent, Is there one thing they stand for to-day for which they formerly stood? Let me remind honourable members of some things they would fain forget. Let me recall an incident of 1915, which, perhaps, tells its own story better than anything else. In that early year of the war, at the Inter-State Labour Conference, in Adelaide, a certain resolution was passed; and I ask honourable gentlemen opposite whether, in any Conference at which they may gather to-day, such a resolution would be met by anything 1 .t scorn and derision. At the Adelaide Conference, on 3rd June, 1915, the following motion was proposed:That the following message be sent to His Majesty:"" The Commonwealth Political Labour Council, in conference assembled at Adelaide, loyally presents birthday greetings to His Majesty King George V., congratulates him on the attainment of his fiftieth anniversary, and confidently hopes that during the coming year his reign will be been wandering in crowned by victory for the British and Allied arms in the great war of freedom and the realization of an enduring peace."" This motion was carried to the accompaniment of cheers. When we turn from this striking evidence of the loyalty of the Labour party when led by men who had made and led the Labour movement from the beginning to the record of this same party since 1916; when we examine the chronicle of its doings during the years Comwhich followed the split, we perceive a complete explanation of its present position. We realize also the reason why it is where it is, and why it did what it has done. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) said something about the Nationalist party, and concerning our getting funds from Flinders-lane. son). the matter. I w ill say this: No one today is able to call me his servant, to bid me come at his w ill . outside organization, of any sort that can say to me, "" Do this, "" and I will do it . There was an organization-the Labour party as it once was-whic h could do so; but it asked me to do the one thing which was impossible, and I refused it . It asked me to do that which was dishonourable to myself and treacherous to my country, and I would not do it . But there docs not exist to-day any organization of any kind which can bid me do anything. Honourable members opposite cannot say that and still maintain their places here: I have just recalled one incident in the Adelaide Conference of 1915. set for t h the figures of Labour's sweeping majority in 1914, when we polled 6,223,000, as against 5,500,000 by our opponents, giving us a majority of 723,000 in the electorates, and an overwhelming majority in both Houses of the Federal Legislature-ther e being thirty one of our members in the Senate, and forty-two in the House of Representatives, making a grand total of seventy-three. Let me recall one or two things in order to make it clear as day to all who are not wilfully blind why the Labour party was triumphantly victorious in 1914, and why it has been overwhelmingly defeated ever since. I will read, for the benefit of honourable members, an extract from the Labour manifesto of 1914, the manifesto which fits the loyal resolution just quoted as a glove does the hand. It statesOur interests and our very existence are bound up with those of the Empire. In time of war half-measures are worse than none. If returned with a majority, we shall pursue with the utmost vigour and determination every course necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth and the Empire in any and every contingency. That was the spirit of the Labour party as it existed in 1914. typified the very soul of the' Australian people. It was in the genuine belief that we were animated by this spirit that the people decided to entrust us with the difficult task of governing the country during the supreme crisis of its history. But I was quoting the honorwhat is the position to-day? I turn from the manifesto of 1914-in consequence of which we re-entered this Parliament witb I know nothing of seventy-three supporters-to the sayings of those who to-day are admittedly in the inner council, in the holy .of holies, of the There is no Labour party. Here are some of their utterances:They did not intend to sing the National Anthem -Dr. Mannix (vide Argus, 18th June, 1919). What does the Union Jack stand for so far as the Irish people are concerned? It stands for 700 years of oppression and alien rule; it stands for the depopulation of Ireland; it stands for the ruin of Ireland's trade and prosperity; it stands for coercion and martial law; it stands for famine and exile; .it reminds Irishmen of the blood shed by those who loved their country above their lives. This is what the Empirefln<*stands for in the minds of the Irish people. We cannot be expected to think as English people think, and we do not pretend to do so -Dr. Mannix, May, 1919. We are here for a declared definite purposeto support Ireland's claim as expressed at the I have last general election in Ireland, and to support her chosen leader, Eammon De Valera. This is no time for halting words, or balanced phrases. We are with the Irish people, or we are against them. We help them openly, or we leave them to their fate -Dr. Mannix, at Irish Eace Convention. And here is something of what De Valera has said:That so long as Germany was England's enemy, and England Ireland's enemy, so long would Ireland be Germany's friend. That he would never advocate another rebellion without hopeful chances of success. Proper organization would result in 500,000 fighting volunteers being raised. There is no hope of success except through a German invasion of England, and the landing of troops in Ireland. They should be prepared to leave nothing undone towards that end. And now something to link these statements of D r . Mannix and De'Valera togetherI shook hands with him. I have nothing to apologize for. I have nothing to explain.

If we contrast its present position with that which it previously occupied, and remember how abruptly, towards the end of 1916, it turned from being the very embodiment of warlike spirit and loyalty, to that attitude of grovelling pacifism and disloyalty, which marked our enemies everywhere, we need not look in vain for the explanation. think I have given honourable members the key to it . have said to be true. friends of the Labour party, when amongst them, that they had come to the parting of the ways. have realized that I spoke the truth. H a d they stood fast then, they would to-day, as they did then, enjoy the confidence of the people of Australia. This they have lost. They have gone farther into the morass by throwing this and that principle aside, and still they go on, under the leadership of those whose object is, not the improvement of the condition of the workers nor the elevation and progress of Australia/they care nothiug for the Labour movement save as it will serve their purpose-the y for Australia-bu t the dismemberment of the British Empire. It is of no use mincing words on this matter. This is the avowed object of those who now control the Labour movement. honourable members opposite deny that the section to which I refer controls the Labour movement, then they are saying that which they know to be untrue. An y one who knows the Labour movement can prove it . But they know it very well. There was a time when things were very different; a time when these men would have been ""booted"" out of the Labour movement; but to-day they are its chosen leaders. A t this very moment the Leader of the Opposition himself is in peril. Let me prove it by a quotation: Mr Ryan is marked out as the Leader of the Labour Party. . . . Mr Tudor is quite uninspiring. . . . Mr Ryan is young, brilliant and originala great leader of political cavalry charges to sweep the country [Australia, 1st October, 1919.) It will be no small help to the Irish cause to have as its exponent the man who must, in the future, bo Australia's Prime Minister (Dr. Mannix at Bendigo). And but yesterday MrM a r t in Hannah went down. Why? What did he do? Nothing, This Labour party was swept into power by the people at a great crisis-chose n because it was believed to .be loyal to the Empire and the living embodiment of every great principle for which Australia stands. It carried out the wishes of the people u n t i l 1916, when it became the mere tool of that disloyal section amongst us to which I have referred. I Then what a change came over its actions and its attitude! It had been for the Every one knows what I war, for the Empire. But at the bidI warned my ding of those who had captured its councils, it turned against the war, ' against the Empire. Amongst the proSince .then they posals on the business-paper for the annual Conference of the Victorian Political Labour Council was the following: That the policy of the Labour party be to push on for peace as soon as possible, and that they take no further part in recruiting. That, however, was suppressed as soon as the result of the 1917 election was announced. A t the LabourI n t e r s t a t e Conference at Perth, on the 21st June, 1918, it was resolvedFurther participation in recruiting shall be subject to the following conditions:have, no concern even (a) That a clear and authoritative statement be made on behalf of the Allies asserting their readiness to enter into peace negotations on the basis of no annexation and no penal indemnities. If Then the Sydney Labour Council, on the 30th May, 1918, decidedWe refuse to take part in any recruiting campaign, and call on the workers of this and all other belligerent countries to urge their respective Governments to immediately secure an armistice on all Fronts and initiate negotiations for peace. The manifesto issued by the Victorian Labour party in A p r i l , 1918, contained the following:Peace with a British victory is impossible; the Allies cannot beat the Central Powers. The Labour party believes that the humiliation of a nation creates in its people a spirit of revenge. The Labour party stands for immediate cessation of lighting. No annexations or indemnities. All these things fit like the marbles into a solitaire board-the pattern is filled up, nothing is missing. These gentlemen still mouth some of their ancient shibboleths, but they are bound to the wheel. Their movement is in chains. They talk and talk about the high cost of living, but say nothing as to why they voted against the only effective way of dealing with it . Nothing as to -why they abandoned compulsory training. They talk about the soldier, and proclaim themselves his champions, but they say nothing of why they abandoned him during tlie dark days of the war, or why they passed those resolutions at Perth in favour of a dishonourable and craven peace. We know, however, why they did all these things; we know the reasons for their abandonment of the principles which they formerly held so dear. their machinery has been captured by -those who would hurl them out of Parliament and office in the twinkling of an eye if they had dared to acb in any other way. I have said that Labour has fallen under the domination of disloyaliststhose who seek to dismember the Empire -and wild extremists. Let me now say a few brief words of this latter class. Mr degrading pact has to be made with the J. S. Garden, secretary of the Sydney Labour Council, and of the One Big Union, reported in tbe Sydney Sun, of the 21st January, 1919, saidI say the Soviet system of Russia should he adopted here, the same as we have adopted it on our committee in Sydney. The Victorian Labour Conference, on the 20th April, 1919, expressed earnest hope for Bolshevist success in Russia, recognising "" that common ownership and workers' management of the means of production"" were sought. dine), according to the Labour Call, Melbourne, of the Sth August, 1918, ""hoped to see the policy of the Bolsheviks accepted all over the world ""; and ex-Senator Barnes, in the Argus of the 21st January, 1919,. is reported as saying, ""I am looking with hope to the Bolshevik revolution in Russia."" Disloyalty and Bolshevism, between them explain everything that has happened to the Labour movement. They explain why it was that in 1914 the party was returned with seventy-two men, and to-day has twenty-seven in both Houses; they explain why at every election from 1901 to 1914, the party which went on without a reverse, gathering strength with every step, in 1917 met with such an appalling defeat. For twenty years in States and Commonwealth the party grew, favoured by the people, who believed it to be a party which would place principle before everything. Then came the hour of fiery trial. Mr Hughes. In that hour the Labour party failed-it became the bondsman of crafty and disloyal men and wild fanatics. We have seen the ground around its feet littered with the debris of broken principles. Yet, this party has still the effrontery to speak of the violation of pledges by this Government. I challenge honourable members opposite to mention, during the years of the Labour party's triumph, any influence that has been exerted on behalf of the It is because workers of this country in which I have hot played a great part. I particularly challenge them to say what they have done in the last few years except to destroy the Labour party. What is the policy of the party now ? It is a policy of destruction. In the industrial sphere it is a policy of "" go slow ""-of strikes. In H;he national sphere it is a policy of dismemberment of the Empire. In war, a enemy. In Parliament, time is wasted. It is this party which has denied this Government power to deal with problems of the first importance to the people-industrial matters, Trusts and Combines, which for years they declared were a menace to the people. Honourable members on this side, to whom I was at one time opposed, know what the Labour party said in the days that are gone, and what they have done since 191C. And the people of Australia know and will remember. Those behind their councils said that they must The honorabandon compulsory training. They broke their god, smashing it to pieces at the bidding of men who led them to destruction. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has moved a vote of censure on the Government, but it would have been infinitely more proper had I moved a vote of censure on those who have shipwrecked the Labour movement. I tell him that the day will come when the Labour movement will have to fight for its life against those who are seeking to destroy it. I have said all I intend to say, and I am sure that some honourable members opposite will think I have said far too much. But they have deliberately chosen to put forward, as a pretext, this wretched, flimsy motion in order to prevent Parliament going on with its business. On their heads rests the blame for wasting precious time. I have not spoken as fully as I could, but neither have I minced matters. My very soul revolts at",46,George Fairbairn

Ib cannot be controverted that, during the past few months, the people of Australia have been jjaying more for their meat than they have ever paid for it previously, and that the quality of the article supplied to them has been very inferior.

There was not, at that time, the clamant demand by our producers for the world's parity, because meat and butter were then being sold for export cheaper than they were being sold for local consumption. existence for the supply of these commodities overseas for 50 per cent, less than they are being sold locally. on very reliable authority that there are now in our freezing chambers large quantities of meat which has been sold overseas for 6d. per lb., notwithstanding that the wholesale price locally is 9d. per lb. We know that today the people of Victoria are paying Is. per lb. for tough bull's hide. I can speak upon this matter frompersonal knowledge, because I have very good teeth. I have mentioned these particular commodities because the Prime Minister, who has more effrontery than have ten ordinary men, has stated that the Leader of the Opposition, when filling the office of Minister for Trade and Customs, did nothing to keep down the price of foodstuffs. The right honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that at the time of which he was .speaking there was grave doubt, owine to the decisions of the High Court, whether anything could be accomplished in that direction. I might enumerate much more that was done by the honourable member for Yarra to reduce the cost of living, and I was indeed surprised that he remained silent while the Prime Minister was making his statement. HadI been in his place, I would have interjected, in a tone sufficiently loud for even the Prime Minister to hear, that his statement was far from the truth. But the Leader of the Opposition refrained from interjecting, being evidently possessed of very much more patience than I have. It is no news to honourable members to be told what was done, because of the middlemen who engineered the mass deputation to which I have already referred. The members of that deputation, instead of wearing red ties, wore bits of wool in their buttonholes, and were eviA t what price? dently very proud of these emblems. They did considerable damage to the Queen's Hall in their zeal to howl down the name of Tudor. There was never a greater compliment paid to any man than that paid to him by the deputation in question when they hooted the mere mention of his name. By their action they admitted that Ihe regulations which he had framed whilst filling the position of To-day contracts are in Minister for Trade and Customs had prevented them from cornering meat and butter. Until all these primary products were pooled, the farmers of Australia did not get the price for them that they should have received. They were obliged to sell in order to meet their liabilities. They had to sell their wheat at Is. 8id. per bushel in 1893, just after the great financial crisis in Victoria, when Melbourne was almost deserted, yet the middlemen who bought it sold it afterwards at 3s. 6d. and 3s. 7Jd. per bushel.

253,Mr Mathews,"I am informedfarmers are determined that this should not happen again, they ought to support us in our endea vour to see that the people .who produce get a fair return, while at the same time a fair price is charged to the consumer. the farmers seem to object to the desire of the workers to get commodities as cheaply as possible; but while the workers claim that the wages they are paid shall be. in proportion to the cost of l i v in g I think, they ought to claim more'-the y are all, with the exception, perhaps, of a few cranks, ready to admit that the farmer should receive a price which will give him a fair chance of living in comfort. When the Leader of the Opposition presented his case in regard to the bad handling of our commodities on the other side of the world, that charge being laid against the Government,,it was peculiar that, when the Prime Minister, was replying there was not a word of rebuttal from any honourable member in the Corner. Neither did the Prime Minister answer the charge. He was not aware that other nations had received our goods, and were charging higher prices for them; but it was something he should have known. The Government ought to be able to follow all our commodities where they go, and demand that the Australian producer shall get the f u l l return for what he sends away. I do not think that the producers ought to be so hard on the workers as, according to some of their statements, they appear to be. But perhaps it is thoughtlessness on their part. On the other hand I want the producers to get a f a i r deal. It is not under estimating the amount when I say that they have lost £100,000,000 on the sale of their products overseas. We are told that the armies of the United States of America were clothed with our wool at about Is. 3£d. per l b. America did not get a bale of our wool at Is. 3^d. per lb. They paid 80 per cent, above that rate for the cheapest wool they received. the growers of Australia did not get the enormous prices paid by many countries for our wool, and I am sorry that the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), and those engaged in the handto-mouth calling he follows, did not get higher prices-no t because I am concerned for their interests, but because I want bo see them taxed on their returns. We should have been able to reduce very considerably the financial strain on the country through the sale of our commodities. This was a matter which the ex-Treasurer Some representatives of ( Mr Watt) went to Great Britain to negotiate. Now we are told that there, is difficulty in the way, and we are led to believe that the honourable member for Balaclava resigned .his portfolio because be was not permitted to handle this very complex question in his own way. However, I regret that Australia did not get more of the money, because I know that the capitalists of other countries got it , and are now endeavouring to squeeze us here as well as the people of Great Britain. Having failed in his endeavour to prove that the Leader of the Opposition had done nothing towards reducing the cost of living, the Prime Ministeri n that peculiar style of his own, which is very effective with a lot of people, although not with honourable members in the House, launched forth upon an oratorical attack on the Labour party of Australia for having refused to accept his proposal for increasing the legislative powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. But he knows very well that the B ill he brought forward was not a copy of the Labour party's proposals. So much had been cut away from our proposals that it could not be recognised as being anything like the Bills put before the people by this party in 1910 and 1913, and which we again desired to submit to the people in 1916, but were prevented because the Prime Minister had accepted something from the State Premiers which afterwards they did not concede. As a matter of fact, when the Prime Minister's B ill was brought forward last year, the majority of our party accepted it , feeling that it was better to catch half a loaf than to have no bread, but the measure was so distorted in the Senate as to be rendered absolutely useless. In the circumstances, the honourable gentleman's I know well that statement that we were going back on the great desire of the Labour party to increase tlie powers of the Commonwealth Parliament cannot be sustained, and he knows it . When the B ill returned from the Senate, I objected to it , and, although the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best)' maintained that it was the same measure, it took the",50,George Fairbairn

Por one thing, the time would certainly expire before the proposed Convention could meet to draw up by some mutual arrangement the powers to be given to this Parliament. No one could imagine States which claimed sovereign rights conceding one jot of power to this Parliament, and I am sure that it will never be done by concession from the State Parliaments until the people of the States become alive to the situation, and make the demand that it shall be done.

Of course, he may get many foolish workers to believe him, because at the close of his address he brought to bear his long-range gun, and ho imported what some persons call "" insecticide."" For many years past that has been the last shot fired. He knows what he can do with it, and by similar methods; but these will not always act. Soaring again, the right honourable gentleman spoke about the enormous amount of public money on the market causing the inflation of values, though he knows as well as I do, and all who have considered the question broadly know, that if has nothing whatever to do with the case. the currency has had nothing to do with which it was counselled that the worker the rise in prices! of the rise in prices is that during the for him to talk; but when we become war certain men made enormous profits, normal as regards productivity the wageand if prices had not gone down they earners will be thrown out of work, and would have been able to buy the world. will not be able to purchase the commodiPrices had to go up, so that their purties that they have manufactured or chasing power should not be so great as helped to produce.

281,Mr Mathews,"The man whokeep armies and navies larger than kept before? The hope held out to the people was that when the war was finished we would do away with our enormous armies and navies. I agree for the people of Australia to pay for the Army and Navy at the rate we are paying now. honourable member get his estimate of £5,000,000 from? ; was in Melbourne for the Prince's visit, T ascertained, from inquiry, that the number of men required to man those ships was between 4,000 and 5,000. It would be necessary to have quite that number to man that large Fleet and keep up.'the necessary shore establishments. than half the sum you mention. expenditure on the Navy will be about £5,000,000 a year. We are not ashamed to contend. that the expenditure on the Army and Navy should be reduced, as we were told it would be reduced. The Government are trying to make up their minds how* far they will reduce it, and how and then we read an inspired article in.the press about what they intend. Yet, when a Labour representative dares to state during an election campaign that our military and naval expenditure will have to come down, and that our Navy will have to be broken up, the Prime Minister regards him with horror, and endeavours to make capital out of what he has said. If the press, which talks about economy, would howl for it in that direction, it would be much more effective than when it cries out for the reduction of wages among the working, members of the community. If the Age had devoted to the Army and Navy expenditure one quarter of the space which it gave to the -"" salary grab,"" it might have done some good, but it is not getting a share of the -"" salary grabj"" whereas it is getting a share of the other profits. That is why it will not howl about them penditure on the Army and Navy is one of the directions in which we can economize., ashamed of saying that, now that the great war which was to settle all wars is over, most of our warships should he [ l l l ] -2 placed upon the scrap heap. We know that is all they are fit for. I do not ask the Minister for the Navy to admit it . because it is not true. that we received from the British Go^ vernment were of no use to them, although they might have been too good to break up. Still they are not up to date as fighting machines. When tlie advocating the reduction of the Navy, he is simply giving vent to cheap talk, that ought not to have,, and I do not -believe will have, any, effect on the community. for the Labour party when you say the present Navy should be scrapped! You are making some serious, statements.' honourable member my own opinion. I am not speaking for the party, but I believe the general opinion of the party is that the present Navy establishment is too large for Australia, to keep up; that the expenditure ought to be reduced; and that much of. the Fleet that we saw here reoently could safely be stored away.in Sydney harbour, or in portion of Hobson's Bay, or some otheT port, with watchmen on board. Then the people could look with awe upon it as upon a relic of the great war. The Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Poynton) on one occasion, when I said that most of our"" 'Navy ought to be scrapped, asked if I was serious, seeing that I was the representative of a naval port. If I tried to bolster up unnecessary expenditure simply from a desire to hold my seat, I would be unworthy to represent any section of the community. In spite of the fact that I may lose votes by my attitude, I still say .that our Navy establishment is too large. We cannot afford it, and that is where economy ought to be applied.

The Acting Treasurer has stated recently that he cannot find money to increase the old-age and invalid pensions. During the last six or seven months I have received quite a hundred letters from all parts of the Commonwealth from people who have told me the actual facts about their Through no fault of their own they find that the 15s. a week pension is all they have to live on. One old lady tells me that her savings of £800 were lost in the failure of one of the building twenty years ago. She is now 80 years of age, and all she has to look to is the 15s. per week pension. hundreds and thousands of these cases. V. e know that those who ' can get no T assistance from relatives or friends cannot possibly live on 15s. a week. Mr Mathews. it from someLemmon, a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, has forwarded me a We letter from an old couple, over 70 years out of age, who wrote from a benevolent asylum to ask him if they could not possibly get some of the increased pension money. Somebody has the money in the community. The Treasurer will not make millions friends by taking it from those who have We are often told it , but civilization demands that somecountry, thing more should be done towards the support of these unfortunate people. War widows originally received a pension of £ 1 per week; but, finding that although they have done it they could not live on that allowance, They could not have made their the Government granted them an, increase. Recently the amount hag been because only human reduced in the case of young widows to £1 per week. that they received £ 1 10s. per week, I have only to say that if the Government consider it necessary to grant the widow and tigers at Royal of a soldier 30s. per week, it should be Such practices would not be even more necessary to grant the same even by our present paramount by way of pension to a poor old In past days, beman or woman who, in the industrial strife, has fallen by the w-ay. In if the honourable member's party had rewe mained in office, old-age pensioners would have continued to receive only 12s. 6d. per week. It was only after we had decided to increase the old-age pension to 15s. a week that Opposition members began to urge that it should be raised to £1. rect. If we were in .power, we should not be afraid to tax those who have the money in order to raise the funds necessary to provide an invalid and old-age pension of £1 per week. The increase position. from 12s. 6d. to 15s. per week was made only last January, but the cost of livin g is still going up. In passing, I may say that no trade union w ill ever again be induced to sign an agreement for three societies years, or even twelve months, because the workers now realize that a wage that they might to-day consider adeThere must be quate would probably be wholly inadequate three months hence, because of the increase in prices.

They have, however, given us no evidence of any intention on their part to move in the right direction. If the cost of living is to go on increasing we shall have more trouble. strike in Melbourne for some weeks; but it is only the forerunner of an infinitely larger trouble that will arise unless some action is taken to put down profiteering. I hope that the Government will find some way of providing the money necessary to enable them to keep their compact with the men who have fought for us, and with their dependants. I hope, also, that they will increase the invalid and old-age pensions in proportion to the increase in the cost of living. ' I come now to the war gratuity bonds. During the last ten days I have been asked by at least 200 returned men how they can obtain cash for their bonds. When the War Gratuity Bill was before us, the Prime Minister distinctly stated that it had been so framed that the harpies who prey upon mankind would be unable to make money by trafficking in these bonds. He declared that no one would be able to rob the returned soldier of the full face value of his bond. I do not know whether certain traders in the community have discovered a flaw in the Act, but I do know that, in many cases, the bonds have changed hands under circumstances that were not contemplated when the Bill was before the House. honourable member is right. diers are being told that they can purthem. chase furniture to the value of 60 or 70 per cent, of their bonds, and receive the bonds to be cashed in certain cases. balance in cash. This system of trafficking is being so largely resorted to by but we were informed that it would not certain traders that unless-a stop is put permit transactions such as those to which. to it ' immediately our second-hand furniture shops will shortly be overcrowded with furniture purchased by soldiers merely with the object of getting cash for portion of their bonds. If there is a flaw in the Act every one should know of it. The Prime Why should one section of the community be able to deal in this way with men who wish to get cash for their bonds, while others who are prepared to do business in a genuine, straightforward way are shut out? would not have been better in the long run for the soldier to have made the war We have had a gratuity bonds absolutely non-negotiable. gratuity should have been paid in cash. been done only by floating a loan of £30,000,000. mised a cash gratuity, and the Government should have been prepared, if necessary, to find the money by a compulsory loan. If the Act is ineffective, so that harpies are able to trade in these bonds to the detriment of the soldiers, the Government should immediately amend it. If they are not prepared to do that, they should, at least, make a straightforward statement on the subject, and so put every one on the same plane. Will the Acting Treasurer state whether it is a fact that tradespeople, before taking a bond from a soldier in payment for goods are able to go to the Treasury and have the bonds transferred to them? tain the consent of the Treasury. of fact, people who are trafficking in these bonds send them to the Treasury for transfer ? of the fact that we were told when the Bill was before us that trafficking could only say that the Government have misled us, and that no more telling indict-",56,George Fairbairn

Men constantly ask me how they can convert their bonds into cash. I know that I cannot send them to a fair dealer, and as I am not prepared to hand them over to a rogue of a dealer, I am unable to help them. The sooner we have from the Government a plain statement on this sub1 ject, the better for the soldiers and the community as a whole. The Prim© Ministeri n the course of his speech stated that the Labour party, since it lost him had fallen upon evil davs, and amongst evil men. Having made that statement, he quoted from a newspaper paragraph in regard to Dr. Mannix. made the charge that the leaders of the Labour party were outside the movement. He said that D r . Mannix was our leader. He knows that is not correct. Dr. Mannix has as much right to interfere in the political world as has any other minister of religion, and no more. He has as much right to interfere in political D i d he obtain the conaffairs as has the Rev. Mr Woodfull, the Rev. Mr Worrall, or any of their class. If he has been more effective in his interstrong man and the others axe weaklings. If D r . Mannix has taken advantage of every opportunity to attack the Ministerial party, he was justified in doing so. He occupies rather a peculiar position, because, as an Irishman, and one of a race who have always been clamouring for liberty they have never been allowed to enjoy, his sympathies are naturally w i th the downtrodden. I am not a member of his Faith, 'but rather the opposite, as I have frequently said; but, unlike the clergymen of other denominations, he has taken the side of the lowly in the community; that he is our leader: That he is admired by a great section of the workers is quite correct, and if they choose to admire him.who shall say them nay? When the Prime Minister drags this question I am neither a into political life, as he did successfully at the last general election, and as w it h less success he endeavoured to do at the Ballarat by-election, he treads upon, very dangerous ground. He hurls these taunts at us to-day in the hope that they w ill prove injurious to our party ; but let me say that we welcome assistance from every section, of the community. In my opinion, it is to the everlasting disgrace of the representatives of other churches that they have not been found w it h D r . Mannix on the side of the lowly, but on the other side. It is because of this difference that the Prime Minister selects the representative of a particular church and hurls at him , and us, the taunt that he is our leader. It is true that D r . Mannix has assisted us in many directions, and that his assistance has been used to in j u r e the Labour party. But honourable members opposite will not always be able to adopt that course.

Is it not the boast of this great and glorious Empire that it concerns itself with the well-being of its people. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) does not approve of these remarks. Those associated with the honourable member do not want to disrupt the Empire, because it is by waving the flag that they have made their money. does not wish to disrupt the Empire either. about the people of the Empire, and if to disrupt the Empire were to benefit the people, why should it not be disrupted? knows that the disruption of the Empire would not .be for the benefit of the people. thati? In the great Empire about which we talk .so .much there are millions of persons starving, and other millions who must fall below the starvation line if they do :not obtain work next day. If it would benefit the people to disrupt the Empire, who .shall say that it should not be done? If the condition of the people would be bettered by their being associated in small rather ' -than in large communities, who will say that the change should not be effected? What are we out for if it is not to benefit the people ? Do we desire 'merely the aggregation of many peoples in one Empire, without being concerned as to whether that is for their benefit or not? I say, again, that if it were for the benefit of the people, it would be better that the Empire should be disrupted. The Prime Minister taunted the Leader of the Opposition ""by reading 'an extract from a newspaper playing Ryan against Tudor and Tudor against Ryan, and endeavoured to belittle the honourable member -Our party is like of order. every, other party in this respect. If certain members of the party believe that one of their number would make a better leader than another, what is to prevent them from holding such a belief? Why should the Prime Minister throw, stones? know that the names of Watt and Hughes are set one against the other? Is there not an impression throughout Australia to-day that we have onlyto wait until Watt gets back to >see what "" B ill y "" Hughes will get? People who live in glass-houses should not throw stonesj and the Prime Minister should certainly not throw stones until he knows what will happen when Mr Watt returns. The suggestion of rivalry between Mr Tudor and Mr Ryan will not break up the party on this side, whatever may be the effect upon the party opposite of the rivalry between Mr Hughes and Mr Watt. Let the Prime Minister keep-his personal taunts to himself. When he becomes personal we can give him all he wants. We have had newspapers counting how many on the opposite side will follow Mr Watt and how many will follow Mr Hughes. There may be some truth in what is said in the newspapers. But it is the same with every political party. I am tola that even in the Farmers' party there are some who think that they might have another leader. Throughout, the Prime Minister's reply we had nothing .but taunts, and he would not deal with the motion before the House. I intend to close with a reference to the case of the Reverend Father Jerger. before the Court? was before the Court, but I understand that it is settled that Father Jerger is to go. I deal with the case as one concerning a community that is supposed to. be free. It is stated that because Father Jerger is of German birth or extraction he is to be deported from this country. How brave we are! We were going totry and execute thousands of Germans who perpetrated most damnable acts during the war.

The Ballarat election on Saturday has resulted in an addition o i one member to the strength of Labouri n this Chamber, and a corresponding reduction of the direct jVlinisterinl party. There has been in t h f newspapers and the minds of the general'public some speculation as to the position of parties in this Parliament in view of the result of that election. WheneverI have been asked for an opinion upon this matter I have said that the result of the Ballarat election can make no difference whatsoever to the position of parties in this Parliament. There are now in this House 49 Nationalists and 26 Labour members, for although* there is a slight division in the ranks of the Nationalists, those who sit on the Government side are not separated by principle, and when they vote on a vital issue which challenges the Government from the stand-point of Labour, the Corner Nationalists will vote with . their confreres, the direct supporters of the Government. A t least a sufficient number of them will always vote with the Government to save it from destruction. What difference is there in the voters who returned the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) to the last Parliament, and those who elected him to this Parliament? I undertake to say that not 500 electors of the 20,000 or 30,000 who voted in that electorate have changed their allegiance or voted differently at the two elections. The honourable member was returned for the last Parliament by Nationalist votes, and he was returned to this Parliament also by Nationalist votes; therefore, he was a Nationalist in the last Parliament, and he is a Nationalist to-day. same remark applies to the honourable the Leader of the so-called Country section. last Parliament by Nationalist Liberals, and he is elected to this Parliament by the votes of the same people. Except for the little ebb and flow in public opinion which takes place between general elections, the so-called Country party represents Liberals and Nationalists identically the same as do the members of the direct Government party. What has happened in this Australian Parliament has happened in every British Parliament. When there is a large Government party, all the members of capacity and personality cannot be Ministers, and those who are left out immediately set about the formation of a cave or clique, or a corner party in order to force the Government to recognise them. That is not peculiar to this Parliament or to the Ministerial party. It has happened in every representative Parliament in Britain and the British Dominions, and with every party, whether called Liberal, Conservative, or LabouT. When all the men of strong personality in a large party cannot be recognised as Ministers, some of them break away, and by organization within the party insist that the ruling faction shall recognise them and offer them some preferment. If there be, during the life of this Parliament, any change at all in the relation of representatives, it will be by a reconstruction amongst members on the Government side. The present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) may go out of office, and the ex-Treasurer ( Mr Watt) may take his place. Some Ministers in the present team may lose their portfolios, and other members from the Corner section gain them. In my judgment, based on the experience of a good many years in the Parliament, that is the most extreme disruption that can possibly take place before the next general election. In thirteen years I have contested six elections, and during the whole of that time the 1910-13 Parliament ' was the only one which ran its f u l l course of three years. No Parliament since then has seemed more likely to survive its f u l l term than does the present The one. view of the increase of salaries. He was returned to the MrJ . H .

CATTS -If you, sir, take exception to the word contemptible I withdraw it, but it is a most unworthy and sordid suggestion that the paltry few pounds that a member of. Parliamentreceives as his allowance will influence him in casting a vote in, this House. The honourable member could not heap a greater insult on every member in. this Chamber. Labour mem> bers, at any rate,, are showing that they are prepared to* vote against, the Government, and to take, every opportunity to put them, out of office-. We shalL continue, to. do so, because that is ourduty. The honourable member's suggestion does not. cast a slur on those who vote against the Government,, but imputes that, those who vote with the Government are afraid of losing the few paltry pounds, they receive in. salary for. fear of being sent to ti© country.. Both sections of the Nationalists I have my charge*. Not one honourable membeen describing represent capitalism and vested interests. The direct Government party represents the middlemen, agents, distributors, and the proprietors of the secondary industries in the larger centres of population. The so-called Country party represents the big landed proprietors in the country districts; it, too, represents vested interests and capitalism, but as the Ministerial party is so large it can .afford to divide into sections. The country capitalist desires to get a bit more at the expense of the city agent and distributor, but on the very instant that vested interests are threatened the two sections becomes as united as the Holy Trinity itself. I venture to predict that there will never be a challenge to the Government no matter upon what subject, whether it be the interests of the primary producers or anything else, when the so-called Country party and representatives of the farmers and country producers wili vote with Labour to defeat the Government. This so-called Country party was said to have entered this Parliament with three main planks to its platform. The first was that there should be a restoration'of what is called responsible parliamentary government. Mr J. H . CATTS -What has the honourable member done to get rid of the War Precautions Act. and restore the power of this Parliament? Nothing whatsoever. Another plank of the Country party's so-called, platform was economy. What have the so-called Country members done to effect economy ? The third plank of the so-called Conn? try party's policy pledged them to votein the interests of the primary producers; The primary producers have been the victims of such colossal robbery as is. without precedent in history, but the Country party has sat silent. One indictment, of this censure' motion challenges the Government for not having made any definite binding, contracts in regard to the overseas sales of primary products. I defy any honourable member of the so-called Country party to say that he has ever seen one of those contracts. These gentlemen, sit facing me,, but there is no answer to ber has even asked to see them. The interest of honourable members oppositein theprimary producers is not sufficient fo induce them to demand the production of the contracts in this House, although the Prime Minister admitted, on the 13th May, that Australian wool had been sold to the Imperial authorities for use overseas, not only by Great Britain, but by foreign Powers, at one-third of the market value. The Prime Minister knows that one-third of the market value was, because he was in Great Britain for two years, and knew the ruling prices for various products. On the Prime Minister's own showing, this country has been robbed of £320,000,000 in connection with the sale of wool alone. The same sort of thing has happened in regard to sales of wheat, metals, butter, &c. The primary producers, being unable to obtain any information in regard to the sales of butter overseas, have been compelled to subscribe money to send private representatives to Great Britain in order to try to find out the true position of affairs, although they are supposed to have in this Parliament a party officially representing them, which could demand on the floor of this House that the information be made",61,Speaker Hon J He Is Proved To Be Guilty

CATTS to detailed information regarding the sales of Australian products, including the contracts which were the instruments of such sales. Those contracts have been asked for from this side of the House, but we are impotent to force the Government to produce them, because we number only twenty-five in a House of seventy-five; but the members of the Country party know that, if they joined us in this demand, the Government would be compelled to produce the information. Although this motion of censure challengesthe Government on this issue of vital concern to the primary producers, it w ill be seen when the division bells ring and the numbers go up that, w it h probably one or two exceptions, the so-called representative of the primary producers votes to shield the Government in this robbery of the primary producers. In 1914, the present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) described the party opposite, in a signed. statement issued to the general public, and I propose to read some extracts from it : Mr Joseph Cook and his party pose as the friends of the ""poor farmers."" They bid ""the man on the land"" beware of the Labour party, and to trust the so-called Liberal party, to defend him against all his enemies. In view of the record of the Fusion and the great interests who support it, it is the most impudent attempt to fool the people ever attempted. Who are the enemies of the farmers? The land monopolists, the middleman, commission agent, and the trusts. Land monopoly has heen, and is still, the greatest curse of Australia. The holders of great estates have compelled farmers to pay exorbitant prices for land, or have forced him on to the poorer lands away from rail and market. Middlemen and commission agents fleece the producer. He is at their mercy. They control the channels through which alone the farmer can sell his produce. And the great combinations of capitalists who form trusts, rings, and monopolies fleece the farmer, both when he buys his machinery and goods' he needs and when he sells his produce. These are the enemies of the farmer. And they are all behind Mr ister, for raising the sectarian issue ? What Cook and his party; yet Mr Cook has the audacity to declare that his party is the friend of the farmer. . . . How can a party supported by trusts, middlemen, and monopolists, and financed by these very people, be expected to protect the farmer from the people who fleece him? behind Mr Cook. (Signed) W. M. HUGHES, I am referring Commonwealth Offices, Sydney. The trusts and the great landlords are to-day behind the combination of Mr. Hughes and Sir Joseph Cook. There they sit together now, cheek by j o w l ! The Prime Minister has raised the sectarian issue. I have heard him, when a Labour man, denouncing that same issue when the party opposed to Labour did what it has always done when it has sought to disrupt the Labour party by introducing the sectarian serpent. The Prime Minister was then vitriolic in his rebuke. Yet this same dirtyweapon he now actually goes into the gutter to employ against the old party which put h i m on his feet in the public life of Australia.

337,Mr Deputyspeaker (Hon. J.,,63,Joseph Cook T O What Informa The Trusts And The Great Landlords Are All
338,Mr Deputyspeaker,"TheThese honourable gentlemen all belong to the persuasion and profess the Faith which the Prime Minister has attacked. What kind of men are they that they should support the Prime Minister, their Leader, in his attack upon their own Faith, upon their priests, their nuns, and the religion of their fathers? They know, as well as the Prime Minister knows, that this wicked invention has nothing behind it except an appeal to the blind prejudices of the people? If the Protestants of this country numbered one-fourth of its total population, and the Catholics represented three-fourths, Mr Hughes' attack would be the other way round, without the shadow of question. The Prime Minister has had something ' to say about Labour and loyalty. This same kind of stuff was hurled at the Labour party when Mr Hughes and Mr that the right honourable gentleman has Fisher were its leaders-hurle d just exactly as the Prime Minister to-day has thrown it at us. I have another pamphlet here, signed by Mr Hughes. It is entitled, ""The Degradation of Patriotism: an Exposure."" Andi t statesAt a time when to dub a man a "" traitor"" is to at once charge him with the most serious of crimes and expose him to the hitter odium and contempt of his fellows, a leaflet has been widely circulated levelling charges of "" disloyalty"" and ""treachery"" to the Empire. against certain members of the Labour party. These statements are contemptible and wicked untruths, and the man who made them knew them to be so when he wrote them. What can we say of a man who in the face of these statements ( Mr Fisher's denial) would charge Mr Fisher with favouring ""Hauling down the flag"" and ""Raising that of revolt""? What are we to think of Mr Joseph Cook, under whose notice I have brought this leaflet, who heard Mr Fisher's speech in Parliament, who knows that every statement made in the leaflet about Mr Fisher is absolutely untrue? Yesterday, I sent Mr Cook a copy of this infamous leaflet, and asked him to repudiate it ; but, although he admitted having heard Mr Fisher deny the truth of any one of them, he would not do so. What are we to say of men who, posing as patriots and deprecating everything calculated to create the impression amongst the enemy that the Empire is not presenting a united front, brands the leader of one of the great political parties in Australia as a ""traitor,"" knowing the same to be an infamous falsehood? Mr J. H. Catts. What are we to say of a party tliat not only does not repudiate such tactics by its paid agent, but openly approves him and them, and bends its every effort to give the widest publicity to this cowardly, contemptible, and malicious slander? (Sgd.) W. M. HUGHES. 321 Pitt-street, Sydney. The Prime Minister then directed a copy of this pamphlet to the present Acting Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), who now sits facing me at the table. Mr Hughes said, "" I have brought this infamous leaflet under the notice of Mr Cook, and although he knows it to be untrue, he will not say it is untrue, because there is an election on."" able member for Bendigo( Mr Hughes) nor the honourable member for Cook( Mr Catts) could ever say that I have raised that question in all my life. Mr J. H . CATTS I am not saying raised it, but that, the subject having been raised, he has kept silence, and has neither protested against it nor contradicted it. The attack to which that leaflet refers was launched in 1914, and I reiterate that Mr Hughes said, "" I brought this under the notice of Mr Cook .personally. He knows the statements to be untrue, and yet Tefuses to give public denial to them Mr Cook gives his countenance to the leaflet, knowing it to be untrue."" We charge this Government with (a) failure to prevent the inordinate rise in tbe cost of living. When the Prime Minister, in 1919, was yet on the waters adjacent to the Australian coast, making his Australian ward way from England, he set out a brief policy for the impend. ing elections thus, ""As to the profiteer and the Bolshevik, damn them both!"" And he said he would "" shoot them both."" What has he done to damn or shoot them, since ? He now says he has not the power. One of our principal charges against the Prime Minister is that he has the War Precautions Act in operation to-day in all its original force and effect. Under that Act he can do anything he likes in regard to every mouthful that the people eat and every yard of material with which they clothe themselves. Yet, having this power, he has absolutely refused to use it. He will use it for other purposes-for deportation, for example.

The present Leader of the Labour party supplied many returns, when Minister for Customs, giving instances of that of which I "" complain. The Commonwealth Government have unlimited power over imports from foreign countries. If it is believed that an im porter is robbing the people of Australia, the Government, under their present powers, may demand the productiono f his invoices, and! they could publish in the Commonwealth Gazette theprices 'charged. If this were done it would be one of the most effective steps that could be taken to prevent profiteering, because, when the people realize how they are being robbed, they will insist upon definite action being taken to stop it . Again, the Government have unlimited power over taxation. They could tax all profits above a certain margin, and by the publication of the names' of those who are making excessive profits, could discourage the practice. The Government, further, have complete power over the Post Office. Here, indeed, is a huge machinethat could be used to protect the great masses, of the people from the rapacious trader.' If a an commercial firm were found to be acting unfairly towards the people, the Postal authorities could prevent the firm's letters from being, delivered through the post; and' they could disconnect the firm!s telephone. And why should not these public conveniences be refused to any firm found guilty of using, them for the purpose of exploiting the people? No trader could stand up against Government action properly directed to prevent profiteering.. I . intend now to quote some admissions I am not. But by the Acting Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) during, the course of my remarks on theoccasion I have referred to. They will be found on page 3632 of Hansard, 2nd June, 1915.

I take no notice of the argument that there is not sufficient money to pay the increased sum. There is plenty available if only the right means are taken to obtain it.

On the motion, speaking of the total repatriation approthe Government was conniving at the priations, he saidFor 1920-21 the total amount provided is cashing of the bonds. £37,475,000. The Government are issuing a piece of reference, my "" attention being momenpaper, very little of which can be negotarily otherwise engaged, but if it were tiated. Were these terms used to mislead the for Cook( Mr J. H . Catts) to withdraw soldier electors into the belief that they it. were going to get cash for their bonds? What is going on to-dav with regard to point im that way at all. those bonds is an absolute scandal. Traders in Sydney, who have the authomember said something that the Minister rity of the Government, are selling goods, regards as offensive it must be withsay, furniture, and demanding that the drawn. soldier shall spend with them £60 out of every £100. In needy cases the furniture so supplied is taken to the auction say anything personally offensive; I am rooms and sold for a song. If interest-bearing bonds are issued ring to the policy of the Government, they cannot be made inalienable or which, I say, amounts to what I stated. If non-negotiable-the y will be negotiated it is allowed to go on under the system in some shape or form; and the that has been introduced it does amount to proper thing is for the Government the connivance of the Government. There to carry out their election pledges. is only one way to stop this, and I moved The Labour party said that if they to give effect to the remedy, but the were returned to power cash would Nationalists voted against my proposal. be paid, and under the influence of public opinion, and the driving force of the Labour movement, the Government also promised to pay cash. The bonds should be paid in a negotiable instrument that can be openly traded at its face value, instead of being secretly and covertly negotiated at an enormous disI count. This policy really means that, with the connivance of the Government, the soldiers are thus robbed by the profiteers of the country of 10s. in the £ 1 of their gratuity.

That man has been two years begging the State Government to provide him with a living area, and he cannot get it.

CATTS -We are now told that this repatriation is costing this or that sum; but why did the Government not find out, before they made their promises, that they could not fulfil them? Our charge is that the Government promised, and is not honouring their promise. The Government do not say they are carrying out their undertaking, but are giving reasons for not doing so, and that is no answer to the charge. The next charge against the Government is that of (c) failure to take steps to proceed with the erection of the Federal deal with the causes of industrial unrest. This unrest is caused by two phenomena -the high cost of living and unemployment. It has already been shown, and it is admitted, that the Government have ' done nothing to deal with the high cost of living; as to unemployment, the Government themselves are the greatest offenders. They are putting Government employees off work, and thus creating unemployment, as at Cockatoo Dock, Sydney, where large numbers of .men are out of work. The Government refuse to go on with the building of the .Federal Capital, which would . riot ""only provide work, but return handsomely. on the expenditure. There are any number of private companies which would be very glad to take over the Federal Capital as a commercial proposition. At the present time, although the lands within the Federal area are let on short leases, which does not allow them to be put to their best use, they, are returning a profit. The British. House of Commons, and from development of the Federal Capital is a_ paying concern, and could he made so from the jump; yet the Government refuse to go on with the work, although the compact is nearly twenty years overdue. There are some honourable members on the Government side who have been vowing vengeance against the Government on this score. these are the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) and a number of others, and they now have an opportunity of expressing their dissatisfaction with the Government for its ""general incapacity"" in this matter. However, as I have said over and over again in New South Wales, those members only express their dissatisfaction by their votes when there is no risk to the Government-neve r if there is any "" business"" in it. The Government know that the attitude of these gentlemen is only a bit of by-play; and it is certain that the very moment they assert themselves in regard to the Federal Capital, and show that fchey intend to take decisive steps by voting against the Government, the latter will render a hostile vote unnecessary and get to work very quickly. They will not risk being torn from the Treasury bench for the mere sake of declining to Capital. The Prime Minister has already appointed a Royal Commission to deal with the question of industrial unrest, but only a few weeks ago he was compelled to admit that this body represents only so much blank cartridge, and that the Government can do nothing with its re T port. The next count in the indictment of the Labour Opposition charges the Government with (d) failure to secure an adequate return to the Australian people for their wool and other primary products which have been sold overseas. In this connection I do not propose to repeat create an asset that would the case against the Government'which I put upon record in Hansard earlier in the session. My case dealing with the wool sales effected overseas will be found on page 305 of Hansard, and that dealing with the sales of wheat on page 341 of Hansard of the current session. In speaking upon those subjects I quoted statements made by Ministers in the other authoritative sources, with a view to proving that this country has been grossly robbed in the prices which it. has obtained for its primary products under sales effected by the Government. All the admissions which have since been made have served only to confirm my charge, including the stateAmongst ment of the Prime Minister on the 13th May last that, during the war, we had sold our wool to Great Britain and the Allied Powers at one-third of its value.",70,Joseph Cook T O What Informa The Trusts And The Great Landlords Are All

387,Sir Joseph Cook,"This settlement isNo doubt, when the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) returns to this country we shall get the full details of the dispute between himself and the Prime Minister, and shall thus secure further confirmation of the rotten state of affairs which has existed in regard to the sales of Australian produce. On the 13th May last-as will be seen by reference to Hansard, page 2085-86the Prime Minister took up the role of a prophet. He said, in effect, ""Just watch how the prices of Australian wool will tumble after 30th June next."" He then went on to show that prices were coming down with a run as the result of an express arrangement to exploit the Australian producer. A few weeks later his prediction was verified. The prices of our wool came down with an awful crash to the serious loss of our primary producers. The Prime Minister himself told us that those prices were being manipulated. Where are the representatives of the Country party that they allow this kind of thing to go on? even register a protest against it . -The next count in the indictment against Ministers charges them with (e) failure to make definite binding contracts for the sale of Australia's primary products. So far, these contracts have not been tabled. They have been asked for again and again, and their production has been refused. We can only conclude, therefore, that their production would not be to the advantage of the Government Any attempt to do so would seriously embarrass the Government. What did the ex-Treasurer say prior to his departure for the Old Country? He said. "" I am going to London to try and straighten out the threads of this wool bungle."" Sir JOSEPH "" bungle,"" did he? Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes, he did. say "" tangle."" Mr J. H'. CATTS -The Assistant Minister for Defence really confirms my reference. How can there be a "" tangle'' if there are proper contracts governing the sales? I now propose to say .a word or two in regard to the cables between Mr at one-third of its value; 'that there is Hughes and Mr Watt, an edited edition of which was produced in this Parliament. I wish to register my emphatic protest against that editing, and against the presentation of a garbled statement to the Parliament and the people of this country. member accuse his own Leader of putting forward a garbled statement? Mr J. H . CATTS I do not; but whatever the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) did, he did on his own responsibility. He acted according to his judgment; but I decline to be bound by his action, and I protest against the procedure adopted. We have been told that some things have transpired between representative men of this country which the people of Australia ought not to know. My own view is that nothing can possibly transpire in regard to the government of this country which the men and women of Australia, who elect this Parliament, are not entitled to know, I have not had an opportunity of seeing the original cables, but there are They do not far-spreading rumours amongst public men generally accepted as well-founded as to what was contained in them, and these rumours can be effectually silenced only by the publication of'the whole of those cables. One of the stories current is that a particular cable contained a statement to the effect that if Australia did not pay £8,000,000 odd within a prescribed time ""he would be branded in the House of Commons and before the world as a defaulter. able member does not believe that ? Mr J. H . CATTS I believe it until I see a proper denial of it. COOK -He did not say made here, and the Government did not deny it. Mr J. H . CATTS I did not see the. I heard him statement, and I have not seen the cables. Moreover, I do not wish to see them if I am to close my mouth in regard to their contents.

391,Mr Watkins,"The statement was£175,000,000. I say that if the statement was made that, unless the Commonwealth paid a sum of £8,000,000 by a certain date, she would be branded as a defaulter, our people should know it. Perhaps it was this statement which had something to do with.the attitude taken up by the ex-Treasurer. It is further alleged that, because of some pressure having been exerted on behalf of Australia in regard to the Japanese Treaty, Mr Watt was compelled to Teport point for point to the Australian Government, and that he was not to be trusted on vital matters affecting the national well-being of this country. being industriously circulated against the honourable member for Balaclava demands that the whole of the cables shall be placed upon the table of this House. It is practically charged against him that, though an Australian bom, he regarded his obligations so lightly that he had practically to be put in chains and legirons, because of the fear that he would do something to prejudicially affect the vital interests of Australia. What has transpired with regard to the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty should be made public property in this country. If I am in public life at any time any difficulty arises between Japan and our kinsmen in America, I shall be no party to any treaty or agreement that is likely to embroil Australia on the side of the coloured races of the East agt»''nst our kinsmen in America. able member knows that iB impossible. Mr J. H . CATTS I believe it is impossible, because an agreement that would do anything of that kind woulil not be worth the paper it is written on; but if such an event should take place, I should be found going from one end of this country to the other, putting before the people what I believe to be the proper view, in order to prevent them from being entrapped into* any dispute, or from taking Bides against the people of America. The statements in current circulation amongst parliamentarians, Commonwealth and State, as to the seriouB allegations in the cablegrams 'which passed between the Prime Minister and the ex-Treasurer demand, not merely a denial across the chamber, but the production of the messages in an unabridged condition, so that the people may know the truth. I have known the honourable member for Balaclava for a good many years. I cannot conceive of him doing an utterly foolish thing; and I cannot but believe that something we have not seen , has had something to do. with his resignation. The statement of the case put forward by the Prime Minister against his absent colleague was too strong, it went too far, it proved too much; it made the honourable member for The very insinuation that is Balaclava out as a babbling infant in swaddling clothes, or even a raving idiot. In the circumstances, I shall have very much doubt as to the facts until I hear the other side. In any case, I presume that the honourable member for Balaclava, as an Australian, is just as good a judge aa is the Prime Minister, who is not an Australian, as to what ought to be published; and he asks for the publication of the whole of the cablegrams. I am not concernect whether honourable members of the Corner party vote against the Government or not. On this indictment, let them support the Government; let their constituents see what their attitude is. Let the so-called representatives of the primary producers explain to the real primary producers why they did not demand farther knowledge about the sales of their products, and something more about the supposed contracts in regard to those sales. Then their constituents, and not those who sit in the Chamber, will be the persons to judge them. The charges against the Government have been proved up to the hilt. Anything said in defence has been mere Billingsgate, or excuses or references to issues that are mere side-steppings. No real answer has been put up; nothing has been said to indicate to the people of the country that the Government are not guilty of the whole of the charges. It only strengthens our case to say that our allegations are mere reiterations of what has been said previously. It shows thab the charge of neglect, incapacity, and incompetence of the Government has been sheeted home against them time after time.",72,Joseph Cook T O What Informa The Trusts And The Great Landlords Are All
392,Mr Jowett,"Of course, the honor1 am satisfied that when the people of Australia read these charges, as they will appear in the official record of Hansard, and the case stated in support, they must come to the conclusion that the Labour party was entirely justified in the step it has taken.
