Petition. certain electors of the Commonwealth praying that the Australian Government withdraw our troops from Vietnam, call for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Vietnam and call on all world leaders to call a conference of conflicting parties aimed rifle and the Armalite rifle that has been at permanent peace and self-determination of the Vietnamese people based on the principles of the 1954 Geneva Accords. Petition received and read. General a question. When did he learn that the Minister for Customs and Excise had decided to amend the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to require the permission of the Minister for Civil Aviation instead of the Director-General of Civil Aviation for the importation of aircraft? When was advice of the intention to amend the Regulations given to the Solicitorweapon in limited numbers to troops in General who was due to appear for the Director-General of Civil Aviation before the Privy Council in a case arising under the Regulations as they stood before the amendment? able member's question precisely, as it was asked, I say that knowledge of the decision of the Minister for Customs and Excise to alter the Regulations came to me on the Monday or the Tuesday, which would have been 28th or 29th June. I am not sure which day it was now, from recollection. The new regulation was made on Thursday, 1st July, and knowledge came to me two or three days prior to that. The honourable member's next question was: When did the Solicitor-General know? The Solicitor General knew on the Sunday or Mondaywhich would have been 4th or 5th Julythat the regulation had been made. I have not in my mind precise knowledge of whether he knew of it on the Sunday and did something first thing Monday morning, or whether he did not know of it until the Monday morning. So, I am not able to answer that question with the precision that the honourable gentleman would require. However, as soon as the regulation was made on the Thursday a communication was sent off immediately to the Solicitor-General in London, to inform him. Minister for the Army tell the House whether the Army has made an evaluation of the respective merits of the standard FN issued to a certain number of Australian troops in South Vietnam? Can he tell the House the particular capabilities and the respective merits of each rifle? evaluating the Armalite rifle for some time now as part of a programme of evaluation that is being undertaken by all the A.B.C.A. armies*-that is, the armies of America, Britain, Canada and Australia. As I have indicated, the rifle is still being evaluated by all those armies. Nowhere has any decision been made as to where, if at all, this weapon will fit into the scheme of things. We are playing our part in this evaluation, in pursuance of which we have issued the Vietnam, Borneo and New Guinea. I do not know the respective characteristics of these weapons in detail. However, the principal advantage of the Armalite rifle is that it is lighter and uses lighter ammunition and therefore more ammunition can be carried for the same weight. Its great defect at the present moment is its extreme inaccuracy beyond a range of 300 yards. There has been a good deal of exaggerated comment about the effects of this weapon. In fact, the lethality of the Armalite rifle is no greater than, if it is as great as, that of the S.L.R. rifle with which our troops and all the N.A.T.O. armies are equipped.

Did he mean that he believes it is wise to keep the ship owners and the stevedoring authorities guessing as to how long he is prepared to keep them waiting before he does exactly what they are asking him to do, or did he mean to keep the waterside workers guessing as to whether he intended to introduce legislation-no w long overdue -to provide for long service leave at 15 years instead of 20 years? Did he mean that he wants to keep both the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers guessing as to how much more time he intends to let go by before he and his Department really make some effort to get all thc parties around a conference table with the object of bridging the gulf between the parties in regard to their present opposeven though they marry within that period ing lists of demands? of the honorabie gentleman's question in which he asked whether I will do something requested by the steamship owners, 1 want to make it clear that they have not asked me to do anything. So that part of his question happens to be incorrect. As to the rest of the .question, the honourable gentleman, too, can be kept guessing in the same way as everybody else. What progress has been made in the campaign against the sirex wasp? Has further finance been allocated in this financial year for the campaign? decided to continue its contribution to the National Sirex Fund during this financial year. We will devote up to £100,000 for this purpose to match contributions by the State Governments. I understand that in addition to the governmental contributions the private mill owners will contribute about £8,000 in this financial year. The object of the campaign is to contain this particular pest in the States of Victoria and Tasmania. So far the campaign has been successful in that regard. In addition to that, and Industry inform the House what the research will continue to be carried out to proposed Australian sugar quota is under see whether the pest can be eradicated the sugar bill now being considered by the entirely in those two States. The joint United States Congress? campaign has been reasonably successful and it will be reviewed before thc end of for Housing: Will he justify the extravagant spending of public moneys on Press, television and radio advertising for homes savings grant purposes while he continues to place every conceivable obstruction in the way of people obtaining grants? What amounts have been spent up to the present time on the various forms of advertising, and will the Minister say why some applicants, who have built and occupied homes during the life of this Parliament, have been refused grants; why young people are compelled to save for three years to qualify for the grant after having left school; and why the joint savings of a parent and a child are unacceptable savings when, at the same time, property purchased by a parent for a child is acceptable under the Act? Will the Minister cause this farcical advertising to cease while scores of applicants are being refused the assistance the Prime Minister promised in 1963? advertising relative to the extent of the scheme is, of course, comparatively trivial. Far from reducing it I expect shortly to undertake a further campaign to make details of the scheme and its requirements clear to members of the public who otherwise might not be aware of some of the requirements. The honourable member must appreciate that this scheme is a reward for saving; it is not a Socialist boondoggle available to both the worthy and the thriftless alike. The scheme will continue along these lines and as and when it is necessary to make further details known so that appropriate people may benefit the necessary steps to advertise it will be taken.",13,Waterside Workers Federation

The Bill was proposed by the United States Administration and submitted to Congress. I am advised that the formula which has been proposed by the Administration would allot to Australia a basic quantity of 187,000 short tons of sugar a year, which would increase with the growth of American consumption. Our recent sales to the United States have been of the order of 200,000 tons a year, although our basic quota has been only a small proportion of that. We have effected the other sales because other countries could not supply the requirements. Having said that this base quota is probefore drugs can be added to or deleted posed, I point out that this is by no means from the pharmaceutical benefits list, a the end of the story as the American scheme recommendation is made by a special expert operates, for the matter, I am advised, is committee.

Minister for Health: Is the honourable gentlehis administration of it? man aware whether sodium luminal is included on the pharmaceutical benefits list?

If sodium luminal is not included on the pharmaceutical benefits list at present, does the Minister know whether it is possible for people to import that drug into Australia? Doctors have informed me that the substitute for sodium luminal produced by G. H. Faulding and Co. Ltd. is available but induces sleepiness in some people, whereas sodium luminal does not. Will the Minister ascertain the answer to my question if he does not know it at present? referred to by the honourable member would be quite useful in this chamber. I am sorry that I am not aware whether sodium luminal is included on the pharmaceutical benefits list. As honourable members are aware, candidate for this seat?

I moveTbat a joint select committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the methods by which the working and capital expenses of the nation's telephone services can be most fairly and efficiently met. I feel that this is a matter of some significance to the Australian community. The Post Office occupies a very important position in our daily life and thc Telephone Branch in particular is perhaps, in terms of monetary turnover at least, by far fhe major section of the activities of the Post Office. It is difficult to get a comprehensive picture of Post Office finances. I direct the attention of tbe House, for instance, to at least two sets of documents which have to be looked at if any appraisal of this kind is to be made. The Estimates, which the House will consider very shortly, show the projected receipts of the Post Office. For the year ended 30th June 1966, the total revenue of the Post Office from all its activities is expected to be £203 million of which £134 million will come from the services of the Telephone Branch. The cash statement in the Estimates shows the normal expenditure of the Post Office as £136 million. Taking into account the expected revenue of £203 million, a quick calculation would seem to indicate that the Post Office will have a surplus of about £67 million. But a second item appears in the Estimates contained in Appropriatton Bill (No. 2) relating to capital expenditure on the Post Office. The amount is £91 million. So there are two items. Ordinary annual expenses on a cash basis are £136 million and there is capital expenditure of £91 million, giving total expenditure of £227 million compared with receipts of £203 million. That is a picture of a kind, but it is not a very comprehensive picture of the operations of the Post Office. To obtain a comprehensive picture of what is called the commercial form of accounting, one has to turn to another that there are two sides of the question that document which is produced and tabled in we have to debate, and I want to try to this House-the annual report of the present the two of them, although I may Postmaster-General. The last one available be a little biased in favour of one rather F.8226/65 -R -[8 ] is that for the year ended 30th June 1964. I presume that we will not receive the latest report for a month or two although it has been the practice for the past couple of years to produce an interim statement of the Department's finances to assist in the Budget debate. On the basis of the commercial account for the year ended 30th June 1964, the total revenue of the Post Office from all sources was near enough to £165 million of which £102 million was earned by the Telephone Branch. So something more than one-half-neare r threefifths-of the activity of the Post Office, in a monetary sense at any rate, is reflected in the Telephone Branch. When you turn to the expenses of the Post Office, however, you find two very significant items, neither of which appears in the cash statement. The first significant item is the provision for depreciation. For the Telephone Branch, this amounted to £23 million for the year ended 30th June 1964. The second significant item, which has appeared for only the last five years or so, is interest. For thc year ended 30th June 1964, the total earnings of the Telephone Branch of near enough to £103 million had offset against them an interest commitment of £22,379,000. In other words, one-fifth of the cost of the Telephone Branch is reflected by this interest component. This interest component is a comparatively new device. Prior to 1960, no interest component was found in the Post Office accounts except a very small sum relating to certain loan funds which had been appropriated directly to the Post Office. Other than that, the capitalisation of the Post Office had come from one of two directions, first, from revenue provided out of taxation by the Commonwealth Government, or secondly, from what is called the ploughing back of capital by the Post Office. I want to make that point first, that the cost of the telephone service as at present computed, when compared with the method of computation used five or six years ago, is one-fifth higher than it might otherwise have been, by reason of the loading on of this interest component. This morning I am merely suggesting",20,Labour M H R Raps Labour
57,Mr Crean (Melbourne Porte) [11.18].,"than the other. But what I ant suggesting is that these are matters of such significance and magnitude that I doubt whether the Parliament as a whole knows what the issues involved really are. I suggest that a select committee of the kind proposed could at least go into these problems. Some of the details are highly technical. Again there are two sets of revenue or expenditure that I want to look at and the cases for the two of them are somewhat different. There are what might be called capital items and there are what might be called items of an annual kind, and during the course of my argument I want to look at both of these sets of items. It might be said, and it has been said previously by the Postmaster-General( Mr thought your undertaking was worth investHulme), that if the Post Office did not collect this amount-and it is £25 million for all the activity of the Post Office, but £22 million in respect of telephone activities a position virtually to fix its own prices, -by charging telephone users, the revenue would have to find an additional amount of £22 million. AgainI think that is a statement of fact. If you did not get the £22 million one way, according to the totality of accounts you would have to get it another way. But at least that does not dispose of the argument that one means of getting it may be more equitable than another. The fact that you collect £22 million from users of telephones rather than raising £22 million by taxation is merely something that we have to consider in the kind of context in which we must try to evaluate the position. Let us consider just what the Post Office is doing in this connection. I will show in a moment that this £22 million really goes into another fund, and then whatever the capital requirements of the Post Office are on the cash side of the budget, they are reduced accordingly because the Post Office has, in essence, ploughed this interest back into the undertaking. What the Post Office is doing here is, of course, what is being done in quite a large number of branches of what is called private enterprise. There, of course, it is done in the name of what is called profit, and there are some people who argue that it is profit that makes the economy efficient. That is again an argument which I suggest is a rather coloured argument; it ignores, of course, the reality that profit i.s made only by charging the users of the goods or services that are provided by an undertaking more than those goods or services cost to produce or provide. The difference is profit. Well, whether profit is a regulator of economic efficiency is at least a matter of some doubt. Increasingly in recent years what has been done in private enterprise has been that higher profits than are normal have been extracted, some of those profits not being distributed to shareholders but being ploughed back into the undertaking to increase its capital structure. AgainI want merely to note that that is a difference in the operation of capitalistic economic theory, if you like to call it that, in 1965 as compared with its operation in, say, 1905. In those days if you wanted additional capital you went on to the market and if investors ing in they would provide the capital. But what is happening now is that because of the scale of industry an undertakingfindsitself in within limits, and itfixesthem so as not only to give a fair dividend to its shareholders but also to allow an additional amount to be ploughed back in order to increase the capital structure of the undertaking. Again, on the score of sheer efficiency there is no justification whatsoever for saying that because you have succeeded in producing 100,000 motor cars you have a warrant to go further and produce 200,000 motor cars, if it is not in the interests of the economy as a whole that we should have 200,000 motor cars. Certainly we should not have 200,000 motor cars until we have enough garages to allow them to be moved off the roads at night, and enough roads for them to run on by day. Sometimes we must achieve co-ordination between correlated aspects of a broad question. Tests somewhat similar to these, it seems, are being applied to the Post Office. To begin with, I do not regard private profit as necessarily an efficient regulator of the economy, but I do think that once you begin to interpolate into the economics of a public utility concepts of profit which are applicable only-if they are applicable at all-to private enterprise, you get into extreme difficulty indeed. I believe that a public utility such as the Post Office should charge the users of its services sufficient only to cover the costs of the services. It need not make a profit because, after all, the profit belongs to tbe community as a whole. at the expense of the provider of the funds-in What is the point in making a profit? this case, through the Treasury, the taxpayer-thu s Everybody is a shareholder in the undertaxpayer. taking, whereas in the case of a private concern there is a limited degree of shareThe report goes on to stateholding. In the case of the Post Office or, for that matter, any other public utility, unquestionably there are no shareholders in the sense in which there are shareholders in a private I do not dispute that proposition. If the concern. The profit motive is the sort of philosophy where that has been intruded into the operations Post Office is a public undertaking and it of the Post Office. Now it is said that bedoes not have to get its capital from private cause the Post Office has a large amount of shareholding so, in essence, it loses the comcapitalisation-and it is close to £600 parison. To my mind that is the whole million, about £500 millions of which is in point of the argument. the telephone section-the Post Office should charge the users of telephones sufficient for its services to show a notional profit of something like 4 per cent, on the capital. AgainI am simply suggesting that this is want to show honourable members where the at least arguable. It can be very dubious concept the other way is rather distorted. It when you come to certain other aspects of is because the Post Office obtains its finance the analysis. WhatI am saying is that at in the way it does that the interest comleast there is no proven theory one way or ponent at least is a matter of opinion rather the other about it, and I think that when than a matter of any final fact. The fact you do get to this kind of situation it is at that the Government decided, in essence, least time that the Parliament had a look to accept the theory of the majority report at it. The fact that there are two points of view Office £20 million or £25 million more for is very clearly brought out in a document services than those services currently cost. that was commissioned by the former We might ask ourselves where we get to Postmaster-General, Mr Davidson. He set beyond that point when it is claimed by the up an ad hoc committee to inquire into Minister: "" I will use that additional interest the commercial accounts of the Post Office. to extend the capital structure of the Post It was a committee of five and on this issue Office for the future "". Again this introduces it divided three one way and two the other. another devious theory-that those people It reached nothing like a unanimous decision. who use tbe Post Office or the telephone I think this is summarised very succinctly today should contribute something towards in one clause in each of the two reports of the capital cost of those who want to use the Ad Hoc Committee of Inquiry into the those facilities tomorrow. That at least is Commercial Accounts of the Post Officethe majority report and the minority report. it is not one that can be airily and conI quote from paragraph 65 of the majority clusively disposed of by somebody putting report appearing at page 17. It statesThe reason for this view is conceptually a very simple one. It is that the use of interest-free about this method: The Government can money is worth something in addition to the charge interest and erect a theory about why money itself: that is to say, the recipient of an it charges interest. Equally, without fracadvance obtains a financial advantage greater than the amount of the advance. In other words, if turing any accounting principles, it could interest is not chargeable on an advance, an be suggested that because the money comes advantage is obtained by the recipient at the out of taxation in the first place and the expense of the provider. It follows that the nonGovernment is collecting more revenue in charging of interest on any part of the net advances that have been provided to the Post Office would taxes than it requires, it would be justimean, for the purpose of Term of Reference 1 (a), fied in meeting the cost out of such revenue the conferring of an advantage on the Post Office and waiving interest charges. In fact, over transferring a cost from the Post Office to the If the Post Office had obtained itsfinancefrom some financier other than Treasury, it would have been required to pay interest. Government obtained the capital from someother than the Treasury it would have had to pay interest. But of course the means that it now loads on to the Post only one possible argument and I suggest the other point of view. I suggest there are two points of view",21,Telephone Services
58,Mr Cleaver,That concept is out of date.,23,Telephone Services
59,Mr Crean,"It is not out of date. Ithe past IS years this Government has provided for all capital works of the Commonwealth out of revenue with very few small exceptions. These exceptions appeared in some years when it did not choose to tax as heavily as it might. But what the Government has done with the Post Office is different from what would be done, for example, in the case of the user of a road. The Government has said, in effect, that it will treat the Post Office like a private undertaking that has to make a profit and it will charge the Post Office interest on the money it requires. To come to the other point of view, 1 shall quote paragraph 27 of the minority report found at page 54 of the reports I have cited. It statesFor our purposes, it is sufficient to say that interest may, in the context with which we are concerned, be treated as the price which the owner can exact from the user for the use of money. When the community, as taxpayers, provides money for the community, as Post Office customers, it is a matter of judgment whether a price for the use of the money should be exacted from the customers. Such judgment must be constantly exercised upon wise principles in future. WhatI am trying to suggest is that so far as Parliament as a whole is concerned the judgment is not being exercised with any wisdom at all. There can be neither logic nor theory to justify altering retrospectively the judgments on this matter currently charged. I suggest that even here that have been made in the past. For this reason, we think that the theoretical contentions referred to in paragraph 65 of the majority report should be carefully assessed. We should add that there cannot be any ready-made rule of "" business practice"" by which the charge for interest can be determined in the case of a national service. That is the point I throw back at the honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver). 1 repeat it because he was not here when I read it previously. We should add that there cannot be any readymade rule of "" business practice"" by which the charge for interest can be determined in the case of a national service. So far I have only put the view about the should be made progressively as is rent and capital side of the provision for the telephone as a component. I suggest that there is a section of the Post Office and by those quotacase for that to be done. Other countries, tions I have tried to suggest that at least just as we have, have a rent component there are two views on this matter. At the and the charge for calls. Some countries moment, of course, the Government has charge a higher rent and exempt a certain chosen the other view to prevail although it number of calls. I am not too sure that, made a very quick conversion. I quote what in view of the greater extent to which the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) trunk lines are now used, the time has not said at the Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in March 1959. He saidThe proposition is that we charge ourselves interest, we throw into deficit a couple of great undertakings that have been referred to, and we then raise the wind in order to meet that deficitbecause it all comes back onto us. Therefore, charging ourselves interest is merely a complicated piece of book-keeping that does not produce one pennyworth of financial results. That was the view of the Prime Minister in March that year but five months later, in August, the Treasurer chose to change it. also changed his views. member for Swan has made this charge before. I think that if he reads the report of Public Accounts Committee fairly he will find that this was a question that we set aside for future consideration. I agreed that the matter ought to be set aside but I did not agree with the presumption that the interest ought to be charged. I still do not agree with it. I think it is fantastic crazy book-keeping that does not give a pennyworth of result. In fact, it puts a charge of £25 million on the community for no regular reason at all. But to get back to the other side, I want to speak about the way that telephones are there can be some differences of opinion as there are different methods of paying for the services. There are three payments made for the telephone at the moment. There is what is called an installation charge made to new subscribers. This was not previously charged. It is a new form of costing as far as the telephone is concerned and was developed in the last few years. Some people, whilst not objecting to a charge being made, suggest that it should be amortised over a period and that the subscriber should not have to pay £5. £10 or £15 in a lump sum but that the charge",23,Telephone Services

In relation to the Post Office it was believed in years gone byI think it still finds acceptance in the community as it would in the Parliament-that it was desirable that there should be provided something better than a mere cash document and we therefore instituted commercial accounts in the Post Office. One will appreciate that with a couple of million telephone accounts and with the many obligations which have been undertaken towards the end of the financial year, it is desirable in regard to both receipts and expenditure that there should be accruals at the end of the year so that the year's accounts take into account those at the beginning of the year and those at the end, so that the real economic result for the year is presented. I believe it is impossible under our Constitution to do other than to present to the Parliament, in the Treasury document, anything more than cash accounts. Therefore the commercial statement must be a supplementary document. But I feel that both documents are prepared in such a way that they are very easily understood by anybody who sets about a study of them. I think the actual statement of profit and loss and the balance sheet and the notes which accompany them and the explanations which are given in the annual report give members of Parliament and members of the public a pretty clear picture of the accounts of the Post Office. I now come to the motion which is before the House, lt requires three things: First, the appointment of a joint select committee. Then it requires tha' the select conimittee shall have regard to two things. It shall inquire into and report upon the methods by which the working expenses of the telephone services can be most fairly and efficiently met and upon the methods by which the capital expenditure on telephone services can be most fairly and efficiently met. I believe that if this is to be accepted it might be expected that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would have proved that there is something wrong at the present time; that there is something unfair in what is being done in the charges or in the preparation of accounts; that there is inefficiency within this total operation or that there are better and improved methods which should be instituted. I do not think that this has been proven by what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said this morning. As I said earlier, I think that most of his argument centred upon the question of whether or not interest should be charged. This is a philosophical argument in which the Government has one philosophy and the Opposition has another. We can argue this in the Parliament. There is no need to appoint representatives from this side of the Parliament and from that side to disagree in a committee. Let us have the disagreement, which has already existed for years, within the Parliament itself. Let us agree to disagree in regard to this matter. It was not first determined in the Parliament. It was a suggestion from the Public Accounts Committee some years ago that this matter ought to be looked at. The Government accepted the recommendation of the Committee and appointed Sir Alexander Fitzgerald as chairman of a committee of inquiry. That committee presented a report and the Government accepted the recommendation contained in the report. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports says that this was only a majority view, three to two. Does he suggest that if this matter were discussed by a select committee of the Parliament there would be a unanimous decision on it? I will bet guineas to gooseberries that it would be the Opposition on one side and the Government on the other side as members of such a committee making a recommendation to the Parliament. know the result in advance? in advance. But the extraordinary thing is that once again we find that the Labour Party in this Parliament is completely opposed to the views of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom because, if honourable members undertake a study of the bases of the operations of the Post Office in the United Kingdom, they will find that the Labour Party there accepts not only that there should be an interest charge debited against the user of Post Office facilities, particularly the telephone, but also that there should be over and above that interest charge an income return of something like 8 per cent.",25,Telephone Services

68,Mr Hulme,"We do know the result1960. Labour Party. If that is the situation, why is there objection-apparentl y real objection -by the Labour Party in Australia to this charge for interest against the user of the service? The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that if the money were borrowed outside of the Treasury it would be reasonable that the user of the telephone should pay the interest charge. to meet. which we have to meet. meet costs it should meet. Is that what the Minister is saying? or two sections, as the honourable member presented the matter. The cost has to be met either by the taxpayer, who in many instances does not use other than a public telephone, or by the telephone subscriber. We say in relation to the use of a public telephone that the user will pay something more than the normal unit call fee. The user pays 6d. instead of the normal 4d. and is in fact making a contribution, ln the final wash up of this matter, it is a case of whether taxation is increased to cover this cost or whether the user of the facility meets it. The net result is that in the 1963-64 financial year when there was a demand on the Treasury for £20 millionI wiil deal in roundfigures-the total amount shown for capital works was £68 million. Interest amounted to £23 million and depreciation to £25 million. The demand on the Treasury was for a net amount of £20 million. If interest is excluded as a debit against the user of the telephone then not £20 million but £43 million is required from the taxpayer in increased taxation. To take the estimate for the current financial year on which we have just embarked, of the £90 million provided, £30 million will be required for interest charges, £34 million for depreciation charges, and £26 million net from the Treasury. If we add to the latter amount the £30 million for interest, we arrive at a figure of £56 million which has to be provided by the general taxpayer. I am prepared to argue with anybody the complete justification of charging the user with the cost of the thing which he is in fact using. This seems to me, as I said earlier, a matter of simple philosophy. This is the philosophy we accept. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has presented the philosophy which the Opposition accepts. AllI can say is that while we are in government it is our philosophy which will be applied. Doubtless when the party of which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is a member is in government, it will be its philosophy which will be applied. I think it is better for us to agree to differ rather than to waste time appointing a select committee. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has suggested that we might have a look at the tariff structure. We have already done so. It will be remembered that, last year, there were considerable adjustments in the tariff structure. At 1st October, before they were altered last year, there were 20 basic categories and in each of those categories four types of telephone were available at differing rentals. So, there were overall 80 different categories. This number we reduced to nine categories. I believe that this was the introduction of-to use the word which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports used this morningefficiency into the structure. If we go back to 1949, before this Government came to office, we find that there were 128 rental categories within the telephone operations of the Post Office. I believe that this was real inefficiency. We have given our mind to this aspect to produce a much more efficient system of administration and one which is more easily understood by the public. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred to the New Zealand system also. This system is not exclusive to New Zealand. It applies in some other countries in the world. It is a system by which there is a basic rental charge plus local call fees according to whether it is based on total local calls or on a certain number of local calls covering a particular six-monthly period. But what should be remembered in making this sort of approach to the matter is the size of Australia and the population of Australia. As I have indicated in this",26,Telephone Services

74,Mr Hulme,"There is a cost to oneHouse before, the size of New Zealand can be shown by taking a stretch of our country between Brisbane and Melbourne extending 200 miles in from the seaboard. That is New Zealand. Australia is a tremendous area with a small population. If we were to have this type of operation-and because local call fees would be free up to a certain point at least-ther e would be a greater requirement for switching equipment or capital equipment. If we were to implement such a system at this time, I believe there would be a trebling or a quadrupling of the engaged signals which people get when they use telephones. If we were to implement that system at this point of time, I think1 say this without time to examine the matter fully here and now-ther e would be a tremendous complaint from the public. If we were trying to have this system in operation in two years, three years or five years, we would have to increase probably by £20 million a year the actual capital requirement. So, I say that this matter has been investigated and that it has been found not to be capable of implementation within the structure of the Australian Post Office at the present time. We believe that the first thing we should consider is a modern system and that the maximum number of people should have a telephone rather than that money should be spent in giving such a service to fewer people although it may perhaps meet their purse a little better. But there is within this system something which must be basically understood. It is that if there is a charge covering rental and so many calls, the person who is not a frequent user of the telephone is subsidising the person who is a frequent user. This is avoided by our system because the user pays a rental charge and then pays for each service. I have seen accounts for 25s. for six months' calls and I have seen other accounts, as I am sure other honourable members have, which run into hundreds of pounds. The small user must subsidise the large user in this kind of scheme. So, Sir, I believe that this morning we have not been encouraged to believe that there is any justification for condemning or criticising the Post Office over the way third way. in which we are meeting the capital needs or the way in which we are meeting the working expenses. As I have understood the raise capital in several ways. Having availdiscussion, the only working expense that is able the depreciation reserve we are using, under criticism is the interest charge. There is no question of whether we should charge for the liability in relation to furlough or the liability in relation to superannuation, or of whether we should charge for depreciation on assets. Only one working expense is criticised. Yet this criticism is put on the broad basis of the methods by which all the working expenses are charged. As I have said, there is a suggestion of criticism or comment only in relation to interest. I suggest that the motion is badly worded if this is the only point that is to be tackled. The other point that arises relates to capital. I know of only two or three ways by which we can raise the capital required for an operation such as this, Sir. Either you can get it from the Government through the Treasury or you can go out into the public market and compete with the Commonwealth when it is seeking to raise loan money for the States, and compete also with local government authorities and semi governmental authorities in the States. I do not think that there would be any advocacy in this place for that course. that, of course. interest on what is costing it nothing. which the honourable member has an argument, and on which he bases the whole of his submission, is interest. Why does not the motion mention interest instead of dealing with total capital and total expense operations? interest to provide one third of its capital. raising capital, because this is what the motion deals with. You can get capital only from the Treasury or on the public market, or you can do as the British do. They seek to get it from additional profits over and above the interest charge that they make.",27,Telephone Services

I believe that this is a very sensible approach to the problem. I say in conclusion, Sir, as I said at the sible to determine when one will be able beginning: This is a question of philosophy; to say that an applicant will be able to get a and that is all it is. The argument has been telephone within, say, three months, six before the public for many years. It has months or one year of application. been considered by a special committee under the chairmanship of a person who was selected by the Government as a man as it is usually approached in the Parliament whose competence and ability as chairman and as I myself have had to approach it would not be under criticism. That comseveral times over the years-fro m the mittee made a recommendation. Admittedly, standpoint of where telephones are most in the report was a majority one. But I think it demand or where the supply of telephones would be almost impossible to find a comis most deficient. If we approach the mittee that would make a unanimous report problem of supplying telephones on this unless its members were all from one side basis, all we are doing is to discuss a of the Parliament. Do we say that we reject rationing scheme. The public does not want the report because it was only a majority us to concern ourselves with rationing a report? If this principle were to be adopted service which is in short supply. The public in relation to reports received, we would expects us to supply a service which the never accept the recommendations of comCommonwealth Government is responsible mittees, because so many recommendations for providing. made to the Parliament on various matters are in fact majority recommendations. I suggest that there is no justification for the or ideological issue. In Britain, telephone House agreeing to the motion, and I ask services have always been provided by the honourable members to reject it. Mr Deputy Speaker, the motion is not States, they have been provided by the designed to condemn the Post Office or to national Government. This is not a question condemn the Postmaster-General( Mr on which we should be deciding whether it Hulme). The Minister has taken far too would be better to have this kind of utility narrow a view of the use of the words conducted wholly by private enterprises as "" fairly and efficiently "" in the motion.

This is what the motion is should engage in competition. A great numdesigned to achieve. My colleague, the ber of members of the Parliament, particuhonorable member for Melbourne Ports larly on our side, now suggest that when ( Mr Crean), who proposed the motion, the some activity is carried on by corporations Minister, the honourable member for Swan or private individuals, there is merit in hav( Mr Cleaver), who is Chairman of the ing public competition with the private Public Accounts Committee and who will operators.

Frankly, Government's supplying all the telephone after thirteen years as a member of this services in Australia and for the proposition Parliament, I cannot understand why it that it is illegal in Australia for anybody seems every year that more people are waiting for telephones than were waiting in the previous year and why, in this field of government activity, it is impossible to say when the backlog will be met and imposI do not want to approach this question I do not approach this as a philosophical national Government. In Australia, for more than 50 years, since the Commonwealth took over such services from the",28,Telephone Services
83,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [12.9],"else to provide a telephone service and that this position is to continue. Moreover, we all ought to be concerned with the fact that this government monopoly is not meeting the public demand. In the past, I have acknowledged in this House, outside it in public, and in private, that the Postmaster-General's Department is now administered by a man of very great skill and experience. The first Liberal Postmaster-General for years has more experience in commercial and economic matters than has been possessed by any persons who have held his position for a long time past. Undoubtedly, therefore, within the limits of the concepts which have applied until now, the Department will be administered as efficiently and justly as possible. I am certain that the present Minister does as good a job as anybody in this House could do within the limits of the concepts that at present govern the administration of the Department. It is the concepts which have to be broadened. There are officers in his Department who are very gravely concerned about the Department's inability to meet the demand. It is not too much to say that the morale of a very great numberI believe the majority -of members of this Department at all levels is gravely affected by the insinuation by the public that they are inefficient. Indeed, the insinuation is sometimes made that they are corrupt. These insinuations are always made about any Government department which administers in a state of shortage. The officers of this Department are honourable, efficient and dedicated men. It is unfortunate that there is a colossal turnreasonable or impracticable proposition? It over in the Department and that there is a tremendous wastage at some levels and particularly in the Telephone Branch. But it is not the fault of the officers of the Department that they cannot meet the demand for telephones; that they cannot fulfil the obligations of this Government monopoly. Many officers in the Treasury are also gravely concerned about this position in the Postmaster-General's Department. They are not officers at the top level, admittedly, because most officers at that level are too set in their ways. Some are still pre-Keynesian. They were brilliant students in the 1920's. But there is a new generation of Treasury officers who are gravely concerned about the position in the Postmaster-General's Department. As one of the lay members of this Parliament, I think I am entitled to express the misgivings that the public has and that most of the Parliament have. I shall point out, with the aid of a few statistics, the position which has arisen. There are now in Australia at least 50,000 families or businesses waiting for telephones. It is impossible for them to know, in general, when they will be able to get a telephone. As things go, in a year's time there will be more waiting, despite the fact that for the current year, as in the year just concluded, there has been an increased allocation for capital works in this Department. telephones at the end of June of this year than were waiting at the end of June last year. that. Mr HulmeI expect a similar result this year. could say when we shall end a year with no applicants waiting. timetable so that we shall know that an applicant will be able to get a telephone in three months or six months. Is this an unis not regarded as unreasonable or impracticable in any other country. If one must be ideological in this matter, one can point out that in America, where private enterprise provides the telephones, an applicant never has to wait as long as he does in Australia. This is not because public enterprise is less efficient than private enterprise; it is because in Australia public expenditure can always and private expenditure can only rarely be regulated by governments and, in the case of housing and telephones, it has been regulated more than in any other case, although from time to time the motor industry also has been regulated because it depends on credit.",29,Telephone Services

More money than is being provided this year could not be used there even if it were available. considerable problem but yesterday the Minister agreed in an answer to the honourable member for St. George( Mr Bosman) that 61 per cent, of the people waiting for telephones in Australia resided in New South Wales. The Minister did not say, although I believe it is a fact, that 48 per cent, of those waiting for telephones in Australia are in the Sydney metropolitan area. I was provoked to speak on the Estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department last year by the fact that he said in answer to questions about the waiting period and the waiting list for telephones that New South Wales was getting a larger allocation for telephones in the year just ended than any other State. One would expect this on the basis of population alone. the others were given; it was 40 per cent, of the total. ter said 37 per cent., but even then I should think that if 60 per cent, of the people waiting for telephones live in New South Wales, the allocation of 40 per cent, to New South Wales would not bring the applicants in that State into parity with those in the the other States. Let me be parochial now. this problem because I do not think we staff to do this work. We cannot just pick up vices from the point of view of rationing. I technical staff at a moment's notice.

I know that this is a difficulty. But the Minister put it also on the basis that in Sydney, because there cing of telephones is that the persons who is a harbour in the middle of the city and use the service should pay for them. They because the city is built on rock, it costs more to install telephones. For the same reason it costs more in Sydney to install water, sewerage, electricity or any other utility. In no State Department and in no other Commonwealth Department would the argument be tolerated that because terrain makes installation more expensive the people must wait longer for facilities. I am not saying that telephones are as essential as water or electricity, or as important as sewerage. Nevertheless, telephones are an essential utility. These days, business and families should not have to tolerate the inability to install telephones which applies particularly in Sydney and to a lesser extent in Melbourne. Let me illustrate-parochially , if you like the extent of the delay. I quote from an answer which was given 12 months ago to the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson). In New South Wales there were four electorates in which more than 2,000 people were waiting for telephones. They were the electorates of Werriwa, Mitchell, Hughes and Mackellar. Several other electorates had waiting lists of more than 1,000. They were the electorates of Banks, Lang, Parramatta, Reid and Robertson. In Victoria, three electorates had more than 1,000 waiting. I refer to the electorates of Bruce, Lalor and Flinders. In no other electorate in any State was there a waiting list of more than a few hundred. In the Minister's own State, in most cases the numbers waiting were in the mere tens. I do not want to take a parochial view of accepts the position-that there must always be a shortage of telephones in any part of in Australia, every business and every family that wants a telephone, can have a My own simple attitude towards the finan-",30,Telephone Services

I adopt that attitude on the very simple thesis that every man's telephone is more valuable to him if more people have a telephone. The more people who can ring a subscriber or whom a subscriber can ring, thc more valuable the telephone is to that subscriber. I do not want to engage in any philosophical argument about interest. I am baffled, frankly, to hear why interest should have to be paid on moneys provided for public buildings such as schools. I am baffled to know why hospitals should be in this category and I do not see why transport should have to be in this category. In all these cases-public transport, public schools or hospitalsthc money comes from taxation. To a certain extent, so far as the States are concerned, Ihey are financed from loans, but even loans are usually filled from taxation. That is, the money is raised and spent once ancl for all. Why do we have to go through the motion of paying interest on it in the future? a telephone for everybody who wants one, In fairness, I can certainly understand the necessity, say, where electricity is generated by a public authority and gas is generated by a private authority which has to borrow money or pay a dividend. I can understand that in such circumstances one has to impose interest on the public authority. Again, I can understand that where there is a Commonwealth authority, like the Snowy Mountains Authority, which is financed out of taxation, producing electricity and a State public authority producing electricity from buildings for which loans have been made by the Commonwealth and must be paid back to the Commonwealth, one has to include interest so as not to distort the relative cost of producing hydroelectricity as against thermal electricity. I can understand all these matters, but why do we have to pay interest on money which is found from taxation and from charges? Frankly, I cannot understand why we do it. the quantum of money you have available. I would like to make with the telephones is roads. Most of the cost of roads in Australia member's time has expired. -certainl y the cost of all the main roadscomes from the petrol tax. We may not equate it technically that way, but it is debate I wish to direct certain matters to within I per cent, or 2 per cent. We never say that the amount which comes from the petrol tax and is put into roads has to be paid back to the Commonwealth or has to earn interest for the Government. Why should we say it in regard to telephones? The simple, ingenuous and naive proposition I make is that people who subscribe to telephones should meet the amount which is required to instal and maintain them. Looking at the figures, roughly there would not be much difference in that from what they pay already. The £20 million, roughly, which is levied in interest, the one fifth of the cost of running the service, which the Minister has described, does not appear in the Budget. The public is frustrated, in the same way as members of Parliament from the electorates which I have mentioned are frustrated, by the fact that this Government monopoly is not meeting public demand. If we say that, because of the requirements of defence or development or social welfare, the country cannot afford the indulgence of and if we say that some people do not need telephones, where are we to draw the line? Are we to say the same thing about other things which have proliferated in the last ten or thirty years? Are we to say that people do not need as many motor cars, that they do not need as many refrigerators? Are we therefore to say: "" Do not supply the roads which they need for the motor cars, and do not supply the electricity that they need for the refrigerators.""? Are we to squeeze people out in this way? roads vve want. have got we have financed from the petrol tax. People need telephones and they are entitled to get them. I have suggested a way in which this can be fairly and efficiently, done.

Then he moved on clear that he did not agree with the majority to speak about the method of running the report that was embodied in the docuPost Office. That is inherent in the motion ment. He referred to the minority report that he moved this morning. He criticised as a wishy-washy document. It was quite the theoretical approach of the businessmen apparent that he did not agree with the two in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of members of the Committee who signed the Inquiry. He drew a comparison between the minority report. I suggest that it is apparent three businessmen who presented the that the honourable member wanted no majority section of the report and the modernisation in the accounting system of businessmen who presented the minority the Post Office. This is rather amazing when section. one looks at his background as a public accountant. He advocated the concept that the Post Office be a public utility. This truly those businessmen on this job of inquiring is amazing. The honourable member fails to into the commercial accounts of the Post recognise that the use of the Post Office is Office. In my opinion the efficiency and not uniform throughout the community. The development of the Post Office are due to it large corporations and businesses using the being treated as a commercial and business facilities of the Post Office so extensively undertaking in the Estimates. From the should surely make equitable contributions. remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Here we have the honourable member, who is Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) and the honourable a dedicated Socialist, wanting it to be a member for Melbourne Ports this morning, public utility giving the maximum service at one would think that the Post Office simply the minimum cost. He wants to apply a is not regarded in the Estimates as a business uniform cost to all within the community. undertaking. One only has to make a quick I think it is pertinent to refer to page 20, paragraph 96 of the Committee's report of 1961, where a view that had been put before it was expressed in this wayThis view assumes that taxpayers are identical with consumers of Post Office services and that, therefore, taxpayers receive a benefit from the investment of taxation receipts in the Post Office if they obtain Post Office services at less than cost. Such a view is, however, untenable. Almost every taxpayer is a consumer of Post Office services, services, and the amount they pay for them, vary greatly from individual to individual. Likewise, so do taxes paid vary from individual to individual. However, there is no correspondence, except fortuitously, between the relative taxes paid by individuals and the relative use by individuals of Post Office services. Now1 turn, not to what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said in the debate in 1961, but to what he said in the debate on postal and telephone rates in October last year. We find that he came back to this interest component in commercial accounting, which formed the substance of the speech that he made this morning. He then asked for maximum service at a minimum cost and he spoke-thi s was a strange term to come from the lips of my friend-of a rough equality between income received from Post Office services and expenditure incurred. He indicated that all Thank goodness the Government had",32,Telephone Services
101,Mr Speaker,Order! As it is now,33,Telephone Services
102,Mr Cleaver,"The honourable memreference to the documents that we received on Tuesday night to see that it is so classified. The Government does not accept the Socialist view that the Post Office should be a pure public utility, with the dangers of efficiency declining and the cost to the taxpayers continually increasing. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, not content with his speech in early October, came up again in late October of last year when he moved for the disallowance of a regulation regarding increases in telephone charges. He then referred to the commercial accounts of the Post Office. It was apparent from his remarks that he did not like the. operating loss of £1.6 million, as revealed in those accounts. The interest charge of about £22 million in respect.of the telephone section did not please him either. He asked for a different method of accounting which would omit that interest charge. From all of his contributions to which I have referred, we see that increased charges by the Post Oflice under any circumstances are virtually anathema to him. As a good Socialist, he believes that the Post Office and all of its communications facilities should be run at an ever-increasing deficit. The Government will never concur in that. He hopes that on every occasion the Commonwealth Budget can provide the milions of pounds to cover the losses that might accrue from a public utility whose efficiency would decline. I know that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is a generous fellow. We are good friends. I also know that his party looks upon him as a future Treasurer. What a Treasurer he would make in a Labour government if he adhered to this regular and consistent approach, this Socialist approach, to a business undertaking of the magnitude of the Australian Post Office. I am concerned about his shifting ground. He was a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1954 when the whole of the Post Office was reviewed by that Parliamentary Committee. Without making any request in the printed report, he was a party to the Committee sayingThe Committee cannot over-emphasise the importance of comprehensive commercial accounts, and it has constantly used them for evaluating the results of the Department as a whole, as well as for the branches in each State. It seems to the Committee that the Department has not used the accounts for a similar purpose. The honourable member was a member of the Committee which, when dealing with capital, interest and exchange charges, saidThe amount of capital of the Postmaster General's Department to be included in its Commercial Accounts should be determined without delay. The present basis of charges for interest on capital in the Commercial Accounts of the Postmaster-General's Department has long been anomalous. He also was a party to a request that this matter should be reviewed, quite urgently, by the committee that was proposed. This morning in answer to an interjection that I made, he said that he did not deny that; but that he was not a party to fhe actual findings. However, he must have concluded that any sensible committee would come up with a conclusion that the capital of the Post Office must be clearly defined for the first time in the' history of the Federation and that upon that capital there should, of course, be this notional interest charged. inherent in the report. So, today, the commercial accounts stand as the very basis upon which this business undertaking operates. The Commonwealth says: "" In respect of this Department we have used all commercial methods of calculating costs in order to ascertain whether it has made a profit or a loss "". Likewise, in other departments we can see whether we are operating profitably or otherwise. The Government and its advisers now turn to the commercial accounts knowing that for the first time they can calculate whether public charges should be increased or even reduced according to fluctuations in the profit or loss. For those reasons I am concerned that my friend, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, constantly comes up with this accusation that the interest charge is unsound. I believe that he wants afixedBudget provision for the Post Office established for some period ahead. I note that in his speeches he has indicated that. He speaks of flexibility in one breath, but then claims that all rates should be inflexible. I believe",33,Telephone Services
103,Mr Crean,That is not in the report.,34,Telephone Services
104,Mr Cleaver,"Of course it is. It is that in a changing world and in respect of a vast undertaking such as the Post Office he is fundamentally wrong. I wonder whether, under his scheme, the Post Office would have fared as well as it has in the Government's Budgets for capital works in recent years. Let me point out the very high votes that have been achieved by the Government. In 1963-64 the vote for Post Office capital works was £78 million; in the following year it was £71 million; last year it moved up to £80 million; and we noted with approval that in the Budget presented on Tuesday night it is £92 million. I venture to suggest that if the honourable member and his group had had their way some years ago and had fixed a forward plan, it would have been very easy for a government to say: "" We have attended to the Post Office. We have looked forward. We have budgeted at the requested rate "". I do not think we would have seen such a substantial increase as we see in this year's Budget. The capital of the Post Office, as shown in the latest commercial accounts, now stands at £581 million. That has been provided by governments over the years. As that is the figure established because the recommendation of an independent committee, sensibly, was accepted by the Government, that is the figure on which interest charges are now calculated at a fair interest rate. Every strategy of common and modern business methods is used to ascertain the correct charge that the people of sidering Australia should make. I believe that it records. would be quite out of context for business This motion needs only very brief explanapeople as well as householders to be asked tion. It is quite obvious that the Committee, to pay today for Post Office facilities an when undertaking its present inquiry, may arbitrary figure which was far out of date wish to have the power that is sought. In because of inflationary trends and not in accordance with practice, I have proposed line with the cost that other business this motion for the concurrence of the organisations must meet. So, the motion that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has moved this morning, for the appointment of a Joint Select Committee, simply is not justified and is not acceptable. Its purpose is political. It would take out of the hands of the Government the management of this tremendous believes that the Post Office should remain a government department, just as it is in the -Foreign Affairs-Ministeria l Statement, 18th United Kingdom under a Socialist governAugust 1965.

Indeed, in most essentia] respects it is, and ought to be recognised as-and function as a commercial organisation. If, after allowing for its social responsibilities, it fails to approach the problems of management and organisation with a business mind it will quickly become inefficient.

Although his views may not have been shared by many members of the Australian Labour Party, his speech showed an independence of thought which faced up to many of the real issues that confront this nation. I commend him for his independent thinking and his statement to the House. There is no indication when this cruel subversive war in Vietnam will end. Australians, together with most other peoples of the world, are desirous that a peaceful settlement, preferably by negotiation, should be achieved. Ultimate victory by either side as a result of armed combat will cost many additional lives and will cause untold hardship of the parties concerned. It is for the purpose of obtaining peace by negotiation that several attempts have been made from many sources to have discussions with the North Vietnamese and Hanoi. But all have proved to be fruitless. In spite of the numerous rebuffs that tbe United States of America has had she is still, as always, ready to negotiate a fair and just peace. It is well worthwhile to recall the statement made by President Johnson on 7th April last. To my mind, in that statement he defined quite clearly the purpose of the United States in Vietnam. I can do no better than to quote that statement. The President saidOur objective is the independence of South Vietnam and its freedom from attack. We want nothing for ourselves-onl y that the people of South Vietnam be allowed to guide their own country in their own way. We will do everything necessary to reach that objective and we will do only what is absolutely necessary. . . . the only path for reasonable men is the path of peaceful settlement. Such peace demands an independent South Vietnam-securel y guaranteed and able to shape its own relationships to all others-fre e from outside interference-tie d to no alliancea military base for no other country. These are the essentials of anyfinalsettlement. We will never be second in the search for such a peaceful settlement in South Vietnam. These are worthy principles. They are worthy of a nation of the calibre of the United States of America, and I am proud that our Government is wisely supporting them. Approaches have been made to the North Vietnamese to confer on peace. It is worth recalling some of the efforts that have already been mentioned in debate, because there seems to be a section of the community that is too prone to obliterate the many calls for peace that have been made by several nations. On numerous occasions efforts have been made to confer with the North Vietnamese and other interested parties. Among them was an attempt b.y the British Foreigh Minister, Mr Stewart, the Co-chairman of the Geneva Conference with Mr Gromyko. Mr Stewart suggested to the Soviet that all the facts of the conflict should be circulated to interested powers and that those powers should be asked for their ideas as to how settlement might be obtained. The Soviet Government was not prepared to act. Further, Mr Stewart sought a conference on Laos in hope that this may lead to a better understanding among the powers interested in South East Asia. He did not receive a reply to his request. He then attempted to arrange a conference on Cambodia. Britain and the United States were eager that this conference should take place, but again no favorable response came from the Soviets. Honourable members know of the appeal of the 17 non-aligned nations that was made on 15th June last. Non-aligned nations are those which are not committed to support either side.",35,Internationa L Affairs
108,Motion (By Mr Hasluck),by leave,36,Internationa L Affairs
109,Mr Aston (Phillip) [2.17],"I shouldthe term for the honourable member's benefit. Those nations put forward an appeal for discussions without pre-conditions, but this was denounced by Hanoi and Peking. At the recent conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, the British Prime Minister voiced a proposal to find a basis on which the parties would be prepared to enter into discussions. Both Peking and Hanoi derided those proposals. On 8th July Mr Harold Davies, a British Minister, visited Hanoi to try to induce the Government there to receive the Commonwealth mission. Again, his request was rejected. In April the British Government sent Mr Gordon Walker to visit Communist China and North Vietnam. He was not received. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, stands ready at all times to use his good offices to find a peaceful solution, but not even his help is welcomed. North Vietnam refused an invitation to take part in the peace of the whole world. I believe that the discussions of the Security Council after the incident in the Gulf of Tonkin. On 1st August the Prime Minister of India submitted a proposal for a cease fire. Discussion on rhese matters was rejected. The reluctance to discuss peace is on one decision is not a departure from our tradiside only, and the only conclusion to be tional role; it is in line with our history. We drawn is that North Vietnam and China have fought in two great wars alongside our believe that they will obtain their objective allies as a small nation determined to mainby military means in their quest to subjugate tain the principles of international law and South Vietnam and the whole of South East to protect the territorial rights of nations.

Vietnam, without American aid by all the non-Communist countries in Asia and assistance from other nations, would and elsewhere and, in effect, would leave have been lost already to the Communist nothing to negotiate or on which to confer. cause. It is the determined intention to upPast history has shown us that security canhold these traditional principles that has not be obtained by throwing a small state strengthened our will to stop the ever or country to the wolves or, in this case, to spreading growth of Communism in South the Red dragon. If this were to occur South East Asia and, at the same time, to assist Vietnam would never again regain her indethe Vietnamese people to attain a true pendent status or respect. Gone would be independence. her right to self-determination and in its place her people would be subjected to Communist control and domination and her freedom would be lost. She would have a Communist government imposed upon her by North Vietnam and Pekinga government not chosen by the people of South Vietnam-and Red China would have advanced considerably in her territorial desire to dominate South East Asia. If this were to be achieved, one would be entitled to ask in what direction would the next thrust be and which country would be next. It is my assessment that what happens in Asia now is of greater importance to Australia's eventual security than to that of any other nation, for if South Vietnam were to fall it would necessitate a complete rethinking by all other Asian countries of their foreign policies and their defence commitments, and the political future of South East Asia would, for certain, become more unstable and, consequently, endanger the Government's decision to send troops to Vietnam has the support of the Australian people. The decision was not made lightly but only after a very thorough assessment of the facts and our obligations under the South East Asia Treaty Organisation. The China's ambitions are just as potent as",36,Internationa L Affairs
110,Mr Peters,They are not aligned.,37,Internationa L Affairs
111,Mr Aston,"I thought I should explainIf we were to be attacked we would expect our friends in the S.E.A.T.O. pact to act as we have acted. We would expect them to honour their obligations. Our very existence as a free nation could well depend on how swiftly they responded to our request. The reported belligerence of President Sukarno to America-and he has warned America to get out of South East Asia-make s the fulfilment of obligations by all S.E.A.T.O. members the more important. If America is forced out of this area it will be tantamount to forcing Australia out as well. President Sukarno should be aware that if be assists in forcing America out of South East Asia he will be forcing Australia out with her. There is no half way mark. I was interested to read in the Melbourne ""Sun News-Pictorial"" of 28th May last a statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) thatIf S.E.A.T.O. was invoked the Labour movement would support Australia's obligations. If we needed assistance we would get it. If other people needed assistance they could rely on the fact that they would get it and we would support it. There is nothing whatever wrong with this statement. I agree with it and have no quarrel with it, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition continued by saying-and this is where he made his mistakeBut no request has come under S.E.A.T.O let the lie be nailed. These are stong words from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It was a rather strange statement from this learned gentleman who poses in this House as an authority on most matters. I believe that the S.E.A.T.O. treaty has been invoked. On 8th May 1965 at the S.E.A.T.O. conference Vietnam was unanimously declared to be a protocol state. At the ninth meeting of the S.E.A.T.O. Council the Council expressed grave concern about Communist aggression against the Republic of Vietnam a protocol state-unde r the terms of the Manila Pact. There can be no mistake. Further, the Council agreed that the members of S.E.A.T.O. should remain prepared to take further concrete steps, if necessary, within their respective capabilities in fulfilment of their obligations under the treaty. In the same newspaper article the Deputy Leader saidAmerica doesn't say her troops are there under S.E.A.T.O. Here again I believe he is remiss, because in 1964 a resolution passed by the House of Representatives in the United States of America in Congress assembled statedConsonant with the Constitution and the Charter of the United Nations and in accord with its obligations under the South East Asia collective defence treaty, the United States is therefore prepared, as the President determines, to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the South East Asia collective defence treaty requesting assistance in defence of its freedom. It is quite clear that the United States regards Vietnam as a protocol state and that S.E.A.T.O. regards Vietnam as a protocol state. Further, in this very House in 1962, Sir Garfield Barwick pointed out that the responsibilities under the S.E.A.T.O. treaty can be carried out collectively or individually. He used the words: "" Since this treaty obligation is individual as well as collective"". To my mind it is clear that any protocol State within the S.E.A.T.O. framework upon request from a country that is being attacked, in the terms of Article5 of the S.E.A.T.O. treaty may fulfil its obligations either individually or severally by providing assistance to the country asking for assistance. This is what Australia has done; this is what America has done. If the Deputy Leader is sincere in saying that if S.E.A.T.O. were invoked the Labour movement would support Australia's obligations, I believe he should use what influence he may have left within his Party not only to win support for his own statement but to ensure that Australia may be politically united in what I believe to be a correct and just cause. It is apparent that S.E.A.T.O. has been invoked. Does this now mean that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will support the Government as he has stated, or will he deny the reported statement? In the last session of this Parliament there were suggestions from the Opposition that the Government did not advise the United Nations of Australia's action in sending troops to South Vietnam. I think the record should be put straight. I point out that the President of the Security Council of the United Nations was advised by our Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) on 4th May this year-and the date is important-of Australia's actions in the following termsI have the honour to inform you that the Australian Government has decided to despatch forces to South Vietnam in order to assist in securing its Asia who have seen the poor conditions defence against the hostile activities including armed under which the people there live must sit attacks (Article4 of the S.E.A.T.O. Treaty), which have been supported, organised and directed by up and wonder, and say: "" If these corrupt North Vietnam. This decision has been made at the South East Asian governments do not do request of the Government of the Republic of something to improve living conditions, Vietnam and it is in accordance with Australia's somebody else will"". international obligations. Let there be no doubt as to how and why we have acted. The Australian Government has acted with the utmost propriety in honouring our obligations under S.E.A.T.O. and supporting South Vietnam and our ally, the United States of America, with whom our security is now so tightly bound. I appreciate that many calls have been made for peace, some by more influential countries than ours, but to negotiate with an enemy so busy fighting a war that he has not time to negotiate except on his own terms seems to my simple mind comparable with flogging a tiger out of a jungle with an olive branch. Despite previous difficulties and those at present being encountered, efforts to obtain a just peace by negotiation should be continuing and unrelenting. have listened to the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Aston) conduct his usual attack upon the Australian Labour Party and pursue his same old line of attack upon Communists that we have heard on every occasion he has risen to speak in a debate on foreign affairs. The honourable member stated that Australian troops are in Vietnam because of our obligations as a member of the South East Asian Treaty Organisation, I remind him that earlier this year, in answer to a question by the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns), the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) stated that Australian troops are in Vietnam at the request of the South Vietnamese Government and not because we are a member of S.E.A.T.O. We often hear from Government supporters the cry about Communists in South East Asia and how the whole of that area eventually will be taken over by the Communists. I believe that something has to be done by the governments of South East Asia to prevent a takeover by the Communists. It is about time that South East Asian governments did something to raise the social standards of their people and took action to improve the living conditions they endure at present. Travellers in South East The South East Asian people are being driven towards Communism because of their poor living conditions. To prevent the spread of Communism the living standards of these people must be improved. They must be provided with three meals a day, a decent bed and a proper home to live in. The improvement of the living standards of the people is the only way to combat Communism. Unless the South East Asian governments are prepared fo do something for their people, they will turn to Communism and the whole of South East Asia will go Communist. During debates on foreign affairs Government supporters have been critical of the refusal of the Hanoi Government to negotiate for peace with the Government of the United States, or with the government of any other country. I remind honourable members of what has taken place since the Geneva Conference in 1954. Honourable members probably are well aware that governments which were parties to that conference did not honour the agreement that was reached. The United States Government participated in the Conference but refused to sign tbe agreement and, according to Anthony Eden in his memoirs "" Full Circle ""-attempte d to sabotage its provisions. Although the United States Government did not sign the agreement, it promised publicly to refrain from offering threats of war. In the circumstances other countries would be entitled to be wary in conducting negotiations with the United States of America or South Vietnam. In October 1954 Ngo Dinh Diem returned from the United States to take control of South Vietnam with the support of General Eisenhower, the then American President. In 1955 a referendum was held at which only 15 per cent, of the Vietnamese voted. Diem took complete control of South Vietnam and cut off all trade with the north. He announced publicly that he would train a new army and march to the north. This was an open violation of the Geneva Agreement. The United States was against a national election and in his memoirs",37,Internationa L Affairs
112,Mr Devine (East Sydney) [2.37],"W cGeneral Eisenhower states that every expert he consulted agreed that if an election was held, at least 80 per cent, of the peopleboth north and south-woul d vote for a coalition of parties under Ho Chi Minh. The Geneva Agreement was then broken by an influx of arms into South Vietnam. United States Senator Wayne Morse has been critical of the Johnson Administration because of this action. He has stated openly that America has supplied arms to the South Vietnamese army. Honourable members will remember the circumstances of the Diem regime. When he was of no further use to the United States Government he was assassinated. Since then South Vietnam has had 13 or 14 governments. It was not until 1960 that the National Uberation Front was formed, not by Communists but by Catholics, Buddhists and members of other religious organisations, and government oflicials. It was formed to fight for a better deal and better living conditions, which the people had not received following the Geneva Conference. The Minister for External Affairs said last night that the National Liberation Front speaks confidently of a military victory. I am sure that all honourable members believe that this is an impossible task because the Front does not have the means or power to defeat the armed might of the United States. We should also be aware that about 500,000 allied troops would be necessary to hold every village and town captured by the American and South Vietnamese armies. What are our present reasons for the build-up of troops in Vietnam? I ask the Minister for External Affairs: Is it a fact that the morale of the South Vietnamese troops is cracking up? Is the majority of the South Vietnamese Army now deserting to join the Vietcong? Is it true that the ranger battalions, which are supposed to be the crack units of the South Vietnamese army, are also folding up and are refusing to fight? I believe that the Governments of the United States and South Vietnam are concerned about the loyalties of their soldiers and of some members of the military junta which at present is leading the country. It is have arisen in Sabah and Sarawak, both of feared that they may decide to join the Vietcong. The monsoonal period has arrived in Vietnam and on many occasions troops will be without air cover. The Vietcong will be stepping up its activities. More casualties will occur. There will be more deaths and more heartbreaks for the Australian families of our troops in Vietnam. The Australian Government has placed security restrictions on correspondents in the area so that they cannot interview wounded troops, or even troops in camp. They are thus prevented from sending to their newspapers the facts of the campaign in Vietnam. I am sure that all members of the Australian Labour Party would like to see an end to the war in Vietnam, but I think it is up to the United States Government to take a more sincere step towards achieving peace in Vietnam. The first thing it should do, as was suggested last night by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), is cease it's bombing of North Vietnam. We could hold our present perimeters and negotiate for a peaceful settlement. Dr. Mackay -What happened when (he Americans did just that? may get some worth-while results. The secession of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia has caused a great deal of concern to many Australians. I was fortunate enough to be a member of a delegation from the Australian Labour Party which recently toured Malaysia as the guests of the Singapore Government and the Federal Government of Malaysia. We saw a large part of Malaysia. We travelled not only by air but also by car and we had an opportunity to see many of the villages and towns and the rural workers throughout Malaysia. We were able to interview representatives of the various political parties represented in the Federation, gaining from them their views about the Federation. I think it may be said that as a result of our visit we know many things about the Federation which other people probably do not know. Singapore has now seceded from the Federation and has become an independent State. Since this occurred a feeling of discontent seems to which depended for their development on financial assistance from Singapore. We hope that Singapore's action will not lead to Sabah and Sarawak also breaking away from the Federation.",39,Internationa L Affairs
113,Mr Devine,"Giv e it a try and weWe spent the first five days of our visit in Singapore. Anybody who has visited Singapore recently will be well aware that it is bustling with activity. A great amount of developmental work is going on. The main business of Singapore centres around shipping. Being the fifth largest port in the and the Malays. This information also was world, Singapore is the gateway for South East Asian trade. The waterside workers of Singapore are nationalised. They come under the direct control of the Government. They are guaranteed a full wage every week. They are supplied each day with a hot meal. Their working conditions are pretty satisfactory. Because of the importance of shipping the Singapore Government has borrowed 50 million dollars from the World Bank in order to improve port facilities. The Government of Singapore, being formed of members of a democratic socialist party, is striving to develop a better counConference's opposition to discrimination try both socially and economically. Evidence of this effort is readily seen in housing, education and employment. There is some unemployment in Singapore but the Government is trying to overcome this anomaly by encouraging the establishment of industries in thc special industrial area, which covers 9,000 acres. The Government's aim is to provide 80.000 new jobs in the next 10 years. Factories are now working in the manufacturing and engineering industries. Products coming from the factories include cement, chemical goods, iron and steel, textiles, soap, matches and rubber goods. It is estimated that about 10,000 people each year come into Singapore from the mainland seeking employment. This information was not given to us by the Singapore Government; we were informed of these facts by the Alliance Party in Singapore, wbich is the Opposition party, and which is not represented in the Federal Government. It probably never will have a representative in that Government. About 50 per cent, of the population of Singapore is under the age of 20 years. Thc main problems so far as these people are concerned are education and employment but under the guidance of its youthful and vigorous leaders Singapore will undoubledly become a State worthy of world praise.

This was caused by the economic difference that existed between the Chinese given to us by members of the Alliance Party. We were also told, however, that the problem created by the tension between the Chinese and the Malays was not as bad as the negro problem in the United States. We all are aware of the riots that recently occurred in the United States. I should like to refer now to the communique issued on 25th June last in London following the meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, at which 22 countries were represented. Dealing with tbe matter of the the communique statedThe Prime Ministers recognised that the Commonwealth, as a multi-racial association, is opposed to discrimination on grounds of race or colour; and they took the opportunity at their meeting to re-affirm the declaration in their communique of 1964 that "" for all Commonwealth governments it should be an objective of policy to build in each country a structure of society which offers equal opportunity and non-discrimination for all its people, irrespective of race, colour or creed "". The Commonwealth should be able to exercise constructive leadership in the application of democratic principles in a manner which will enable the people of each country of different racial and cultural groups to exist and develop as free and equal citizens. As soon as we arrived in Malaysia the tension between the races was apparent. I often wondered whether the various Governments were trying to do something to overcome discrimination. Was it caused by the social and economic development of Singapore, which was expanding more rapidly than the other States of the Federation? Was it caused by the fear that the People's Action Party was getting a foothold in the rest of the Federation by reason of verbal reports of its achievements? Was the Federal Government concerned about the solidarity convention of the Opposition parties, which was chaired by Dr. Toh, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, and which had as its purpose the formation of a united Opposition party in the Federaa bearing on Singapore's departure from the Federation. As an Australian and a member of this Parliament I must be critical of the Malaysian Government for not taking into its confidence the Governments of Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand, which have greatly assisted the Federation through the Colombo Plan. Under the Colombo Plan, Australia and New Zealand have sent doctors to Malaysia. We have sent technicians to assist in the development of the country. Our teachers are working in schools, teachers' training colleges and unidelivered last night. He began, unlike myversities in Malaysia. We have also assisted the Federation with military aid. In not condown an amendment which was, I thought; sulting us the Malaysian Government treated us with contempt. It is reported that the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) was annoyed over this and that he sent a stern note to the Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. What was the reply he received? It would be interesting to have the notes and the replies tabled in the House. Government should strive for a ceasefire Perhaps later in the debate the Prime Minister will be able to give us some answers. He may be able to tell us whether there were any feelings at the Prime Ministers' Conference about the breaking up of the Federation. Was he consulted about the situation in Malaysia? Was he informed that the Federation was breaking up? It will prowave of a hand or the echoing of a senbably take many years for the breach between Singapore and the Federation to be healed. However, I , with many other Opposition members, must agree with the Government's decision to recognise the State of Singapore fully. at least on a harmonious note by expresCharter of the United Nations, the organ sing my complete accord with my honorof that body that has the primary responable friend from East Sydney( Mr Devine) sibility in the matter of peace is the Security in his concern for the plight and problems Council.

Can any person seriously conregrettably for the Opposition at least, template the Soviet Union, as one of the must cease. I want to turn my mind to the remarkable speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) last night. I hope that he will not be needlessly offended if I describe it as being a strange mixture of fiction and fantasy. But then the honourable gentleman has always shown that he has a remarkable imagination when he deals with history. The honourable gentleman has a very fertile imagination. Indeed, one can almost say of him that the fertility of his imagination is matched only by the barrenness of his regard for facts. This is made conspicuously clear in the speech that he self, on a rather contentious note. He put cast in rather infelicitous language. But be that as it may; this is one of the hazards of political contest. If we look closely at the amendment proposed by the honourable gentleman we find that it is very strange indeed. The first point to which I want to direct my mind is his assertion that the in Vietnam, to be policed by a United Nations peacekeeping force. One of the nostrums that the Australian Labour Party has succumbed to and has embraced, like some dear humbug to the last, is the idea that we can turn to the United Nations and, by the passing of some resolution or the tence, bring the whole of the machinery of the United Nations into play and secure peace in South Vietnam. I think a fair test of the validity of the honourable gentleman's argument is to examine it in relation to the United Nations five permanent members of the Security",40,Internationa L Affairs
114,Mr Killen (Moreton) [2.56],"I begin and South Vietnam. Under Article 24 of theCouncil, saying: "" Yes, we are prepared to join with the other permanent members of the Security Council not only to demand a ceasefire forthwith in South Vietnam but also to move into South Vietnam to enforce the ceasefire ""? Have my friends opposite not acquainted themselves with the veto power of Article 27 of the Charter? It requires all the permanent members to vote in the one way on all substantive matters. If one does not vote that way that is the end of it. this Government or any collection of goBut, for the purposes of the analysis, let vernments should use the machinery of the us assume that the Security Council should determine this. Will all the nations in the world heed the demand that can be made by the Security Council under Article 43 for all members of the United Nations to put forces at the disposal of the Security Council at its call? How real is this proposition? That is the question. I venture to say that it is a rather forlorn hope to think thnt peace can be secured in South Vietnam through the Security Council. But then let us dismiss that and turn our attention to the possibility of invoking what are known as the Uniting for Peace resolutions within the framework of the United Nations Charter. A series of resolutions was passed some time ago when it was found that, upon the veto of one permanent member of the Security Council, the whole framework of peace enforcement could be put in jeopardy. This would seem at first blush to offer greater prospect of doing something. But again we must come to grips with reality. If, upon the Security Council having failed to reach agreement on a matter of substance, seven members of the Councilone, two or more permanent members may be involved-as k for an emergency meeting of thc General Assembly, that meeting must be called forthwith. Alternatively, if a majority of the members of the General Assembly ask for an emergency meeting of the General Assembly, the meeting must be called forthwith. Then the matter can be put in train and the resolution can be passed. The force of the resolution is extremely China, the Kuriles, North Sakhalin, North restricted. It amounts to no more than a Korea and virtually the whole of Indorecommendation. It is in essence a return China? Is this a myth? Is this a fiction? to the co-operative spirit that sprang out You can take the whole totality of every of the Covenant of the former League of conquest of the Alexanders, the Caesars, Nations. There is no obligation upon memthe Charlemagnes, the Gengis Khans and bers of the United Nations to agree to proroll them all together and you cannot find vide forces. Certainly, forces were provided a comparison with what the international for the United Nations operations in the Communist conspiracy has achieved in the Congo. But nobody can hold that up to me as being a splendid example of peacekeeping, because I venture to describe it as one of the shabbiest expressions of man's inhumanity to man. Another example of the use of the Uniting for Peace resolutions was connected with Suez. They are the two alternatives. There is no other that I am aware of, and when honourable gentlemen opposite contend that United Nations for the purpose of securing peace in South Vietnam and then enforcing it I would hope that they would at least have that quality of intellectual honesty that would require them to describe precisely how this can be done. I turn from that to what struck me as being the second lamentable defect in the argument of my friend the Leader of the Opposition last night. It was his highly curious attack upon the proposition advanced by the Minister for External Affairs in relation to what he has described as the world power struggle. The House will recall some of the adjectives that the Leader of the Opposition used in relation to this doctrine. He described it as being simple and misleading. How simple is it? How misleading is it to all those countries that have fallen under Communist control? It is all right for my friend the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Devine) to denigrate the Government Whip, the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Aston) on the matter of Communist encroachment over the face of the world, but again this is a matter of reality. I think it is useful that occasionally we remind ourselves how real the struggle for world power is. Look what has happened within the space of a generation. What has happened to the little States in the Baltic, to Petsamo, to Karelia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the whole of course of the last generation. But the Leader been depicting Ho Chi Minh as a splendid of the Opposition last night attempted to flay the Minister for External Affairs by describing this as simple and misleading. Is it simple to the millions of people to whom today liberty and freedom are completely denied? There is nothing simple and misleading about that, but apparently we have to come to our Golgotha before we can completely understand. This was, I thought, a caricature of the sense of responHo Chi Minh was given the appointment of sibility that should flow from the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition in the National Parliament at this critical time. What is the relationship of the world power struggle to South Vietnam. BeforeI proceed to answer that question, let me say that I was rather intrigued by the attempt of the Leader of the Opposition to embarrass the Minister for External Affairs by advertthe international Communist conspiracy has ing to his historical engagement over the years. 1 suspected in this some resistance to respect those who are prepared to treat things historically. It did not seem to make I believe I do understand it as well as any sense to me. The discipline of the Minister for External Affairs as an historian has earned him marked respect, but last night the Leader of the Opposition chided him and made some cheap, and I thought most uncharitable, reference to that fact. But in the matter of history and in the matter of fact the Leader of the Opposition seems to have developed a remarkable allergy. Facts seem to irritate him and the history of events seems to annoy him. It is useful and essential, therefore, when we are dealordinary assertion for my friend to make. ing with the doctrine that the Minister has propounded-the doctrine of a struggle for world power in relation to South Vietnam -that all the elements be carefully explored. What are the facts? Ho Chi Minh, of course, is described variously by the honordomination. There are no "" ifs "" or "" buts "" able member for Yarra (Dr. Cairns) and Tom the ToryI beg your pardon, I am referring to the honourable member for Reid fairies and a benign agrarian reformer. This is the tripe that this peripatetic pair have been wandering around Australia talking about. They have been running in and out of teach-ins-thi s new fangled creationand this has been their star turn. They have been stirring up goodwill and understanding in relation to South Vietnam. This is what these gentlemen have been doing. They have character with a warm sense of humanity. I hope the facts do not irritate my friends opposite too much. Ho Chi Minh emerged for the first time in Moscow in 1922. He attended the fourth meeting of the International Communist Conference in that year. At that Conference there was established a South East Asian section. In 1925 directing all activities in Indo-China. I assure my friends opposite that they will not wrest from me any apologia at all for the behaviour of the French in Indo-China. The French never understood the relevance of the colonial movement in relation to the international Communist conspiracy and, of course, they went through the holocaust of the Indo-Chinese war. The fact remains that squeezed every drop of influence out of the understandable nationalist movement. I hope I understand the spirit of nationalism. of my friends opposite; but the fact remains that the Communists have used and exploited this movement in a grievous and wanton way. This irritates the Leader of the Opposition and he finds no evidence at all of Communist activity in South Vietnam. Much to my astonishment, he went on record last night as saying that there is as much nationalism among the Vietcong as there is Communism. I thought that a most extraLet me sum up my argument at this point. For 40 years there have operated in the former Indo-Chinese territory-in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia-element s which are attached and devoted towards prosecuting to the very hilt the international Communist conspiracy, the aim of which is world about that at all. To those who argue otherwise I say with very great respect that they have succumbed to some of the soft talk that is peddled so fervently in so many parts of the country. LastlyI want to say something about the question of negotiations. When the Prime Minister came into the chamber on TuesdayI thought he looked a little jaded and 1 said to some of my friends: "" How do you think the Prime Minister looks? "" The explanation was forthcoming that he has been kept up",42,Internationa L Affairs
115,( Mr Uren),"as being the leader of thelate at night dealing with inquiries coming from Ho Chi Minh, wanting to find out whether the Prime Mimster would be prepared to send Mr Hasluck up to Hanoi to talk to him. I think that that little bit of persiflage, that little bit of nonsense, puts into perspective the argument of the Opposition. The catalogue of attempts to negotiate tions to try to settle the matter round the with North Vietnam was given by my friend the honourable member for Phillip this afternoon and by the Minister for External Affairs last night. It has been recited over and over again. What do the honourable gentlemen opposite say? They say that you must keep this up. Where are you to stop? Cannot you imagine the scene when the Vietnamese, or their equivalent, are down here on Lake Burley Griffin. There you will find Tom the Tory and Ho Chi Jim stirring them up telling them to go back and to keep quiet. This is the reality, and I invite my in regard to negotiation. If the Government friends opposite to realise what a sheer is sincere about negotiations, that is a good farce they are making of the position in thing. The Minister, to some extent, both South Vietnam. We are faced, Sir, with an in the Chamber today and the Monash enemy who is dedicated, an enemy who University teach-in, where I heard is completely trained, an enemy who is him, expressed the view that we should intent upon wresting from the people of return to the 1954 Geneva Conference proSouth Vietnam their liberties. Either we posals. I think that this is a positive proStop him there today or we will have to stop posal, but could any sincere person in Aushim at some other time in the future. I tralia consider that the honourable member finish on this note: As I listened to my for Moreton( Mr Killen), who has just friend, the Leader of the Opposition, last resumed his seat, believes in peaceful night, the thought passed through my negotiations? mind: Is he now a prisoner of the left? I was left with this conclusion: Prisoner of the left? Bless my heart and soul. All you can hear from the honourable gentleman is connection with the problems of Vietnam? the clank of his chains. this debate on foreign affairs in order to scribed two years ago as ""Killen the magsupport the amendment moved by the nificent "". It is men such as he on the back Leader of the Opposition. I want to concenbenches on the Government side who are trate my remarks on the crisis in Vietnam, the curse of this country. I do not say that because I believe that this great crisis could the Minister for External Affairs has the escalate into a world war. I think that all same background as those backbencherspeople throughout the world are greatly those jackbooted boys who believe that the concerned about escalation of the war in only solution of the problems of the world Vietnam. If there is an escalation it could is war. I know that there are good members turn into a nuclear war and, consequently, -me n of sanity-in both the Australian a nuclear holocaust. It is for this reason Country Party and the Liberal Party who that we on this side of the Parliament have believe that we can settle these matters by said consistently that we stand for a cease negotiation. fire in Vietnam, and that we stand for settling the matter by means of peaceful negotiation and not by war. We have been and vicious war, a war of extremes, as a consistent in our stand. The last time that I was in the House when the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) made a statement on foreign affairs, which was on 23rd March 1965, our policy on this side of the House was consistent. We said that there ought to be a cease fire and negotiaconference table, because we believe that there is no military solution to the crisis in Vietnam. For some reason or other, at that time the Minister was not in favour of negotiations. Why was he not? It was because at that time the United States of America was not prepared for negotiations. It was prepared for escalation at that time. It is only since the Americans have put forward the proposition of negotiation that the Menzies Government has come out with its rubber stamp policy and supported the Americans Did the honourable member at any time talk about tolerance and understanding in He wants only war. It is an anti-Communist crusade. It is a holy war with that great warrior from Moreton, whom the The war in Vietnam is a heartless, cruel",44,Internationa L Affairs
116,Mr Uren (Reid) [3.16],"I rise to enter Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) decivil war is to any country. It brings out the extremes in people and, of course, brings out cruelty and harshness against one another. The Government of Australia has committed our young men to a conflict which is a holy wara negative anti-Communist crusade. It is a hopeless war which cannot be won by military means. There is only one way in which it can be settled. We must try to settle it by negotiation and then, by economic and political means, we may be able to assist to lift these people out support of the United States. of the great poverty, hunger and disease in which they exist at present. This is the war which defeated the might of the French colonial empire, a war in which over 500,000 French colonial troops were committed between 1946 and 1954. This is the war in which over 240,000 Frenchmen were casualties, over 100,000 Frenchmen perished, and over 40,000 Frenchmen surrendered in a humiliating defeat at Dien Bien Phu. This is the war to which our gallant, brave, heroic, self-sacriby the people of Vietnam themselves. ficing Prime Minister has committed 1250 young Australians. We have been informed by the Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes) that young Australian conscripts wili be drafted into this war against their own wishes. They will not have the privilege that our gallant, brave Prime Minister had to determine whether or not to go to war. In this crisis they have been drafted without being given the right, as the Prime Minister was given the right, to determine whether or not to go to war. These young men have been drafted and more will be drafted into this holy crusade of anti-Communism. It is negative anti-Communism; there is nothing positive about it. Are these young Australian supermen-onl y a mere handful of them, about 1,000 troops-to do what half a million Frenchmen could not do? One must ask why we Australians and the Americans stand so much alone. Where are our South East Asia Treaty Organisation allies? If this is the great war that is to stop the onward, downward thrust of Communism, where are the troops of Pakistan, which is our S.E.A.T.O. ally? Where are the forces of Thailand, the neighbour of Vietnam? Where are the forces of the Philippines and our other two Seato allies? Neither France nor Britain has military forces in Vietnam. Australia stands alone with Americans and a few New Zealanders. That is our lonely position. Anyone who likes to read the ""New York Times"" of l l t h September 1964 will learn that Cabot Lodge, who somehow or other just arrived here at the right time, a day or two before the determination of this Government that we would commit ourselves to Vietnam, also did the rounds of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation members to try to get them to commit forces to Vietnam. There are not any N.A.T.O. forces in Vietnam. We stand alone in that position in our I am proud that the Australian Labour Party made a unanimous decision-ther e is unanimity on this side-to oppose the sending of Australian forces to Vietnam. I was overseas when the decision was made by the parliamentary caucus, and when I read the decision I was indeed proud of the party to which I belong, because it determined that we should not send our forces to Vietnam. It considered that this was a civil war involving a problem which had to be solved No matter what country it is, its internal problems have to be solved eventually by the people who live within its boundaries. This question of infiltration from the North has been argued time and time again, and I shall deal with it later if time is available. I want to deal briefly with the Diem regime which was set up by the American Government. From 1955 to 1963, Premier Diem governed the people of South Vietnam. In 1962, President Kennedy became concerned about the problems that were arising in Vietnam and he sent out a bipartisan Senate committee, under the leadership of Senator Mike Mansfield, to investigate the position. Senator Mansfield said that he found chaos, intrigue and widespread corruption in South Vietnam. He also saidIt would be a disservice to my country not to voice a deep concern over the trend of events in Vietnam in the seven years which have elapsed since my last visit in 195S. What is most disturbing is that Vietnam now appears to be, as it was then, only at the beginning of a beginning to coping with grave internal problems. Senator Mansfield pointed out that aid amounting to something like 2,000 million dollars had been poured into Vietnam. Of that 2,000 million dollars only a little over 100 million dollars had been spent on economic aid, and the balance was spent on military aid. It was during this time that Diem had his opportunity for land reform if he wanted to bring real freedom to the peasants of Vietnam. The great mass of the people are peasants. But what happened? In the struggle between the French and the Viet Minh forces in the Mekong Delta over the years 1946 to 1954, the land was taken from the landlords and distributed among the peasants, but when the Diem regime returned it took the land from the peasants and handed it back to the landlords. That is why what is known in this country as the Vietcong, and what is known widely throughout the world as the National Liberation Front, has been able to survive against the great odds that it faces. It has been able to survive because the mass of the people are on the side of the National Liberation Front. A guerrilla war can only succeed if the masses of the people are on the side of the guerrillas, and in Vietnam the masses of the people are on the side of the National Liberation Front. Let me say to honourable members who on within the United States heirarchy. I are interjecting that I am convinced that believe that President Johnson is a member America wants to get out of Vietnam, but of the doves, that he does not want to she wants to negotiate from strength. escalate the war; but the internal struggle in America became committed to Vietnam in American politics continues. Surely we have the blackest and darkest era of America's to come to negotiations. The question has foreign policy. She became committed been asked: "" Why are not negotiations during the 1954-55 period under Dulles' going on?"" It has been asked over and foreign policy. We know that at that time on over again. at least two occasions Dulles offered the French nuclear weapons to use against the Viet Minh. If honourable members want the authority for that, I suggest that they read say: "" We fought a war from 1946 to 1954. Eden's memoirs because Eden was the one We won the war and the French decided who vetoed the proposal on that occasion. to go home. Vietnam was divided temHow can they get out and save face? They South."" There were to be general elections have to negotiate from strength. We know within two years, but the people were that there has been an escalation of the cheated out of the general elections because bombing. When we look at the bombing of Premier Diem and, as my colleague of North Vietnam, we note that Walter the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Lippman, a very eminent Liberal American Devine) has stated, because President newspaper correspondent, has expressed Eisenhower believed, as he said in his his views on why the Americans are bombmemoirs, that on information received from ing North Vietnam. For example, he is all the experts on Vietnam, it appeared that reported in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" over 80 per cent, of the people would have of 26th July 1965 as having saidThe American air strikes were tried out as a distrust over there. relatively cheap and easy way of compensating for and covering up the defeat of the South Vietnamese army. In the past six months the plight of the Saigon army has become worse and worse, and today throughout the centuries. Anyone who cares its reserves are used up, its troops arc deserting in to study the history of Vietnam will learn masses, the villages from which it could draw that the Annamites and the Vietnamese have new recruits are in Vietcong hands, communications with the few centres that it still holds are substantially cut. That is why America is sending forces into Vietnam. She now means to build up her forces to 125,000 strong and eventually, perhaps, to 200,000 or even 300,000. But I believe that when the Americans do so it will be solely for the purpose of trying to hold the position and protect their air bases. There is a struggle going on in American politics. That struggle is going on between the doves and the hawks. The hawks want to escalate the war. They want to go into China, just as the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) does. He is on record here as stating that he wants to de-nuclearise China. The hawks also want that. Public statement after public statement has been made in America to the effect that America should de-nuclearise China. That is their attitude. So this struggle goes Let us look at the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam. Its members might porarily. The French withdrew to the supported the Government of Ho Chi Minh. Therefore, there is a certain measure of These people have not been fighting for just a few years; they have been struggling been struggling against Chinese, French and Japanese oppression for over 20 centuries. And they will continue to struggle. I want them to negotiate. I am in favour of negotiation, and I am in favour of a cease fire. But we must remember that we are bombing North Vietnam and there are masses of foreign military forces in South Vietnam. Thc supporters of the National Liberation Front think that, because they control most of the land mass of Vietnam, they are going to win. They believe that, just as under the 1954 Geneva Agreement they were cheated out of general elections, so now they cannot trust the Americans. Therefore, there may be doubts in their minds, but 1 think pressure must be brought to bear in the world scene and that we must have negotiations. It is suggested that there is pressure from thereof-""thi s House regrets statements by the the North. It is strange that on this occasion desire thc Minister did not quote from the by military American White Paper entitled "" Aggression Government to strive for a ceasefire now, to be from the North"". Perhaps the reason he policed by a United Nations peacekeeping foice, did not do so was that my colleague, the and for a conference of all parties directly involved, honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. including Cairns) and others have given some explanawhich will both end the agony of the Vietnamese tion of that document.

He saidThe Council said that it was disturbed over evidence that the increasing infiltration of arms slightly different angle. The Leader of the and combat personnel from the North into South Vietnam now includes members of the regular armed forces of North Vietnam. Unfortunately, he could not get two of his S.E.A.T.O. allies to agree with him. Both Pakistan and France abstained from supporting that statement. No positive proposals were placed before the Parliament. The Minister merely made a statement. We want evidence. Let him place before us evidence in the form of public documents and we will examine them on their merits to see whether there is aggression from the North. We believe that the war in Vietnam is a civil war and that the only people who can settle the problems of Vietnam are the Vietnamese people themselves. We hope that there will be a cease fire, we hope that there will be a cooling off period and we hope, eventually, that the people of Vietnam will determine by a free election the type of government that they are to have. that all I need say about the speech of the honourable meniber for Reid( Mr Uren) is that if we turn to the ""Hansard"" report of the last debate on international affairs we shall find that he made the same speech, word for word, on that occasion. Neither his thinking nor his reading has been brought up to date. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) last night gave a very clear exposition of Government policy, particularly in relation to Malaysia and Vietnam. Following this clear exposition the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) proposed a very strange amendment to the Minister's motion that the House take note of the papers which he had presented. That amendment was in these termsTliat all words after "" That"" be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place Prime Minister which disclose his Government's to seek a solution to the conflict in Vietnam means alone. The House urges the representatives of both the Government in Saigon and the Vietcong to seek a settlement, The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) dealt very effectively with the amendment. I want to look at it from a Opposition proposed his amendment having regard to both the present and the past context of the situation in Vietnam, the present context being that Australian troops are now in action there and the past context being that numerous delegations have been trying to open peace negotiations in regard to Vietnam. These attempts at negotiation have proved abortive for one very simple reason-the Communists believe that they can win. Because they think that they are in a winning position they do not feel it necessary to negotiate. There is plenty of evidence to support this contention. Some evidence was contained in the Minister's speech last night in which he quoted a statement by the National Liberation Front which was reported by Radio Hanoi in this wayWith all the factors of victory within our grasp, let our entire people and army valiantly march forwards. We shall certainly win. We are resolved to win a great victory. It is obvious that the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese will not negotiate while",45,Internationa L Affairs
117,Mr Ntxon (Gippsland) [3.36],"I thinkthey are in that frame of mind. I think it was the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) who told me that Sir Arthur Fadden, a former Treasurer of this Government, would often say that when the cattle smelt the water they were very hard to stop. Obviously at this time the North Vietnamese think that they can smell victory so they will not negotiate. But I am sure that victory is not yet theirs because the determination and the resolution expressed to the honourable member for Bradfield and myself on our visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Ky, General Thieu, General Chieu and Dr. Do and others indicated that victory for the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese is a long way off. What does disturb me somewhat is that obviously the Opposition belongs to the group which says: "" Yankee go home"". Having been to Saigon and having seen certain things which give me a small advantage over others who have not been there, all I can say is that if the Yankees do go home the 15 million people in South Vietnam will be thrown to the Communist wolves. Let us extend this "" Yankee go home"" attitude. Suppose Australia were subjected to aggression. Would the Opposition continue to say "" Yankee go home"" or would it say: "" We are signatories to the S.E.A.T.O. and ANZUS. Pacts. Come and look after us.""? Of course the Opposition, or at least the sensible members of the Opposition, would be asking for help. What is the reason for the Opposition's attitude? Another remarkable feature of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition last night is that he did not at any stage say that we should bring the Australian troops home from Vietnam. On 4th May last, when the Parliament was debating the Government's proposal to send troops to Vietnam, he had this to sayTherefore, on behalf of all my colleagues of of South Vietnam. Perhaps there needs to Her Majesty's Opposition, I say that we oppose the Government's decision to send 800 men to fight in Vietnam. We oppose it firmly and completely. On this occasion, however, by some chance or other, the Leader of the Opposition did not mention bringing home the troops now in Vietnam. Can it be that he knows full well that the proposition he puts to the House is impractical, or does he know that sitting behind him are some of the more militant members of his party who are demanding that he adopt his present attitude and advance the amendment now before the House? It is very hard for me to make an assessment of the position, but from the fact that the Leader of the Opposition did not demand that the Australian troops be returned home and also from the fact that he did not protest very loudly about additional troops being sent to Vietnam, I can certainly say that he believes that the proposition he has advanced is somewhat impractical. On 29th April last the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) announced that we would assist in the struggle in Vietnam by sending a battalion of troops. A full debate followed during the course of which a complete explanation of Australia's position was given. However, after the House went into recess a great deal of propaganda was spread around the countryside which confused the people of Australia somewhat. I must say that the propaganda has been disseminated by some academics, who have adopted a rather lofty attitude to the whole matter, and by some members of the Opposition who have decided to handle the question by misinterpreting the facts and by speaking half truths. I include the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) and the honourable member for Reid in that group. Let us consider why Australian troops are in Vietnam. What right have we to have our troops there? These questions seem to have been under some scrutiny by the honourable member for Reid but I do not agree with the answers that he found to them. In his statement the Prime Minister saidThe Australian Government is now in receipt of a request from the Government of South Vietnam for further military assistance. There was a request from the Government be more than just a plain request from a government for troops. Well, there is more. The first thing to remember is that Vietnam is a protocol State under the S.E.A.T.O. arrangement and is named as such in the Manila Pact of 8th September 1954. Let us remember that a protocol State is one in a defined area of the Treaty but which is not a signatory to the Treaty. So there are two points. First, there was a request, and secondly, Vietnam is a protocol country. Now let us look at the Treaty. Article 11, which I will not read in full but from which 1 will not take anything out of context, is in these termslu order more effectively to achieve the objectives Missions, the Committee has come to the conof this Treaty, the Parties, separately and jointly Notice these words. . . will maintain and develop their individual nnd collective capacity to resist armed attack and to prevent and counter subversive activities directed from without against their territorial integrity and political stability. Article II indicates that separate action can be taken by the member nations of S.E.A.T.O. within the bounds of the Treaty. Let us look a little further. Article IV, seciion 1 statesEach PartyI stress the word "" each ""-. . recognises that aggression by means of tect of the kind of war that is at present armed attack in thc treaty area . . . would endanger its own peace and safety, and agrees being waged in Vietnam, involving subverthat it will iu that event act to meet the common sion without total war.

Fourthly, Article IV sets out the South Vietnamese told us of a man in the grounds on which it can be taken.

That is the he managed not to do so. The honourable kind of terrorist activity in which the Vietmember for Yarra, in one speech that he cong have been indulging in order to force delivered on a television programme at one assistance from people, either by making of the university teach-ins, appeared to be them join the Vietcong or by making them at some pains to prove that there is very supply the Vietcong with food. little outside assistance being given to the Vietcong. Indeed, he claimed straight out that what is happening in Vietnam is simply the chances of victory in Vietnam. Infiltraa local revolution. This is not so, however, tion has been occurring not only from the if one has regard to the findings of the northern borders; it has been shown also Legal Committee of the International Conthat members of the Vietcong have been trol Commission, which included the following remarksHaving examined Uie complaints and the supporting material sent by the South Vietnamese clusion that in specific instances there is evideuce to show that armed and unarmed personnel, arms, munitions and other supplies have been sent from the Zone in tlie North to the Zone in the South with the object of supporting, organising and carrying out hostile activities, including armed attacks, directed against the Armed Forces and Administration of the Zone in the South. These acts are in violation of Articles 10, 19, 24 and 27 of the Agreement on thc Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam. Evidence of all kinds is available in the report of that Legal Committee, and details of armaments arid equipment are given. It is quite plain that there is aggression from outside, with Communist assistance. Indeed, Mao Tse-tung has claimed to be the archiof wars we have known previously. Local Communists have been taken from South Vietnam to subvert the villagers and spread When the honourable member for BradLet me now turn to an examination of coming in from the border with Laos. The war that is going on is completely different from previous wars in many respects. It is different from the operations in Malaya or from the war that was waged in Korea. Following the defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu the northern leader, Ho Chi-Minh, who was then still in control, had readymade lines of communication and supply. He had a ready-made set-up to carry on with his subversive activities against the Government in the south. At the present time, as bas already been mentioned, it is rather more difficult to fight a war in the traditional way. It is the monsoon season, and planes and troops cannot move in the normal fashion. The physical conditions of the country certainly suit guerrilla activities. In the wet season the rain forests provide hideaways for armaments and food and for the members of the Vietcong themselves. At the same time as these difficulties are being experienced past Government failure to provide internal stability has provided a further difficulty. In addition, there has been a clash between the Buddhists and the Catholics. The Communists have made the most of this by provoking the Buddhists during the Diem regime by telling the Buddhists that the Catholics were discriminating against them. I have set out some of the problems that have had to be faced to give an idea of the magnitude of the task of winning this war in South Vietnam, but I say that despite or because of the problems the South Vietnamese are more determined than ever to win out. The honourable member for Bradfield and I met Prime Minister Ky and when we asked him about this religious problem that has been in existence in Vietnam for so long he said that members of his Government were militarists first and that their first duty was to obtain security for South Vietnam. I might mention that Prime Minister Ky is a Buddhist. We then met General Thieu, chairman of the Military Cabinet. When asked a similar question he expressed like feelings, and he is a Catholic. We in Australia can only hope that the bringing together of representatives of the two religious factions at the top Government level will provide some stability. BeforeI go any further I think I should land reform problem-and , let us face it, elaborate on a matter that was mentioned in the east land is life. Unfortunately golast night by the honourable member for vernments have not faced up to the problem Bradfield who unfortunately had not time to go into it in detail. The line has been peddled both inside and outside this House that we should be giving economic and not military aid. The honourable member for Bradfield and I had the privilege of attending a ceremony in Saigon to celebrate International Aid Day, at which Prime Minister Ky and the Foreign Minister, Dr. Do, addressed a large gathering. Flying in the square, were 33 flags of nations supporting South Vietnam and I want to record in "" Hansard"" the names of some of those nations; I am sorry that I cannot recall all of them. The flag of the United States of America was there, for a start, and I may mention that in the last financial year the United States spent 300 million dollars on economic aid for South Vietnam, while its military aid commitment amounted to 330 million dollars. So those who think the Americans are fighting and not assisting economically should think again. Also flying were the flags of Australia, France, United Kingdom, the Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand and Pakistan, all S.E.A.T.O. countries and all assisting South Vietnam with economic aid. Then there were the flags of Canada and India, both member nations of the International Control Commission and assisting with economic aid in South Vietnam. There was the flag of the United Nations, which assists with technical expert advice and has conferred 59 fellowships on South Vietnamese this year. There were also the flags of the Republic of China, Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, Iran, Israel, Ireland, Austria, the Netherlands, Greece, Argentina, Algeria, Turkey, Brazil, Malaysia and Tunisia. I have mentioned only 26 of the 33flagsthat were flying there. Let us, therefore, have no more of this talk about a lack of economic aid. The first thing that Prime Minister Ky said was, ""What we need is stability with security so that we can make better use of the economic aid. The only way we can get security is to achieve peace in our country and get rid of the Vietcong."" In an earlier time Diem failed for two or three reasons. He failed to solve the religious problems. He failed to solve the of absent landlords and abuses of the farming system. Prime Minister Ky on this occasion said that he would be doing something about land reform. He showed us how with the Hop Tac programme he is endeavouring to implement land reform. Diem failed because his technical programme for defended villages did not provide real security for the villagers living in them. The present Hop Tac programme, which has been likened to a stone thrown into a pond, with ripples spreading out from the point of entry, provides an area of security springing from the centre of that area. This Hop Tac programme, or pacification programme, proceeds in three stages. First there is the clearing of Vietcong from an area by troops Then there is the removal of cells of the Vietcong and finally development is carried on by civilian teams of agricultural experts, medical experts, educationalists and others. South Vietnam is not alone in its struggle. As I have already pointed out, it has 33 nations assisting it. We in Auslralia must show the fortitude and the resolve to assist in the South Vietnamese struggle against aggression. If we fail, the struggle will merely will in the world the people of Malaysia be transferred to another country. Let us play our part in demonstrating to the Communist powers that, along with our allies, we will not tolerate aggression, and that what Australia wants is to live in peace with all. able member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) has some odd philosophies mixed up in his politics. He ended his speech with a plea for peace. He spent his 20 minutes telling us how we and our allies are going to bomb the Vietnamese into a peaceful position. He spoke about freedom and about liberty and about his friend Marshal Ky. Honourable members on this side of the House-and I think all Australians-ar e not concerned with which side is right or wrong on this issue in Vietnam, but we are concerned with that country and its people and with the security of thb entire area. I believe that this Government and its supporters are proceeding on a collision course which will end in catastrophe for the whole area and perhaps for the whole world. I have been disappointed while sitting in this chamber during this debate in that I have heard so little said about the fate of the people who are being devastated and destroyed in this conflict. 1 have been disappointed also to hear the constant apologia from the other side of the House as to why Australians and Australia are involved in Vietnam. Why are we in Vietnam? Australia, in effect, has almost declared war on significant portions of the Asian mainland. We have troops scattered throughout South East Asia. We are challenging the movement of ideas, of people and of nationalism in some of the rising nations of Asia. We are doing this not on any grounds of truth and justice but, I believe, because we are misinterpreting the whole swing of history and the burden of human needs in the area. I believe that Australia's participation in the war in Vietnam is a piece of strategic folly. If there were no other reasons, if there were no people involved and if there were no principles involved except that of Australia's strategy in its own self-defence, then I believe we have made a fundamental strategic error. We have placed Australian soldiers in South Vietnam, in Borneo and in Malaya. We all know that despite the best have not been able to stay together. We also have troops or airmen in Thailand. With the meagre forces available to the people and Government of Australia the Government has chosen to scatter them throughout half of South East Asia. Are there no lessons in history? Is there nothing to be learned from the very recent past? Let us consider for a moment what happened to the Australian troops placed in similar positions during World War II . The Government says that at the moment there is not going to be any sudden or violent outbreak of a world war. How does anybody know this? We were told here in the House that even on a question fundamental to Australian policy and our own security, in effect-the situation in Malaysia-w e were not consulted or informed. This Government's intelligence services seem to be singularly remiss. What happened to Australian servicemen during the last war? Have we no memories of Singapore, Rabaul, Timor, Ambon, of Greece and Crete? In every instance in which Australia placed troops in this kind of position we lost the lot. It is a fundamental strategic error. The Government and those people in Australia who are supporting it in this policy will have placed",48,Internationa L Affairs
118,Mr Bryant (Wills) [3.55],"The honorAustralia in grave jeopardy if we should need our forces for Australia's defence. We have removed them beyond our own control and placed them under the control of people answerable to other governments. We have placed them in positions in which they must indulge in some of the barbarities that are inevitable in war. I say that again. Barbarities are inevitable in war on both sides. It is no good for honourable members opposite to try to explain away the tortures. Of course they happen. We on this side of the House do not try to apologise for the tortures performed by others either. Of course they happen, and they are an inevitable result of war. I believe that placing Australian troops in would be better if they got out of the luxury Vietnam is a piece of strategic folly from hotels and established contact with people the point of view of Australia's defence and all round the world. security and interest. It is also a psychological error. We live in Australia and Australia a continuous buildup of hysteria, of poliis here for all time. This has been said so tical hysteria, a phoney atmosphere, about often: The Americans can go home, the the foreign policy of this country. Let us British can go home and, in fact, the take the question of China.

This spoiling of Australian politics This is another lesson of history; that if you and sullying the whole atmosphere of the sit people down, man for man, round a table nation has been a continuing feature in and keep at it long enough, most of the the last 15 years and we have seen consistent barriers between them will collapse. The developments of that pattern in this place. barriers between peoples all over the world There is the Crimes Act with the rather are falling down. Twice in my lifetime the fantastic notion of "" proclaimed countries ""; F.8226/65 -R -[9] borders between France and Germany have been the cause of almost tearing the world apart. Now it is possible to drive across those borders merely by showing a passport. When the borders between France and Germany have fallen down then no international position is insoluble. I believe that it is part and parcel of the pattern of political thinking of the Government and its supporters that they cannot get down on the ground and mix with the people. It would be better if, instead of travelling by Boeing around the world, they got down and travelled in the trams and trains or on pushbikes, or drove on the roads and spoke to thc people. It In the last 15 or 20 years we have seen Iambs to be fed. On one side they are dangerous, tigerish and wretched-and all the But that has been only part of the whole there is the non-recognition of countries of whose politics we do not approve; the fact that we have no diplomatic representation in China, Mongolia and Eastern Europe. There is the question of East Germany and the attitude of regarding it as if all East Germans had leprosy. As one German said to me: ""Do all the good Germans live on that side of the wall and all the bad ones on this side? "" We do not even talk to them and we do not visit them. Very few honourable members opposite go anywhere where they can see these people on the ground. Then we have seen the rush of the last two or three years with conscription brought in offhand, almost underhand, against the advice of military advisers apparently, and we have seen it gradually extending until insiduously and slowly but surely it is going to creep into every household in this country. When the people went to the ballot boxes last December they were not aware of the full implications of conscription. SoI believe that so far as Vietnam is concerned we are indulging in a piece of phony political hysteria. Let us take the question of passports, ln Parliament in the last session the Minister for Housing( Mr inexplicable. This is the position so far Bury) representing the Minister fo Immigration ( Mr Opperman), announced that because of the position in Vietnam we were going to endorse Australian passports as being not valid for Vietnam. At least half a million Australians have British passports and they can go where they like. The British system is to have passgreat deal more of the history of Vietnam ports valid for travel all over the world. Why pick Vietnam? We have Australian soldiers on the Borneo border of Indonesia and there is no suggestion that we should not travel to Indonesia. It is all phoney. It is all hysteria and part of a pattern to try to issues? Was not Australia sickened when the stir the people of Australia in some vague way so that they will not understand. Vietnam is far off. It is remote, it is exotic and it is unknown. Hardly anybody in Australia has been there. Indonesia, of course, is handy and people know it. Thousands have been there. It is just up the road, so to speak, and we do not feel that it is a danger. It cannot be built up to have this sort of atmosphere, so we fly across the ocean and we pick Vietnam. A good deal of the workings of the minds of honourable members opposite is nonsense. It is little credit to the people who vote for them that nevertheless they continue to send them here. I challenge honourable members opposite on the single question of passports. We have passports now that are not valid for travel to North Vietnam. If the Government is dinkum and this is not phoney humbug and a piece of political hysteria, the Government will apply the same restriction to passports for Indonesia. I object to it in both cases. I believe that freedom of travel in all ordinary circumstances is one of the fundamental freedoms, but if the Government is dinkum it will do in both cases what it has done in the case of passports for Vietnam. If the Government will not do it in both cases it is not dinkum. Ask the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), who I understand is going to follow me in the debate and who has a singular capacity for explaining the inexplicable and defending the indefensible, what his view is. Ask the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Allan), whose capacity in that regards is not as formidable as that of the honourable member for Mackellar, but who still always manages to vote for the as Vietnam is concerned. Why are we there? We can talk about the history of Vietnam. Books on the subject have been in and out of the Library faster than any others in my experience as a member of the Library Committee. There is a great deal of documentation there and many honourable members of this House know a and its geography than they know about Australia, but they do not seem to care much about its people. Are we really in Vietnam on great moral Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) said that the bombing of North VietnamI think Dong Hoi was the place-wa s a great moral enterprise and an act of great moral courage? Have members of the Government ever been bombed? I know that the Minister for the Navy( Mr Chaney) has been bombed and probably he might have been flying bombers. Literally hundreds of thousands of Australians who have experienced bombing at first hand and who have been the customers, know that in reality nobody can bomb munitions dumps without killing other peopie. Even with all the sophisticated apparatus of modern war it is murder; it is killing people. In my view undeclared wars and adventures of this nature are murder in the first degree. I long for the day when we will bring into international relations the same relationships as we have between people on the ground, and until that day we have all to work towards that end. It behoves a country of 11 million people-on e of the richest, most prosperous, secure and well founded in the world; one of the most politically stable and one of the most homogeneous so far as humanity is concerned-to bend all its efforts to try to bring this about. If it is a grievous error and a sin and murder for one man to shoot another man because his cow happens to get into his cabbages, or just because he wants them, it is wrong to shoot him because he happens to own a canal like Suez or happens to live in a black community like Sharpeville, or happens to be a Communist like fhe people of North Vietnam. Yet these are matters whioh honourable menibers on the other side of the House consider reasons for capital punishment. ] believe the people of Australia should wake up to the fact that this is a great moral issue and that we have taken the side of immorality. Are we in Vietnam for the sake of democracy? No honourable member opposite has answered this question. The Minister said that there have been rapid cl.anges of government in South Vietnam, as if that were an indication of democracy, trying to explain away the words honourable members opposite use, on the one hand, and the facts of political life in Vietnam on the other hand. The honourable member for Gippsland speaks of Marshal Ky as one of his friends. stituents, so you can talk to him personally. Marshal Ky's politics are obviously as dicHow real is this world power struggle? How tatorial, undemocratic and dangerous as real are the historical analogies that honorthose of anybody else in the world. It has able members opposite bring forth, conbeen mentioned that he has praised the late stantly quoting the compromise of 1938 Adolf Hitler, and of course that does not and Munich? It would be better if they make him a lone star ranger, because turned back to 1848 and the rise of back in 1938 the Prime Minister did the nationalism in Europe. Unfortunately, they same. Honourable members opposite should still think not as South East Asians but as get out of their trance and should not talk, conservative western Europeans. in words like these, to people who live in a democratic community in which the law is nonsense spoken by the honourable member based on a fundamental morality. Do not for Moreton and the philosophical abstractalk about Australia's interest unless you tions which the Minister speaks. They talk can prove conclusively that Australia's interest is involved. We are in Vietnam in the interests of America. It happens that America has become psychologically involved there and now is strategically involved in such a way Fhat she cannot disentangle herself. If we were doing our duty to America the most important and friendly thing to do would be to help the USA. disengage in Vietnam. By embarking on this adventure we are making it more difficult for America to disengage. The Prime Minister is the most artful spinner of words I have met in my time, and 1 have met a few. Early last session I asked him to table the letters which requested Australian participation in Vietnam. What did he say? I thought, from memory, that he said he would not table them, but on looking up my question in "" Hansard"" I find that he did not even say there were any letters. This is what we suspected until we were told, only yesterday or the day before, that it was done by diplomatic exchange at ambassadorial level. Fancy committing Australian soldiers to war-and that is how the Prime Minister described it-by diplomatic exchanges at ambassadorial level. Have honourable members opposite no sense of the appropriate or of their responsibilities to the nation? The Minister for External Affairs and the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) talk about the world power struggle, in the same terms as Adolf Hitler, Lenin, Metternich and Philip of Spain. All through history mischief makers have talked about the power struggle. Victoria? I have not time to deal with the historical",52,Internationa L Affairs

120,Mr Bryant,"He is one of your conas though Communism throughout the world is a great, sweeping, dangerous disease. I know that they will try to take what I say out of context and quote it around the country and use it for their own purposes. But what do they mean? Do they assert that every Russian is a dangerous and wicked person and that every Chinese is a foul and vicious person thirsting for the blood of everybody else and dominion over them or that every Pole or Yugoslav is like that? It would not be a bad idea if some honourable members opposite occasionally went to these countries instead of standing in their places mouthing these threats. What are they going to do if Indonesia has a Communist Government as its next chain of command? Is the Minister for the Navy going to call up his fleet and descend upon Djakarta and install there some of the minions of the Ky Government of South Vietnam? So the real issue is this: It is a question Chauvinism or isolationism. The influence of humanity. I believe we live in a friendly world. Last year I travelled through a great number of these countries down on the ground among the people. Whether they were Indians, Mongolians, East Germans, West Germans or the people of Moscow or Singapore there was no fundamental difference in the way they treated one when one was looking for help and could not find an hotel or when the tyre of one's car was punctured or anything else. Like the honourable member for Gwydir, I have attended international conferences of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. When you sit people that there should be an immediate beside these people at the conference table ceasefire in Vietnam and a withdrawal of it is possible to arrive at a solution of most Australian and American troops from that problems, but you do not work it out overcountry. It is claimed by the spokesmen for night. We are here at the tail end of perhaps of the present regimes in Vietnam a Titoist 2,500 years of this kind of development and Communist regime in that country. That we are not going to solve the problem oversuggestion is put up as being of benefit to night. There are a tremendous number of both parts of Vietnam and to the whole of questions before the people of Australia and this area. It is claimed by the Russian Comone of them is this: What is the answer in munists that a Titoist type of regime in the Vietnam, except devastation, war, desolation north of South Vietnam would act as a and the provoking of China to enter the stabilising force in the area. The reason why war, if we proceed in this way? To provoke this proposal was made is plainly that the China into this war would be one of the Russian Communists are engaged in a conmost tragic follies of history and the contest at the present time with the Chinese tinued participation of Australia in Vietnam Communists. There is an intense spirit of is part and parcel of that provocation. I rivalry between these two mighty leaders of believe that the House should support the the Communist empire. The Communists in motion moved by the Opposition and that Russia are disturbed at the success that their it is time that the Government was removed from office. honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) who has just spoken expressed surprise to find that humanity all over the world has the same hopes and aspirations and, indeed, the same desire to express itself and to work out each individual destiny. I am not surprised at this feature in the world. I believe it is part of human nature to aspire to conditions of peace under a rule of law and order. These are the hopes of mankind of all ages and in all places in the world. Listening to this debate since it started last night, I have come to the conclusion that there are two main streams of thought behind the Opposition's attack on the Government's decision to intervene in Vietnam. One of these streams of thought is plainly influenced by Communist propaganda. The other stream of thought is based upon of Communist propaganda is something on which I am able to speak, perhaps, with some authority because, as the House knows, in the last few years I have been privileged to associate quite closely with leaders of various countries including Communist countries. I have had many conversations about a number of issues, especially the issues of South Vietnam and South East Asia, with the leaders of Communist countries. It has been put to me by some of these the Soviet Union that if such a withdrawal were to happen we would have in place",55,Internationa L Affairs
121,Mr Ian Allan (Gwydir) [4.15],"Th eChinese colleagues have been having in international affairs in extending their influence among the smaller and newer countries of the world. The Russian Communists are making every effort they can to contain Communist China by pursuing a particular course of action in North Korea, in Vietnam, and in all Asian countries around the perimeter of their partner, Communist China. As part of this process of restoring and reinforcing Russian influence in these perimeter countries, the Russian Communists have launched a large and intensive campaign of propaganda throughout the world. Thcy want to establish a Russian oriented government in Vietnam for their own purposes-no t for our purposes-to give them some protection from Communist China. This is quite a legitimate action for the Russian Communists to take. Naturally, they are afraid of the giant that is arming itself in Communist China. This action is quite legitimate but I believe the Russian Communists to be misguided even from their own point of view. It certainly would be quite unacceptable to Australia, to the small countries of Asia or to any Western country because this action would mean the cynical abandonment of our friends in South Vietnam. It would change the balance of power and aggression would be encouraged in other countries in South East Asia, particularly aggression of the same order as the aggression that is taking place now in South Vietnam. It is quite plain from the words of speakers from the Opposition side that honourable members opposite have been influenced by this intensive campaign of propaganda waged by the Russian Communists to secure a Russian oriented government in Vietnam. The quite impractical proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) last night that Australia should now take the initiative to bring about a ceasefire between the Vietcong and the South Vietnamese is a typical example of this influence. Everyone who can read and who can hear knows that the Americans have had an open door to negotiations all the way through this conflict. Several attempts have been made by sympathetic powers to bring the two parties to the conference table, but they will not come. They will not play. It is wrong for the Leader of the Opposition, as the spokesman for a large political party in Australia, to say: "" All right, all othe: attempts have failed; let Australia try now "". It is quite unreal. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition says this only because it is the slogan of the great peacemakers of the present time, the Russians, who want peace at any price in Vietnam because they are frightened of Communist China. That is the extent of the influence that Communist propaganda has had on the thinking of the Labour Party. The other main stream of thought in the Labour Party, that of extreme nationalism or isolationism, is something which has become a feature of the world since the last war. This attitude has sprung up in the most unexpected places. People are determined not to be pushed around by the great powers, principally by the United States of America. One has some sympathy for this point of view because, as I said earlier, k is the will and the desire of every man to live a free life and not be subservient to any other man. The same principle applies to nations. No free nation would willingly abandon its freedom or willingly sacrifice its integrity and independence to become the kind of satellite that is found in the Soviet system. No country cheerfully accepts being bullied or being pushed about. This is quite an understandable feeling or emotion. But it is quite wrong to be influenced by that feeling in this present instance. Our purpose in going into South Vietnam is not to go to thc support of the American troops or even primarily to go to the support of the South Vietnamese. Our objective in South Vietnam is to discharge our obligations under the United Nations Charter. We believe in the universal rule of law and we believe in working for it. We took an active part in framing the Charter and we have subscribed to it. We realise that if one looks to the rule of law one must have the means of enforcing it. It is up to those countries which recognise the rule of law and which work for it throughout the world to take whatever steps they can to see that it is enforced. That is what we are trying to do, and therefore we are supporting the principles and purposes of the United Nations. One cannot have a higher moral obligation than that or a higher call on the respect and enthusiasm of all people who love freedom.

122,Mr James (Hunter) [4.31],"Mrthcy do not want. The principles of the 1954 Geneva Agreements have frequently been mentioned in this Parliament. I want to quote some statements made in this chamber by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) and the present Governor General Designate, Mr Casey, as he then was, in 1954. On 5th August of that year, in a debate on international affairs with particular relation to South East Asia and Vietnam, the Prime Minister saidI make these remarks not because I desire even President Eisenhower is on record as havto appear to resist the development of democracy ing said in relation to Vietnam in an address in other communities; on thc contrary, it is one of the great hopes of the world. My reason for sayto State Governors on 4th August 1953ing what I have on this point is to emphasise that thc probabilities in Vietnam, both north and south of the line of division now established, are that the most organised groups will be the Communists themselves. We must, therefore, not overlook the possibility that a free election may be an election which establishes a Communist administration in the whole of Vietnam. We would do well, therefore, to consider the significance of Indo-China, not by assuming easily that the frontier of the Viet Minh is on the 17th parallel, but by contemplating that before long we may be forced toregard the Communist frontier as lying on the southern shores of Indo-China. . . .

Yet thc United States claims to be boys be given a choice of whether they will one of the leaders of democracy and to be sent to South Vietnam. We believe that believe in the right of the people to the they should have the same right of choice free choice of governments. Statements such that the Prime Minister had at the outbreak as this have come from prominent leaders of World WarI when he was a member of in the western world. What hypocrites they the Melbourne University Rifles Regiment. are to make statements about people being given a choice in electing a government when they are deliberately preventing them Prime Minister is on record in this Parfrom doing so. I do not believe that any honourable memrefer to one of the first of the 12 or 18 ber wants to see Communism spread one leaders that that country has had in the last inch further in the world, but I do believe 12 years. The Prime Minister is on record in the principle expressed in the United as saying that President Diem was a brave, Nations Charter which states that every honest little man. But when we look at the nation is entitled to self determination. We are supposed to be upholding the principles of the United Nations yet we are spilling Australian blood, together with that of the American boys in Vietnam, to prevent the people of that little country from choosing a government that they wish. able member knows that that is the truth. If we lose it we lose the tin and the tungsten which we so greatly value and it would be lost immediately, so 400 million dollars voted is not a give away.

123,Mr Giles,What rot.,59,Internationa L Affairs
124,Mr James,"It is not rot. The honorinformation available to honourable members in the Library we find that Diem was brought back from the United States and was installed as the President of South Vietnam by the United States authorities. President Diem is on record as having personally ordered the burning down of 300 Buddhist pagodas and imprisoning 3,000 Buddhist monks, many of whom were tortured, imprisoned and put to death. This caused the great majority of Buddhists, who comprised between 70 per cent, and 80 per cent, of the population of South Vietnam, to join forces with the Communist Vietcong. The Buddhists sighed with relief when President Diem was assassinated, and when General Khanh assumed the role of Prime Minister they thought the situation might be a little better. However, they were disillusioned because, on General Khanh's orders, 100 Buddhist pagodas were burnt down and more than 200 Buddhist monks were arrested, tortured and disembowelled. We can also learn from a Library volume on South East Asia that, under the Diem regime, mobile courts moved about the country and tried people who had been arrested for being in possession of a packet made by the Minister for External Affairs of cigarettes or a box of matches that had originated in North Vietnam. The possession of such articles was alleged to be subAffairs( Mr Hasluck) to add his comments versive and was regarded as sufficient evidence for them to be imprisoned for many years. We learn also from the ""British Far Eastern Review "", a conservative magazine printed in Hong Kong, at page 476 of the edition of 18th March, that more than 2,000 Government troops deserted during the New Year festival. Yet honourable members opposite maintain that we are fighting on behalf of the majority of the Vietnamese people. In November 1963 an article appeared in the ""New York Herald Tribune"" which stated that despite the State Department's denial, the United States Government was involved in the uprising and the revolt which brought about the assassination of President Diem, and in that article the United States was accused of being responsible for that action. I said earlier that 1 would refer to a statement made in this House some years ago by the Governor General Designate, Lord Casey. In a debate on South East Asia on 10th August 1954, Mr Casey, as he then was, was reported at page 97 of "" Hansard"" as sayinglt is enough to say that no Korean settlement was arrived at. In April, the French and Vietnam forces were waging an unequal conflict at Dien Bien Phu against the Vietminh. Talk of intervention, particularly in the air, in order to save the situation, was being widely canvassed at that time. Our Australian view was that such intervention would be wrong for the following reasons:was then Minister for External Affairs and who is now Governor General Designate of Australia. He said that intervention would be wrong for the following reasonsIt would not have the backing of the United Nations. It would put us in wrong with world opinion, particularly in Asia. It would probably embroil us with Communist China. It would wreck the Geneva conference, and it was most unlikely to stop the fall of Dien Bien Phu. These were the views that 1 expressed on behalf of the Australian Government to Mr Dulles, Mr Eden, and other leaders at Geneva. I would like to hear the comments of Government supporters on that statement in this Parliament on 10th August 1954 and I would like the Minister for External on that statement. I have referred to a speech in which Lord Casey said that the great majority of the people in South East Asia would be against us. How true that is. What is the position today? The peoples in Asia who support United States foreign policy in Vietnam number 180 million. They are the peoples of the Republic of China, South Korea, Laos, South Vietnam, Turkey, the Philippines, Iran, Thailand and Malaya. But the peoples who are opposed to that policy number 1,470 million. They are the peoples of China. India, Japan, Pakistan, Indonesia, North Korea, Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Burma, Afghanistan and Ceylon. The Governments of those nations have all expressed strong resentment at the policies being pursued in South Vietnam by the United States Government.

134,Mr Hayden,"I raise a point of order.The honourable member for Hunter( Mr So, we must look at Ho Chi Minh and James) presented such a miasma of so-called facts that I do not think there is any need to reply to him. He referred to Cambodia. He ought to realise that Cambodia paid Australia the compliment of asking us to represent it in Saigon. That completely refutes his suggestion that Cambodia is in any way unfriendly to us. When one picks up any newspaper at the present time or listens to any newscast, the picture one' finds is not cong and now he is very obviously and very very pretty. In a sense, it may seem like the agony of the world. Many countries are living in a state of tension. Countries are separating from one another. There are serious riots in America. In short, what has come so much to the forefront in recent weeks is a fair demonstration of man's ageold inhumanity to man. Australia may quite deservedly be called list after Vietnam. From the knowledge that the lucky country. But for how long will I have of the position, I have no doubt that that be so? We do not know the daily terrors the Thais themselves believe that. If South that people live by or live wilh in other Vietnam were to go I am not too sure that countries: We do not know at first hand of the Thais would find themselves in a tenable the suppression of the liberty of people, the position. Laos and Cambodia are very much suppression of nations and the daily toll of uncommitted nations. They are not strong life which, in fact, is being taken in many nations.

The real point is: Are we going Malaya at the present time there is substanto stand by idly, like a pack of blind fools tial encroachment and infiltration by Comand, in our own comfort, do precisely nomunist forces. So if we have the sense to thing about it? I am not saying this in any look practically at South Vietnam to sec sanctimonious way. I simply believe that vvhat it means we will see that if this key is this is something that too few of us have dislodged it may well mean the ultinvile the honesty to face.

In doing so, obviously I must may. start at the very beginning of the situation that exists there. To begin with, one must look at the role of China in this area. China people of South Vietnam, who have enat the present time is dominating and for dured this war since 1954, are nothing more some time past has dominated the whole of nor less than the victims of China's very South East Asia like a colossus or like a real plan for the complete domination of very heavy cloud. Normally one would call South East Asia. One of the really outit a dark cloud, but these days one must standing facts is that with all of these incall it a red cloud. We cannot think of tense pressures no political party or group South Vietnam in isolation from China, bein South Vietnam has sought in any way cause it is in the scheme of things in China's to treat or to deal with the Vietcong or the imperialist approach to South East Asia. For National Liberation Front.

That attack certainly is aided the temptations of power, the South Vietand directed by the National Liberation namese are firmly determined to resist Front which, of course, is directed by Ho Chi Minh. see what kind of a man he is. It is well known to everbody who takes the trouble to read anything about his history that he is an extreme Marxist and leftist. He was trained extensively in Moscow. He is an ardent supporter of Mao Tse-tung and an author and expert on guerrilla warfare. Ho has repeatedly and openly preached destruction of all the people opposing the Vietdirectly trying to stir up trouble in countries neighbouring South Vietnam. So, whether anybody likes it or not, this war is clearly a war of survival for Vietnam and in the long run is clearly a war of survival for South East Asia. No one with any knowledge of South East Asia would doubt that China has Thailand next on the Asia. Whether we like il or not, we are a of South East Asia. We are very much a part of it, although we are Europeans. Thc dreadful thing is that the war weary",61,Internationa L Affairs

136,Mr Falkinder (Franklin) [4.52],"Communists overrunning their country. Knowing that, Ho Chi Minh has refused to allow any situation which could permit normal free elections in South Vietnam. With complete arrogance and cold confidence that he can crush South Vietnam, he refuses any unconditional offers to talk. The only terms in which he is interested are his own, with the complete absence of opposition of any kind. I ask: What has happened to the Labour Party on this issue? Its present policy is to that will solve the war by military means. do no more and no less than to abandon these people to a horrible fate. In this resubstance when he says that it is very imporspect Labour Party policy is inhuman, inhumane and callous in the extreme. Members of the Labour Party satisfy their so-called consciences by saying: ""Let the United Nations deal with this "". If only the United Nations would; if only the United Nations could. This afternoon the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) demonstrated in pretty clear terms just how much power or lack of power the United Nations has, in fact, in the General Assembly and in the Security Council with the veto obtaining. It bas to be pointed out to those people who conveniently have forgotten it, that the United Nations has tried. South East Asia is land reform. Land reform It has to be pointed out that U Thant went to Peking and Hanoi. The United Kingdom sent Mr Gordon Walker and he was rejected out of hand. The United States has offered, completely unconditionally, to support the United Nations or to talk with North Vietnam on any terms. Each time the North Vietnamese, Hanoi and Peking have completely rejected President Johnson's offer. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers tried. As honourable members know, quite recently Mr Harold Davies tried, and he was rejected. India tried and it was rejected. Seventeen nonaligned nations tried and they were rejected. said that two thirds of South Vietnam was Even President Tito tried and he was rejected. In the face of that, what kind of conditions does Ho Chi Minh want? The obvious answer to that question is that he wants only his own conditions. Nobody can say that genuine and real attempts have not been made. The attempts that have been made have been most exhaustive. But every one of them has met with a positive, blank refusal. No one, least of all Australia, has any territorial ambitions in South Vietnam. The United States most positively has not. The only ambition that we have is to see that in the long run the people of South Vietnam will have the right to determine their own future and their own destiny. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) said: ""The war cannot be solved by military means alone"". In part I agree with him; in part I disagree with him. I disagree with him if the situation should be that Ho Chi Minh wins, because obviously But I suggest that his statement has some tant that effort should be put into economic aid for the country. The ideological war or the war against plain hunger is another war which has to be won as well as the military war. It ought to be pointed out that at present 33 nations are giving social and economic aid to South Vietnam. It also ought to be reiterated that President Johnson has offered 1,000 million dollars of economic aid for the whole of South East Asia. That includes South Vietnam. One burning question which has not been discussed much but which is important in has begun in South Vietnam. As one who is very keen on seeing land reform expedited wherever possible in South East Asia, I am not completely satisfied that it has been expedited sufficiently. For people who live on the land, it is fundamental that they own their own land, however small their plot may be. I believe that one of the firmest grounds on which the economic and ideological side of this war can be won is for the South Vietnamese Government to accelerate land reform. I regard that as essential. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition was in pretty serious error when he controlled by the Vietcong. I am quite sure that he made the error of making the assessment on area and not on population. If he were to examine the facts he would find that two thirds of the population are within the control of the existing Government. I might mention in passing that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hunter, spoke about Buddhists being executed. Perhaps he is not aware of, or perhaps he overlooked, the fact that Air ViceMarshal Ky is a Buddhist. I said earlier tliat these were a war weary people. They are. They have been engaged in a war since 1954 and during that period they have had 80,000 casualties. That in itself would be a terrible loss to any country. At the present time the strength of the Vietcong is of the order of 45,000 hard core troops, 15,000 support troops and 100,000 irregular troops. So the force that is fighting the existing Government is of the order of 160,000. The South Vietnamese Government has troops of varying grades and quality which number approximately half a million. The people of South Vietnam can be divided roughly into four distinct groups. There are the Buddhists who constitute about 70 per cent, of the population, the Hoa Hao who number U million, the Cao Dai the number of whom is about the same, and the Catholics who' number l i miUion. Of those H million people the greater part of 1 million are refugees from North Vietnam. They probably are the strongest elements of the anti-Communist forces in the south. The others are by no means Comniunist sympathisers, but those to whom I have referred are the strongest anti-Communist element. It is interesting to note that, although there are 46 provincial cities in the 46 provinces, not one is in the hands of the Vietcong. Of course, that is where the majority of the population lives. the same as that from Sydney to Perth. It is in this area that in recent times the Anybody who travels from Sydney to Government has been able to move Perth nowadays does not regard that as approximately 400,000 persons to relative being a very long trip. The distance from safety. There has been some discussion earlier we note that we are not remote from what today about elections. In May or June, I is going on in South Vietnam. Geographithink, of this year there was a provincial cally, we arc very close. I have said that election at which 3,500 people voted. This we are in Asia. We are part of Asia.

I believe that is one important subject of foreign affairs some of the reasons why there may be considerquite significant statements were made by able difficulty about holding an election at the Government on the subject of defence. the moment. It is completely forgotten by those who argue the extreme leftist viewpoint on behalf of the Labour Party that a similar situation existed in Korea and to a very large extent in Berlin. I do not know whether anybody regarded the war in Korea as being a civil war. Two thirds of the population of Korea lived in South Korea. As a result of a strong stand by the United Nations and other countries, some of whom are now involved in South Vietnam, it was possible to give those people the right to determine their own future and to remain independent, as they are at the present time. The people of West Berlin are free-in the sense in which we use the term as opposed to the meaning that the Communists ascribe to it. Those people are free simply because certain nations were prepared to support them. Was that what one would describe as interfering in other people's internal business? Those involved were protecting the right of certain people to determine their own destiny and were protecting them from being murdered in hundreds of thousands. Undeniably that is what would occur if South Vietnam were to be overrun. Yet some people would describe the war in Vietnam as being a civil war. Many people do not realise that the distance from Saigon to Sydney is almost Saigon to Darwin is the same as that from Brisbane to Darwin. When we think in those terms, which we readily understand, The first was made during the presentation",62,Internationa L Affairs
137,Mr Hayden (Oxley) [5.10],"Duringof the Budget, which provided for the greatest annual expenditure on defence since the last war. That in itself is understandable, because the equipment of the Australian forces had largely been allowed to run down. Instead of adopting a system of gradual and constant replacement over the years, the Government allowed this rundown to occur and now suddenly it has presented us with this accumulated shortage. That is the main reason for our large defence bill. The other significant statement by the Government prior to the Minister's statement on foreign policy concerned the increased commitment of Australian regular troops to the war in Vietnam and the proposal to increase the number of 20 year old youths to be conscripted for military service next year. Both of these statements were quite momentous in themselves. They seemed to imply many considerations. Therefore, one would have expected that, when the Minister for External Affairs made his policy statement last night, he would have dwelt for some time on the two statements I have mentioned. When all is said and done, the lives of young Australians are involved. It may fairly be inferred from the statements already made by the Government that quite a number of our 20 year old conscripts will lose their lives in the foetid jungles of Vietnam. Instead of listening to some momentous statement from the Minister about what the Government proposes for the future; instead of hearing an outline of the plan and the principles that rhe Government is pursuing in its approach to our commitment in Vietnam and what it hopes to achieve, all we got from the Minister was a vague assertion that the aim was to hold the Vietgong. After that there was a vacuum. The conceptions of our commitment, our strategy, in Vietnam do not extend beyond this point. Instead of listening to an interestpromptly said: ""There will not be an elecing, absorbing and indeed very important speech, we found that we had traversed much ground that had been traversed on many occasions previously. In fact, the Minister delivered his speech like the flat pedantic dialogue of a bored conducted tour guide who is tired of telling the same story often and who is doubtful anyway about whether all the virtues he acclaims do exist. The only candid statement that I have daily life in peace under the rule of governbeen able to find about the Government's ments of their own choice. Perhaps he did involvement in Vietnam comes from a recently appointed Minister, Senator McKellar who is Minister for Repatriation. This candid statement is rather shocking. The report of his comments which appears in the "" Australian "" of l l t h August statesAustralia was in Vietnam to ensure American help in the future. . . . ""This is why we have had to face up to the position in Vietnam This is the only reason, mind youand give aid to our allies. If we did not agree to send our troops what would happen in the years to come if we got into a pickle and appealed to our allies in the United States?"" In other words, what he was saying was that it comes down to this simple denominator: The Government is bidding on the international stock exchange of power where deals are made with human lives. It was not a matter of considering the virtues or the principles involved in the war in Vietnam; it was a plain, straight out power deal so far as this Government was concerned without regard to social and economic problems. I have made it clear in the past that I believe this is a oivil war. I have no less an authority to support me than President Kennedy and his statement in 1961. I have quoted it in this House before. What hope does the Minister for External Affairs hold out? He made some wan suggestion about a return to the Geneva Agreement of 1954. What he either conveniently forgets or intentionally neglects to mention is why the war in Vietnam is being fought. One of the conditions of the Agreement was that there should be an election in 1956 on the future of North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The Diem regime, which this Government applauds, was deposited in office without any reference to the people of the South Vietnam area. Diem tion. I am holding on to this territory."" This Government applauded him for that. In other words, it was party to the tearing up of the Agreement. The Minister now says that there was some benefit, some virtue, in this. He also mentioned-thi s was about the sum-total of the principles that he enunciated, as far as I could see-in respect of the future of this country, that the aim should be for the people to go about their not hear the Prime Minister's contribution to the debate on Vietnam on 4th May this year. The Prime Minister thought it was rather a humorous suggestion to have elections in South Vietnam and indeed he first of all upheld the approach of the Diem regime in abrogating the commitment of the Geneva Conference Agreement of 1954 and rejecting the elections which were to decide the future of North and South Vietnam. Although he did not actually say that I am sure that he meant it because, if he did not mean it, it means he had not done his homework on the subject of Vietnam. I am sure he also meant that there was no need for free elections in the community for the local legislature. But in saying this he condemned himself because the Diem regime did, in fact, hold elections for the local legislature. Once again, I have no intention of going into the details of this because I have already mentioned them in this House on a previous occasion. I am sure the Prime Minister must be purposeless Prime Minister of the present. aware of the ignominious way in which Dr. It is quite well known that this country seems Dan was ejected from his rightful position to drift without design or guidance and he in the legislature of South Vietnam by the just presides over its course.

This is well vouchsafed for in the Tf we examine the Prime Minister's statepolitical writings of this country. He rules ment we find that the discussion about ruthlessly. This autocratic trait is part of Australia's commitment to Vietnam took his character. He is consistent, not only in place between the Governments of the wielding this power in his own party but United States of America and Australia. The in lauding it in people like Diem.

There was only one delaying ""Sydney Morning Herald"" as saying on factor-the Government of South Vietnam 28th October 1938 in an address at the Constitutional Club. He saidWhy was Hitler able to tear up the Treaty ot Versailles, absorb Austria and the Sudentenland without firing a shot? The dominating reason why he was able to do it all is that he gives the German people a leadership to which they render unquestioning obedience. If you and I were Germans sitting beside our ownfiresin Berlin, we would not be critical of the leadership of such results. Minister. Can you not see in the phrasing the lingering longing for a similar chance to wield autocratic power? So we have one facet of the background of the Prime Minister's character. The noisy Jingoistic belligerence of the Prime Minister explains the authoritarianism which is part and parcel of the Government's foreign policy. There is another side that can be found in his history as an administrator. He was the reluctant dragoon of World War I, the partyless premier of World War II and he is the We find the Prime Minister prepared to Another risk is that in helping Asians we might limit their freedom by making decisions compare the Minister's statement with the Prime Minister's remarks reported on page",64,Internationa L Affairs

139,Mr Hayden,"Our present Primehad not been consulted. It had to be consulted and told that it had to make a request for the despatch of Australian troops to Vietnama matter which had already been arranged. In other words, as we well know, the Government of South Vietnam is a puppet Government. It has no right to claim that it represents the people. It does not have the capacity to express the attitudes of the people of South Vietnam. We have the statement of Henry Cabot Lodge reported in the Brisbane ""Sunday Truth"" on 15th August. Mr Lodge, the present American Ambassador in Saigon, announced thatThe United States would not leave South Vietof vice, crime, poverty, suffering and want. nam even if the Saigon Government asked it to pull out. We have people like Senator McKellar saying that it is better to fight the Communists outside Australia's territory and not on the Australian mainland. This seems to be a catch cry of Government members: "" Let us fight it in someone else's yard, not our own"". I do not know whether they realise the effect this is having on a lot of Asian minds who now regard the war in Vietnam as someone else's war being fought in an Asian country. It is obvious that the Government wants to fight our battles in someone else's country. The Government sees these conflicts, and the turmoil, problems and trouble that arise from them, in terms of armed might. This is its retaliation. There is to be no attack on the social and economic problems of those countries. Last night the Minister for External Affairs made a most revealing statement. He said something that I have felt for some time and, indeed on occasions, expressed. But there is nothing like having the official imprimatur on one's conceptions of what is taking place. He was referring to the appointment of governments in Vietnam and I interjected: "" Who chose this Government?"" The Minister repliedIt is a government which has been accepted by the people of South Vietnam. How does he arrive at that decision? The people of South Vietnam have never had a chance to decide which Government should be in power. They have been left so spellbound and breathless by the rapidity with which governments move in and out that they would not know which government is administering their country. Let us get to the one and only quality that is required of a government to be appointed in South Vietnam. According to the Minister for External Affairs the answer lies in what he said last night. He saidEvery government that has come to power in South Vietnam and endured there has come there on the sole principle of resisting the Vietcong and continuing this struggle. Note that this is the sole principle. It does not matter if the government stands for corruption, oppression, cruel dictatorship and discrimination-al l of which past governments of Vietnam have stood for. It does not matter if there is a perpetuation It does not matter that the government maintains a feudalistic, exploiting land system within the country. None of these things matters so long as the government resists the Vietcong. Our Government is not interested in the social and economic considerations; all it wants is a government in Vietnam which will resist the Vietcong. This is the only virtue or quality that is required. It does not matter that they are thugs, murderers, gangsters. This is an amazing statement. Of course, on the other hand, the Minister does lay claim to a very handy slogan -hand y because of its emotive value. It is: We cannot remain neutral. How many times have we heard this? We cannot remain neutral in the face of aggression! Do not bother to interpret what "" neutral"" means! Do not try to analyse what "" aggression "" involves! Just utter the slogan because it has a good emotional value and it will intimidate the people in the community who will be frightened to disagree because it will impute disloyalty. What ridiculous rot. Are we going to make a decision and come down on some one's side in connection with the continuing conflict between Israel and the Arab States? If honourable members take the point that they are interested only where there is Communist influence how do they get on in a situation of conflict such as exists between Pakistan and India? Pakistan is getting assistance and encouragement from China, and India is getting assistance and encouragement from Russia. This is an interesting dilemma. I should like to hear the Minister for External Affairs discourse on this at some time, because after all this is an important element of the arguinto the Dominican Republic in comp!ete ment which members of the Government put up. These glorious freedom fighters opposite maintain-and this is another reason for our involvement in Vietnamthat we are there to fight for these freedoms. They do not bother to define the freedoms. I would really like the Prime Minister or the Minister for External Affairs or other members of the Government to define what are these freedoms. Is it freedom for the people of those countries to suffer from malnutrition, beri-beri, hookworm, endemic disease, high infant mortality rates, a low life expectancy and an exploitative feudal system? All these are things we have done little or nothing to rectify during the centuries we as colonial powers have been in a position to do something about them. Arc these the freedoms Government supporters want to perpetuate and fight for? If honourable members opposite really want to fight for freedom-and that is what they claim to represent-wh y have they not done something about the oppression of the coloured people in South Africa? Where does the Government stand on that issue? These people surely have a right to freedom and an entitlement to consideration. My good friend, the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant), has asked: "" What about freedom for the aborigines? What about equality for those coloured people?"" My goodness, for how many years has the fight taken place in this House? For how long has fhe struggle persisted for voting rights for the aboriginal population of this country? is a main cause of dissension is once again The honourable member for Wills has been the leader and greatest protagonist in this field. It is not good enough when there is a social or economic upheaval in a depressed or underdeveloped country immediately to declare it to be part of the international Communist movement inspired by the Red forces. I know it is comfortable. I know it is convenient. It saves the 'hard work of exploring all the delicate implications of internal social and economic upheavals which derive from a nationalistic spirit in those countries. But it does not solve the problem. We must consider the heritage of our children and their children and the future that we are carving out for them. That is what they will have to live with if we are to declare these things in such simple terms and then move in as I rather regret the United States of America moved contravention of international law and of the United Nations Charter, to quell what was allegedly a Communist insurrection and which, in fact, tunned out to be nothing more than a rebellion aimed at social reform, led by moderate forces. Of the 58 people documented by the United States as Communists taking part in the leadership of the rebellion, some had their names mentioned twice and some had been dead for some time. If this type of thing is to go on, if we are just to move into the underdeveloped countries whenever they have some sort of nationalistically inspired social and economic rebellion and incriminate them as Communist, we will deny them their entitlement to a better way of life. It seems to me to be horribly cruel and unfair that we should live in such affluence while other people suffer such impoverishment. If we are to move in to quell these movements by decisions outside the United Nations and stand for maintenance of the status quo and the perpetuation al] too often of an extreme form of dictatorship, eventually, and in a very short time, there will be complete destruction of the United Nations. Very briefly tihe Minister for External Affairs last night dealt with the United Nations but did not bother to define the real problem of the future of the United Nations. 1 think the suggestion that thc non-payment of fees by France and Russia an over-simplification. In fact, it is more than that. It is dragging a red herring across the course. What will undermine the United Nations and destroy world peace is, first, the unilateral action of a world peace force from the West, and, secondly, the refusal of people like those on the opposite side of the chamber to have any trust in mankind and to invest any hope in the future. They absolutely refuse to support social and economic movements for nationalistic achievement in the underprivileged or underdeveloped countries of the world. 1 wholeheartedly support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition and suggest that unless this Government completely refurbishes its thinking on the problem of Vietnam, we will reap a very sorry harvest for future generations. member's time has expired.

We do not even want to win in the ordinary sense of defeating the enemy and forcing him to abject surrender. In the campaigns, military and politicomilitary, in which the Americans, British, Australians and New Zealanders and their friends within the non-Communist world have been involved since the end of the Second World War, on no single occasion have we or our allies operated to gain anything for ourselves, and on no single occasion have we operated except with the clear perception that in human and financial terms we would suffer. In every incident we and our allies have operated to preserve freedom and to protect a people from being overrun. In every incident we have acted to put a limit to the further expansion of prethis issue. So the Communists will not datory Communism. Where the British, Americans, Australians, New Zealanders and others have operated with this as their motive and wilh the strength of resolution and moral righteousness, they have never failed. Here is the record. West Berlin was pretroops should come home? If so, should served from being overrun by the immense resolution of the Americans, the British and the French in their great air lift operation, to the point where the Communists abandoned their blockade, which was designed to subjugate the city. The terrorists in Malaya and their Communist masters and supporters from outside Malaya abandoned their campaign when they realised that they could not succeed. The tremendous conflict in Korea was brought to a halt and negotiations were subquestion. Such a suggestion is humbug. stituted forfightingwhen the Communists of North Korea and their Chinese backers came to understand that they could not win. The Russians took home their missiles from Cuba when they made the correct assessment of the resolution of President Kennedy and the American people. The Pathet Lao Communists in Laos came to a composition when they realised that they could not win. The celerity and strength of the American appearance in Lebanon were sufficient to preserve peace there when that country was threatened. This is the pattern all around the perimeter of the central fortress of Communism. These recurring attempts to expand by force and subversion have been made. Americans and the British, with whom we have stood and with whom the New Zealanders have stood, has succeeded in its intended purpose. The purpose has never been to smash the aggressor into utter defeat. The purpose has always been to substitute negotiation for fighting. But there is no incident where the Communists have been willing to negotiate until the point was reached when they were forced to conclude that they could not succeed in their aggression through military activity. So we are fighting to win a peace. What is the alternative proposition of those who disagree with this? The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) last night gave a convincing reply to the suggestion that economic aid alone would settle negotiate. What then is the proposition? Is is that we should retire in front of the aggressive North Vietnam and its shadowy Chinese Communist partner just because they will not negotiate for peaceful settlement? Is it Labour's proposition that our the Americans also go home? For a long time neither American nor Australian personnel in South Vietnam fired a shot, but shots were fired at them. Being there but not fighting has proved to be unrealistic. For Australia, far more so than for the United States, this is not just a local conflict of ideologies. To attempt to dismiss it or to shrug it off as a civil conflict because Vietnamese are fighting Vietnamese begs the South Vietnam is the only fighting front in the world today where the forces of freedom are actuallyfightingthe Communistsfighting for peace, security and all the objectives which the Leader of the Opposition enumerated and with which he agrees. To suggest, as some have done, that this is a war that the forces of freedom cannot win and that Australia should not have become involved militarily is to ignore the realities of the matter-to ignore the sad history of failures to achieve peace by any other means. So we have entered the fight in order to make it sufficiently clear to the North strating in South Vietnam and Malaysia, we Vietnamese that they cannot win the war. can expect our voice to be heard and When this is clear to them and only then listened to by those with whom we are will they be prepared to come to the conworking to reduce tension and put an end ference table and agree to terms of peace. to the fighting.

How does the Government affect involving sacrifice which do show that there the mind of all hesitant people in Asia when it carries out a policy which, frankly, I think means that it values money or trade more than the lives of its own sons? Let me say this for Peking. I do not believe that Peking would give Australia war materials if directly or indirectly those materials were to lead to the death of its own people. If that is the case Peking must regard this Australian form of materialism as inferior to its own, and certainly presenting no model of superior values. I believe that the Government would make a real moral impact on Asia if it were to ask the Australian taxpayers to pay £50 million a year to buttress the food supplies of India, and were to sacrifice the China trade; to The Government's denunciations of China strategy, trade, military policy and everyare certain great things for which you stand.

148,Mr Beazley,"In the little time that Subandrio wrote a letter in the "" New Yorkmerits or demerits of his dispute with Lee Kuan Yew notwithstanding, he remains a very significantfigurefor this country. The last thing that I want to say about this situation in South East Asia is this: What is the vast change that has taken place? The vast change over the last 25 years is that the Pax Britannica has disappeared. At one stage, from what was the Indian Empire-no w India, Burma, Pakistan and Ceylon-and right through South East Asia, underwriting the Dutch in what was the Netherlands East Indies, British power and influence emanated to the whole of South and South East Asia making it a region of ultimate effective British decision. There was defence in depth. When the Japanese took what is now Malaysia, the retreat could be towards Burma and then towards India, but the power to spring back at Malaya and the independent position of Britain in Asia were both rendered possible by her possession of India. The Pax Britannica is obviously not going to be restored, but instinctively the people of Malaysia invoked it again when they called for British and other Commonwealth troops. The dangerous thing that is happening is that wherever Chinese influence can be exerted, whether it is her new influence on Pakistan, her influence on Burma, her direct influence across the border onto India, her pressure on Nepal and the influence she formerly exerted on the former Government of Ceylon, it is always directed towards needling India-to driving Tamils out of Ceylon, to driving Indians out of Burma destitute, to heightening the tension over Kashmir, to intimidating Nepal, which provides a very large number of India's troops, and to producing social collapse of India. Tbe fragmentation and stultification of India arc essential to Chinese supremacy. We cannot restore the Pax Britannica, but we can work for a stable progressive India, and it is my belief that it is not the function of Australia or the Australian people to use the resources of this country just to have an affluent society ourselves. I believe that it is our function in this part of the world to use the agricultural, mineral and other resources of this country, and above all the resources of national character, to meet the great need for stability and purpose in the world beginning movement of an amendment by the Leader in the whole of South Asia. I believe that of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). The terms we need to work for will, mind and purpose in Asia and for the transformation of Indian agriculture, which badly needs fertilisers. We need to work for the transformation of Indian food standards partly by the diversion of that China trade to which I referred earlier. We will then begin creating stability and strength behind Malaysia. If India collapses under Chinese pressureand remember it is the Chinese aim to fragment India-Malaysia' s position and South East Asia will be untenable. Prime Minister) [8.8] Mr Speaker, I must say that I listened with great interest and some pleasure to the remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) in relation to Malaysia, because I think that this problem requires a cool judgment and a just appreciation of what has been done, and with what he said on that point I find myself in complete agreement. We have hopesI hope that they are well foundedfor a genuine co-operation between Malaysia and the newly independent State of Singapore. We have a friendship for both. We wish them both well, but we do desire above all things that on those matters on which co-operation between them is of great importance they will find it possible to co-operate in the most effective way. I do not desire to say any more tonight about Malaysia although it could lend itself to a good deal of discussion because this debate has concentrated itself around the problem of Vietnam. Here, again, I feel under some little embarrassment because several speeches have been made in the course of this debate which state so effectively the essence of the matter that, coming as I do tonight, I must feel that I am engaging in tedious repetition. But, still, this is a matter of immense controversy. I have been challengedI do not know why-mor e than once to state the Government's position. I thought I had stated it pretty crisply. Therefore, with great respect to my colleague the made a brilliant exposition of this matter this afternoon, and others who have spoken, I will just put it in my own way tonight in the hope that I can say something reasonably comprehensive. The debate began as a debate by the",74,Internationa L Affairs
149,Sir Robert Menzies (Kooyong,,75,Internationa L Affairs
150,Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Mcewen) Who,"of the amendment are before honourable members. I just want to refer to one or two aspects. The amendment reads"" this House urges the Government I think this is what might be called the operative part of it to strive for a cease fire now, to be policed by a United Nations peace-keeping force, and for a conference of all parties directly involved, insors are defeated, or unless they abandon cluding representatives of both the Government in Saigon and the Vietcong, to seek a settlement which will both end the agony of the Vietnamese people and establish their right to choose their own government. My friend, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen), submitted this to a somewhat devastating examination, I thought, this afternoon but I must say something on my own account. The first part of the amendment is taken, of course, from the Prime Minister's Conference. The honourable gentleman must be aware of the terms of the resolution carried at the Prime Minister's Conference, and the setting up by that conferencea matter to which I shall refer a little later-of a mission designed to ascertain whether there was some basis upon which a conference could be held. To the extent that he adopts that resolution, of which I was one of the promoters, I welcome some bipartisan policy on this vexed matter. He speaks about the representation of the Vietcong. I do not want to be dogmatic about a matter of this kind because, compared with some other aspects of this problem, it is not the greatest of matters. But I would have thought that there was some difficulty about having representation of the Vietcong in such a conference, if we obtained such a conference, because it would seem to present difficulties of a kind that would be inevitable in the case of guerrillas who always work under cover and are not always susceptible to conference. Such direct representation would not be necessary now, strictly speaking, because what is the Vietcong? It represents the hands which are ordered by the voice of Hanoi. Do not let us forget that. In any conference, if we were lucky enough to get one, what Hanoi said would go with the Vietcong. Make no mistake about this. Therefore, it is with Hanoi, and behind that, with Peking that an effective conference needs to occur. Then, finally, the Leader of the Opposition said, I thought rather piously, that the Vietnamese ought to be enabled to establish their right to choose their own government. That is, in one sense, although not in every sense, what this war is about-the right to choose their own government. They will have no right to choose their own government-non e whatever-unles s the aggrestheir activities. I would have thought that, in famous words, every school boy would know that to be true. I turn from the terms of the amendment to offer a few observations on some aspects of this matter which have given me great occasion for thought and on which 1 have arrived, I think, at clear views, and on which I think I ought to state those views. A lot of people in Australia today-a t any rate, quite a few who write letters, sign petitions, pass resolutions, or make speeches somewhere or other-hav e as their theme: You must negotiate. They have a beautiful antithesis here. You either negotiate or you become involved in military operations. You cannot do both. I have been accused of over-simplification. About that one, all 1 can say is: "" O sancta simplicitas "". You either say: "" We stand for negotiation"", and do nothing more about it, or you say: "" We want to negotiate but if the condition of getting to the point of negotiation is to have some fighting, then the fighting must be engaged in "" . Yet these people keep on writing letters, putting on rather anaemic looking demonstrations outside Parliament House and so on. They forget that negotiations for peace can be usefully engaged in only by the parties to the conflict. Honourable members do not suppose, do they, that two or three countries which have nothing whatever to do with it are going to have pleasant little negotiations and say: "" Now we have settled the argument.""? Therefore, the willingness of HanoiI use Hanoi to describe the North Vietnameseto negotiate is essential. Could anybody with his five wits, or even with four, deny that the willingness of Hanoi to negotiate is essential? If Hanoi is not willing, no negotiation can occur. On 10th March of this year, the Commander-in-Chief of North Vietnam, a very considerable functionary, after demanding unconditional withdrawal of American forces-Hanoi was always putting it up as National Liberation Front was established in a condition for negotiation-sai d the followThailand. In 1960, by order from Hanoi, ing words which I emphasiseThe problem of the peaceful reunification of now a subordinate part of the central office Vietnam is the affair of the Vietnamese people. So far, if I may say so, so good. He then South Vietnam. Yet, in spite of having went onIt will be settled by the Vietnam Fatherland Front in spite of having read from occasion to and the South Vietnamese Liberation Front. This is brilliant. It would be settled by the them academic and some of them no people, meaning the Communists-the doubt intelligent, and in spite of having parent Communist organisation and the cast my eye over these matters I have not, son Communist organisation in South Vietfrom first to last, been able to discover any nam. This deserves to go down in history as pressure being put by any of these people a classic of impudence, a classic of the on Hanoi. All the pressure has been put on denial of justice-the kind of democratic the defending countries like the United justice to which I would call the attention States and ourselves whose great desire is of my friends on the opposite benches. Mr Michael Stewart, not a member of rights of all the people of South Vietnam my party, but a distinguished Labour to self determination without external or Foreign Minister in Great Britain, has no internal armed threat and, we would hope, ambiguities in his mind on this matter. He under some form of international guarantee. made a speech on 1st April, and I think it is is worthwhile to recall what he said. His comment wasThe House will notice in that statementHe referred to the one that I have just I have noted these because I have been on mentionednot only that North Vietnam is not thinking in had otherwise rather enjoyed. They put up terms of conference and negotiation at all but that the affairs of Vietnam are subsequently to be propositions along these lines: "" If you besettled exclusively by Communist organisations and lieve that Communist armed aggression in that by these principlesThese are Mr Stewart's wordsno non-Communist in Vietnam would have any chance of taking part in framing the future of his of peace"". All honourable members have country. This view, of course, Is confirmed by North ""peace"" is a dirty word. The basis of the Vietnam itself. When approached by the 17 statement is that if you believe in the things unaligned countries, several of whom to my that I have just mentioned you are the direct knowledge as a result of conferences enemy of peace. But you have your choice. are heavily disposed in favour of North You have your way of escape. Tf you Vietnam, because they wanted to seek abandon Soutb Vietnam and do your best peace, the reply that they received from to persuade other nations, and in particular North VietnamI would hate to call it a the United States, to do likewise, in the dusty answer but it was certainly a dirty result you leave all of South East Asia to answer-wa s that the internal affairs of its fate and then, believe it or not, you are South Vietnam must be settled by the South the friend of peace. This is the new series Vietnamese people themselves, in accorof propositions which a lot of people, some dance with the programme of the South of whom are well meaning, have been Vietnam National Liberation Front, without advancing. Clearly such people are preany foreign interference. I only need remind the House, because price. I want to put it fairly comprehensively, that the National Liberation Front is a popular Communist technique nowadays. A of Australia adopted these views. Whas the National Liberation Front, which is operating from Hanoi, was established in received letters-no t too many, but someoccasion, not too closely, some of the statements made by various people, some of to achieve a just peace, protecting the By a singular feat of mental gymnastics some vocal people in our own country have worked out some astonishing propositions. the receiving end of one or two rather abusive remarks by people whose works I and against South Vietnam should be resisted in the common interest, including our own, by arms, then you are the enemy heard it stated that to us-o r is it to me?pared to secure peace by surrender or flight. In other words, they want peace at anv Suppose the people and the Government would be involved? 1 want to traverse this with some care because I think that our people have a right to understand exactly what is involved. I repeat-wha t would be involved? In the first place, we would need to S.E.A.T.O. and ANZUS. since each of these pacts involves mutuality of obligations. Wc have not heard much for some time about S.E.A.T.O. and ANZUS. It used to be rather a kind of parlour game in this House to argue about S.E.A.T.O. and ANZUS. and what they mean. I hope honourable members will forgive me if 1 remind them and place on record consecutively what they mean. In 1954 we passed an Act of Parliament to ratify the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty. The preamble to the Act was challenged by the then Leader of the Opposition but thc challenge was not carried to a vote. The challenge was that we had selected Communism and had not extended the provisions of the Bill to cover other forms of activity. In any case, the preamble was carried unanimously by both parties in this House with no division being sought. The preamble is in these termsWhereas the independence and integrity of the countries and territories of South East Asia and the South West Pacific are threatened by the aggressive policies of international Communism: And whereas those Communist policies have already shown themselves in Korea, Indo-China and elsewhere by armed aggression, by armed insurrection assisted from without and otherwise: And whereas those Communist policies represent a common danger to the security of Australia and of the world generally and are a violation of the principles and purposes of the Charter of thc United Nations. . . 1 have read sufficient of the preamble to the Bill which was passed by this House although, as I have indicated, it was criticised by the then Leader of the Opposition because it should have included a reference to Fascism as well as to Communism. There it is, now part of an Act of this Parliament. Now let me turn to the Treaty. [ do not think any honourable member dared to vote against the Treaty to which not only Australia but also New Zealand, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United Stales, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and France were parties. The preamble to the Treaty is as followsIntending to declare publicly and formally their sense of unity, so that any potential aggressor will oo any of the parties is deemed to include an appreciate that the Parties stand together in the area. . . Article II of the Treaty, a very important article, statesIn order more effectively to achieve the objectives repudiate our obligations under of this Treaty, the Parties, separately and jointlyLet the House mark those words ""separately and jointly""by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack and to prevent and counter subversive activities directed from without against their territorial integrity and political stability. Could there have been in anticipation a better description of what is going on in South Vietnam and what, as I will show, the Leader of the Opposition admits is going on in South Vietnam? I come now to Article IV of the Treaty. It readsEach Party recognises that aggression by means of armed attack in the treaty area against any of the Parties or against any State or territory which the Parties by unanimous agreement may hereafter designate: South Vietnam was unanimously so designatedwould endanger its own peace and safety, and agrees that itMeaning each partywill in that event act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes. . . . We, like the United States, have regarded that Treaty as imposing upon us separate as well as joint responsibilities. That is what the Treaty provided expressly and clearly. Later in the Article, of course-and I say this only to complete the story-it was provided that no action on the territory of any such designated State-South Vietnam, to wit-shal l be taken except at the invitation or with the consent of the Government concerned. In the case of South Vietnam, of course, this condition has been fulfilled. So much for S.E.A.T.O. What is our position under ANZUS., which was ratified by an Act of this Parliament in 1952? The treaty itself states in Article IV Each party recognises that an armed attack in the Pacific area on any of the parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes. Then there is a very interesting article from our point of view, Article V, which saysFor the purpose of Article IV an armed attack armed attack on the metropolitan territory of any of the parties That is, on Australia proper, to bring it right homeor on the island territories under its jurisdiction and which I hope will be read by all honorin the PacificIn our case, Papua and New Guinea, for been made towards a peaceful settlement. instanceor on its armed forces, public vessels or aircraft of them was made by Peking or Hanoi. Let in the Pacific. As the Pacific clearly means the Pacific goes to some meeting or teach-in or some area, an attack on troops, American troops, sit-in, as one honourable member described it Australian troops, New Zealand troops, is -and wants to be gulled by a lot of of the highest significance. 1 say no more about that answer to the made by Hanoi or Peking. question of what would be involved. I come now to the other answers to the question: What would be involved if we did what we are sometimes told we sihould do? The second result would be that we would be adopting a policy of isolation and neutrality. the Tonkin Gulf incident, Hanoi refused to There is no middle course here, just the attend. The people in Hanoi said that they adoption of a policy of isolation and had not started the trouble, and in any event neutrality, with, as a consequence, the they refused to attend. They said cateabandonment of any right to expect any gorically-and they have stuck to it ever other nation to aid us in our own defence. since-that the matter of Vietnam was not If it is good enough for us to be isolated within the competence of the Security Counor neutral then it is good enough for the cil. Yet there are some honourable members other man, so far as we are concerned, to who bamboozle themselves into believing be isolated or neutral. It would also involve that all you have to do is to take the matter the further adoption-and let us face up to the United Nations. Hanoi had no truck to this although it is a hard choice or a hard with such ideas, contending that the Vietproposition-of a national policy in Ausnam matter was not within the competence tralia of unarmed pacificism or a defence of the Security Council. policy involving a provision adequate to secure our country by our own efforts against attack by any enemy, however powerful and however armed. One has only to state these matters-a t obedient servant of the Western bloc-in the risk of oversimplification as opposed to April of this year, there was a contemptuous overcomplication-to see that each of these rejection of any United Nations intervencourses is unthinkable. Each of them would tion. Further approaches were made by the be tantamount to national suicide, and we United States, which also sought to promote must therefore face the facts. The facts are action by the Security Council. Peking that we must honour our international rejected such action in advance.

It is very interesting to recall designed to enable us to make effective conthat the United Kingdom proposed to the tributions to the common defence against Soviet Union that both countries, having Communist aggression. This policy, if it provided co-chairmen of the 1954 Geneva needs explanation, is the one pursued by Conferencea conference which some my Government. Of course we would all wish to see a busy and state their views. The Soviet reply genuine peace conference, but what has was a condemnation of the United States happened? At the risk of wearying the and a demand for the withdrawal of the HouseI just want to elaborate what my colleague stated in admirably summary form this afternoon. The document tabled by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck), able members, sets out the efforts that have I say at the very beginning that the conspicuous feature of these efforts is that none this be remembered by every person who theoreticians. None of these efforts was When the United States in August 1964 took to the Security Council-and we hear a lot about the United Nations and why we should be approaching that organisationWhen the greatly respected Secretary General of the United Nations, U Thant, wanted to visit Peking and Hanoi-and he could not be represented as the humble honourable members have been saying should be resumed-shoul d invite the parties to get United States forces from Vietnam, a demand which I have not yet discovered has been made by the Opposition, although I wiil have something to say about that befoie I conclude. Then the greatly respected Patrick Gordon Walker, whom many of us know, was sent out by the present British Government, which is not of my political complexion, to see whether he might bring the chance of a conference with him. Both Peking and Hanoi declined to receive him. They would have nothing to do with him, a man of the highest character and with the most high minded desire to achieve peace if possible. In April of this year President Johnson said in a famous speech that he was ready for unconditional discussion. Peking and Hanoi made a reply in their exquisite jargon, saying that this was a swindle pure and simple. In May the Canadian representative on the International Control Commission, which some people bave been saying should be brought into function, wanted to talk with the Peking and Hanoi Governments. He was rebuffed. Then at the Commonwealth Prime Minof America. isters' Conference-and I will say more about that in a little whilea Commonwealth mission was proposed and supported. vince all Australians, who have not been It has not succeeded in making any contact completely taken, in by Communist propawith any of the Communist countries at ganda, of three things; first, that all peaceful all.

They met the produced a plan for the setting up of a singular fate, which must have come as mission consisting of Prime Ministers to a shock to some of them, of being described make contact on behalf of the Commonby the Communist authorities as the Trojan wealth with the parties principally concerned horse of American imperialism.

Just let me emphasise this now become described as the Trojan horse point: The mission was not to negotiate. It that this shocks me; but it further exhibits the fact that we are dealing with people in the north who will insult their friends in other parts of Asia or in Africa so long as it enables them to maintain their campaign to overrun, to tyrannise and to destroy. The President of IndiaI do not think anybody would have suggested he was a war-monger, unlike me prefer the people of countries other than your own, therefore I am bound to say that you will agree he is not a war-monger, because he is not an Australian. But the President of India made an approach and Peking's reply was that this was preposterous in the extreme. When an unexpected combination got together, India and Yugoslavia-tlie y are not identical politically, Tito practising his own form of detached Communism-the y were both rewarded for their pains by being described by the people whom the Opposition thinks it is simple to get a conference with as the errand boys Now Sir, all these events must surely conhad something to say and do about this matter and I think I ought to put it before The Prime Minister of Great Britain, at",75,Internationa L Affairs
151,Mr James,Ho w true.,80,Internationa L Affairs
152,Sir Robert Menzies,"You alwayswould have found negotiation difficult because it contained within itself an immense variety of views, some being not dissimilar from my own and some being not like my own. They were a mixture. Therefore, the whole point was that the mission was to see whether a basis for conference could be found. That was an honourable task. The mission was to go and talk to these people and, without committing itself to any particular view as to the merits, see whether there was some basis for a conference. The Prime Minister of Great Britain took advantage of a talk that he and I were having a day or two before to explain his idea to me. He did that because, no doubt, I happen to be, nowadays, the senior Prime Minister. I considered the matter overnight and, having reflected on it, I told him that I would strongly support the proposal. In the result, with some opposition, but not much, the plan was adopted. The mission was made up of the Prime Ministers of Great Britain, of Nigeria, and of Trinidad and Tobago, and the President of Ghana. Those men represented a variety of views. The Prime Minister of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, is a very distinguished, and in my opinion, a very wise man. The Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Dr. Williams, is known, no doubt, to quite a few of my colleagues, and the President of Ghana is Dr. Nkrumah. As the agreed final communique saidWe reviewed the various efforts which had been last lingering hope of peace negotiations made to achieve a peaceful solution. This statement was made on behalf of have failed, since the obligations under it all of us-2 1 Prime Ministers, several of would have been repudiated and other South whom had feelings disposed in favour of Asian countries would be left to fend for North Vietnam. We had reviewed the themselves against overwhelming odds, and various efforts which had been made to the defence position of Australia would be achieve a peaceful solution and I just immeasurably weakened. emphasise once more that it is worthy of note that not one of those efforts had been made either by Peking or Hanoi. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Commonwealth's mission has not succeeded in making contact with either of these governments. Yet, Sir, the statement of guidance worked out by our conference exhibited a it is wrong for Australia to take an active reasonableness which ho nation with any aggression,part in the defence of South Vietnam against real desire for peace could have refused to examine'. 1 clo not want to trench too much on the some lack of virtue in Indonesian aggressors time of the House and therefore I shall not which does not apply to the Communist read all these passages, but I will take the aggressors? Where do the present agitators opportunity, Sir, with the permission of the House, to table the communique because the document does contain the guide lines which were worked out for this mission if the mission ever got to first base. While the aggressors are contemptuously rejecting all peaceful propositions and pressing on with their evil activities, there is an element in Australia which is, whether it realises it or not, conducting propaganda directed to the desertion of South Vietnam by the Americans and by the rest of us, the grave weakening of South Vietnam's defence, the abandonment of Thailand and Malaysia, victory for Peking and Hanoi and the dramatic encouragement of Communist influence and control even nearer to Australian shores. The propaganda is directed to these ends whether people realise it or not. I ask the Australian people who fully realise the dangers involved for our own country to understand the conscious or unconscious objectives of much of the current agitation for the withdrawal of Australian troops and therefore, presumably of American troops, since to urge the withdrawal of Australian troops and the retention of American troops would be a shocking incident in Australia's history. If that agitation succeeded and South Vietnam were abandoned, North Vietnam and its Communist terrorists, the Vietcong, would of course be vastly encouraged and aided; the except on the basis of surrender to military conquest would disappear; S.E.A.T.O. would Dr. J. F. Cairns -We have still got you. almost cancel me out. Two other matters, Sir, must be remembered. First of all, if I wonder how it can be right for us to take an active part in the defence of Malaysia against aggression. Is there",80,Internationa L Affairs
153,Sir Robert Menzies,"Yes, but youstand on that matter? Perhaps they will say that there is no aggression against South Vietnam. AllI can say-in a homely phrase -is that they can tell that to the American Marines. ln the second place, victory for Communism in South East Asia would not only spell disaster and degradation to the millions of people in that area who desire to be left alone to live in peace and, with the aid of more fortunate countries, develop their resources and raise their own living standards; it would, in world terms, represent an alteration in the world balance of power in favour of the Communist powers and it would so increase the risks of world war. Sir, this needs great emphasis: As the democracies have learned, retreat and appeasement do not produce a true or lasting peace. They give aid and comfort to thc aggressors. They hasten the day when the aggressor feels able to strike on the grand scale successfully. They encourage future wars. They do grievous harm to that cause-the cause of peace-whic h their advocates delude themselves into believing that they are supporting. On any reasoned view of this grim problem it is of course not possible to attack the presence of Australian forces without attacking the presence of the United States and of other non-Vietnamese forces. But does the Australian Labour Party attack the United States presence and actions? This is interesting to me. It is very difficult to keep up with the Labour Party because it is-as you might sayhere today and gone tomorrow on these matters of policy and, indeed, on all other matters. But at least, I hope that occasionally one must be able to read something that the Labour Party says, and think: This is it. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr the interests neither of the people of South VietBeaton) is interjecting. Listen to this; it will do you the world of good. This may not have reached you in the fastnesses of Bendigo. A Labour Party information release was issued on 18th February 196S. I have the one I got. Optimistically it says, on the last page: "" Additional copies of this statement may be obtained from the Australian Labour Party's Federal Secretariat on request"". If the honourable member has not had one I will pay the postage to have it sent to him. I just want to quote what this Labour Party, now so ambiguous, now so defeatist, now so unreal, had to say only in February of this year. I cannot read all of the document, but it professes to be the complete text of the resolution unanimously adopted by the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party Executive at its meeting in Sydney on Thursday, 18th February 1965; and the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party's Executive had before it the unanimous recommendation of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Party. When you have unanimity piled on unanimity I suppose one may hope: '* Roughly, this is what they believe "". The first thing that I want to refer to is this statementIn its statement to the Security Council on February 7th, reporting the air strikes against military installations in the south of North Vietnam, America insisted that its object in South Vietnam, while resisting aggression, is to achieve a peaceful settlement maintained by the presence of international peacekeeping machinery and that it would not allow thc situation to be changed by terror and violence. This statement said this unanimous body-of American purposes is unexceptionable and the case for the American action of recent days, as based on thc aim of shortening the war and achieving a negotiated settlement, which would establish and maintain the rights of the South Vietnamese people, deserves sympathetic Australian understanding. Nothing could be better. Later in the course of the same document the same people, unanimously, 1 suppose, unless unanimity had faded away halfway through the page, say this-and let everybody remember this, because I think that really if a lot of this is true we are almost on a bi-partisan policyThe demand of the Soviet Government for the immediate departure of all American and other foreign forces from South Vietnam would be in nam nor the people of Australia. Its immediate consequence must be a Communist takeover ot South Vietnam, snuffing out the hope of freedom and the democratic independence of that country and extending the area of Communist control closer to this country. I say to honourable members opposite: This is not a lot of reactionary Tories speaking. This is your crowd speaking-a t least, last February. The document continuesThe presence of those forces is necessary and justified as a holding operation providedtiiataU efforts are bent towards the objects set out by the American Government in its message to the Security Council, ln other words, the presence of these forces is justified as a temporary means to an end and not an end in itself. The object must be, at a proper time and in circumstances enabling the people of South Vietnam a free choice, to allow them to decide by their own votes on their own government and to ensure the physical independence of that government Sir, this is, I think, remarkable and worthy of applause. I will undertake to say that it is in the teeth of the views that will be heard from one or two honourable members sitting opposite, if there is any importance to be placed on consistency. The Leader of the Opposition who, I know, believes all that himself-twiste d and distorted by recent events, but in his heart, of course, he believes those things to be true-earlie r this year when we had a debate said two things that are very accurate and memorable. He saidTiiat there has long been and still is aggression from the north and subversion inspired from the north, I do not for one moment deny. 'Later on he saidThe object of the Vietcong in the war-thi s guerrilla war-is to avoid, as far as possible, direct am satisfied-and I was confirmed in this entanglement with massed troops in order that by infiltration, subversion and terrorism, they may control villages, hamlets, outposts and small communities wherever these are most vulnerable. These are brilliant and descriptive words. ours. No sane personI emphasise the I do not know how they disappeared from word ""sane""-coul d say that American the Labour Party's vocabulary, because in forces are being used in Vietnam for the the current debate my honourable friend preservation of interests peculiar to the Leader of the Opposition, under the America. Does any honourable member most terrible pressures, undoubtedly and opposite say that? Speak up. Now is your obviously, instead of repeating these statechance. Well, you do not say it.

Then he made the most remarkable statemonth, Mr Dean Rusk, the distinguished ment I have listened to for years. He said Secretary of State, was being interviewed that we are driving North Vietnam right He was asked what the commitment was to into the arms of China because we are South Vietnam. I will not read out in full resisting the power of China. Of all the what he said. But he began by sayingpusillanimous statements ever made in the House, it must be the all time high. I do not Vietnam. believe he thought of it. 1 do not believe he meant it. No man who said what he said before could possibly produce such utter nonsense. The moral is: Do not resist China and then you will not drive North Vietnam into their arms; and do not resist North Vietnam because it will save you a lot of trouble, and who are the South Vietnamese anyway? I suppose this astonishing proposition would apply also to the United States of America. That would be a reasonable inference. On the basis that we want to leave it all to the United States, it would be a reasonable inference. But the Leader of the Opposition, coming back from this excursion into fancy, goes on to say in this very speechThe British presence in Asia is essential to India, Malaysia, and Australia, just as the United States presence in this area is essential to the security of the area. Where do they stand? What is the policy or position of this Party? Before1 conclude, I want to say a word about the position of the United States.

What position does the right honourable gentleman hold in international affairs when the nearest Commonwealth Prime Minister, his close and intimate friend the Prime Minister of Malaysia, does not even consult him on the affairs of a country whose welfare we have guaranteed? I will come back to the question of Malaysia even if the right honourable gentleman wishes us to forget it. The Prime Minister quoted most of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) which I seconded, and which I shall now proceed to support with argument. Every phrase in the amendment came from the communique of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers. Every word came from that communique, with one exception, which related to our proposal that negotiations take place not only with the Government in Saigon but also with the Vietcong. Does the Prime Minister believe that any fruitful negotiations concerning Vietnam can take place unless there are negotiations with the Vietcong? Mr Michael Stewart, the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary, said that there would have to be negotiations with the Vietcong. Mr Keith Holyoake, the Prime Minister of New Zealand-to quote our Prime Minister, a man of the right honourable gentleman's own political complexion-sai d that there would have to be negotiations with the Vietcong. Must our Prime Minister always be out of step with all his counterparts? I quote the words of Mr Holyoake as reported in the Melbourne "" Age"" of 17th JuneI should have thought that the representatives of the South East Asia Collective Defence of the Vietcong should be brought to the conferTreaty, which is commonly known as the ence table. I quote him againI would be in favour of the United States suspending bombing once again to see what result this would bring. And again, Mr Holyoake saidI would be prepared to delay the despatch of New Zealand forces to Vietnam if that would help negotiations. The Prime Minister quoted from the Opposition's amendment another passage which declared that the people of Vietnam -bot h North and South-shoul d have the F.8226/65 -R -(10 J right to choose their own government. Neither the people in the north nor the people in the south have been accorded this right up to now. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck), last night, in what I thought at the time to be one of the hopeful passages in his speech, though now it seems to be an obscure one, saidIt seems to me that what we should envisage is a return to the Geneva Agreement of 1954. That Agreement proposed steps to enable the people of North and South Vietnam to choose their own government. Does the Minister agree with that section of the Agreement, or would he ignore it? Does he agree that there should be negotiations with China, as there were in the making of the Geneva Agreement? Does he agree that there should be negotiations with Hanoi? Does he agree that there should be, as there were then, negotiations with the Viet Minh or negotiations with those whom he demonstrated last night to be the successors of the Viet Minh, to wit, the Vietcong or the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam? What did the Minister mean by a return to the Geneva Agreement? Should we negotiate with China? Should we negotiate with the Vietcong? Should there be general elections? Would we sign the Geneva Agreement now? What did the Minister mean? He brought up the subject, and we have moved to give effect to the features of the Geneva Agreement. Was he merely uttering a pious and vague platitude? It would appear that if his statement meant anything, the Prime Minister has repudiated it already. The Prime Minister went back to the debate in this House in 1954 on the ratification S.E. A .T.O. Treaty. He said that the Leader of the Opposition of that time had cavilled in some way at the preamble to the Treaty. The then Leader of the Opposition did nothing of the sort. He cavilled at the preamble to our act adopting the Treaty, because that preamble limited the effect of the Treaty. The preamble to our act refers to Communist aggression; the S.E.A.T.O. Treaty does not. The American understanding attached to the Treaty limits the obligations of the United States of America under it to Communist aggression. aggression only. But none of the other signatories so limited their obligations. Under the Treaty, we did not, but it is possible to interpret the preamble to our act as limiting our obligations under the Treaty. Communist aggression is not the only aggression in this area. Are we to say that the aggression of Indonesia against Malaysia is Communist aggression? It is because it is not Communist aggression that the United States does not regard herself as obliged to defend Malaysia against Indonesia. The Prime Minister, going very glibly through the S.E.A.T.O. Treaty said that, under its terms, we would be defended in New Guinea. The only prospective assault on New Guinea is from Indonesia. That country, America believes -and we, too, believe-doe s not have a Communist Government. Under the S.E.A.T.O. Treaty, America is not obliged to defend New Guinea. But America is obliged, under the security treaty between Australia and New Zealand and the United States, which is known as the ANZUS. Treaty, to defend New Guinea, and there is no doubt that she would. I am sorry to have to document the say should be brought into function "".

His own attitude to negotiations, of duced in the preamble to the statement of course, has been completely consistent. Let the Labour Party's policy on foreign affairs, me recall what he said only last April. and we endorse that preamble to the Treaty. These are his wordsThe Prime Minister endeavoured to call in aid the assertion that the presence of Ausobligations in relation to a ceasefire, negotiate tralian troops in Vietnam is due to the obligations, invoking of the S.E.A.T.O.

On the very same day, at Johns subject, but he has never said that. Our Hopkins University, the President of the troops are not in Vietnam under the terms of the S.E.A.T.O. Treaty. Nobody has Communist invoked the Treaty to have our troops present there. The Prime Minister uses the phrase, "" we have regarded ourselves as entitled or obliged to send troops "". The honourable member for Phillip( Mr Aston), who is Government Whip, reading a prepared speech, said this afternoon that we had reported to the United Nations in accordance with our obligations under the S.E.A.T.O. Treaty. We did not do that last year at all. We sent a letter this year. We did not send one last year, and the Minister himself has said so in answers to prepared questions which I have put on the notice paper. Subsequently, the Prime Minister used some words which the Minister for External Affairs should at least clarify. The right honourable gentleman used the phrase, "" the Geneva Conference which some honourable gentlemen say should be resumed"". Did the Minister, by his reference to the Geneva Agreement, mean that the Conference should be resumed, or did he not? What he really meant is now in doubt. The Prime Minister also referred to "" the International Control Commission, which some people Negotiate with an enemy which has violated its with a country that has ignored its international and negotiate with people who will",84,Internationa L Affairs

Last month, tiie right honourable gentleman subscribed to a communique which he now proceeds, in the words of one of his back bench supporters, to rubbish. Of course, the Prime Minister belittles the whole idea of negotiation and. whether it comes from academics or from bishops, he will denounce it. He says that all such suggestions come from Communist sources. A visiting American bishop, on his way back from Vietnam, saidEvery Christian church has its peace or disarmaGovernment's attitude in Vietnam or in ment conimittee. I am sorry that your Prime Minister says that. For the leader of a great Western nation to stoop to expressions such as that is unworthy, both of him and his office. The Prime Minister then concluded with some references to alleged statements by members of the Labour Party on various Labour Party from time to time, or what occasions. He did not quote any of them he says is the Labour Party's view. His own precisely, but he did quote from a document attitudes and views are all too notorious. I issued by our Federal Secretariat last Febsuppose we were all appropriately insulted, ruary which reported the unanimous vicw offended and disturbed by the things which of the parliamentary executive of our party were said by President Sukarno during his on Vietnam.

I have hud to deal with this question of Vietnam countries of South East Asia and the because that is all that the Prime Minister Prime Minister's espousal of his doctrine of wished to discuss. NowI must deal with a few more general subjects. At least the Prime Minister's speech was area because it is believed-and chapter free of some of the cant which still disand verse are quoted from his election figured what I thought was a vastly imspeeches of last November and Decemberproved speech by the Minister for External that his interest in the area is to fight in Affairs last night. It is quite ingenuous to other people's backyards. I am not saying say. as the Minister for External Aftairs so that this is what Australia is doing, but this often says, that we are in Vietnam to preis the way that Australia's actions are serve sovereign independence or teiritorial integrity, or to defend the frontiers of freedom. We are in Vietnam because we believe that it is our right or our duty, or in our interests to support the United States. We were in Malaysia because we thought we should support the United Kingdom and our only arrangements with Malaysia and Singapore are still through the United Kingdom. Why should we not. frankly state that the Australian Government's attitude towards China, for instance, or the Austra'inn Malaysia is clue to a fraternal feeling for our great allies or our dependence on support from our great allies to whom we are related. The Prime Minister has quoted the Senate campaign at the end of last year? We have to remember that the heads of I have been twice this j'ear in various defence in depth bas produced very great misunderstanding and resentment in the interpreted because of the Prime Minister's belligerence in election campaigns. He speaks, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) so clearly showed this afternoon, for internal consumption, whatever the external results may be. I have said about Malaysia that the for all the people in that area. What we recent events there represent the greatest have to do now is to decide what our reverse in the three and a half years since arrangements with Malaysia and Singapore our policy miscarried on West New Guinea. are to be, and on that point I ask the We must all be disturbed by many features Minister for External Affairs to elaborate in Malaysia. I was there last February and I a couple of passages in his speech. The was there again with five of my colleagues Minister saidlast month. I noticed, and I must in all frankness say, that there was a decline in the the Australian Government to associate itself with freedoms which Malaysia inherited and has these arrangements is something still to be espoused and which she alone, in general, determined. represents in South East Asia.

It is more argument among all representative Malaythan ever necessary that we should have sians with visitors like ourselves.

It is not satisfactory that we not comment on the decline in some of these should any longer be in the position of freedoms. One of the disturbing things that uncertainty which was disclosed last week. I found last February was the jealousy felt and expressed in Kuala Lumpur about the Prime Minister of Singapore. On this last discussions on more than one occasion with occasion I was appalled at the extent to every man who now holds ministerial reswhich that jealousy was still more manifest. ponsibility in all the relevant fields in the The success of the visits by Mr Lee Kuan United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore and Yew to Algiers and Cairo a few years ago New Zealand.

Both it before, in our interests and in theirs. Mr Lee and the Tunku have the exceptional quality to have produced viable political parties. It is a pity that the Federation has been dismembered. We would say in Australianot only in our party-that Singapore has the most efficient, honest, modern and democratic government in South East Asia. It is a model for the industrial democracy which can produce proper prospects in life Whether any additional action is necessary by tees we have given to that country. There is no security of tenure in Camp Terendak Since the middle of last year I have had There is another feature, too, about it. The original bargain for Malaysia was between Sabah. Sarawak, Malaya and Singapore. No-one can be certain that there is the same validity in the bargain between Sabah, Sarawak and Malaya alone. This may be regarded as a very tendentious utterance on my part, but I invite honourable members to look at what English weeklies, like the "" Observer"" and the "" Economist "", have said on this subject. Quite clearly, it ought to be put beyond any doubt in the world that Sabah and Sarawak still want to be associated with Malaya before we continue arrangements of this unspecified kind. I now wish to speak briefly on Vietnam. I referred to some of the cant phrases which the Minister for External Affairs himself used, but which many of his back benchers have used in greater proliferation. It is no more true to say there are separate nations and distinct states in North and South Vietnam than it would be to say that of North and South Korea or East and West Germany. They are the same nations and the same races. To use phrases like "" sovereign independence "" and "" territorial integrity "" is to adopt the traditionalist and legalist attitude of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) who is trying to interject. There is a large feature, and there has long been a large feature, of civil war in this country. It is fantastic to refer to the frontier of freedom in the sense of democracy. Saigon is no more democratic than Hanoi, and it is certainly no more popular. But, as I said, we are involved in South Vietnam because thc United States is involved. It is not very flattering to the United States for us to infer, as so many honourable gentlemen do including Ministers in another place, like the Minister for Repatriation (Senator McKellar) when he addressed the Returned Servicemen's League which takes a very close, if archaic, interest in foreign affairs, caveats concerning his reference to aid. and say that we must help the United States in Vietnam to ensure that the United States will honour her obligations under ANZUS. and S.E.A.T.O. America's other allies have not taken that attitude. I do not believe that America would fail to honour her obligations. Again there is vagueness. The Prime United States, which so largely maintains Minister yesterday very casually announced the United Nations, is particularly generous that we are sending more forces to Vietin this respect. She contributes a much nam. He did not elaborate on the reasons. greater percentage voluntarily than the Is it that our original forces were inadequately supported and now require these additional reinforcements and auxiliaries? Is it because the United States needs reassurance? Is it because Malaysia is now secure? It may be trueI think it is-as the Prime Minister said and as tbe Minister for External Affairs said, that most Australians support the sending of troops to Vietnam. But there are two features which ought to give us pause. The first is that there are greater misgivings in Australia about our participation, or more particularly the timing and the method of our participation in South Vietnam, than tbere was in the First World War, the Second World War or the Korean War. Secondly, there is less support for our attitude outside Australia than there was on any of those occasions. I can assure honourable members that there is no enthusiasm in Kuala Lumpur for the fact that Australian troops have been sent in this way to Vietnam. We should not have sent troops before seeking negotiations and explaining our objectives. For reasons which I gave last May when 1 spoke on this subject, Australia in particular sbould be chary of sending forces overseas except as part of an international and multiracial force. Australia should always be prepared to honour her international obligations and, in fact, to promote international peace keeping forces and machinery. But on this occasion the Prime Minister entered upon the war without explaining to the Australian public and without explaining to our neighbours why he was doing it. The Minister for External Affairs mentioned two other good featuresI thought it was the first time he has ever stressed them in his speeches-of international aid and the United Nations. I must enter a few Australia contributes voluntarily to United Nations specialised agencies a considerably smaller percentage of their revenue than the United Nations holds that Australia is able to pay in compulsory obligations. Under the assessments which the body itself makes, we are contributing in aid much less than we can afford to contribute. The United Nations says that she has to contribute towards maintaining the obligatory functions of the United Nations. 1 remember asking the Minister for External Affairs last September whether the only economic aid we had given to Vietnam, in answer to an American note in May, was an expert on insects. The Minister took umbrage at my remark. It turned out that I was inaccurate because I asked my question on 3rd September and the expert on insecticides did not go until 10th October. I was anticipating. He went with some small quantities of fumigants and insecticides and the necessary applicators and 100 metal silos to help preserve stored grain. We had not at that time sent any other assistance at all. Later we sent a surgical team and some galvanised iron roofing. The assistance we have sent to Vietnam has been completely trivial. Yet, if S.E.A.T.O. were invoked, we would be obliged to give social and economic and political assistance. We have not done so. The Minister's statement on this was month, at the General Assembly, it will camouflage. It comes, strange to say, in the have its opportunity, because the General same week when Dr. Frankel, of the ComAssembly will be effective once more.

The United Kingdom, Canadian and New Zealand Governments all provide grants to similar private agencies in their countries. The Commonwealth Government has not yet been willing to support the Bureau in this way. I come now to the United Nations. The Prime Minister, of course, showed his usual contempt for it. His one appearance there naturally makes him resent the organisation. He did not express his current view on what the Minister for External Affairs referred to as the funds crisis. Honourable members will remember that only last month the Prime Minister, in a telecast, was saying: "" No pay, no vote. That is a good, simple rule to which I subscribe heartily "". He must feel very frustrated now that the United Nations General Assembly will be able to function effectively next month. Let us hope that it functions effectively not least in respect of Vietnam. The United Nations cannot act unless member nations raise subjects. The Australian Government has never yet initiated any peace move in South East Asia. Next their chicanery and intransigence in this matter. Let me conclude with some general resuch as Australia, must make use of the great powers and bring restraints to bear on In this country we very properly place great stress on what the United States thinks about various matters. . As my colleague, the honourable member for Fremantle. said this afternoon, the Government pays no respect to America's views on trade with China. American officials tell us very franklv that they think we are trading with the enemy. I do not agree with the American attitude towards China, either politically or economically. Nevertheless, the Government pays no heed to America's attitude in economic matters, only in political ones, ""fhe Country Party, of course, apices with us on both issues. It believes that Affairs, such as thc present President of the Australia should recognise China politically, just as we recognise it economically. Again, the Government does not pay heed to vvhat America thinks our attitude to international aid should be. Americans arc very ready to tell us that they think vve arc ^elfish in not contributing more generously to international agencies in the social and economic field. Our party saysit has said this for years past now-that at least one per cent, of our national income should be contributed to international aid. At our Federal Conference the week before last vve spelt out our belief that we should channel our aid and encoura.ee other nations to channel their aid through international agencies. However, there is the general question of thc political attitudes of the United States. It docs not take the same attitude towards Indonesia as Australia takes, lt believes that Indonesia is not bound to become a satellite of China: that Indonesia could form part of the Maphiiindo concept which would provide some viable political and economic shield, if you like to describe it in that way. Thc United States-on e may think naturally, it being a great power-place s great emphasis on the hip nations in this area. It concentrates on China, Indonesia, India. Pakistan and Japan. It believes that none of the latter four nations is likely to be a satellite of China. It realises that each of them is a very significant country and will remain so. The Australian Government concentrates far too much on the peripheral nations. Australia is a peripheral nation. The strength of such nations lies in international bodies. How can we best assist Great Britain and America in our area? We are in a better position than is any other country in this area to interpret the whole area to America and to Great Britain. We are in the best position of any of the nations in this area to interpret America and Great Britain t'o the other nations of this area. We are no threat militarily or economically. Nobody thinks that we can dominate the area. Thus, peopie believe that we have no particular axe to grind, except that of our own preservation and the promotion of good, neighbourly relations. Our Prime Minister dominates and displaces successive Ministers for External International Court of Justice, the Governor General designate, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and the present Minister. All of them have been ignored or displaced when the occasion requires it. Therefore, the Prime Minister's attitude is crucial in his Government's thinking. He thinks lhat the North Atlantic forces are as essential and also as permanent as he previously thought the North Atlantic empires were in this area. He may be right that they are still essential. He also thinksthis is where he is clearly quite wrong-that Australia should be closer to the North Atlantic powers than to any of her neighbours. The vast military and economic resources of America, Russia, Great Britain and France are often sought in aid by smaller nations in other regions. Such aid, however, is suspected by other nations in those regions and produces tensions in them unless it is rendered under worldwide, or at least regional, arrangements. World organisations wish to use but to curb the power of the great nations. The majority cannot prevail against the powerful minority, but the majority wishes to curb the po\xerful minority. The forces of the great powers are more likely to be welcomed in strange areas if they come under international auspices. The' role of Australia-whic h i.s so much more akin to great powers, such as America and Great Britain, culturally, economically and politically-is to interpret those great powers to this area and this area to them. Only insofar as we discharge that role can our own security be ensured. The Minister for External Affairs, in his speech last night, dealt with many matters on which he had barely touched previously. Tonight the Prime Minister has made many of those matters obscure. The opportunity decided upon in February and endorsed in should be taken to clarify them. We need May and which set out the Parliamentary our allies as much as ever, but we can help Labour Party's policy dealt with three them much more than we have hitherto. aspects of the matter under discussion. One Only if we help them more than we have was that the Executive of the Parliamentary and in a more enlightened and varied way Labour Party condemned aggression from than we have will we really effectively help the north; secondly, it accepted the view ourselves and be good neighbours with all that United States forces should be in the people in this area. study the various speeches that have been made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) inside and outside this sition made a statement which I am sure chamber from time to time is a fascinating astonished everybody, not only on this side academic exercise. It is fascinating to note of the House, but also on his own side. how much they vary, not only in emphasis, He said: "" Not one member of my Party but sometimes even in substance.

But are very few people here tonight on this this afternoon four other members of his side of the House who do not have more Party expressed views which were diametrithan a little sympathy for the honourable cally opposed to what was contained in that gentleman.

I will not accept any suggestion that a man of his intelligence would believe for one moment that an answer to this problem lies with the United Nations. SoI must ask myself: Why does he put that view forward in a speech before members of his own Party in this House?

I sometimes wonder whether it is good practice to leave diplomats in posts for any great length of time and so lead to this possible lack of objectivity. I should like to have known the extent of the pressures that we are told were behind the Tunku in precipitating or assisting to precipitate, this move. I should like to know whether those pressures are still there and tonight in masterly fashion so provocative during his recent tour of representations and how they were received.

One of their arguments is that our actions not something that will eventually destroy in South Vietnam are against morality. They Australia. 1 never cease to be astonished at put the point of view that it is immoral for how quickly some of these well meaning us to do anything to continue the war and people gloss over the acts of aggression of the misery of the South Vietnamese people Chinese Communism.

Never do they think 1959, that there was a skirmish in India in -and they are sincere in leaving this out of 1962 and so on.

The contention that Communism cannot be beaten by military means alone is someThis evening, in typical manner, the Prime thing that the Leader of the Opposition adMinister( Sir Robert Menzies) described vances as a magical cure for the problems this as a pusillanimous and astonishing that affect this area.

I have no doubt that if there is a with1965, Studies on Vietnam"". I intend to drawal from South Vietnam-if the policies examine a number of significant aspects of advocated by the honourable member for this document. The Department begins with Yarra, who is to follow me in the debate, a dogmatic statement of a matter that reand his few colleagues in the Labour Party mains highly contentious. It statesare followed-it will mean disaster for the people of South East Asia and, in particular, France disaster and complete loss of freedom and began as a nationalist movement against French Dr. J. F. CAIRNS (Yarra) [10.10] We are driving North Vietnam right into the arms of China, because we are resisting the power of China. It is possible in 20 minutes to deal with as Australia's external relations. I will refer the first of which he issued last night. It is called "" Information Handbook No. 1 of The Vietnamese achieved independence from only after a long and bitter war which colonial rule but developed into a war between France and the Vietnamese Communists known as the Vict Minh. This dogmatic conclusion is not in accord with the evidence. There is much evidence that the Viet Minh remained significantly a nationalist movement throughout the war with the French. Indeed, there is mucb evidence that thc Vietnamese revolutionary movement has remained significantly nationalist through to the present day. A highly accredited writer in the "" New York Times"", Robert Trumbull, expressed an opinion on this matter. It is only one of many similar opinions, not including thai of Dr. Bernard Fall, upon whom the Department relies heavily. Robert Trumbull saidThe people fighting President Ngo are the same who fought against the French, and in their view they are in arms for essentially similar reasons. The reasons are national ones. Then there Vietnam. Had it done so and achieved it, is the opinion of Professor W. W. Rostow, how much stronger would have been the who is now a top American adviser on position of those who have responded by Vietnam. He saidWhat is happening (in) Asia is this. Old societies But Ihe Department chooses to obscure its are changing their ways in order to create refusal to do so by referring on page 10 of a national personality on the world scene. Is the Department aware of these opinions 1965"" to municipal elections held in South which conflict with its own conclusions. If Vietnam. Is tbe Department aware of the it is aware of them, does it choose to exclude following conclusions? First, is it aware them from its studies? The Department then goes on to examine the issue of general elections. It assumes that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime was dedicated to democracy, desired to unify Vietnam by free elections and only failed to do so because free elections could not be held in a Communist police state in the North. Free elections could not be held in the North, but this is not the position of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. Tbere is much evidence, completely ignored by the Department, that the purpose of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime was not to hold free elections or to unify Vietnam but to establish an effective anti-Communist base in South Vietnam. This was done by a far larger infiltration from the North by Diem and his supporters than has ever been alleged to have been arranged by the Communist Government in Hanoi. There is much evidence that the exodus of up to 1 million peasants from the North to the South was not a spontaneous, free movement of people, but that it took place to provide a base of political power in the South for the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. Dr. Fall, who is relied upon heavily by the Department, made a statement at page 154 of his book ""The Two Vietnams"", which seems to have been overlooked completely by those who compiled this apology for the Government's policy. Dr. Fall said. . . the Government of Ngo Dinh Diem immediately used the northern Catholics That is one million of themas its major base of political power. It is strange how the Minister's device of historical interpretation-the realities of power-seem s to direct his attention to only one kind of power. But had the Ngo Dinh Diem regime been inclined to find a democratic basis for its own power it could have done so in South military action to its request for assistance? its "" Information Handbook No. 1 of that Dr. Bernard Fall said?. . . the character the Diem regime has displayed since 1955 is autocratic, arrogant, dogmatic, unwilling to take advice and fiercely resisting any suggestion for real reform. Amongst others, a highly respected French authority. Max CIos saidThe Saigon Government and its local represent;! lives are cut off from any contact with the people. They possess only thc outward trappings of power. The very substance of the country,' the men and thc rice, have escaped it. Then there is the South Vietnam Embassy itself here in Canberra, which in 1963, issued the following statementFor nine years the Ngo Dinh Diem Government had pursued a dictatorial and tyrannical policy. Power was concentrated in the hands of the Ngo family and those of a number of close, incompetent and interested collaborators. The natural and necessary outcome had to be the overthrow of the Ngo regime. Is the Department aware of these significant findings which conflict so much with its own apologia for the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, or if aware of them, does it consider them irrelevant to an evaluation of that regime? Next, the Department would have us believe that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime contributed nothing to a war against the Communists until it was attacked by them after 1959. This interpretation conflicts not only with common sense, but also with a great deal of evidence. It is unreasonable to expect that the Ngo regime would sit idly by until it was attacked by Communists. One of its main functions was to stop the growth of communism and to clean up what remained in the South of the insurgency movement. Yet another French anti-Communist authority, Philippe Devellers, wroteA certain sequence of events by the Ngo regime became classical-denunciations , searches and raids, arrests of suspects, plundering, interrogation enlivened by torture (even of innocent people), deportation and regrouping of populations suspected of intelligence with rebels. Certainly the Ngo regime did not wait until it was attacked. It did, for it, the realistic and common sense thing. Itwent looking for Communists and it killed and captured them, and suspects as well. This campaign began, not in 1959 or 1960 as the Department suggest, but in 1957 or before; just or The as the Vietcong campaign began not in China or any place. They apparently depend for 1960, but in 1957 or before. The Department's subtle suggestion to the contrary is determined, not by the facts, but by the need to meet the Government's prescription that the war in the South was begun by the North after 1959. Of course, there is no evidence of any action by the North until late 1959 or 1960. There is no evidence of the capture of any Communist weapon whatever in South Vietnam from the North until 12th May 1962. But even then the Department ignores the evidence about Northern involvement which does not suit its thesis. Let us look at a small part of the enormous volume that does exist. Paul Locauture, yet another French anti-Communist authority, saysIt must be emphasised that the Hanoi leaders did not make this shift That is the shift of 1960-stil l a cautious one at that-o n their own, but rather in response to the pressures of militants in the South, who criticised the rather indifferent attitude on their Northern comrades towards the repressive measures of the Saigon authorities. If the Department wanted to know a little end of 1964 almost all the weapons of the more about the "" repressive measures of the Vietcong were originally captured from the Saigon authorities"", it would not have to Government forces? What does explain the look far. Melbourne journalist, Denis Warner, wrote in 1961It is inevitable that of the approximately 400 Vietcong killed each month, many should be innocent bystanders. Any estimate of the number killed in error is at best a fairly wild guess . . . everyone in the village is dossiered, photographed and questioned . . . the remaining Communists left behind are liquidated and the formal Communists are dealt with at one's convenience. Is the Department aware of this other side of the story or, if aware of it, is it merely that there was insufficient space to publish any indication that it existed? In respect of aggression from the north, the Department's document presents no new evidence, relies upon conclusions and generalisations, and ignores the volume of contradictory evidence that exists. It provides photographs which, except to the simple minded, add no evidence to that which it has already provided, examined and criticised. It ignores evidence of this kind: General Paul Harkins, United States Commander, South Vietnam, said on 6th March 1963guerrillas obviously are not being reinforced supplied systematically from North Vietnam, weapons primarily on whatever they can capture. Many of tbeir weapons are home-made. Senator Wayne Morse, on 21st May 1964, saidI have examined witnesses for some time on South Vietnam from the Pentagon and State Department. When I put the question to them: "" What military personnel have you found in South Vietnam from Red China, Cambodia or elsewhere?"", the answer is always "" Practically none "". So when I press the witnesses further with the question, ""AmI to understand the Vietcong are South Vietnamese entirely?"", the answer is, "" Yes "". The same is true of their weapons. The Vietcong have armed themselves from Government stocks, not by foreign imports from Communist countries. On 29th January 1965, Mr L. A. Crozier, adviser to the Department of External Affairs itself, returned to Australia and wroteRecent photographs of weapons captured from the Vietcong show that they have now the best modern carbines, heavy machine guns, recoilless rifles, mortars and so on-almos t all originally captured from the Government forces. Does the Department repudiate its own adviser? Why has it not even mentioned that it possesses evidence that up to the remarkable position taken up by the Departmunist small arms and ammunition. A ship that ment and the Government in respect of Mr size is not much above the Oriental junk class. Crozier? The evidence of aggression preThe ""New York Times"", on 22nd Febviously given in public discussion still stands ruary 1965 saidand has not been added tb. It is that up to 16th February 1965 no more than 835 weapons from Communist countries had by been captured in South Vietnam. This of incriminating goods or weapons bave been means that it is highly probable that not found. more than 6 per cent, of the weapons used by the Vietcong up to February 1965 Is the .""

The Department's document endeavours York Times"" said this or not, and is what to hide this situation by a reference, on it said relevant to the Department's own page 20, to the National Liberation Front's completely unsupported statement that vast claim that 47,000 weapons .captured from quantities of ammunition have been the Government forces "" would amount to brought to South Vietnam by land and sea? only a small proportion of the armoury required for approximately 100,000 regional forces and village guerrillas "". This page 22 that there has beencover up is exploded even in the document . . . the discovery of large supply dumps of itself, for on page 22 it states. . . the Vietcong had used up their stocks of French and other captured weapons and ammunition, their main forces now have been almost entirely re-equipped with standard weapons of Communist Chinese and Communist bloc manufacture. "" Now"" in this sentence is llt h July 1965, so if captured weapons were not used until the main forces were re-equipped about 11th July 1965, then captured weapons must have been enough up to about that time. The attempted cover up ignores the fact that not all of the 100,000 regional forces and village guerrillas are armed at the one time. The evidence is that for much of the time they did not ail operate at once, and a given weapon was handed round amongst many guerrillas in an area. On page 20 the document deals with the transport of weapons into South Vietnam by sea, and statesVast quantities of ammunition have been brought to South Vietnam by land and sea. Vast quantities! But no evidence of any North. But it ignores two things that the weapons brought by sea has ever been given, Department's document manages, with so except that of the 100 tons captured on much else, to omit. 16th February 1965. Is this evidence of vast quantities? The ""New York Times"" of 28th February 1965 contained this article infiltrators came in between 1959 and 1965, relating to this shipment of 100 tonsApparently the major new evidence of a need for the Vietcong that is claimed-abou t 50 for escalating the war with all the hazard that per cent, a year-the n there are not 40.000 entails is a 100 ton cargo ship loaded with Comleft today; there are no more than 8,000. About 12,000 vessels are searched each month thc South Vietnamese coastal junk police force, but arrests are rare and no significant amounts ing goods or weapons been found? Does the Department care whether the "" New The Department's document tells us on the latest communist manufactured equipment in recent months. But the document gives no details of type or quantity. Why does it not do so? When faced with this question recently at Monash University, the Minister for External Affairs said he could not give details because they were secret. Is that the reason? If it is, why are they secret? If large supply dumps had been captured would not the Vietcong know? Would there be any reason to keep the details secret? If the Government had any figures, would it not produce them in triumph as evidence of aggression from the North? The Department's document, as do all the similar documents, makes great play upon the 40,000 infiltrators into South Vietnam from the North. It does so in close proximity to claims that there are 40,000 or 50,000 members of the regular forces in the Vietcong. This allows a subtle suggestion that almost all the regular or hard core Vietcong forces are infiltrators from the First of all, there are casualties. If 40,000 and if they were subject to the casualty rate The second thing ignored by the Department's document is the age of the infiltrators. It is admitted that most of the claimed 40,000 infiltrators, up to the end of 1964, were South Vietnamese who had fought against the French before 1954, and who went to North Vietnam, as required under the Geneva Agreement, and then came back to South Vietnam after 1959. How old are they now? If they were old enough to fight against the French before 1954 they must have been at least 18 years old then, and they must be at least 29 years old nowa little old, perhaps, for hard core Vietcong, particularly when most of the hard core Vietcong regulars who are captured are around 20 years of age. Even the notorious White Paper, ""Aggression from the North"", which makes the same claims, for the same reasons as the Department's document does, contains this admission on page 11The casualty rate has been high, and obviously many of those who were in fighting trim ten years ago are no longer up to the rigours of guerrilla war. Were the Department and the Minister unaware of the serious consequences of the casualty rate and the age of the infiltrators upon the claim that the war depended upon the infiltrators from the North? If they were aware of them, did they choose to omit these consequences from their story? Now let us look at another totally inadequate picture presented by the Department's document. I refer to the economic record of the Ngo regime. At page 10, the Department's document indicates that the economic record of South Vietnam was very good but it ignores completely the great deal of evidence about South Vietnam's economic performance just as it ignores completely much evidence about its political performance. For instance, in 1965, Denis Warner concludedA meagre 1.4 per cent, of US. aid or SIS million his point. If he is sincere, if he thinks that went to agriculture between 1955 and 1960. The much vaunted rural health programme did not exist. Land reform was a flop. So, on the one side we have the presentation of a case which is not in fact a study at all; it is an exercise in public relations. Let me make a final point. I have examined critically the record of the authorities in South Vietnam, and of the Governments that support them, because it is the authorities in Soutb Vietnam whom we are committed to suppon. The record of the North Vietnam authorities is bad, too. But we are not legally and morally tied to them. No one can hope to win in South Vietnam unless the record is good. It has not been good. Therefore, we may not win. We can win only if the record is good. If it is to become good, we must know where it has been bad. -There has been a curious air of unreality in the speeches of members of the Opposition tonight. One would have thought that they were merely examining some academic argument which had no relation to the interests of Australia. In the past year we have seen things happening to our north which have destroyed a great deal of our security. Singapore has broken away from Malaysia. The unhappy Sukarno is now the prisoner of the Communists. He apparently has found it futile to maintain any resistance against his master Aidit. Red China has emerged as a nuclear power. The security and indeed the existence of Australia is at stake. There is an air of unreality about the whole approach of the Opposition to these problems. The honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) has just concluded his speech. Is it a coincidence that after a seemingly dispassionate argument he always reaches a conclusion which is acceptable to the Communists? This has happened so often that it is a coincidence which surely strains credulity. Tonight he was concerned with trying to show that there was no aggression from the north. He was concerned in reading into the record, so that it can be quoted by Communist sources abroad as something coming from the Australian Parliament, the conclusion that there was no aggression from the north in Vietnam. He relied almost entirely upon Communist sources to prove the Communists are always right, as one would seem to conclude from his arguments, then indeed he has given his heart and his mind into the keeping of our Communist enemies. I think it would be unfair to name him as a Communist agent even though he does and says the same things as a Communist agent would do and say. Perhaps he is not a Communist but, on his public record, he",92,Internationa L Affairs
160,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [10.30].,"stands always as the friend of the Communists' friends and the enemy of the Communists' enemies. These things are relevant to what I shall say in a moment about Vietnam. We are in Vietnam for two reasons, each good and sufficient in itself and, in combination, of overwhelming strength. First, it is our duty to the Vietnamese people to be there, and secondly, it is our duty to the Australian people to be there. Let me examine these two propositions. Opposition speakers have taken the Communist line that the Vietcong has the majority of local support in South Vietnam. This is the opposite of the truth. What local support the Vietcong has comes from terror and the fear of these people that we will abandon them. Consider the position that obtained on partition in 1954 when one million people came south fleeing in terror from Ho Chi Minh. He has boasted that he executed 50,000 of those who were fool enough to remain. The real total was probably far greater than that. Opposition speakers have said that there was no election in 1956: How could there be an election when half the country was in the grip of northern Communist terror? But Opposition speakers have gone much further. They say that even in the South there would have been a majority for the Vietcong and have misquoted President Eisenhower on this very point, and they have misquoted him in the same way as the Communists have misquoted him. I have here the exact statement that he made in the book of which Opposition speakers have made so much. President Eisenhower did not say that, in an election, 80 per cent, would have voted for Ho Chi Minh. What he did say was that earlier, in 1954, when Ho Chi Minh was leading the Viet Minh in their struggle against the French, 80 per cent, of the population would have supported him against the French nominee Bao Dai, and since 1955 there was a much greater majority in South Vietnam in favour of Diem and against Bao Dai so Ho Chi Minh's majority would not mean very much. Opposition speakers have misquoted this. Mr Clyde Cameron -Well, read the whole of it. speakers have misquoted it and they have done so in a way which is in line with what the Communists are doing. The Communists have misquoted in the way in which the Opposition has misquoted. Mr Clyde Cameron -Giv e us the page number. exact quotation on the table of the House if I have permission to do so. -I s leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. from the Minister giving the exact quotation, and the reference to thc book and the page from which it is taken. NowI come to the matter of aggression from the North. The honourable member for Yarra spent his entire time in trying to prove that there has been no aggression from the North. He denies Hanoi's boast that it controls the Liberation Front in the South. Does he not know that the Communist Party is an integral party? Does he not know that Ho Chi Minh is a foundation member of the French Communist Party and a devout Communist, a man who is subservient to Peking? What is the good of thc honourable members talking about the split between the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people? Of course there is a split between the people, but the people have nothing to do with it. Their leaders, their dictators, their rulers are Communists working together inside the same system. Ho Chi Minh is the spiritual brother of Mao, or rather he takes orders from Mao. He is Mao's puppet. This is well known and is an established fact. Let me quote now from a speech delivered on 16th June by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the British Government, a member of the Labour Party and also a person who has full access to all intelligence reports. I quote him exactly and I will also lay this document on the table of the House if I have permission. He saidFor some five years, from 1954 to 1959, the two parts of Vietnam lived uneasily indeed, but at least in comparative peace; at least able to make some progress with their economy; . . . Immediately after 1959 came the call of the Government of North Vietnam demanding that the Vietcong activities in the South be stepped up to a full-scale attack on the Government of South",99,Internationa L Affairs

Now, there was no need for that action. The two parts were living in comparative peace, they could have lived in greater peace. They could today, if that call had never been made, be living has pointed out, not one of the factions in much greater happiness and at a higher standard involved was a pro-Communist faction. of life than they are living today. There was no need for this. It was a deliberate decision by the Communist North to make an attack on its neighbour, and it cannot be said . . . that this could be excused by blaming it on a United States presence in the South. When this attack began there were only 700 American troops and civilian advisers in the South. These are the words of the Foreign Secretary of Saigon. That was an excellent project, in the British Labour Government, a man The cows were shot by the Vietcong, the who has full access to intelligence reports. equipment was destroyed by the Vietcong He also saidAndI should add now that we have information not reach the children of Saigon.

Let me remind them of one small thing. The Australian Government sent to South Vietnam a dairy herd and established a model dairy to provide milk for the children and because of the Vietcong the milk did The very fact that there have been these disturbances and changes of government is though it is not a fully democratic one.

The one thing that can turnand so that they can say: "" If you, in South East Asia, want to save yourselves from murder and torture, you had better come to terms with the Communists."" Communist agents are working this plan here in Australia. The people who say these things are helping to kill Australian troops. What is the Opposition asking for now? More than we are giving? Negotiation? Honourable members opposite call it negotiation that they are asking for, but if they are asking for anything more than we are giving now, they are asking only for complete surrender. So much for our duty to the Vietnamese people. We must protect this nascent democracy against Communist aggression. And what is our duty to the people of Australia? As the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) said last night, it is fashionable to discount the domino theory-to wipe it off as something superficial-bu t really the truth of the matter is that if we abandon the Vietnamese people there will not be a man or woman in Asia that will trust our word. We will yield the whole of Asia to Communism. If we walk out-if we show that our word is not to be trusted by the people of Vietnam-the n the people of other Asian countries, Thailand, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, and further afield, will feel that we cannot give them protection and that, as such, we are untrustworthy allies. The domino theory, unfortunately, has too much of reality in it to be a comfortable theory. The Chinese thrust is southwards. If the United States were to lose interest in this areaI do not for one moment think it will do so in spite of the provocation to that end that is being given by the Communists in Australia and those who echo Communist propaganda-Australia would be a Chinese province within ten years. What do we think of those who are striking this blow at the security of Australia? Somebody in the United States might well have a different opinion about the need for helping the Vietnamese against Communism. The security of the United States is not directly involved in this. The fall of Asia would not immediately mean the enslavement of the people of the United States as it would mean the enslavement of Australia. Naturally there might be two opinons in America as to the need for involvement in Vietnam. Why should we endeavour to exacerbate, in the United States, an opinion which is directly inimical to the interests and survival of Australia? There are academics-active , they say. I have here "" Hansard"" of 19th April 1954, and I recall that these same men, Fitzgerald and Davidson, were then sponsoring the false proposition that Ho Chi Minh and his Vietnam Minh movement were not really Communist. Those are the people who, on questions of fact, ask us to follow them today. Obviously they did not know what they were talking about then. They misled Australia then. If we listen to them they will be misleading Australia again. again, the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has indulged in an attack on the Australian Labour Party or on individual members of it instead of facing up to the real problem that is confronting this nation. I ask the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) whether tbey listened attentively this afternoon and this evening to the remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley). Are honourable members opposite sincere when they say, as the honourable member for Mackellar, the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) and numerous other Government speakers have said, that China is the power behind the trouble in Vietnam; that China is surging forward and will be a threat to Australia in the future? I ask those members what they are doing to prevent this Government selling wheat, wool, metal and other goods to China, because these goods are being used, in all probability, to clothe and feed the Vietcong troops who are shooting down members of the Australian forces. What are honourable members opposite doing to stop their Government from selling these items to China if they believe that China is the threat that they say it is? Government supporters have been at great pains tonight to try to paint a picture that all is well on their side of the House and that they know all the answers. They would have us believe that to solve the problem all we have to do is go into Vietnam and fight-to keep banging away, in the words of the Prime Minister. The Labour Party has put forward a proposition to this House. I know that this proposition",101,Internationa L Affairs
167,Mr Galvin (Kingston) [10.50],"Onc ehas been put forward before. The honourable member for Mackellar and the Prime Minister quoted a great socialist, Michael Stewart, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the United Kingdom Government. It is pleasing to note that some Government supporters are reading the words of socialists. I hope they are heeding them. Mr Kevin Cairns -But the United Kingis in a position to know much more than dom Labour Party is different from your I do. I am prepared to give considerably Party. is different.

168,Mr Galvin,"I do not know how it he may be.to ask questions about this matter. I suppose that the Minister for External Affairs, even if he has information, could not give it to us now. Nevertheless, we in Australia must be vitally concerned with this question. In addition to the matters that I have mentioned, there is the dispute between Pakistan and India:-tw o powers that are members of the Commonwealth of Nations. We thought their dispute over one piece of territory had been settled. But a dispute between the two countries has now broken out again in Kashmir. This is a great tragedy. Singapore and Malaya, I suppose, and India-particularl y India-ar e the pattern for our parliamentary form of government and our democratic way of life in Asia. India cannot afford to wage wars, no matter how minor they may be, if she is at the same time to develop. She has had a border dispute with China, which is a threat to her all the time. India, in this situation, is now engaged in a struggle with Pakistan. I have said before in this House, and I say again, that where people are killing one another, in my view, they are at war. Whether people are killing one another with guns, bayonets or other weapons, one cannot disguise the fact that when opposing nations are destroying human life they are at war. And if this is not war it is murder. These problems are close to us in Australia. Later, I am sure, we shall hear more about these issues in this Parliament. I hoped that we would have heard the Minister say something about them on this occasion. As I have said, I do not criticise him, but I would have liked him to mention these matters and to tell us of measures that Australia could be taking to seize the initiative and try to bring about agreement between Pakistan and India without waiting for the United Kingdom or some other Commonwealth country to make the first move. We should take the initiative in most of these problems. As everybody has been quoting what somebody else has said, I intend in the next few moments to place on record the nine points made by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr Wilson, in the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons on Monday, 19th July. In summing up, Mr Wilson saidFirst, this is a war-and this is inevitable in pack ice. Those who think that these two initiatives conditions of modern war, even conventional war -whic h as long as it continues will bring death, destruction, tragedy, mutilation to thousands upon thousands of people whose only desire is to live in peace with their own people and wbo in all conscience have seen enough fighting, fighting on their own homeland, fighting without respite for almost a quarter of a century. He said that he thought there would be no disagreement with the proposition that it was a war. He continuedSecondly, this is a war which carries wilh it the gravest danger of escalation, of extension to the point where we might within a very short period of time see it extended to become a major land war on the Asian mainland. There is no doubt that that is quite true. However, I doubt whether in Australia we all face up to the truth of that. On both sides of Parliament we seem to think that it is for us to score off each other and to make the problem more confusing for the people to solve. Mr Wilson said that there was no military solution to this problem. The report statesFourthly, a soludon to this problem will not be found by military means alone. A decision to defer any hope of a political solution, to deny the means of a political solution, is a decision that the military measures may be itensified with all that that means . . . Fifthly, to get a political solution means getting men round a table. Every effort to do this-whethe r through the co-chairmen, whether through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, whether through the French initiative, whether through my right hon. Friend's message to the heads of the Geneva Conference governments, whether through the initiative of the 17 non-aligned countries, whether through the initiative of the Commonwealth peace mission and subsequent attempts to get acceptance of that mission-ha s so far foundered on the unwillingness of Hanoi andto the extent to which China accepts responsibility . . . He said that the efforts should be continued. He points out that the key to the situation is Hanoi and says how difficult it is to break through. He then commented on Mr Davies's Hanoi visit. He is a man who was mentioned by the Prime Minister tonight. Mr Wilson said that he felt that Mr Davies's visit had done some good, and he added that he hoped that in the cooler atmosphere of the debate recognition would be given to the difficult circumstances that Mr Davies had to face. He saidI believe that my honourable Friend's visit, while it has not melted the ice, has caused some cracks and shifting to take place m what seemed solid were wrong have a duty to explain what they would have done in these unique circumstances to stop the present conflict and the danger of a further drift to war. We on this side of the House find ourselves on common ground with our socialist friends in the United Kingdom because they, like us, continue to seek conferences, although the door has been slammed in our face and remains shut, because it is realised that we must continue in our attempts to find a solution. He pointed out that in the United Kingdom and in every other country there is a great desire for peace in Vietnam. Then he saidThat is a banner-the ""peace in Vietnam banner ""-that I hope we could all carry, although it is becoming clear that some of those who shout loudest for it, both here and he is talking about the United Kingdom, of courseand in other countries, are concerned not with peace in Vietnam but with victory in Vietnam. Of course, he is referring to those people from Hanoi and Peking and others who demand that the Americans get out. The Australian Labour Party has not demanded that the Americans get out. The United Kingdom Government has not demanded that the Americans get out. In fact, Mr Broadcasting Commission's channels, docuWilson has gone to great pains to show why the United Kingdom Socialist Labour Government supports the Americans in Vietnam. That does not stop them from battling on. It is worth repeating what he said. He said that there are some who are concerned not with peace in Vietnam but with victory in Vietnam. He then continuedThere will be no quick or easy victory for anyone, and a refusal to negotiate now will mean an intensification of the war in which, in the end inevitably, after thousands more have lost their lives, after thousands more have been made homeless, and after innumerable children have been made fatherless, the realisation will slowly dawn that peace will come only at the conference table. If that is what occurs, as I believe it will occur ultimately, the responsibility will lie on those who refuse to come to the conference table. For-le t us be clear-the enemies of negotiation are the enemies of peace. Peking? of peace are Hanoi and Peking. But that should not stop this Government from taking some initiative to continue to break have seen the extent of the decline in the through and knock on the door to try to force the issue and to try to build up greater world opinion. There was the recent slap in the face given to Marshal Tito and Prime Minister Shastri of India when an approach was made, through President Nasser, to Peking and Hanoi. The fact that they were slapped in the face and told there would be no negotiations will only strengthen in the long run world opinion and force this issue to the conference table. We must continue to strive for peace. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) is more or less in the terms of the communique of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, except that we add the little point about the Prime Minister's attitude. Perhaps we can say that he had something to do with the decision of the Prime Ministers' Conference, but apart from that, his attitude that we should keep banging away is not an attitude that reflects great credit on the Prime Minister nor on this country. We have been fortunate in this country because we have been privileged to see on television, particularly on the Australian mentaries of statements by Mr Wilson and Mr Michael Stewart. It gives me great pleasure to know that there are two great Socialists in this world who are fighting for peace and that their thoughts are akin to those of the Labour Party in this country. mains for me to sum up the debate for the night. I believe this has been a memorable occasion in our experience for several reasons. The first that comes to my mind is the devastating way in which it has focused the antipodean differences in the Labour Party. For instance, we have seen considerable courage on the part of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) and the honourable member for Batman( Mr Benson). Tbis, of course, could cost them dearly in their party if the agonising hedging of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) is an index Hanoi and of the need for caution. yourself?",103,Internationa L Affairs

We have seen the honourable member for Oxley( Mr obligations of our forces in the event of Hayden) and other honourable members opposite who now feel they can bark more openly. Above all, we have seen the degree of confusion which exists in the Opposition and which has come even more as a blanket over its thinking since tbe last occasion on which foreign affairs were debated. There are some things which, I believe, must be emphasised in any summing-up. The first that comes to my mind is the inexactivities. At page 71 he sayscusable lack of information on vital issues on the part of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), or his continuing and increasing subservient repetition of matters to which he has not given his heart. For instance, there is that amazing phrase to which several references have been made already tonight; namely, that our actions have been driving North Vietnam right into the arms of China. This philosophy that we ought to lay off because we might offend China will not bear scrutiny for a moment. In any case, what does a study of the nature of the North Vietnamese Government reveal vis-a-vis the Chinese regime? There are many commentators. Some of the most notable of them have stated that it is a dourly orthodox Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist regime, not in any way to be compared with the Yugoslavian outlook or even the Polish outlook. It is slavishly following a line that was learnt by Ho Chi Minh in the early stages of his career when he represented France in the Commintern and when he was receiving his early training at the hands of the Stalinists in Russia. This is a situation which is recognised by the honourable member for Fremantle who, unlike his leader, freely admits that ultimately this is a Chinese war. Those were his words. It may be by proxy. He went on to give the contradiction to his leader when he reasserted the domino theory; the way in which he believes the fall of Vietnam would lead on, in an unhappy succession, to the fall of Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and ultimately Malaysia. However, there were other ways in which the Leader of the Opposition showed his inability to understand what is going on. For instance, he made great play on the apparent obscurity of our relationship with Malaysia. He asked questions such as: What happens in the event of friction between Singapore and Malaysia? What are the internal dissension between the components of the Federation of Malaysia? One would expect a man in his position to know the answers to questions of that kind. Let me quote to him from a recent book written by Dr. Millar on Australian defence. Dr. Millar discusses A.N.Z.A.M., which is an arrangement for consultation on and coordination of military planning and One thing the (Commonwealth Strategic) Reserve-the Australian component, at least-wa s not to be used for was to put down any civil disturbances in Malaya or Singapore. In other words, it was clearly set down in the arrangements for consultation and coordination in respect of the setting up of the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve that the Australian troops were not to be used for the kind of friction which the Leader of the Opposition cited. The honourable member for Fremantle, who as 1 said made a courageous speech, when he was accusing honourable members on this side of the House of being prepared to come to terms in respect of trading with China in strategic materials, did not mention that all the Western powers have agreed on a list of strategic materials vis-a-vis China, and that Australia observes that list meticulously. Was it absolutely honest for him to speak in terms of our trading in steel when a moment's scrutiny would have shown him, or the answer to a question in the right place would have told him, that certain types of steel are on the list and those types of steel are not sold by Australia even to Hong Kong. We do not trade in those materials in respect of which trade is not permitted. If we decided not to trade in the materials in respect of which trade is permitted, other nations most surely would trade in them. In our position-w e are a small nation and a primary producing nationI believe that the Government has a duty to compare our potential to purchase weapons, such as the Mirage fighter and other extremely necessary organs of defence, with our selling wheat and what would happen if we did not sell it and it was supplied by some other nation. Of course, there is always the other side of the argument. Let us suppose that we refused to sell wheat to China and that within the next year there was a great famine. What a scream there would be from members of the Opposition and their do-good friends. We would be called the architects of starvation. Then we heard the honourable meniber for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) deliver another of his speeches. He sought to show that the Department of External Affairs is engaged in partisan philosophies. He quoted from a recent publication that has been given to us and which in the opening sentence refers to the war between France and the Vietnamese Communists known as the Viet Minh. He took exception to this. He maintained that this was an uninformed attitude on the part of the Department and suggested that officers of the Department had only to read the work of Bernard Fall and they would have been all right. Let me quote a passage for the benefit of the learned doctor. At page 382 of his book ""Road Without Joy "", Bernard Fall statesFor the French to grant independence to such a government would have, without the slightest doubt, resulted in a solidly Communist Vietnamese state . . . thus bringing about the domination of thc whole Indo-Chinese Peninsula by Communist forces. Yet again he saidThe Communist Government of Ho Chi Minh was in full control of the country's administration is the enemy's technique. as of VJ Day. Until thc French returned to Hanoi in March 1946 it used its unhindered control lo liquidate hundreds General Giap has admitted to 50,000 as a mistakeof Vietnamese anti-Communist nationalists likely to get in thc way. That is the opinion of Bernard Fall. I maintain that it squares absolutely wilh the opening sentence in the document issued by the Department of External Affairs. As one reads the speech of the Leader of the Opposition one is impressed by the fact that it is full of superficialities and slogans and is entirely devoid of a constructive word in relation to this desperate situation in which Australia is placed. When, by way of interjection, the Leader of the Opposition was asked for one solid, constructive comment he said: "" That is not our job. It is the Government's job."" That is a strange attitude for the Leader of the Opposition lo adopt. That is an amazing concept for a leader of a party to express. Is this parly so obsessed with its role that it feels obliged to join issue with the basic requirements of national defence and survival without suggesting any positive alternative? Is this the Labour Party's concept of its role? ls it the task of Her Majesty's Opposition to be utterly negative and destructive, even to the point of firing the enemy's most important weapons for him? How far does this concept of opposition take honourable members opposite? The Leader of the Opposition does not do this in ignorance. He challenged the Government for adopting military means alone. That is a false charge. He knowsthis is revealed by the way in which he speaks-that the war that is being waged is not' being fought just with weapons made from steel. This revolutionary warfare is guerrilla warfare plus a psycho-political, ideological content. We know the value of the political and psychological factors to the enemy. Then the Leader of the Opposition joined the enemy in the propaganda war that is raging today both outside and inside Australia. He did so, for example, in his reference to villages of the Vietnamese being destroyed by Australian and American troops. He said that we are destroying their villages. Not one word is uttered by honourable members opposite about what is being done by people from the north. This The Leader of the Opposition used certain phrases when talking about Malaysia. He spoke of the partial collapse of Malaysia and dissolution from within. These are very interesting terms indeed. It is .interesting to assess the role of members of the Opposition in relation to the internal politics of Malaysia as a result of frequent visits there. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, upon his return to Australia after one of his visits, spoke about the formation of a PanSouth East Asian Socialist entente. Let us consider the Communists' major lines of attack on the Vietnamese situation. For example, there is this constant harking back to the type of government that exists in South Vietnam. Let me quote one or two of the contributions from honourable members opposite in this regard. The Leader of the Opposition himself said that we prop up regimes of varying degrees of corruption. Then, of course, we all remember that Shakespearian roll of phrase of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) when he spoke of dirty, rotten, filthy, corrupt governments in South East Asia. We heard also from the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) who interjected: ""Give them free elections"". Then the honourable member for Oxley interjected "" Which governments? "" when the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) was speaking. What is the reality of this situation? We know the story of the way in which this particular war was prepared-undoub tedly under the unsuspecting noses of the Americans who were there with some hundreds of advisers. From the years 1956 and 1957 up to 1959 a purposeful plan was carried out to destroy, resistance and indeed to destroy the homogeneity of South Vietnam. There was a purposeful plan of murder, of the removal of mayors, youth leaders, teachers and doctors, indeed of anyThe attitude is: Leave them alone to go one who could form the backbone of information and of leadership in the South Vietnamese villages. During the year 1960 President Kennedy-and he has been quoted enough tonight-reporte d that 4,000 youth leaders and mayors had been murdered in South Vietnam. All this was before the we are driving North Vietnam right into shooting war, as we now know it, got under the arms of China because we are resisting way. Preparation was made for the comthe power of China. This is the frightening plete annihilation of any kind of political conclusion to which one comes after listenactivity on the part of the South Vietnamese. ing, not only to so many honourable members As we look at the reality of this type of Opposition mean by "" because we are resistgovernment in South Vietnam let us call a ing the power of China""? Is this the way spade a spade. In spite of what has been that the Opposition mind works? In their said by honourable members opposite, who thinking has China already won? Is it futile would deny Bernard Fall's contention that to resist any longer? This, I certainly susthe Government of South Vietnam was no pect, is one of the major arguments of the more corrupt or arbitrary than 90 per cent, peace mongers, the Walkers and the of the members of the United Nations? I Moyeses and those who value their skins so quote him exactly: ""Not one out of 10 highly that they would prefer to be Red governments in the United Nations today than dead. These men are not alone. The holds power by a less tainted source"". Communist fronts have done their work Would the Opposition contest the right to well in this country and today their effect exist of these dozens of other nations in the is seen in some of the universities, some of face of Communist subversion? Would it the churches, some of the trade unions and choose to champion the Communists on the some of the newspapers-than k God not in other hand as the exponents of real democthe majority. But Australia's thinking in this racy? Do honourable members opposite want regard is more petrified by fear than most real democracy or do they want unbridled people imagine. mob rule, leading speedily to that chaos and confusion where the strong minority-the dictator-slip s into power and pseudo criticised the domino theory that China democracy gives birth to totalitarianism? would march on across Asia. Does he deny This is Communist policy. This is the to the nation that this is Communist policy? policy supported by many honourable members opposite without regard to the setting or the circumstances. "" Give them free elections"" is the cry, despite circumstances of murder, terror or coercion and the incomprehension of people on whom they would force a foreign political system. This is the starry eyed naive nonsense which lies at the basis of so many failures in the United Nations recently and in the rapid acceleration of political concepts in the world. The Geneva Accords of 1954 were doomed from the start because they were in too much of a hurry and had insufficient realism about policing the interim period prior to any attempt at self determination. In my book the statement of the honourable member for Oxley"" Give them free elections"" is the modern equivalent to Pontius Pilate's call for a bowl of water. to hell in their own way. The honourable member is backed up by a celebrated colleague in Professor McMahon Ball. The Leader of the Opposition said that from opposite, but to people in other parts of the nation. What does the Leader of the The Leader of the Opposition, of course, Does he disregard the clearly stated objectives of Marshal Chen Yi with regard to Thailand for example? Does he discount the Communist terrorist activities inside Malaysia and the number of men being trained inside Indonesia, as they have been training Chinese from Sarawak? Does he care about Sukarno's more recent statements about Timor? If this is not the set up for dominos I do not know what is. In short, does the Leader of the Opposition care, or does he even know? Or does he prefer the melodramatic sentimentality of his ghost writers? Again the Leader of the Opposition deplores this Government's actions in resorting to military measures. He makes a fine debating point of the half truth that you cannot win all wars with force, yet does he know what Mao Tse-tung said about political power growing out of the muzzle of a rifle? Does he remember what Marx and Engels said 120 years ago about the place of violence and terror? Does he remember Hungary, Tibet or Korea? The question uppermost in my mind after listening for nearly two years to my friends opposite is: How many of these men opposite are really free to say what they think? In my opinion, from the leader down, they look, act and debate like those who are under subservience to an outside force-al l save a few who clearly quite bitterly enjoy their attacks on our security. One area that has not been mentioned except in passing is New Guinea. WeJiave done well in this land. I hope that I am right in feeling that we have many sane and sensible friends among the indigenous population. But let us remember also that Police Commissioner Cole has recently pointed out that the spearheads of the cold war are already pointing into the heart of that land. Make no mistake, the enemy will try with all the means at his disposal to develop a cold war there. First you have the dissident few. Then the Communists build up behind them. Then there is the appeal, as Marshal Chen Yi has pointed out, to civil disturbance and war. The best possible insurance lies in quality of leadership, especially in terms of our own leadership, coupled with ideological and political development of these people. Administrative officials are invaluable and I believe that we in Australia must see to it that in the years ahead we give every opportunity to our best thinkers and our best young men to make their contribution to the development of this land from which we have so little to gain. It is not a rich country. It will never repay in terms of £ s. d. the money put into it. In matters of development the young people in Papua and New Guinea are looking to us with expectation and friendship. I believe that together we can build a pattern that will give the lie to the white Australia misconception and show that we are the kind of friendly people who can build a new nation.

184,16 ( Mr Speaker,"Hon. Sir John McLeay.)Waterfront Employment. Motion (by Mr Hasluck) proposedThat the House do now adjourn. [11.43] -Yesterday afternoon the Minister would be dangerous on the waterfront, for Labour and National Service( Mr because he will not tell me whether or not McMahon) was asked a question by the he means to do what the employers want honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess). him to do. His reply would have me guessing It was quite a reasonable question, not perwhether he proposes to introduce by legislahaps of the kind that I would ask, seeking tion a system of automatically applying disinformation as to what the Government ciplinary measures without first hearing the proposed to do about the head-on collision explanation of the individual, because that on the Australian waterfront. In reply to is what the employers want and that is that question, the Minister first referred to what is in the log of claims which the a statement which he had made and which employers have filed. His reply would have had received wide publicity in the Press. me guessing whether he wants to impose still Then he went on to sayI have not made any statement on the matter employers want. since then, and I have quite deliberately refrained from doing so. I believe it is wise to keep them guessing. Today, in an attempt to take this matter a stage further and get some clear understanding as to where we were going in relation to this head-on collision, I put to the Minister a reasonable type of question, concluding with an inquiry as to how long he intended to keep us guessing before he or his Department took some action towards bringing the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers to the conference table to try to stop the conditions that are tying up industry on the waterfront. I do not know whether the Minister thinks he is smart or not in telling me in this Parliament that he is going to keep me guessing, too; but, when national responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of a Minister, that Minister is writing down the prestige of this Parliament when he tries to be a smartie in the Parliament. IfI took the Minister's reply literally, huge penalties that have been imposed on it would have me guessing as to whether he the Waterside Workers Federation to date. is actually preparing legislation to take away We all know that the waterside workers from the Waterside Workers Federation all have had penalties amounting to £2 million the rights at present held by the Federation imposed upon them since the penal legislawith relation to the recruitment of labour, tion was introduced into this Parliament. because that is what the employers have And even the imposition of £2 million in asked for.

The reply would have me guessing, too, as to whether he wants to introduce legislation to provide for the introduction of the piecework or bonus higher and more vicious penalties for port stoppages, because that, too, is what the The Minister said to me that the employers have not asked him to do anything. PerhapsI framed my question incorrectly. But those certainly are the things that the employers want the Minister to do, and, knowing what this Minister did on the last occasion when he introduced the long service leave provisions, I become hesitant in my thinking, and I find myself guessing whether he wants to follow the same lines of action that he followed on the last occasion. This Minister knows full well what the employers' claims are. The Minister knows full well that this is a case of a head-on collision. He knows full well, too, that it is a function of his Department to bring the parties together and to try to drive some sense into both sides, not to inflict all the penalties on the one side only. The fight between the waterside workers and the employers has been going on for generation after generation. We all know of the",110,Pairs
185,"Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland) System On The Waterfront, Something Which","to thc problem, a problem that is worldwide? This problem is not peculiar to Australia; it is worldwide. Instead of being funny, the Minister should have his officers get these people together at a round table conference. He should not be planning legislation and keeping us guessing. Fancy a Minister saying he is keeping Parliament guessing on a national question such as this. Such an attitude does no more than reduce his status in this Parliament to a level below that becoming a man appointed to Cabinet rank. 1 have no brief for either side in respect of what is happening on the waterfront because this is another head-on collision, and it is having such an effect on the country's economy that none of us wants to see it last one day longer. I wonder why the Minister keeps me guessing about whether the waterside workers have a genuine case in their application for a pension. Surely the waterside worker is as good as the employee of Broken Hill Company Pty. Ltd. I remind the Minister that the employees of that company have been given a pension without asking for it. The company handed its employees £6,000 for a contribution by them of less than £500. Yet, when the waterside workers dare to ask for a pensions scheme, the Minister keeps us guessing as to whether he has an interest in the matter. He knows, too, that the decent employers on the waterfront are contributing to a mechanisation fund. The number may be small, but if the honourable member is one who wants the kindof thing that the employers want, let me read the last item and see whether he is happy about it. It states that if the union will solve all the problems of the employers and will prevent stoppages and agree to drastic penalties for port stoppages, thc employers will agree to look at the practicability of a contributory pension scheme. That is one of the reasons for the head-on collisions in this industry at the present time. It is true that the blame can be levelled at both sides, but is it not competent for the Minister to do something to bring the parties together around the table in an endeavour to settle this question which cannot be settled by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission because it is outride the field of the Commission's operations? Surely the Minister can give this House, and those who are interested in the welfare of not only the waterside workers but also of everyone else in the community a better answer than, "" I will keep you guessing"". I say to the Minister that these smart tactics do not do him or this Parliament justice. In the years that I have been in this place I have tried to couch my questions in a manner which would elicit information and help those I am seeking to help. 1 will not be treated in this way by a Minister who thinks that he is the smartie and that I can be kept guessing. Let me warn the Minister that this is the kind of approach which lowers the level of the Parliament in the public mind. This Parliament is entitled to have questions which are put to the Minister answered in a better way than the Minister answers them. In addition, this Parliament and this country are entitled to a better effort than is now being made by the Minister and his Department towards settling the disputes on the waterfront which are resulting in these head-on collisions.

The honourable gentleman was clearly confused as to the substance of the question asked by the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess). That honourable member asked me what the Government intended to do to restore sanity to the waterfront and what action it intended to take in the light of the fact that the Waterside Workers Federation had decided to hold 24 hour stoppages on each alternate Wednesday.

As to the last question he asked, known in this community. whether initiative would be taken to call a fresh conference, I believe I should warn the House again about the kind of people we are dealing with and the kind of response you can expect to get from them if you ever do enter into an agreement with them. The honourable member will know that in 1963, after there had been a series of strikes almost as serious as those that are now taking place, at the request of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, senior officials of the A.C.T.U., the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, the every one of us, came to a solemn agreement.
