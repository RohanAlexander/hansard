2,Mr Thompson,"In view of thethe session closes, of the actual arrangements, if any, made by or with the concurrence of the Government, for any trips both inside and outside Australia; and will he particularly give the House information of any projected touring excursion to Japan and the Mandated Territories, and state whether the Government intend to arrange and finance these trips, and whether the personnel of the parties is being arranged by the Government, and on what ground; and, finally, whether the Government will be able to give an assurance to the taxpayers that these trips will be worth the money spent on them, and in what way they will justify their expense? such urgency that it could not have beon placed on the notice-paper, but probably at this stage of the session it will be better to deal with it as urgent. strongly deprecate the suggestion that any trips that may bo arranged to enable honourable members to visit parts of Australia or other countries are in the nature of picnics. Honourable members will moke such visits as may be made, because of the great benefit to be derived by inquiring thus into some questions of national interest, or establishing friendly relations with the people of other countries. arrangements have been made for a trip outside Australia except that to the Mandated Territories. Arrangements for that visit are not complete, but it was, I think, the will of the whole House that some honourable gentlemen should visit those Territories during the recess to see for themselves how Australia is carrying out her great and sacred obligations under the Mandate. Territory trip was to have taken place almost immediately on the rising of the House, hut I announced the other day that, owing to other arrangements mado by honourable members, that trip had been postponed. proposed visits to Japan and other places, the following is a telegram I have received from Mr Hume Ford, the director of the Pan-Pacific Union:Have cable from secretary House of Peers introduced this session, and as certain that Diet not in session, out if Australian parliamentarians visit Japan will be welrestrictions have been placed on the comed by Japanese officials and people. at the notice-paper, that the first six items have still to be dealt with, and in addition there is the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Bill, a very important measure, and additional Estimates. It will be very difficult to get through this programme to-day, and I suggest that the Prime Minister adjourn at train time until Monday, so that -we might complete the business on that day. Failing that, and as the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Bill has not yet been introduced, und as it is necessary that honourable members should give an expression of opinion as to what the amount of the pension should be, an early place should bo found for the B i ll in to-day's proceedings. What action does the Prime Minister intend to take in this matter? the Leader of the Opposition has referred to, with the exception of No. 2 on the notice-paper, will not occupy this House very long, and there is no reason why our business should not be disposed of without adjourning and meeting again next week. BubI am very anxious to meet the wishes of the honourable gentleman and his party, and the Government are prepared At present no to deal with the Old-age ' and Invalid Pensions Bill immediately after the amendments made by the Senate to the Advances to Settlers Bill have been considered.

If that has been the practice, how is it that there is not in the Department a record of those assessments? individual taxpayer is kept separate; the amounts owing by leaseholders have never been brought together on any list or in any ledger. I am told that to get information of the amount due by individuals it would be necessary to go through the whole series of files. The details are almost inextricably mixed. Practically every person who is taxed on a Crown lease is also taxed on freehold property, and it would mean an immense amount of work to analyze the records. no records in the office of the amount the different leaseholders owe to the Government, how was he able to tell the House the total amount outstanding? member really desires this information he should have allowed me to speak when I intended the other night; but honourable members opposite kept on interfering with me by rising to points of order. vented from speaking by his own guillotine. that the amounts are taken out of the details each year, and recorded as totals in the report of the Land Tax Commissioners.

MALONEY asked the Minister representing the Ministerf o r Home and Territories, upon notice1. What is the total amount spent to date in connection with the rain-making experiments made by Mr Balsillie? 2. Will the Minister inform the House what benefit, if any, to Australia, was obtained by such experiments? 3. Is Mr Balsillie in the Federal Service; if so, what are severally his. salary, allowances, and expenses? honourable member's questions are as f o l low 1. Allowing for value of material still on hand, the cost was about £6,000. Mr Balsillie was not paid any salary' or remuneration. 2. There is hardly any question which could be of greater importance to Australia tlian rain stimulation. In view of this, and the fact that Mr Balsillie had proved his ability in other scientific directions, it was decided to incur some expenditure in investigating a matter of such importance. The experimenters claimed that a more than average rainfall within a certain radius of the experimental stations resulted, but only prolonged operations over years could definitely prove whether the claim is correct. 3. Mr Balsillie has not been in the Public .Service for years. CASE OF MR . J . MORTBY .

The possession of property members. In introducing this measure exceeding £310 in value was sufficient to a brief outline of the trend of invalid disqualify a claimant. The Act also proand old-age pensions legislation in Ausvided for the payment of invalid pentralia may be of interest to honourable sions, but the actual payment of these members. Prior to the introduction of pensions was not brought into effect until old-age pensions, the only prospect for December, 1910. The first liberalization of the aged who were without means, and of the pensions law was made in December, whose friends were unable to provide for 1912, by the second Fisher Administration. them, was accommodation in benevolent Up to that time contributions made by asylums and charitable homes. The main objection to these institutions was the taint of pauperism, it being considered that they were replicas of the poor-houses in Great Britain. Many children who desired to have their parents Avith them were unable to, because of their own needy circumstances. Families thus became separated, not through lack of filial affection, but through tbe unfortunate compulsion of poverty. In Australasia the lead in providing old age pensions was taken by New Zealand, which commenced the payment of penJanuary, 1907. New South Wales also brought in similar legislation later in the same year, and in July, 1908, Queensland copied the example of the southern the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman), whose ment of pensions in New South Wales before he entered this Parliament, and in able members.

78,Mr Groom,Yes; that is the effect,23,Eable Page Read A First Time Second Reading
79,Motion (By Mr Bectce) Agreed To,"children to their parents constituted income. As a result, many persons were debarred from the benefits of the Act merely because their children maintained them in their old age. By the 1912 Act contributions from children towards the support of their parents were exempted from computation of income. The same Act also provided that the value of the pensioner's home should be exempted from the calculations of property. That has been the law ever since. The value of the homes of invalid and old-age pensioners is exempted altogether. is worthy of notice, however, that no increase was made in the rate of pension, although the statistician's figures showed that the sum necessary to purchase a certain' amount of food, groceries, and housing had risen from 20s. in 1909-10 to 23s. 5d. in 1912-13, an increase of nearly 20 per cent. abnormal conditions which obtained immediately following the outbreak of war pressed very heavily upon all sections of the community, and undoubtedly the burden was felt very severely by persons in receipt of invalid and old-age pensions. Nothing in the way of ameliorating their lot was done until September, 1916, when the .second Hughes Administration increased the rate of pension from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per week, and the limit of income from 20s. to 22s. 6d. It may here bo noted that the sum necessary to provide food, groceries, and housing had increased from 20s. in 1909-10 to 27s. 3d. in 1916-17, so the rate of pensions was still rather behind the cost of living. In addition to providing for an increase in the rate of pension the 1916 amending Bill also authorized the payment of 2s. per week to pensioners in benevolent and charitable institutions. No further amending legislation was introduced until October, 1919, when the second National War Government submitted a measure to increase the rate of pension from 12s. 6d. to 15s. per week, and increasing the limit of income from 22s. 6d. to 25s. per week. It will be noted that in all these increases the limit of income was increased by the actual amount of the pension increase. In this Bill the Government propose to depart from that principle, and make more liberal provisions. It is proposed to make the limit of income 5s. higher than previously, although the increase in the rate of pension is only 2s. 6d. When the 1919 amending legislation was introduced, the sum necessary to provide food, groceries, and housing had increased from 20s. in 1909-10 to 33s. l i d . In July, 1920, special legislation was introduced by the second National War Government solely for the benefit of blind persons. That Act authorized an increase in the income limit, enabling a blind pensioner and his wife to have between them an income of £221 per annum, including the penIt sion. In the measure now before honourable members it is proposed to increase the maximum rate of pension from 15s. to 17s. 6d. per week, and, in addition, the amount which a pensioner may earn without affecting the rate of pension will be increased from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per week. This will permit a pensioner to have a total income of 30s. per week The At present the limit is 25s. Only about 6 per cent, of the total number of pensioners supplement their income in this way, so that any reduction in pension payments must, be due to property disqualifications or something of that nature. The increase in the amount which the pensioners will be able to earn is estimated to increase the expenditure of the. Commonwealth by £150,000. Honourable members will see that this increase has not proceeded in regular steps, and if the provision applied to the wholo of the pensioners the increase it would: involve would amount to £250,000, because so many more would be brought within the operation of the double rate. Although the rate of pension has already been increased on two occasions, this is the first instance-wit h the exception of the occasion upon which the increase to .blind pensioners was provided for-in which provision has been made to allow the pensioner to earn a little more money without affecting the rate of the pension, A single person under this Bill will be able to enjoy an income of pension and earnings up to 30s. per week, whilst the total income of married pensioners may be as high as £ 3 a week. The latest figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician-and I had them checked when I introduced the Budget-showe d that the cost of food, groceries, and housing, which was 20s. in 1909, is now 34s. 3d. per week. The rate of pension in 1909 was 20s. per fortnight, and, as a result oi the passing of this Bill, it will be raised to 35s. per fortnight. Numerous modifications of the Act are proposed, whicb will very materially improve the position of the pensioners. first time in which any increase has been made really consistent with the increase in the cost of living. the cost of living include the cost of olothing ? ject to correction, that the cost of clothing is included in the estimate. honourable members that the Government proposal is a generous one. standing that the cost of living has increased since 1910 the rate of pension will, under this Bill, for the first time be proportionate to the needs of the pensioners. that bhe pension should not be paid to a person possessed of property to the value of £310 or over. Although the limit of income has been increased on two occasions, no corresponding increase has ever been made in respect to the value of property which the pensioner may possess without losing the right to a pension. The Government proposal is a most sympathetic one, and is as generous as it possibly can be in view of the financial position of the Commonwealth at the present time. any relief to parents who are keeping an invalid child? I may say that a ruling was in existence which limited strictly the amount of the income of parents allowed to draw a pension for an invalid member of the family. One of the first executive acts of the present Government was to liberalize this rule, and many of these cases have since been reviewed and pensions have been granted which previously were refused. MrE . RILEY -If I have an invalid son or daughter and am earning £5 or £6 a week, will that income be held to justify the withholding of the invalid pension f before the advent of the present Government to office there had been an Executive ruling to the effect that in such cases the invalid pension should not be paid where the income of the parents was, I think, £4 5s. per week. The present Government has decided that the matter shall be at the discretion of the Commissioner of Pensions, after an investigation of the whole of the circumstances of each This is the case. likely that the Commissioner will adhere to the old rule. I am able to say that many cases that have come under my own notice have been reviewed, and pensions have been granted in cases in which they were previously refused because of the rigid way It will at once be clear to in which the provisions .of the Act had been interpreted. tion now. placed on the earnings of the parents in such cases? amount has been fixed. The circumOriginally the Act provided stances of each case are reviewed. This is a matter which requires a certain elasticity of administration, and the object should be to insure the proper attention and treatment of the invalid. I was saying that originally a person was entitled to hold property to the value of £310 without losing the right to an old age pension. The first alteration in this connection was made in 1912, when the value of the old-age pensioner's home was excluded from the amount of property which might be possessed. The Government in this Bill continues that pro, vision, but proposes to raise'the property limit from £310 to £400. made in the case of money >which a pensioner may have in a bank'? cluded in estimating the value of the pensioner's property. Under this Bill, the total amount of property the pensioner may hold without losing his right to the pension will be £400, instead of £310, as at present. The pensioner will still be entitled, as in the past, to a special exemption of £50 before any reduction is made in the pension. In this connection, the same rate will be applied as in the past, which is £1 a year for every £10 of property, and under this Bill a pensioner having property of the value of £390 will still be able to obtain £12 or £13 a year in pension, despite the fact that he has property of that value in his possession.

99,Dr. Earle Page,"No. The Actpensions at the present time with their cost when the system was first introduced. When the Commonwealth took over the payment of invalid and old-age pensions in 1909 there were 41,116 pensions in force, involving a liability of £946,000 per annum. On the 30th June, 1923, fourteen years later, the pensions in force numbered 147,453, and the annual liability Avas increased to £5,518,000, or more than five times the amount which was paid fourteen years ago. It is expected that the liberalization of the provisions of the Act will lead to an increase in the number of pensions claimed, and the expenditure will, of course, be correspondingly greater. In my Budget speech I made provision for an increase during the present financial year, of which there is practically ten months to run. This will mean an increase in the expenditure for the balance of the present financial year of £1,065,000. The total estimated expenditure for old-age pensions for 1923-24 is £6,490,000. total additional expenditure when the whole year is considered will be between £1,300,000 and £1,500,000. The additional amount is somewhat difficult to estimate, because when the conditions arc liberalized many people who before did not think it worthwhile to bother about the old-age pension send in their applications for pensions immediately. From the figures I have given honourable members will see that the cost of invalid and old-age pensions represents a heavy burden on the taxpayers, and consumes a substantial proportion of the total revenue of the Commonwealth. The expenditure will, of course, continue to increase as the population increases, and the burden upon the taxpayers will become greater. said nothing of the amendment I suggested to him. member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) and other honourable members informed me of the anomalous position of certain invalids who have been in Australia for many years, and owing to their arrival here at an older age than three years they were not eligible for pensions. The Government propose to adopt an amendment which will permit of the payment of invalid pensions to persons with a definite disability after twenty-five years' residence in Australia. short period, invalids might be dumped here indiscriminately to obtain a permanent pension. The present Act provides that if they arrive here over the age of three years they are not entitled to the benefit of the invalid pension. years' residence. alteration, the Government accept the amendment. Despite the considerable expenditure involved, the Government have fully met the position by liberalizing the pension conditions to enable the aged and infirm, to live in decency and comfort for the remainder of their lives. The Government realize that the provision now being made does not really conform to the needs of the nation, and, if posThe sible, they would have increased the pension to £1. But this would have involved an alteration of the whole scheme of old-age pensions, and as there was no certainty that that high rate could be continued even if , as has been suggested, it were paid for a year or two out of surplus revenue; the subsequent state of the finances might have forced a reduction. The time has arrived when the whole question of providing for, not merely old ago and sickness both temporary and permanent, but also for accident and unemployment, should be considered in a comprehensive way and placed on a satisfactory and permanent basis, to. remove altogether the taint of pauperism that might bo attached to the operation of this measure. The Government feel that the pioneers of this Treasurer has country arc entitled to a pension arrived at on a proper basis. It is proposed to appoint a Royal Commission, consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament, to inquire into the whole question of sickness, accident, old age, permanent invalidity, and unemployment, to obtain the data available from all parts of the world, and to submit as early as possible, probably next session, a comprehensive scheme.

105,Dr. Earle Page,"With thatmore liberal basis than is tbe present provision will be evolved, and information obtained to enable tbem to ascertain whether a scheme providing for unemployment can be satisfactorily instituted in Australia at present. Honourable members agree that this Bill is very necessary, and I am very pleased that the Government have introduced it before the close of the session. Provision is made for many changes in the old-age pension conditions, and in many respects they are liberalized. The important feature of the Bill is the increase of the pension itself. I have persistently urged in the House, and I believe I have the support of many honourable members on the other side, that the amount should be increased to £1 instead of 17s. 6d. per week. When this matter was previously discussed in the HouseI asked that the order of leave be made sufficiently wide to enable such an amendment to be moved, but at this stage the order of leave does not permit of it . 1 understand that if the House is tested and a majority is favorable to the increase of the pension to £ 1 , the Government will offer no objection. have already intimated that the finances cannot stand an extra expenditure of nearly £1,500,000. weeks ago the Prime Minister informed me that the order of leave would be sufficiently wide to enable the House to decide whether the pension should be 17s. 6d. or £ 1 . I later questioned the Treasurer, and he said that the Prime Minister had already given me that promise. Prime Minister had staged that he would give consideration to the honourable member's request. the Prime Minister that if the House agreed to the increase the Government would accept it .

The that it would not preclude the moving of , Treasurer now seems to object. It seems an amendment to increase the pension now that an amendment cannot be moved. extraordinary action on the part of the Government. shaken my confidence, and I ask the Prime Minister to let the House know the position. In view of the present state of the finances, I conscientiously believe that the increase to £1 per .week could be made. The Treasurer stated that the increase of 2s. 6d. per week and the raising of the earning capacity to 25s. per fortnight involved an expenditure of £1,136,000. In 1923 there were 107,389 old-age pensioners and 40,064 invalid pensioners, making a total of 147,453. By making the increase 5s. the amount of £1,136,000 would not be doubled, but would be £1,916,889, inasmuch as the figures relating to the earning capacity and other matters would already be included in the 2s. 6d. increase, and therefore would not affect the further increase. A further increase of 2s. 6d. would add £958,444 to the amount of £1,136,000, making a total of £2,094,444. I see no reason why a .larger increase of the old age and invalid pension cannot be provided from the large surplus which the Treasurer has in hand. The honourable gentleman stated that, in comparison with the time when the pension was first granted, the purchasing power of the sovereign to-day is only 14s. 3d., and. I understand that the latest statistics show that the cost of living increased by 3.0 per cent, during the last quarter. In view of the constantly increasing cost of living there is every justification for enlarging the pension. I shall not move any amendment on the second reading. I am purposely deferring my action until the Committee stage, in the hope that the Government will permit the House to express its opinion as to whether the pension should be increased to 17s. 6d. or £1. I wish it to be distinctly understood that any vote upon that issue will not be regarded by the Opposition as vital.",27,Eable Page Read A First Time Second Reading

[12.44] -The attitude taken up by the honourable member for Fawkner will not commend itself to the Committee. The Prime Minister was not right in announcing that this amendment would be regarded by the Government as vital. The honourable member for Fawkner has said that the right honourable gentleman's announcement places honourable members on-the Ministerial side in an awkward g osition, but it should not do so. The Government was prepared to remit £1,300,000 of taxation that was due to the Commonwealth from the wealthy leaseholders. We, on this side of the House, stopped that. We think it only a fair thing that the money saved'should be devoted to helping the old-age and invalid pensioners. It seems to me that the position of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) is cowardly. ber, for Fawkner was responsible for the amendment that saved' that money. matter was raised first of all on this side of the' House by the honourable member.' for Yarra( Mr Scullin). The honorable member for Fawkner would not have said' a word about it had it not been raised by tlie Opposition. ber for Yarra raised the point at the earliest possible moment that it could have been raised. No one else, had a chance to raise it . sider that the money so saved to the Commonwealth should be applied to the purpose of. this amendment. The honourable member for Fawkner knows that' sympathy is not of much good to pensioners or anybody else. that. let the honourable member give us his vote if he wants to help the pensioners. I desire that the old-age pensioners should receive £1 a week, but if th£t is not' possible, we must get the best we can in the circumstances. I have supported £1 a week before to-day, and would be very glad if the Government could see its Way to> make the pension up to that amount. If this Bill is not passed the pensioners will continue to get only 15s. a week. The Government has promised to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole question of pensions and other like matters of national importance. In the circumstances, I shall vote for the clause in the Bill and against the amendment. I am glad that the Government intends to pay a pension to those who were inmates in asylums and institutionsprior to the passing of the original pensions Act. I understand, also, that the value of property which a pensioner may hold without interfering with his pensions' rights is to be increased to £400. That will be of some assistance to a few people. In voting for this clause and against the amendment I believe that I am studying the interests of the pensioners, because if the amendment should be carried-the Bill, will be shelved and the pensioners will have no hope of any increase in their pensions, for a good. many, months. -The Committee finds itself in amost peculiar position.

125,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [12.52].,"the Government has introduced a number of measures to give financial relief to wealthy sections of the community, and yet it tells us now that it cannot increase the pension to the aged and infirm. The only word that can be applied to these circumstances is "" disgraceful."" Why has the Prime Minister bound his supporters to vote in a certain way? Is it because he is anxious, on the eve of his departure for Great Britain, to obtain some kind of a vote of confidence? The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr discuss. Every effort should be made to Maxwell) and the honourable member for Henty( Mr F. Francis) tell us that they are pledged to support a pension of 20s., but because the Government intends to make this vote a vital matter they are willing to vote against the amendment. vote in favour of making the pension £1. cowardly for the Prime Minister to compel his supporters to vote against the amendment. cowardly in allowing the Prime Minister to dragoon them. Why should they weakly and supinely submit, to such treatment? It is high time that the pensioners were afforded some relief from, their sufferings. They have been starved during the last few years, because of the high cost of living. It is despicable of the Government to withhold payment of the increased pension until 11th September. It should be paid as from the beginning of the financial year. I ask the Government to look at this matter from a humane point of view; and I ask those supporters of the Government who are favorable to increasing the pension to £1 to show a little Australian pluck and to cut adrift from politics for a few moments and, without fear of the resultof their vote, give the pensioners a little British fair play. I am very sorry that the debate has assumed this acrimonious tone. I am pledged to vote for a pension of £1 a week, and I shall do so. I thought that the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was very moderate and tolerant. I am sorry that the Government will not accept his proposals. I want to pay a tribute to the Government for bringing the measure down. know,, has to act in a way that will conserve the financial interests of the people of Australia; but he should also act to conserve Australia's honour. I believe that Australia would be better served by cutting down expenditure somewhere else and increasing the pension to £ 1 a week. I hope that even now the Government will agree to the amendment. This question is one of the most important that this Committee has had to pay an equitable pension. Our duty is to pay the invalid and old-age pensioners an adequate amount; and even the Government admits that the pension is not adequate. The most pathetic correspondence that honourable members get comes from the old-age and invalid pensioners. I am not pledged to Sometimes they get six such letters at a time, and all of them plead for an increase in the pension so that the pensioners may enjoy a little more of the good things of life. Even 20s. would not be a sufficient His supporters are also pension, for it would provide only a bare existence. I believe that the first call on the revenue of the country should be for these pensions. honourable member to say that both £1 and 17s. 6d. a week are too little?

Ministerial supporters have weakened to such an extent, as a result of the onslaughts made by honourable members on this side, that the Prime Minister has resorted to the very desperate expedient of threatening them with a dissolution if they dare to vote for the amendment. The prestige and dignity of the Prime Minister should not be paramount in a matter like this. It is extraordinary that, vernment are unable to grant more than in connection with what is, perhaps, the most important measure that has been dealt with by Parliament this session, honourable members supporting the Government should meekly back down and desert principles which they have enunciated until recently. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) and the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr responsible for its financial proposals, Austin Chapman) have been constant in their declaration that the aged and infirm people of this country are entitled to at least £1 per week. In the last Parliament, the Minister, who was then a private member, went so far as to put on the notice-paper a motion which, if carried, would have been a direction to the Government to increase the pension to £1 per week. It will be very difficult for him to justify his present attitude. I hope that honourable members will stand to their principles and vote for the amendment. sire to enter my protest against the action of the Government in introducing this Bill at the eleventh hour, and expecting its passage without affording honourable members a reasonable opportunity of considering its provisions. I protest, also, against the Prime Minister threatening his. supporters with a dissolution if they adhere to principles which some of them, until recently, have so enthusiastically supported. If they weaken now they will be guilty of gross political cowardice. Honourable members opposite have been prepared to vote away hundreds of thousands of pounds in remissions of taxation and for the payment of it is proposed to vote an additional £1,000,000 for the relief of the infirm and aged in the community, they weakly obey the behests of the Prime Minister and oppose it . I have no desire to delay the passage of the Bill, but I Apparently the could not allow this opportunity to pass without voicing my protest against the attitude of the Government. ' I only wish to say that, like many other honourable members on this side of the House, I am quite in sympathy with the proposal to show every consideration to our invalid and old-age pensioners. But, as the Treasurer has stated that the Gothe increase proposed in the Bill, and as the Prime Minister has stated the view which the Government will take of any action that is likely to put them in a difficult position, there is no option for honourable members who are in the same position as myself; we must support the Government. For the Government is and any action which seriously embarrasses its policy may precipitate a crisis involving the pensioners.in the loss of the proposed increase. We are in full sympathy with the desire that our invalid and old-age pensioners shall receive the most liberal treatment possible, but we must agree to the proposal of the Government rather than risk that there shall be no increase at all. It is rather interesting to recall that Labour, when in power, made no attempt to increase pensions. the payment of the invalid and old-age pensions as a dole or act of charity on the part of the Government, but as something to which the recipients are entitled for their services to this country. Many of the old people who are now in indigent circumstances have made it possible for those who followed them to make good, and, therefore, there should not be the slightest hesitation in treating them as liberally as possible. I have the greatest admiration for our old-age pensionersfar more, indeed, than I have for many people who have amassed wealth by dubious methods. During the last few days, we have been voting away hundreds of thousands of pounds in remissions of taxation and for the payment of bounties. Therefore, we should hob turn down this request for the payment of £ 1 per week to our invalid and old-age pensioners. We have been told",31,Eable Page Read A First Time Second Reading

His wife has a sinall grocery put in a tight corner, because, while many of them agree that the pension should be increased to £ 1 , they do not desire to see the Government defeated, and will, therefore, vote against the amendment. I wish 'to refer to some provisions of the existing Act which require alteration. A person .must have resided continuously in the -Commonwealth for twenty years before he -becomes entitled to an old-age pension. I had a letter a few months ago from a lady who was born in England, and who left that country for Australia thirty years -ago. She spent the first eighteen years of her residence in Australia in the State of Victoria. She then went to New Zealand, and resided there for about -six years. She returned to Victoria, and, although she is now sixty years of age, and has resided in Australia and New Zealand for the last thirty years, she is not eligible for an old-age pension. J trust that the Treasurer will consider the desirability of altering the provision .requiring continuous residence for twenty years in Australia to entitle a person to the old-age pension. I consider that a British-born subject coming to Australia, and living, say, twenty-five years, continuously in Australia and New Zealand, is justly entitled to the benefit of the Commonwealth Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act. If the Treasurer is able by regulation to alter this provision in the way I suggest, and will do so, he will confer a great benefit on many deserving persons in this community. down that a man or a woman must be .absolutely incapacitated from all kinds of work to be entitled to an invalid pension. We all know of cases in which, for all practical purposes, a person is an invalid, but because he is able to do a little light work he is not entitled to an invalid pension. I have had a case of the kind in hand for some considerable time, and I must admit that in connection with it I have received the utmost courtesy from every one in the Pensions Department. The officers there have done their very .best to overcome the difficulty, but the provisions of the Act prevent them from doing the right thing. The case I have had in hand is that of a man whose left leg ds so drawn up that his heel reaches the back of his knee-cap. He is nearly sixty years of age, and, of course, no one will employ him. He cannot run a business, and can only poke about in store, and he is able to open the.door in the morning and sweep the floor. They have .a little jinker in which they cart groceries from <a .merchant's stores in Warrnambool to their shop. The wife .or daughter harness the horse to the jinker, the husband is put into it , and drives to the . merchant's store. The goods .required are put into the conveyance, and he drives .the cart hack. Because.he does this light work for his wife he is debarred under the Act from .obtaining an invalid pension. If the Treasurer; could meet cases of that kind by regulation he would be doing a very fine thing. '1 have stated two cases, which show .the need for .alterations of the existing Act, and I suppose there are many thousands of similar cases which deserve consideration. I trust that if the amendment is defeated the Government will, within the next twelve months, take into consideration another amendment of the law to give the old people the reasonable allowance of £ 1 per week. hopeful that this Bill would be passed without an exhibition of party feeling. I regard the action of the Prime Minister in informing his supporters that by voting for a pension of £ 1 per week they would jeopardize the position of the Government, as complete coercion. Such action can only result in the question being made a party one. I must commend the honourable member for Corio The Act further lays it ( Mr Lister) upon his manly attitude in connection with this Bill. It is refreshing to honourable members on this side to know that there is at least one man on the opposite side who has professed for some time his belief that the invalid and old-age pension should be increased to £ 1 per week, and has now the courage to stand to his convictions, and to declare his intention to support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. In the last fortnight we have been doling out money to the wealthy 'interests of this country. We know that the Government was prepared, under the Land Tax Assessment Bill, to sacrifice taxation to the extent of £1,300,000 for their benefit. We are told that the reason why the Government is not prepared to agree to",33,Eable Page Read A First Time Second Reading

During my election campaign, I pledged myself to endeavour to get an increase: in the old-age pensions, but I would not commit myself to any definite amount, because I was not in a position at that time to know what sum would be justifiable. Probably other honourable members who committed themselves to a definite amount went a little further than was justified, not knowing the amount involved. At that time, I strongly favoured the ^establishment of a comprehensive scheme of national insurance, and the appointment of a Commission for that purpose. when the Government decided to appoint a Royal Commission to report on a comprehensive system of State insurance. is the honourable member for Perthin order in discussing, on this amendment, the' appointment of a Royal Commission ? He is making a second reading speech. : age pension has a direct connection with the Royal Commission, because it w ill be considered with that of State insurance. Everybody admits that we are approaching the limit for pensions, and it would be very inadvisable to take a step to prejudice or annul the work of that Commission. It is very easy to increase the pension; but, supposing, for the sake of. argument, that the Commission recommended that the maximum pension should be 17s. 6di, if this House had already voted £1 per week, difliculty would be-experienced: in reducing it. On the other hand, if , afterdue consideration of the facts, the Commission recommended an old-age pension of £1 per week, then, taking intoaccount the financial position,, honourable members would gladly subscribe to it . But at present we are anticipating and may be going too far, and any further commitment will annul the work of this Commission. get behind a Commission for protection. has been glad, on more than one occasion during this session, to get behind the reports of Royal Commissions. If honourable members have conscientious objections in regard to this matter, well and good, but I refuse to be classed with those who will smother their realconvictionsand vote against their consciences upon a matter in regard to which 1 have arrived at a deliberate and well-weighed opinion. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Perth. ( Mr Mann) has convinced himself, and he reminds me of a Frenchman who convinced himself that he had only to place green glasses.over the eyes of his horse and he could feed him on shavings. But despite his conviction the horse died. The honourable member for Perth said that when the pension was fixed at 10s., nobody objected to it . When I was, therefore, delighted the pension was fixed at 10s. in Victoria it was welcomed as a commencement only-,, for it was pointed out at the time that the Danish pension was equal to10s: of our money, and would purchase morefchan 20s. would in Victoria. Why is it that the-unemployed problem is not more serious: to-day ? It is because of the old age pension. In earlier days, when unemployment became rife, the aged people were the first to suffer. Now they haveat least .some income to keep them from want On that ground alone, I appeal to honourable members opposite to support the amendment. A t the same time, I recognise the difficulty in which they have been placed by the Prime Minister's statement that he would resign and thereby forgo his trip to England as the representative of Australia at the Imperial Conference. That statement surpasses any I have ever heard in my political experience. I ask honourable members not to stifle their own convictions with specious arguments, but to make up their minds that whilst they are compelled to support the Government to-day they will bring pressure to bear upon the Ministry during recess to",36,Chairman To Resume My Seat And I Obeyed The

177,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.16],"have the pension increased to £ 1 . For years I have allotted £ 5 per week to .increasing the pension of some old people from 15s. to £ 1 . Therefore, I welcome the increase to 17s. 6d. because it will enable me to help forty pensioners instead of twenty. If the people who created thiB Parliament were consulted by referendum, would they hesitate to sanction the payment of the paltry 2s. 6d. required to make the pension £ 1 per week? A sum of £340,000,000 has been spent on the slaughter and murder of men, but the rich money holders have not contributed their share. How many dependants of men who fought and died at the Front are helping to bear the accursed cross of interest on the war debt? Why do we not provide that the children of every soldier who died at the Front stall be free of taxation, or be paid from the Consolidated Revenue an amount equal to the tax. I welcome the increase of 2s. 6d. just as in time of want if I stood on the brink of hell and the devil himself handed mo bread for the hungry, I would take it. But I am not content with the increase offered by the Government, and I am surprised that the Prime Minister should prevent men who are loyal to th Government from voting in accordance with their consciences. An amendment is required to do justice to certain invalids who are subject to congenital defects. I have in mind the case of one who is afflicted with congenital dislocation of the hips, and who has no chance of ever being able to earn her own livelihood, but because she was four and a ha/c years, instead of three years or under, when she arrived in Australia, she is mot eligible for a pension. That contemptible provision was drafted by a legal mind. in .political life i o know that when a leader 'of a party makes such a grave statement as the Prime Minister has made to-day, it ' m u s t influence his followers. -The persuade the Ministry during the recess -to'be 'a little more decent to those who are 1 old, and often uelpless, and thus wipe out the infamy ot the vote that I know * will take place to-day. Mr W. M. HUGHES (North Sydney) -f3 24] -As the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) said, we cannot get all we want, but that does not prevent us from asking for it . Unfortunately time does not permit us to do so effectively, but we must do the best we ; can. This pension legislation, which .has been copied by many cnunirrifs, and in the end will be copied by all, has :been on the statute-book for many years, and we have lived to see tbe errors we made ad initium. One of those.errors is patent on the face of it . The present system of pensions discourages and penalizes thrift. If a person -who arrives at C5 or 60 years of age, ns the case .may be, has been so foolish or unfortunate as to save money in the hey-day of life to buy a bouse, or invest it in other ways, he or she is penalized. Naturally, people .do not like that, and, .therefore, in order to qualify for a full pension, they have \r> turn prodigal in the evening of their live."" a:id spend all they have accumulated. The Act requires radical amendment in that respect, and the discouragement of thrift should be eliminated. A person has done well for this couutry on having arrived at the age of 65 or 60 years, and deserves .of the country a .pension sufficient to place him or her beyond the reach of that abject poverty which marked the condition of our forebears. Therefore, the prohibition against property and earnings should be wiped out, and all persons who choose to app.'y for a pension, if otherwise qualified, should receive it in full. Cases have been brought under my notice lately of .pensioners who had invested in property. In assessing the value of that property, no allowance is made for the rates and. outgoings necessary to maintain it, and their pensions have been cut down. That is quite wrong. I certainly do not censure the present Government for that condition of things; they take the legislation as they found it ; but I point out what I I have been long enough conceive to be the road on which -we should travel. As to the amount of pension, we as representatives of the people should be very thankful that the increase of the amount by 2s. 6d. per week has -only thing they can do is to try to, been proposed, but £ 1 to-day will not .purchase more than did 10s. when the pension was first instituted. I wish to point out to Ministers the obvious fact that vduring the war the payments made in respect of soldier's pensions and repatriation were many million pounds in excess of such payments to-day. Our war expenditure will never vanish in our time, but is proceeding towards vanishing point, and when we have the means to be just to the old-age pensioners we should utilize them. So whilst I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne, that the dictum of the Prime Minister is final as regards our power to translate our wishes into action, I still say that the first thing the Government should aim at is, not the saving of money, but the administration of the affairs of the country justly and wisely, and with due regard to those basic interests upon which the welfare of the community depends. There has been a remission of taxation, and a sensible, and indeed, large diminution of the amount payable for soldiers' pensions and repatriation. Therefore, it is within our power to pay to the aged and invalid a pension commensurate with that prosperity which Australia, alone, of all the nations that engaged in the war, is fortunate enough to enjoy. The least we can do is to see that those who have spent their lives in building up the country shall receive a pension that will assure their comfort in their declining years. I therefore urge first the removal of all those provisions which prevent the old-age and invalid pensioners from obtaining the full pension because they have saved up a certain amount of money, and secondly an increase in the pension to at least £ 1 . -Many of the recent actions of this Government have been discreditable, but this is the most discreditable of all. It is almost pathetic to hear honourable members on the other side of the Committee trying to explain their attitude. They certainly have been placed in an unfortunate position through the Government having made this a vital issue. If the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), the honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson), and the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), who have said that though they favour a pension of £ 1 they will support the Government and vote for 17s. 6d. a week, would only take a firm stand the Government would soon alter its attitude. very clear. I said that I intended to voto for £ 1 a week -the Committee who are favorable to a have done the honourable member an injustice. I certainly understood him to say that although he deprecated the action of the Government he would support it . If he did not say it , other honsame thing. orable members on his side of theCommittee 'did. A few days ago the honourable .member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) and some others on that side book a stand on a certain matter and the Government changed its attitude. I believe that if they made a stand now the Government would not risk suffering a defeat. By hook or by crook the Prime Minister intends to get to England, and if honourable members opposite, who say that they wish the pension to be £ 1 , would stand by their convictions the Government would "" climb down."" I do nob think one honourable member opposite can really say that 17s. 6d. a week is an adequate pension. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) has advocated £ 1 a week before now, and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes) is also favorable to the proposal to make the pension £1 per week. I remind that right honourable gentleman that when he was head of the Government he did not give any increase at all. Mr W. M . HUGHES I increased the pension to 12s. 6d., and then to 15s. honourable members opposite seems to be determined very largely by whether they are members of the Ministry or not. I hope that the amendment will be carried. Even if it be not carried I trust that the Government will agree to pay the pension of 17s. 6d. from the beginning of the financial year. We wish to make the increased payment retrospective for only a few weeks. The Government wished to make retrospective for six years a measure that it had before honourable members a few days ago. -The Prime Minister practically gave an assurance that this Bill would be treated in a non-party way. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), apparently, objected to that, and the Prime Minister 'has now made it a party question, and has said that if the vote is against him he will take it as a vote of censure. I regret that very much. A number of honourable members on the other side of I am sorry if I pension of £ 1 per week are to be compelled to vote with the Government, because this has been made a party question.",37,Chairman To Resume My Seat And I Obeyed The

183,Mr Maxwell,"You would do thecomplain that it has been made a party question. It is most regrettable that in the closing hours of the session the Government should try to prevent us from doing the fair thing by the old people. The honourable member for Perth( Mr lowed to die out, and that the Government Mann) takes what he calls a logical point of view. He says that we are not doing the old people any injustice, because they aregetting as much value now as they got when the pension was 10s. a week, according to the cost of living figures. We do not ask public servants to retire on a pension of 17s. 6d. a week, nor is any retiring allowance of which I know as low as that. Why should we ask,the old people to accept such an inadequate pension? If the remarks of the honourable member for Perth indicate his idea of what the standard of living should be, then God help the country if he ever obtained control of it. I trust that the Committee will agree to increase the pension to 20s. I wish to refer to two statements that have been made. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) said that the £1,300,000 which was alleged to have been saved to the Government in respect of the Crown leasehold taxation should be used to pay old-age pensions. I point ont to him what is obvious to almost every other honourable member in the Committee, that that amount has only been saved for one year, and the increase in taxation, in order to provide for old age pensions, will go on year after year. silly statement. If the honourable member has not anything better than that to say he should sit down. to which I shall refer was made by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes). war pensions were decreasing. matter of fact, they are increasing:. The figures for 1920 to 1922 are as follows:1920, £6,178,692; 1921, £6,915,454; 1922, £6,783,426. It is estimated, that in 1923 £6,933,576 will be paid Honourable members will see, therefore, that the war pensions expenditure for this year is to be bigger than ever. Mr W. M . HUGHES I said that our war expenditure had diminished by £6,000,000. right honourable gentleman to say that war pensions had decreased. All I have to say in regard to the measure before us is that I do not hold with the doctrine that all sense of filial duty should be alshould do what children ought to do to assist their parents. I support the clause as it is. I impress it upon honourable members opposite that our pensioners are really the pioneers of Australia. It has been conceded that the Commonwealth Government, is able to pay a pension of £ 1 a week, but some honourable members behind the Government seem to fear for the future. I think we may leave the future to take care of itself. I am strongly in favour of increasing the pension to 20s. I agree with the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes) that 20s. a week now would not be worth any more than was the original pension of 10s. bear that out. Treasurer, as was said by another honourable member on that side of the Chamber a day or so ago, that he should not be too theoretical. Honourable members know that even statistics are misleading at times. I urge that the administration of this Act should be more in accordance with its spirit and not so much in accordance with the letter of it. A number of cases of great hardship have been brought under my notice during the last day or two. I shall take another opportunity to place the details before honourable members. I wish to reply to a statement made by He stated, that the honourable member for Richmond( Mr As a R. Green). He referred to the remark made by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), that the £1,300,000. which .the Opposition prevented the Government from giving to the squatters of Australia should be utilized for pension purposes, and said that that amount would only be available for one year.

192,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [3.43],"would have been additional revenueto Australia that could have been earmarked for pension purposes. that the Committee will deal with this measure in a non-party spirit. The Prime Minister has placed some of his supporters in a most awkward position, and I regret that he has taken up such an attitude. It is distressing that the National Parliament of Australia should be haggling about whether the worn-out soldiers of industry in this country should be given a pension of 17s. 6d. or £1, a difference of thirty, pence per week. It is a sordid thing for us to be fighting about. Plenty of money was availabls for the. urgent needs of war, and. I suggest that we should see to it that the comparatively small amount of money involved in the question before us should also be made available. I regret that honourable members opposite have been ? laced in sueh an unfortunate position, would, much prefer to see some amicable arrangement made bywhich we could vote together on this subject, and secure £1 per week pension for old people. The Prime Minister has been autocratic, and is preventing the free expression of opinion in this Chamber. The Treasurer stated' that in 1909 the pension of 10s. was the equivalent of 17s. 6d. to-day. The GommonwealthTear-Booh does notsupport his contention. Statistician gave me my figures. They would be later than those in the YearBooh figures related to groceries, food, and house rent, and took no account of clothing, which, as every one knows, has increased fully 100 per cent, since 1909. A comparison of the weighted averages for forty-seven items of expenditure shows that as there has been a very heavy increase since 1911, our invalid and old: age pensioners should receive better treatment. Weighted averages for the capital cities of the Commonwealth are as follows:1011. Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart Iu some of the States the increase has been fully 100 per cent. Therefore, there I trust is every justification for an increaseof the pension payments to £1 per week. Apart from that, we should remember that we are living in democratic times, and this subject is receiving attention inall countries of the world; so it is up to Australia to lead the way.

A house that would cost £900 to build to-day could be built for £400 in 1912 or 1913. Where old people have to leave their home, and let it . the value of of the Act. A pensioner can live in his the home as property is taken into account in calculating the pension. That is a good reason why the maximum value should be raised to at least £500. The valuation generally accepted is that of the local authority, and so no deception could be practised upon the Department by pensioners. I prefer that the Treasurer should propose the amendment of the clause himself, because in view of the last decision of the Committee any amendment I moved, however desirable, would be defeated. approving of the Government proposal to increase the value of property which may be possessed without affecting the old age pension, I should like to direct attention to the fact that a few nights ago I pointed out that in connection with soldiers' pensions, the Commissioner of Pensions has decided that if a pensioner is possessed of property to the value of £100 he is supposed to have adequate means of support. Treasurer to direct the attention of those who have charge of soldiers' pensions to the provision with respect to property which is contained in this Bill. Mr W. M. HUGHES (North Sydney) [4.8] I should like the Treasurer to say whether, in calculating the value of property for the purposes of this provision, due allowance is made for rates paid by the pensioner and other charges, including repairs. I know of a case where a man has been compelled by a municipal council to repair his house, and that cost"" a great deal more than the rent he derived from it. Allowance should be made for rates and for repairs, particularly where they have to be carried out by direction of local authority. I agree entirely with what the Leader of the Opposition has said, and I should be glad if the Treasurer could tell us what additional expenditure under the Act would be involved by increasing the value of property which a pensioner might possess up to £500. I do not suppose that the honourable gentleman would contend that to increase the property value to £500 would involve a serious strain on the Treasury. property value from the proposed £400 to £500. Anomalies in this connection arise under the operation own house irrespective of its value, and continue to draw his pension; but should circumstances render it necessary for him to vacate his home and live elsewhere, and its value exceeds the maximum amount provided for in the Act, he forfeits his pension. I have a case in mind of a resident of Guildford in my electorate. It is that of an old lady who was living in a property that was condemned by the health authorities. She was unable to effect the necessary repairs, having no money, and had to vacate the premises, which were demolished, and as the valuation of the residual exceeded £310 she forfeited her pension. There are a great many similar cases. The request which has been made is a reasonable one, and I propose to move--That the word "" Four"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" Five."" The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN It will save time if I point out that fhe honourable member would not be in order. I should like the in moving such an amendment, as its effect would be to increase the appropriation, and that would require a new message from the Governor General. The Bill is based upon a message from the. Governor General recommending the necessary appropriation, and no alteration increasing the appropriation can be ^ made without the Governor General's consent. clear that we cannot make an amendment which would have the effect of increasing the appropriation; but the Treasurer might favourably consider the request made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). Old people are often compelled to leave their homes, though it may be only temporarily. Country pensioners sometimes come to the city in order to be able to attend a doctor, and let their home in the country for six or twelve months. They may pay a rent of 30s. per week in the city, and receive only 10s. per week for their home in the country; but under the Act the rent they receive is taken into account in estimating the value of the property they possess. Of course, I am awaTO that rent is regarded in the same way as any other",42,Chairman To Resume My Seat And I Obeyed The

It is that of two old folk who were living about 10 miles from Fremantle. They had one son who went to the war, and came back gassed. He is now, I think, rambling about Australia trying to get a living. The old folk had a home for many years, and a little garden that they were trying to develop. One was about sixty-nine and the other sixty-seven years of age. They developed rheumatism, and were too old to carry on, and were ultimately granted old-age pensions. They had to leave their place. They receive a rent of 12s. per week for it , whilst they have to pay 12s. per week for a room in Fremantle. Their position is exactly the same as before, but their pension was immediately affected to the extent of 12s. per week, and now those two old people are compelled to live in Fremantle on 17s. 6d. per week. T have tried every method to obtain assistance from the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions. He is sympathetic, but the Act prevents him from giving them assistance. These poor folk had a home valued at £500, and mortgaged for £150. They were trying to retain the equity for their son, who. they believed would, sooner or later, become utterly incapacitated. It is a very deserving case, and surely something can be done. I know of hundreds of cases on all-fours with this one. I ask the Government to make the administration of the Pensions Department a little more sympathetic to deserving cases, not that I have anything to say against the officers, because they keep within the letter of the Act, for which no one can blame them. But the Government might give them a hint, or power, to use their discretion. A blind man of Sydney, who applied for a pension, has written to me as follows:The cmise of iny application ia blindness; my occupation is that of a cigarette and tobacco vendor, and I earn about 35s. per week. I have not sufficient money in tbe bank to warrant a limitation of pension, and have no other property, &c. I was born in Australia, and have never been abroad. Where it can be shown that He says furtherA friend of mine, similarly afflicted and employed, applied for the pension as a cigarette and tobacco vendor, and as such he was granted the pension. Last week be was summoned to the Pensions Office and told that bis pension was to be discontinued, and be was likely to be the recipient of charity, and the pension was not for mendicants, and that tbe granting of his pension was a mistake in the first place. In that case the Department said that the applicant might possibly become a recipient of charity. It would not harm the Commonwealth even if blind pensioners did receive a little over and above the minimum wage. I implore the Government to give their officers power to use their discretion, which I do not think they would abuse. An association of blind people has written to say that persons who come to Australia with defective eyesight are debarred from receiving the pension. vided for in a later amendment. shall not press that matter further. whether the Treasurer can amend the Bill in view of the present ruling.

The principal Act has been amended no fewer than seven times in fourteen years, and each time the conditions have been liberalized. But this B ill representative of both sides of the is the first that has attempted to deal with the anomaly in regard to the net capital value of property that may be owned by the pensioner. has been increased at various times, b u t the earning capacity of the pensioner has not previously been increased concurrently. Every amendment that has been suggested has been considered by the Treasury officers in order to ascertain what effect it would have upon the finances of the country, and the Government has endeavoured to spread the money at its disposal over as wide a field as possible, in order to give the maximum relief. I ask honourable members to accept the assurance of the Government that, after months of careful study, it has come to the conclusion that the proposals contained in the B ill are not only the utmost that the finances will permit to be done at the present time, but also cover the greatest number of anomalies in the best possible way with the money available. If we had not considered the matter f u l l y, and had brought down a hastily-evolved proposal, the Committee would, have been justified in taking the business out of the hands of the Government and laying down a new policy for the administration of the finances. But ' for the first time in the history of this legislation a duly considered B ill dealing with every anomaly has been introduced, and therefore I ask the Committee to support the Government. The Government agrees with the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that this payment should not be regarded as charity, but as a right, and therefore it is appointing a Royal Commission to advise upon a policy of national insur[134] ance, which is the only means by which this assistance to the aged and invalid can be placed upon a non-charitable basis other amendments within the financial capacity of the Commonwealth. The Government does hot suggest that this measure is perfect, but The Government recognise it is the utmost that the Government can do in the present financial circumstances of the country. Realizing the imperfections of the measure, we desire the whole system to be inquired into in the fullest possible way, so that it may be placed The Government has upon a proper basis. Later this afternoon I hope to be able to announce the composition of the Royal Commission to deal with pensions and national insurance. It will be, as far as possible, House, so that every political view may be expressed. In regard to the property qualification, the various amendments that The pension have been suggested would accentuate, rather than remove, the real anomaly, which is that old-age pensioners who live in their own houses, whether they be worth £300, £400, or £500, do not, on that account, suffer any reduction of pension. The raising of the allowable capital value to £500 would not remove the anomaly that exists between those who have their own homes and those who have not. The instance mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra could not have been quite correctly stated, because if people l e f t their own home in the country to temporarily reside in Melbourne that property, being still their home, would not be taken into account by the pensions office, unless it was yielding income in the form of rent. account. ing what the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions assures me is the practice of the Department. In regard to the point raised by the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), rates and maintenance costs are deducted from the income yielded by property, when the pension is being computed. The 'honourable member for Barton( MrF . McDonald) mentioned the blind pensioners. There is a special provision in the Act that earnings up to £221 per annum shall not debar a blind man from receiving the pension. he is earning the money.

I ask the Committee to support the Government's proposal because the increase of the property restriction to £500 would involve an additional £30,000 and £40,000 per annum, and would not remove the anomalies, but 1 would make it more difficult for us to relieve those other anomalies that extend throughout the whole range of the pensions system. [4.40] -On e anomaly to which the Treasurer has not given the least consideration is the varying economic value or purchasing power of the pension in different parts of the Commonwealth. Dr. does not permit of discrimination between different parts of the Commonwealth. arises out of the fact that the pension seems to be based on the purchasing power of the sovereign in , say, Melbourne. bourne that purchasing power decreases by as much as 50 per cent., yet the old-age pensioner is expected to live upon the same amount of money. effect, the pension in the Northern Territory is 50 per cent, below the pension paid in Melbourne. Every Arbitration Court allows Government servants in certain latitudes a special allowance equal to from 35 to 40 per cent of their salaries. The same principle should apply to pensions, because, man is not a after all, if the amount is only sufficient in the southern States to keep the wolf from the door, it must be a starvation rate in other latitudes where its purchasI f that man is ing power is 30 to 50 per cent. less. The only action I have taken on this B ill has been to vote for an increase of the ""We should discriminate pension. I have adopted that attitude because I hold that, u n t i l all restrictions and conditions are wiped out, we cannot have a real old-age pension. Unfortunately the Tory ideas and workhouse traditions of Great Britain still colour our legislation, and they account, for the conditions with which the pension is hedged. We shall have a true old-age This pension when every Australian man of sixty-five years of age and every woman of sixty years of age, who has lived a certain number of years in Australia, has an absolute right to apply for the pension. The present restrictions are subterfuges to enable the Government to refuse the pension to those who are expenditure of between really entitled to it . The maternity allowance is payable to every woman who gives birth to a viable child, and similarly the old-age pension should be available to every person who has the qualifications of age and residence. When the maternity allowance was agreed to by this House no restrictions were laid down. Every mother was entitled to £ 5 . Our object was that no mother who gave birth to a child should be in actual want in her hours of trial. We did not make it necessary to inquire whether a husband brought all his money home or whether as are imposed in connection with the old-age pensions schemes are a result of the practices in countries in the Old World, which were ruled for so long by the landed proprietors.

234,Mr West (East Sydney) [4.42],"at Coolgardie houses may be obtained for 2s. 6d. per week, and in other parts of Western Australia the rents are even lower. The Statistical Department takes these low rents and also the high rents that obtain in the cities, and strikes an average, which it calls an economic rent. The basis is altogether wrjong. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) said that the Labour Government fixed the pension at 10s. per week. That honourable member knows that at that time old people could obtain a room in any of our cities for 2s. 6d. per week, whereas now they have to pay 7s. 6d. A bag of oatmeal cost lOd. in those days, and now it costs 3s. Mutton, which then cost 3d. per l b . , now costs 8d. I do not wish'to weary the Committee by traversing all the foolish arguments that have been presented, although I have been bursting to get up about twenty times this afternoon. Honourable members desire to get the B ill through, and to prevent myself from rising to speak I have had to rush from the Chamber. The restrictions which surround the payment of these pensions must be removed if Australia is to continue to be known abroad for her progressive legislation. person who attains the age of sixty-five years, and women who reach sixty years of age, and are in needy circumstances, should be able to obtain the pension on application; we have fixed our high standard of wages, and under the same law a high standard of old-age pension. Honourable members know that though we sixty-five years of age, legal practitioners of that age may still continue their work, and sometimes draw fees of 60 guineas for appearing in the Courts. Other professional men of similar age get as much as 40 guineas and 50 guineas per day. W h y should we ask the people who have borne the heat and burden of the world's ordinary work to accept such a small pension as the Government wishes to provide ? Public servants are rarely able to obtain work in outside concerns after they reach the age of sixty years, because it is considered that they have not been compelled to be so active all their lives, and are not able to work effectively. consider that we should make the conditions of life for all old people as comfortable as possible. I trust that honourable members opposite will adopt this sane and humanitarian ideal. We should be permitted to discuss f u l ly all these subjects, but the debate' is to be smothered on account of the desire of the Prime Minister to go to England. It is only by taking a new line of action not wedded to precedents that we can make Australia the model country which it should be, and we certainly should adopt a new view on the payment of pensions. I regret that the powers of honourable members to move amendments to financial measure are so restricted. The most cogent reasons may be advanced why certain measures should be amended, but if the Ministry remains adamant nothing can be done. It is a great pity that honourable members are so confined. I do not think that we should be bound so much by precedent. Age does not always increase ""the value of precedents.

A great deal of time could be spent in discussing cases of indithey are guided by the provisions of the vidual hardship which have come under our-notice. I intend to place one or two on record, because debates of this kind are frequently referred to when amendments are contemplated to Bills of this character. Honourable members know that it frequently happens that the parents of a family are left alone in their little home because all their children marry, and go elsewhere to live. The time often comes when one of the sons returns to the old roof, and a general discussion occurs about the future. The mother says, "" Well, John, we find that we cannot manage things any longer. A couple of years ago, I could do all the cooking, and we could get on very well, but'those days have gone."" The father tells very much the same story. Then John says, "" Well, I have a proposal to make. We have a couple of rooms to spare in our home. Why not come with us, and spend the remainder of your days under our roof? We will do our best to provide for you in your declining years."" ment may then be made for the old people to let the old home for a few shillings a week and live with the son, who is thus in a position to provide his aged parents with a few additional comforts. unfair that because the old folk receive a little income by the way of rent from the original home that a reduction should be made in the amount of pension paid. This is not an unusual case. instance which came under my notice in my own constituency may be mentioned. A pensioner, seventy-five years of age, decided to add a few shillings a week to his income by cracking stones. course, he was not able to do very much, so, occasionally, the younger men working in the same locality would go over to help the old man by cracking a few stones on his heap. In this way, his income was supplemented, and in his case, also, reductions were made in old-age pension payments. I direct attention to another anomaly. Mr Fenton. incapacitated miners from what is known as the Miners' Eund, but deductions are made by the Pensions Department iu the case of all beneficiaries under the fund established by the Victorian Racing Club for the assistance of incapacitated or aged jockeys or trainers. I do not blame the officials, because I understand Act. requests to successive Treasurers on this subject, and although I have always received sympathetic consideration, no amendment of the Act has been introduced. I trust that the present Treasurer will see his way clear to rectify this anomaly. I understand that the Treasurer's objection to the amendment is that it would interfere with his financial proposals outlined in the Budget. The Government climbed down in connection with the taxation on leaseholds, and agreed not to make the remission promised in the Budget speech. Why make fish of one and flesh of another. Why should difficulties be created because a little extra is asked for in connection with invalid and old-age pensioners. The order of leave in connection with any financial measure should be sufficiently wide to permit of members subAn arrangemitting amendments even if their effect would be to increase taxation. I am in accord with the Government proIt is posals. I believe that the pensioners will be well satisfied with the increase of 2s. 6d. per week, together with the liberalizing of the provisions of the Bill. Many of these old people live with Another friends, and their pensions are of considerable help. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) that if we cannot get £1 per week for the old folk, the next best Of thing is to accept I7s. 6d., especially as the old-age pensioners are allowed to supplement their income to a certain extent. If we directed more attention to the younger generation, and saw to it that they reached manhood or womanhood in a robust state of health, there would be less likelihood of their joining the ranks of invalid or old-age Payments are allowable to pensioners in the closing years of their lives.

I have been waiting for the honourable member to ; connect his remarks w i th the clause under discussion. ing to show that if the younger generation were looked after properly, the probability is that our expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions would be considerably reduced. The discussion of this clause at the beginning seemed to proceed on the assumption that a person having property valued at £310-no w to be raised to £400-migh t still enjoy the f u l l pension. Dr. there was a deduction of £ 1 from the pension for every £ 1 0 of property possessed. member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) to lend me his ear while I am discussing this question, because I know that along with honourable members on this side he takes a sympathetic interest in this matter. The original Act permitted the possession of property up to a value of £310 before the right to pension ceased. No person was to receive an old-age pension unless amongst other exceptions providedTim capital value of his accumulated property whether in or out of Australia does not exceed £310. Then under section 24 of the original Act we find that where the pensioner has accumulated property, the amount of the pension is subject to the following deductions^One pound for every complete £10 by which the net capital value of tbe property exceeds £50. That is to say, if a pensioner has property valued at £ 3 1 0 , the pension to which he is entitled gradually diminishes To some extent the children until it entirely disappears. The theory Tbeir chance of of the original Act was that the maximum » value of property which the pensioner If , unfortu might hold without ceasing to be entitled to a pension was £ 3 1 0 , and by deductions at the rate of £ 1 for every £ 1 0 of property, the pension would automatically disappear when the value of the property reached £ 3 1 0 . I want to know from the Treasurer why he has not preserved that principle in this B ill . If he had done so, instead of fixing the maximay possess without ceasing to be entitled to a pension at £ 4 0 0 , he should, in view of the increased rate of pension have fixed the maximum value of property at £505. That is necessary to preserve the I am endeavourprinciple of the original Act. The totals pension payable under this B ill will be £45 10s. per annum where there are nodeductions. Allowing for the exemption of £ 5 0 value of property, and the existing rate of deductions for property of £ 1 of pension for every £ 1 0 of property over £ 5 0 , the pension under th's B ill should disappear altogether when the pensioner possessed property to the value of £ 5 0 5. The Government proposes £ 4 0 0 , and their proposals in this case would appear to be another attempt to cut down the rights of pensioners. I am aware that there is an objection to the cost of paying very small pensions; but I suggest that the maximum proposed is not so I ask the honourable high that the Treasurer need concern himself so much about the minimum. My experience is that people are not anxious to make application for old-age pensions when they find that the amount to which they would be entitled in view of the value of property they possess would! be inconsiderable. I understand that the objections to applying in this B ill the principle involved in the original Act, is that it would mean the payment in some cases of very small pensions of less than 5s. per week; but I repeat that the maximum is not so high that we need to be anxious to fix the minimum.

If the Treasurer has an answer to my objection by all means let us have it, because I think that the principle embodied in the original Act should continue. surer) [5.23] -The explanation of the position the honourable member has discovered is this: The original limitation with respect to property was £310. That has been maintained all these years, for the reason that the pension diminishing under the Act, at the rate of £1 for every £400, or only £10 more, he will been£10 of property possessed, left but a very small pension indeed for any person possessing property approximating the value of £310. If £50-the statutory exemption-is deducted from £310, there is £260 left. If there is a deduction of £1 for every £10 of this amount, it means that £26 has to be deducted from £39the annual value of the old-age pension at the present rate. This would leave an ' annual pension of £13, and a person possessing property to the value of £309 would be able to draw a pension of 5s. per week. The Government have tried to preserve that principle in this Bill. If you deduct £50 from £400, you have £350. This would involve a deduction from the pension on the existing scale of £35 from the annual pension, and under this proposal the pensioner would receive £10 10s. a year, or a pension of a little under 5s. per week. If the maximum value of property were raised to £500, and deductions were made in accordance with the same scale, it would be hardly worth a person's while to apply for the pension that would be payable should the value of his property approximate £500. I am advised that, if the amount were raised as proposed, a tremendous amount of investigation would be required, and the results to pensioners would not be commensurate with the trouble involved. That is the reason why the maximum value of property has been fixed at £400. Another reason is that the amount available for distribution had to be parcelled out to the greatest possible advantage in_ correcting the anomalies that arise under the existing Act. It is estimated that the maximum amount of benefit to pensioners will be derived by fixing the value When people of property at a maximum of £400. quite follow the argument of the Treasurer, but I point out that the Government are taking a good deal of credit to themselves for proposing to increase the old age pension by £6 10s. a year, while at the same time, by the operation of this clause, it is probable that pensioners will be deprived of £10 10s. a year of the pensions to which they are legitimately entitled. Under this clause, if a man has property worth £390, he will be able to draw a pension at the rate of £11 10s. a year, but if his property is valued at titled to no pension at all. That is an 'anomaly which should be met. I can quite understand that the cost of paying pensions of 6d. per week would be out of all proportion to the value of the pension; but I should like to know from the Treasurer what is the experience of the Department in connection with the payment of small pensions because of the operation of the provisions of the existing Act, to which the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has referred. If we make a deduction in the pension of £1 per annum for every £10 worth of property which the pensioner has over £50, why should we not stop at that. © Why should we wipe out the pension altogether if the value of a person's property is £400, when a deduction of £1 for every £10 would absorb only £35 a year of the pension, and at the increased rate provided for in the Bill the pensioner would be entitled to £45 10s.? This provision means that the old people will be denied pensions to which they are entitled to the extent of £10 10s. Act, the pension would be absorbed by deductions where the value of the property reached £309. that, but I have shown that, under this Bill, with the maximum value of property fixed at £400, if the pensionis to entirely disappear, when that value is reached, the pensioner will lose pension to the extent of £10 10s. per annum, to which he is entitled.

The maximum amount fixed in the original Act was £ 3 1 0 , and that was .exactly the point at which the pension would disappear. inquire of his Department, and ascertain the few cases of small pensions being applied for under that provision. further, and say if people ask the Department for a pension of 2s., it is strong proof that they want it badly. bably the Government will eliminate the very people who badly need the pension. I see no reason why we should profess to make available, as the equivalent of property, a pension of £ 4 5 a year, when, in actual fact to certain classes of people, it is only £ 3 5 a year. that if a person has property valued at £400, £ 5 0 is free, and the balance is equivalent to a pension or income of £ 3 5 . Therefore, the Department contends that the pension has disappeared. B ill the amount will be £ 4 5 10s. a year, and even then it should not disappear, as it is by no means the equivalent of £26 in 1910. This anomaly has been in every Act since the original Act, but that is no reason why it should be preserved. that should be amended. the deduction. duction is not in dispute at present. The Government are still preserving the original deduction of £ 1 in every £ 1 0 . They are increasing the property limitation from £310 to £400, but we submit that it should be £500, and in strict accordance with the original A ct it should be £ 5 0 5. If fixed at £500, it will obviate Surely the the necessity of, perhaps, allowing pensions of a few pence per week. It is unfortunate that we cannot move an amendment, but I am not certain that the whole clause should not be eliminated.

I admit that the Government have made improvements in the B ill . reflection upon the Administration, as 1 have not words to express my appreciation of the sympathetic attitude shown by the officers of the department. The Government must be given credit for many admirable amendments, but the B ill has been marred in two respects. The pension should have been increased to £ 1 per week and the maximum value of property allowed should have been in creased to £500. surer) [5.39] -The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) did not properly put the faots concerning the alteration of property value allowed. He pointed out that if fixed at £400, a person with property worth £399 would receive a pension of about f 10 10s. a year, but a person possessing £ 4 0 1 would get nothing. Under the Act where property is held worth £310 the owner gets nothing. Under the proposed amendment the pensioner will receive an increase, not of 2s. 6d., but is a marked consideration. That continues throughout the extra £ 1 0 0 fixed by the Government. This is the first time that this limitation has been amended. The Labour party were in office in 1916, and they increased the pension by 2s. 6d., but made no alteration of the property 1919 the pension was increased to 15s., but this limitation was not amended. The Government have endeavoured to meet every anomaly. We admit that the B ill is not perfect, but considering the financial circumstances, we have endeavoured to make the pensions as generous as possible. Persons with property valued at from £310 to £400 will benefit by from 5s. to 7s. 6d. per week. I ask honourable members to agree to the Government's proposal. It is a substantial increase and all that can possibly be considered at present. I protest against the action of the Government in tying the hands of honourable members and refusing to amend the B ill . Honourable members have pointed out anomalies and suggested improvements, but no amendments are permitted, since the appropriation cannot be in creased. This action has been taken by the Treasurer, a gentleman who in the last Parliament frequently stated that the expenditure of the Government should I cast no not be influenced by party considerations, but should be discussed by the whole House and subjected to analysis, criticism and amendment by honourable members. We have to take the clause or leave it . Asi t is a slight improvement on the present law, it cannot be rejected. The honourable members for Yarra( Mr Scullin), and Batman( Mr. Brennan), have suggested important amendments, and it is unfortunate that the Government have shackled Parliament to the extent that honourable members cannot give an expression of opinion on them. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) a few moments ago, by interjection, indicated clearly that the recent vote on the amount of the pension was not a test of the House, and it is evident that the vote on this clause will not be a true expression of the wishes of this Parliament. The Treasurer assumes that credit is due to the Government because this is the first alteration that has been made to the clause. To some extent of 7s. 6d. per week, which they deserve that credit. The Government, in fixing the property value at £400 have increased it by £ 9 0 , but since 1910, when the pension was first granted, the value of money has depreciated to a greater extent than is indicated by this increase. On the correct basis the value allowed should be at least £ 5 0 0 , and-there limitation of £310. In is no reason why the Government should not fix this amount. The Treasurer stated that we should not look a g if t horse in the mouth. I resent very much any reference to the old-age pensions as a gift. at all. I implied that the Opposition were speaking as though it were a g if t . the old-age pension is an act of justice, and I hope, even at this late hour, that the Government will increase the value of property allowed to £500. The Government have made this B ill a vital question, and I know that honourable members opposite must vote with them They seem to have made up their minds that the Government must live and the Prime Minister go abroad; therefore, T suppose that even if we moved an amendment it would not be carried.

What is the good of the Committee even discussing the clauses, if we are powerless to increase the appropriation. . cannot be said that the Government has erred on the side of generosity in its treatment of the old-age pensioners, as it did with its earlier legislation which added considerably to the wealth already in tbe possession of the big squatters, financial institutions and shipping com-, panies. The Government was prepared to pay to those wealthy interests, tribute to the amount of millions oi pounds from the public exchequer. But to those who have been for many years f a it h f u l citizens have welcomed a greater liberalization of of the country, the Government is mean to a fault. The many disabilities to which the pensioners are subjected by regulation call for serious complaint. I understand that of some of them they are to be relieved, but the proposed amendments do not by any means provide a f u l l measure of justice. An aged couple may have been able by sacrifices and t h r if t to save sufficient with which to buy a place they are pleased to call home. But when, as they become enfeebled with age, they find it necessary to live with relatives or friends in order that they may be better cared for, the rental value of their home, which should be the reward of their t h r if t , is deducted from their pension. There is no encouragement of providence and it is a gross anomaly, that those who have endeavoured to help themselves -should be thus penalized. I hope that the Government realizes that it is not by any means relieving all the hardships that are imposed by harsh regulations. vernment did not do itself credit when it suppressed its own supporters, in order to prevent them from voting according to their conscience upon the amount of the pension. A majority of the Committee was prepared to increase the pension to £ 1 per week, but because the Government declared the question vital to its existence, and so put pressure upon its own supporters, the old-age pensioners are deprived of their just due. people will realize that whilst the Government is prepared to give concessions representing many millions of pounds to those who are already well endowed with this world's goods, it refuses a just measure of relief to those who have borne the burden of difficulties of a lifetime, and in the eventide of life are dependent upont the pension for the means of subsistence.

The Department is too strict in this matter, and when it finds that a man is earning a few shillings it immediately penalizes him in respect of his pension. .The pensioners should be encouraged as f a r as possible to earn money over and above their pension, and so increase their comfort, and preserve their self-respect. dorse the contention of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory).

I realize that the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) is not debating my ruling, but I wish to assure the Committee that when the Chair has received an assurance from the Minister in charge of a Bill such as this is that the amount of appropriation would need to be increased if the amendment were accepted, and that he is not prepared to accept it , providing is such that the authorities in the Chair must reject it. I point out to the members of the Committee that the only way in which the amendment can be accepted is for them to prevail upon the Treasurer to review the position. surer will agree to accept the amendment. The details of payment could be so arranged that no increase in the appropriation would be needed. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that the Government could reduce the amount it now pays to the hospitals, and so pay more to the pensioners. It is not paying the full cost of maintaining inmates. I understand that it costs 18s. 6d. a week to maintain the inmates in hospitals in my electorate. If the Treasurer would agree to pay 9s. 6d. instead of 10s. oa. to the hospitals, he could pay 4s. to the inmates without increasing the appropriation.. I think that, in this matter, he has not stated the facts exactly. I must refute the remark of the honourable member that I have not stated the facts. I have explained the exact position. In the appropriation for the purposes of this Bill the Government takes into consideration the number of patients who are expected to be in these institutions, and computes the amount that will be payable in respect of them. If the amendment is accepted,'it must mean an increase in the amount payable. Government has done all that it possibly can do to correct existing anomalies, and in this particular instance it has delibefollow his line of reasoning. I think the rately done what, the pensioners asked it to do. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) apparently wants it to do something more than it is doing for the States. We are doing something more than has been done in the past, for we are making an ex gratia payment of 3s. per week to certain persons dependent upon the States, who have never previously received a pension. The Government has agreed to do this because many of the poor people in these institutions keenly felt the discrimination that was shown. One inmate would get 2s. a week from the Government, and another would get nothing. The Government has increased the payment to 3s., and put all the inmates of the various institutions on the same footing. The amount we are charge of the institutions consider that it will put the inmates in a comfortable and satisfactory position. I can understand honourable members opposite fighting for an increase in the pension to £1 a week, but I cannot understand them fighting for something more than people most concerned have asked the Government to give. [6.14] I had hoped that the Treasurer would see his way clear to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman). I am not satisfied with his explanation of why he cannot do so. At present the Government is making a profit out of these inmates, and even with the increased payments to the hospitals and the pensioners, it will still be 2s. better off in respect of each pensioner than would be the case if the pensioner were not resident in an institution. I cannot see any reason why the Government should retain that 2s. a week. There was always a grievance while the amount was 2s. 6d. Every hospital in my electorate has been writing to me for years about this matter. Personally, I think the difference should be paid to the patients. At present, when a patient leaves a hospital after having been an inmate for three months, he receives 28s. back pay, the balance being retained by the Commonwealth.

I challenge the statement that there is a consensus of opinion among patients that the Government proposal is satisfactory. intimated .that they would be satisfied with the extra Is., but the majority of patients in hospitals in my electorate are not. ing for? all they can get. When the pension was increased to 12s. 6d., pensioners who became inmates of institutions got 2s. a week, and the State Government were credited with 10s. 6d. for their maintenance. When subsequently there was a further increase in pensions of 2s. 6d. per week, the amount paid to institutions was still 10s. 6d., and to the patient 2s., so the Commonwealth Government then made a clear saving of 2s. 6d. upon every pensioner in a public institution. But these patients contend that they are entitled to the f u l l amount of the pension. ' Tbe Government should give them at least 8s. per fortnight. Many of these institutions are caring for men whose health has been ruined in such unhealthy occupations as rock chopping to improve the sanitation and safeguard the health of people in our cities.

During the last election campaign I held institutions, also at the ones mentioned by the honourable member for Reid, and on every occasion I was asked if I would support an increase from 2s. to 3s. in the payment to inmates of such institutions.

In every instance the Some patients may have subject of increasing the payment from 2s. to 3s. was specifically mentioned, and I promised to do all I could to secure for them the increase asked for.

I was never at the Waterfall Sanatorium, so I do not know what the feeling is there, but I am quite sure that the in mates of other institutions were perfectly satisfied w it h my promise to endeavour to get 3s. per week for them. I pointed out that the New South Wales Government had objected to the payments of any furthe r amount to the pensioners, and had asked that the whole of the balance of the pension should be paid to them on the ground that it cost more than 15s. per week to maintain their patients. I was asked if I would be in favour of. that course, and I replied in the negative. As soon as the House met I brought the matter before Cabinet, and found that the extra Is. per week could not be authorized by regulation, so it had to come before Parliament for an amendment of the Act.",56,Temporary Chairman Get Less

I should like to know whether I understood the Treasurer correctly to say, that he has received communications from pensioner inmates of institutions to the effect that they do not desire an increase of their pensions. Dr. I made was that the Government has received requests from pensioners who are inmates of institutions to the effect that they desire the increase in the amount paid to them which the Government is proposing. That request has been made by inmates of institutions in several of the States. that to increase to 4s. the pension paid to the inmates of institutions would considerably increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth on old-age pensions, but that need not be so if the amount involved in the proposed increase were deducted from the payments made to the institutions themselves. I should like to know whether the Bill makes any provision for increased payments to be made to in ' stitutions taking in old-age pensioners. to increase the amount paid to hospitals IfI remember to 12s. 6d. per week, but it is not proposed to increase the amount paid to other institutions in respect of old-age Why should not pensioners.

300,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [ 8 . 1 1 ],"Iwho are inmates of institutions. The Treasurer has said that from the information he has received, these old. people will be satisfied if they are given this amount. Dr. they have actually asked for. sioners in institutions in Queensland w ill not be satisfied w i th the proposal of the Governnient. have said that they would be satisfied with a pension of 3s., believing that it was impossible to get it from this Government, and hoping that honourable members on this side would put up a fight for more generous treatment for them anything but what they wanted. They did not give a thought to honourable members on either side. General were in the place of these people, who have spent the best part of their lives in the service of the country, and now find themselves in these institutions, he would not be satisfied with a pension of 3s. per week, which is hardly sufficient to keep these old people in tobacco. It w ill not be sufficient to provide them with the little comforts that are so essentia l to people in the evening of their lives. There is one of these institutions in Rockhampton, which is the chief centre of my electorate. It is called the Rockhampton Benevolent Home. A very fine body of women manage the institution in the interests of the old people of central Queensland, who prefer to remain in the district in which they have spent their lives, to going into the State institution at Dunwich, which is 400 miles from Rockhampton. to the institution, I know that the old people there do not consider that they have been f a i r l y treated in the past, and they w ill not be satisfied with a pension of 3s. per week. The institution is r u n with funds drawn from the charity of people in central Queensland, although it receives, also, a grant of £600 from the Queensland Government, the total revenue is not sufficient for its proper maintenance, and requires to be regularly supplemented by collections which are periodically made in Rockhampton. These old -folk cannot obtain the wholesome foods which are necessary to keep them in good health, and in consequence I support the very modest demand for 3s. per week, which could go towards paying for little luxuries and comforts. This would allow the pensioners to purchase set aside a few shillings to have at their disposal if at any time they wished to leave an institution. The amendment would involve no great expenditure. The Government were prepared to remit Certain individuals may to the wealthy classes of this community accumulated rentals amounting to £1,300,000 that were due to the Crown. knows that that tax applied to a great many struggling selectors in his own country. Kidman and Edmund Jowett owe between £150,000 and £200,000. The AusI f the Attorneytralian Estates owe about £60,000, as does the New Zealand Loan, and other big companies. There is an exemption of £5,000 on the taxable leasehold interest capitalized, so the struggling selector is not affected. The Government are prepared to assist the wealthy interests, but they do not display the same solicitude for the people in the benevolent institutions of Australia. An amount of 10s. 6d. per week is to be paid to the management of institutions in which pensioners are inmates, and 3s. is to be paid to the inmates themselves. There is still 4s. per week unaccounted for. Isi t fair that the Government should profit because these old people are in institutions? If the pensioners were being cared for outside, they would receive 17s. 6d. per week. Why should the Government benefit because a philanthropic institution like the RockFrom visits made hampton Benevolent Society has provided a home for the old folk? Thef u l l amount of pension should be paid to them. I am pleased that the pension is to be increased, although not to the extent desired. I strongly supported the Labour party's amendment that the penand sion be increased to £ 1 per week. The Rockhampton Benevolent Society have frequently made requests to the Federal Government for increased payments to the institution. They receive 10s. 6d. per week for each inmate, and they find it impossible to carry on at that figure. This institution is not a Government concern, but is controlled by a number",58,Eable Page The Statement Try To Do Something To Make

305,Mr Forde,"I know that Sir Sidneyof humane ladies who devote the whole of their time to it . The Queensland Uovernment provides a grant of £600 per annum, which does not nearly meet the expenses. The funds are augmented by public subscriptions and collections in the streets. On several occasions, the management have unsuccessfully approached the Federal Government for the paymeni of an extra 2s. 6d. per week for each in mate. That request could be met even if the amendment of'the honourable member for Reid were carried, since it would account for 17s. in all out of the 17s. 6d. is meted out to the inmates. The Gothat will be provided after the 10th September for every old-age pensioner in Australia. If 2s. 6d. per week in addition to the present 10s. 6d. were given, it would leave room for the payment of 4s. 6d. per week to each inmate of the institution, or 2s. 6d. extra to such homes as the Rockhampton Benevolent Society, and 2s. extra to the inmates. I ask the Treasurer to consider the advisability of making fhe payment retrospective to the 1st July. When the measure dealing with taxation on leaseholds was before the House, it was proposed to make its provisions retrospective to 1917. In this case all I ask is to make the payment retrospective to the 1st July, 1923. The justice of this request must appeal to the humane instincts of every Australian who has the welfare of the pioneers of this country at heart. They have lived on a basic wage, and reared large families, and have had no opportunity to provide for their old age. Through no f a u l t of their own, they are now in a state of destitution. I regret that honourable members opposite are tied in this matter. They should b6 allowed to cast their votes according to their personal views, but the Government have cracked the whip over their heads and told them that a vote cast in favour of the increase of the pension to £ 1 would be taken as a vote of no-confidence in the Government. I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment, and so bring a ray of sunshine int o the saddened hearts of the old people who are destitute and friendless. that the Treasurer could hot accept my proposal to increase the allowance to pensioners in hospitals and other institutions to 4s. per week. As he pointed out, this concession would involve an amount of £50,000. manner in which public funds have been squandered as the result of the maladministration of the War Service Homes Commission and in other directions. I am surprised that the Treasurer should pose as an exponent of economy at the expense of the old-age and invalid pensioners The Commonwealth are at present retaining 4s. per week, and that is an injustice. Thef u l l amount of the difference should be given either to the pensioner in the hospital or t » the hospital itself so as to improve the food and the general treatment that vernment's only payment to these pensioners is 2s. per week, and 3s. is now proposed. If the extra 4s. per week is not to be paid to the pensioners, it should be given to the State Governments responsible for their maintenance. The Treasurer has stated that the allowance to the State institutions is not being increased. The actual position is that when pensioners enter public hospitals for medical treatment, those hospitals receive 12s. 6d. for the period of their detention. Yet the State institutions will continue to receive the 10s. 6d. that has previously been allowed. Thajt is quite unjustified. In New South Wales are two large hospitals, the Lidcombe and Newington. In one are 1,600 aged and invalid men, and in the other 600 aged and invalid women. It costs 18s. 6d. per head to maintain the inmates of those institutions. I believe in Western Australia it costs 10s. 6d. Commonwealth has no right to evade its responsibilities. Mr O'KOOM -The Commonwealth and States have their own institutions. should give either the State or the pensioner the f u l l benefit of the increase.

In Committee: (Consideration of Governor General's message.) M o t i o n ' (by Dr. posedThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for tlie purposes of an amendment in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill 1023, providing for invalid pensions to certain persons who are afflicted with congenital defects. I ask the Treasurer to so word his motion that I may propose, when the B ill is recommitted, the following amendment:Provided that in .those cases where a pensioner or applicant for a pension satisfies the Commissioner that he is possessed of moneys, or has outstanding moneys due and payable to him by instalments or otherwise, which he is employing or proposes within a reasonable time to employ in the purchase of a home for the pensioner or applicant, such moneys shall not be taken into account when assessing the amount of pension payable. Section 25 provides for the exemption of the home in which the pensioner or applicant is living. No matter what the value of the home may be, it is not taken into account to the detriment of the pension. But a number of cases of hardship have arisen out of the interpretation of this provision. The most recent one that has come under m y notice is that of two pensioners who had been livin g in their own home, but thought it advisable to sell it and purchase another. They sold on time-payment, and bought another on time-payment, the instalments from the sale of the first being applied to the purchase of the second. Dr. the second home? from one house which is being devoted to the purchase of another house. MrF . M c DONALD Yes ; but the proceeds from the first house are reckoned as income, and the pensions are reduced accordingly.' I am satisfied ,that that action is opposed to the spirit of the Act, but I understand that the Commissioner has no power to do otherwise. In such Can the honourable a case the Commissioners should have a discretionary power. My amendment w ill meet the case to which I have referred, and other similar cases. It is quite conceivable that applicants for the pension No honourable memmay have certain moneys coming to them in instalments, and if they use these moneys to purchase a home on time payment they should not be treated as income. surer) [8.46] -The Deputy Commissioner for Invalid and Old-age Pensions assures me that the case mentioned by the honourable member for Barton can be met under the regulations, and I am quite prepared to meet it . wish to have a clear assurance on the matter from the Minister. the honourable member for Barton( Mr. F.

The persons concerned had a small farm, on which they resided. They sold it . A certain amount of the purchase money was paid down, and the balance was to be paid by instalments. They then bought a home under similar conditions. They paid a small deposit, and the balance was to be paid by instalments. When application for the pension was made the Deputy Commissioner in New South Wales, who is an excellent officer, and gave very sympathetic consideration to the matter, took the view that the money received in instalments from the sale of the f a r m was income, and therefore the recipients were not entitled to the pension. I make no complaint about the decision of the officei. He said that the there was really no doubt about it . One applicant went to the expense of obtaining legal assistance to determine the matter.

The letter referred to was sent by the applicants for the pension to the honourable member for Barton( MrF . McDonald). It sets but the circumstances which I have described to the Committee. The letter from the Deputy Commissioner continuesThe sum of £546 was owing to pensioners, and there is no option but to hold it against the claimants in assessing the pension. Tbe fact that they owe money on their present home does not affect the matter. The. Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act exempts the value of the home, but does not permit of money owing from any source being set off against the mortgage on the home, nor can the £300 said to be owing to a brother be taken into consideration, because only moneys secured by a registered mortgage are allowable deductions. There is no doubt about the stand the Department has taken, and the Deputy Commissioner stated that he had no option but to act as he did. I think the Minister should do something to meet such a case. surer) [8.52] I assure the honourable member that I w ill give sympathetic consideration to this and similar cases. If they cannot be met under the regulations, I w ill bring down amendments, if possible, at the earliest moment so that relief may be given. I have a case very similar to the one mentioned by the honourable member for Barton( MrF . McDonald). lady bought a piece of land in a town some distance from the house in which she was living. She sold that home, and intended to make arrangements to build on the block of laud. She was not able to get a builder immediately, so she put in the bank the proceeds of the . sale of her old home, which were to be spent in erecting the new one. All the time that money was in the bank her pension was practically stopped. Relief should be given in such a case as that, because, while the lady was waiting to secure a builder to put up her home, she had to live on the money with which she purposed to build. Eventually she got a contractor to undertake the work, but she had to borrow money to finance the ment by the honourable member for Barton( MrF .

Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported and adopted. In Committee: surer) [8.55] I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" 3 A . Section 22 of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end of Sub-section (2) thereof the words ' or has resided in Australia continuously for twenty years.' "" The effect of this clause is that a person who has been resident in Australia for twenty-five years, and is afflicted with congenital disease which renders him permanently incapacitated, or who is blind, shall be regarded as being eligible for the pension if he arrived in Australia before attaining the age of three years. I heartily support the clause, but I think the residential qualification should be amended. Twenty-five years is a long time. In the other clauses of the Act the term is twenty years. I think that that should be quite long enough. If the Treasurer will make the term twenty years it will be in conformity with the other residential qualifications in the Act. Twenty-five years is almost a life-time. Honourable members on this side of the Chamber think that ten or twelve years should be sufficient qualification. I suggest that the Treasurer should at least reduce it to twenty years. I support the suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). It would not affect matters very much from the financial point of view if the Treasurer 'adopted the suggestion. I m migrants are obliged to undergo a much stricter medical examination now than formerly.

It is hardly reasonable fro m the stand-point of honourable members on this side of the Committee that the qualification in this case should be made twenty-five years. I also ask the Treasurer to reduce it by at least five years, thus bringing it into line. When I discussed this matter with the Treasurer, I suggested that the residential qualification should be twenty years. That was in accord with the representations made to me.

There is a consensus of opinion in the Committee that the term should be twenty years instead of twenty-five years. On a previous clause the Treasurer resisted an appeal to increase the payments to pensioners in public institutions beyond 3s. because, so he declared, they had not asked .for more than 3s. In this case, the honourable* member for Fawkner, who perhaps is more conversant with the nature of the requests from blind people than any other member, declares that they wish the term to be not more than twenty years. In the circumstances the Treasurer might comppy with the request. In this he will have the support not only of members of the Committee, but of the people of Australia. If there is any difficulty in connection with the appropriation it may be remedied by securing [9-0] -The appropriation has a supplementary appropriation The number of congenital cases that will come under the provision of this clause is not very many.

It will be seen that the proposals submitted a£ the Conference were altogether different from those embodied in this B ill . The Conference, after discussing those proposals, was unable to agree. A f t e r several days' sitting, this was the result of the deliberations of the Conference:The following proposals of the Conference were acepted in principle by four States. New South Wales dissented, whilst Tasmania was not represented at the Conference on the 9th June, when the proposals were dealt w it h : For a period of five years from the 1st July, 1923(1) The Commonwealth shall not levy any income tax on any incomes except those of companies.

That was the decision arrived at by four out of the six States, and, instead of effect being given to those proposals, we have before us a B ill which provides only that the State Governments shall collect both Commonwealth and State income taxes. I want to say that the Premiers' Conference up to the present has been shown to be a dismal failure. Nothing of any consequence to the people of Australia has emanated from it . It might as well not have been held for any good that has come out of it . The representatives of New South Wales objected to the proposals I have just quoted, and the New South Wales Treasurer was able to prove, after investigation, that in the figures submitted to the Conference a mistake had been made approaching £2,000,000, plainly showing that there was no justification at the time for the Commonwealth Government rushing the calling of the Conference, as it had not the necessary data upon which to found a scheme. Instead of this House being called together to pass remedial legislations, its meeting was deferred pending the holding of the Conference, and now we are sitting night and day to get through our legislation. When the Conference met, it had no accurate data on which to work, and this House is now asked to pass this B ill to provide that the States shall collect income tax when only two of the States have agreed to do so. U p to the present only Victoria and New South Wales have agreed to the proposal embodied in this Bill. tain that Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania w ill agree, and Western Australia is already provided for. making is that only two of the States have so f a r agreed to the proposal contained in this B ill .

They must decide whether or not they w ill approve of the proposals contained in this B ill . Whilst we are making machinery available to carry out the proposals we do not know whether the States will agree to what is proposed. The State Parliaments must be consulted, and if they do not agree, it will make us look very foolish. If the States do nob agree to the proposal, what w ill become of the scheme ? States that have already agreed to it? member w ill see that we have made certain provision for the expenditure of public money to compensate officers who may be retired from the Commonwealth Service. If only two of the States agree to it , that will make all the difference in the world. I contend that too much -time is taken up in this Housei n pushing measures through before we know where we stand. This may make this Parliament, which should be the superior Parliament, look very small indeed. There is no escape from that. In this matter the State Parliaments should legislate first. W ill honourable members agree that this Parliament should be subordinated to the State Parliaments? It says little for the Government, and it will say little for the members of this House, if , after years of Federation, when the trend of public opinion is in the direction of the abolition of the State Parliaments in order to economize, the Federal Parliament by its, legislation strengthens the State Parliaments by giving them greater powers in regard to taxation. The Government was prepared, if the States would accept it , to hand over income taxation altogether to the State Parliaments, notwithstanding the fact that it was imposed for the purpose of paying the cost of the war. We have to keep that in mind all the time. Although the agreement is for five years, the Treasurer desires to make arrangements whereby the State Parliaments w ill have the cont r ol of all income tax. I say as I said on a previous occasion, that this Parliament must walk warily. If we are not careful about what we are doing, we may find ourselves in such a position that we cannot finance Australia. The customs revenue is not going The y must have a to keep up as at present, and if it falls, and we have no Federal income tax, how are we to meet our obligations? We are going ahead at break-neck speed, and do not know whither we are driving. We are grasping at a shadow, and the time is not far distant when chaos will be rife in the administration of our national affairs. The Treasurer estimates that under the B ill a saving w ill be made of £260,000. A short time ago he expected a saving of £400,000. A t that time.

If a saving of £260,000 is to be made and the average salary of Commonwealth employees is about £250, then 1,040 taxation officers w ill be dismissed.

The child allowance is £ 5 0 . The result is that the great body of workers in New South Wales do not pay State tax at all. the Commonwealth Taxation Department concerns the small income taxpayers, because there are so many of them. In my own district there are several thousand workers who pay Commonwealth income tax, but not one of them pays the State tax. When the States take over the taxation work they w ill require additional labour, and I am doubtful whether the estimated saving of £260,000 w ill be made. New South Wales they are immediately dispensing with one of their buildings, and placing the combined staff under one roof. why a saving should be effected. As a matter of fact, it would be better if the. Commonwealth concentrated the accommodation for public servants rather than housing them in buildings scattered all over the place. More co-ordination would mean less expense. But it does not follow that because the combined staff in New South Wales w ill be housed in one building instead of two, a saving in labour will be effected. What is the position of these men? There are 1,619 employed in the Taxation Department of the Commonwealth alone, and if 1,040 employees are dismissed they w ill join the ranks of the unemployed. There is very little opening for them here. Compensation is to be paid, but what is six or twelve months' pay when employment cannot be found? A f t e r a l l , they are a class of workers who cannot make a success of any job.

I am surprised that the Treasurer makes such an interjection when his proposal is in black and white. Those rights were not given away because the States would not accept them. New South Wales prevented it , and the Commonwealth Treasurer has been complaining ever since of the Treasurer of New South Wales not understanding his job. He refused to accept the proposal because the data were not available to work out the figures.

They proposed a scheme that was derided by every taxation expert in Australia, That being so, it is quite namely, that the field of income taxation should be divided between the Commonwealth and the States, the Federal authority taxing all incomes above £2,000, and the States all incomes under. Apparently the Commonwealth Government did not realize that it was opening up a most wonderful field for dispute between the Federal and State authorities.

I do not know why the Federal Government proposes to surrender to subordinate authorities the right of collecting taxation-for the States are subordinate, and as time goes on and as the intelligence of the people is applied to our system of government, the States w i ll become still more subordinate to the national Parliament. The Government's proposal, however, is building up the authority of the States and making more absolute their sovereign rights. without protest, any surrender of the Commonwealth's powers and rights to a subordinate authority. policy of the State-righters, and it leads to duplication in every shape and form. There can be uniformity and lack of duplication only when the Federal authority is the sole collector of taxation. Dr. honourable member arrangement ? Mr Scullin. Only companies -Government is in power. In the per capita payments the Commonwealth Government has in its hands an all-powerful weapon, but it has never used it . It has made no serious attempt to bring the States to a realization of their responsibility in regard to duplication, but that w ill be done when there is in power a Government strong enough to apply the power it has got. Wheni t does so, the people will support it . The Government boasts of having got r i d of duplication in the collection of taxation, notwithstanding that the Federal Income TaxI t s sole Department' will continue. I predict that there will be no economy in the head office; there w ill , be no dismissals of highly-salaried officers at headquarters. The economy to be effected That w ill be the throwing out into the cold of the smaller-paid men, who w ill find it difficult to get other employment under present conditions. I am not certain It is a composite arrangement, that economy is real when it means the saving of expenditure by throwing people out of work, and rendering them unproductive for a long time. Hearing the Government boasting that it was getting rid of duplication, one would think that it would start upon the worse form of duplication-that in connection with land taxation. There duplication is found, not only in the assessments and collections, but also in valuations. The work of valuing is expensive, and variations give rise to many disputes. The Federal authority, the State authorities, and the municipal authorities are separately engaged in the work of valuation, and in some places other subordinate bodies such as Closer Settlement Boards and Savings Bank Commissioners are covering -the same field, and very rarely do any two valuations agree. There was further scope for the elimination of duplication in connection w it h the I shall never permit, entertainment tax and probate duties. We should be seeking carefully for some real reform instead of rushing into ill That is the considered plans like this. The Federal authority should collect a l l the taxes.

I hope that when we reach the Committee stage the Treasurer will be ready to adopt some suggestions for more generous treatment. Equal consideration should be given to employees whether they are returned men or not, and whether they are permanent or temporary employees. Many of the men who are technically termed temporary employees have been in the Service for four, five, and six years, and, whether they have passed an examination or not, have as much right to compensation as other employees who are regarded as permanent.

At least twelve months' salary should be given to the lower-paid officers who will be retired from the Taxation Department.

What compensation is half-ayear's salary to a man who is receiving as little as £250 a year? I cannot congratulate the Government on the agreement it has made, nor can I congratulate it on the proposals in this Bill. These are simply stop-gap proposals. Much confusion will occur in trying to adjust the Commonwealth and States Taxation Departments, and the various methods of assessing and collecting income tax.

It is impossible in the Golimited time at our disposal to give this measure adequate consideration. Up to He added that the Commonthe present the Treasurer has finalized an on account of the agreement w it h only one State.

Honourable members have no information as to the details of the agreement. I believe that the cost of collection, instead of being reduced, w ill be increased, because the State Taxation Departments w ill have to add to their collecting staffs. Unfortunately, there is little prospect of another general election for a couple of years, so I suppose this muddle w ill be continued and the taxpayers w ill be annoyed u n t i l they have an last thing he should have done. opportunity of expressing their opinion upon this composite Government at the ballot-box. confusion in every direction. People w ill not know how much or to whom they will be called upon to pay. I do not know where I stand, but I am not going to worry about that. I shall wait t ill I receive a notice. It would be unwise to retrench in ' the Taxation Department at this stage. In view of the muddle which is sure to be created by this proposal, it would be better to retain the services of these trained officers. They might be placed in reserve, as it were, and given some other employment u n t i l the Government know definitely what is likely to happen. I should be very much interested to hear you, Mr Speaker, on the floor of the House, express your opinion of this scheme. It is most unsatisfactory in every respect. SirA r t h u r Cocks, the Treasurer of New South Wales, has been very much troubled about the effect' of this agreement upon taxpayers in his State. Until there is uniformity in assessments and exemptions, the agreement is not at all likely to be successful. In New South Wales, for instance, the exemption is £250 and £50 for each child under the age of sixteen years, whereas under the Commonwealth the exemption at the time of the Conference, was £200 and £30 for each child. Do not honourable members see what confusion w ill be caused by such discrepancies ? His view is, as the result of the' agreement the New South Wales Government will be obliged to place a heavier impost on small and medium incomes, because they will not be able to deal with aggregate incomes or companies. He claims that the abandonment of the taxation of aggregate incomes will benefit the big taxpayers of the Commonwealth to the extent of £2,000,000, and that in order to make good an estimated loss to the State of about £200,000, the New South Wales Government w ill have to increase the taxation on the smaller incomes. He realizes that as the State Government are already in bad odour, further taxation difficulties will result in their complete obliteration at the next elections. If the taxpayers are annoyed, they will give no assistance to the Department in the collection of taxation. If the Treasurer is concerned about the success of the New State movement, I think that in submitting this B ill he has done the He should have submitted legislation to make the Federal authority the sole taxThe agreement w ill create ing power, and should gradually have worked towards Unification. W it h U n i fication there would be no trouble in the creation of new States. I am not opposed to the creation of new Statesi f their boundaries are fixed and their Constitutions are framed by this Parliament. The laws for the government of Australia should be passed by this Parliament, but there is no reason why the management of local affairs should not be l e f t to local authorities. If the bodies given the management of local affairs are called Local Governments, that will probably please gentlemen who are anxious to be Premiers of small States. It would lessen the cost of government if the management of local affairs were placed in the hands of local authorities. I am prepared to assist the New State movement, but the whole matter must be managed by the Federal Parliament. If the subdivision of the existing States is to be left to the State Parliaments, it will not be brought about within the life-time of any member of this House. If different authorities are to have the right of taxation, we shall never have economy, and what is done will only defeat the intention of. the people that the Federal Parliament should carry on the government of Australia. It may not be quite relevant to the subject, but I should like to say that I consider there are some very dangerous provisions in the Companies B ill . It would appear that people in a small way of business will be very foolish if they do not put their affairs into a company, as by doing so they may save themselves thousands of pounds in taxes. Another dangerous feature of the proposal to leave to the State Parliaments the imposition and collection of income tax is that they will not be likely to . impose such taxation on democratic lines, though that might be done if there were Labour Governments in all of. the States. Wo know that the Federal Parliament has endeavoured principles to the income tax, and has provided that individuals proportion to their incomes. bers of the Premiers' Conference men largely concerned in public companies, and they seemed to have considered only the interests of the people with whom they are associated, and to have ignored those of the industrial I admit that I have only .skimmed over the report of. the Conference, but it appears to me that the members of it were concerned to relieve the wealthier section of the community, and to abolish, if possible, the graduated tax upon They know that, so long as the Federal Parliament there is no possibility of that being departed from, and they feel that if the control of. income tax is handed over to the State Parliaments, it will be possible to abolish that principle. should be remembered that Australia is not the only country in which there is a graduated income tax.

Clause5 is a welcome provision, although it is not as definite as I should like. Personally, I would insert a clause providing that officers who were eligible for active service, and did not enlist, should be retired before returned soldiers, preference being given to married men as against those who are single. There are many returned soldiers in the Taxation Department, and they should be absorbed in other Departments in place of men who were eligible but failed their country in its hour of need. should apply that principle to the men accompanying the Prime Minister.

Commonwealth Service has suffered in consequence. retrench in the Taxation Department, following upon the many compulsory retirements in the Defence Department, will accentuate the 'existing feeling of insecurity. I have often heard it said that the smaller remuneration of the Public Service compared w it h that obtaining in similar employment outside was more than compensated for by the security of tenure attached to a Government position. I was at one time emthe 'Commonwealth Government. ployed by the State of South Australia, and one of the arguments advanced whenever we sought higher wages and i m proved working conditions was that we should be prepared to accept a lower rate of pay than was received by men outside the Service because we had permanency of employment.

We hope considerably to .and will defer the operation of the provisions of this Bill until we have definite knowledge of the intentions of the various States regarding the proposals which the Commonwealth Government has submitted to them. I again protest against the way in which the Government has been prepared to surrender to the States the powers of the Commonwealth in re: gard to the collection of income tax. It has not actually surrendered the power of taxation, but its action suggests disquieting possibilities for the future if These gentlemen are great "" State righters "", and I am afraid that they are ' prepared to surrender taxation powers to which this Commonwealth has a perfect right. I am very jealous of those powers. I hope that ultimately the Commonwealth Government will be the supreme authority in Australia, and will be able to delegate certain poAvers to provincial councils or State Governments over which it will retain complete authority. The actions of the present Commonwealth Government, hoAvever, do not lead us to think that that day is near at hand. We are told that £200,000 is to be spent in compensating the officers who Avill be affected by the retrenchments consequent upon the adoption of this scheme. The [135] men who will be retired have specialized in taxation work, and may find it very difficult to obtain suitable employment outside. We are also told that the adoption of this scheme will save the Commonwealth £264,000 a year. In that circumstance, surely we can afford to be a little more generous to those Avho are being compulsorily retired. We should . not subject them to embarrassment and difficulty while they are seeking congenial Should we not, therefore, feel employment. We can afford to spend a little more money to adequately compensate them. To achieve that object, a number of amendments to this Bill will be moved in Committee. Honourable members on this side of the Chamber intend to do all they possibly can to obtain for these retrenched employees a liberal compensation. Further, we shall seek to insure that officers who are transferred to the' State services shall receive as much salary as at present, and also the child endowment and cost of living allowances, which are granted in the Commonimprove the measure. There is certainly much room for improvement. When a Labour Government comes into power later, it will endeavour to rectify the mistakes that are now being made. It will take steps to make the CommonAvealth Government the tax-collecting authority in respect of all taxes in ""which it is interested, and will seek a proper scheme of co-ordination which Avill effect a true economy.

I was informed, in reply, that the questions would be considered. I thought that the Treasurer, in his second-reading speech, would have dealt with the points referred to in my questions. No information has been given. I ask now what the Government intends to do in certain cases. 1 shall deal first with the position of officers whom the Government proposes to transfer to the State service. Some of those men may be quite willing to be transferred, and others may have objections. They may say that they are perfectly satisfied with their present employer, but are nof willing to allow the Government autocratically to pass them over to some other employer. They may say, "" We are satisfied to remain in the employ of one feudal baron, but we have no sympathy with the one to whom it is proposed to pass us over."" Will the Government give to the men who object to the transfer the option of retiring with an adequate compensation,, or will it say, ""If you will not accept employment in some other service we shall decline to give you a single penny."" I desire to know whether the Arbitration Court award rights of the transferred employees will be preserved to them? Will they srill receive the cost of living allowmembers to keep pace with them.

Provision is being made in this Bill for declaring certain men "" Excess officers What will be the position of employees who are transferred to the State Servicei f , shortly after the transfer, they are declared to be excess officers? Is there any security against such a happening? There is none. If they go over to the State Services, the State authorities may not be able to give them a position or the status which they occupied under the Commonwealth Government. Bill professes to do justice' to these officials. It does nothing of the kind. If they are retired from the Service they will receive compensation on a definite basis, but if they are transferred to a State Service there will be no guarantee that their status or emoluments will subsequently be secured to them. ently, about 1,000 officers will be affected Mr Anttey. by this Bill. In this State the number will probably be 300. What guarantee is there that, subsequent to their transfer, they will not be declared excess officers. In that event, they will be in a much worse position than if they had been retired from the Commonwealth Service. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) urged the Government to give preference to men who had been on active service, and I took advantage of the opportunity to make an interjection, which was entirely disorderly, to remind' the House that on the staff of the Prime Minister who is about to proceed to England, there is only one man who has been on active service. Apparently, the policy which the Government profess to believe in has gone , by the board. I again ask the Treasurer what guarantee is given to these men, that if they are transferred, their emoluments, their status, their seniority, and their retention in the service of the State will be insured. If the Treasurer is prepared to answer this simple question now, it may save considerable time and expedite the passage of the Bill through Commit-"" tee. -On e Bill follows so closely upon another at this stage of the session that it is absolutely impossible i for honourable Chamber is no longer a deliberative Assembly.

408,Mr Fenton,"I think I can connectof the things we did in framing the Australian Constitution. General Smuts in commenting upon the South African Constitution said, "" We have avoided the mistakes of the Australian Constitution, and have taken to ourselves powers that are not possessed by the National Parliament of Australia."" Constitution been framed on different lines, we would not be passing legislation such as that now before us. There are different ways of practising economy, and for the economy which takes on the character of parsimony I have no liking. I hold that we shall never have true economy in Australian affairs u n t i l the National Parliament is supreme, and the State or provincial authorities are subordinate to the Federal authority. believe that one of the purposes of this B ill is retrenchment. Honourable members in the Country party comer desire to be able to say that they have effected considerable retrenchment in the Commonwealth Public Service. monious members of this House will claim to have saved money for the people. They will claim to be responsible for the retrenchment of a number of Commonwealth public servants at a cost of £200,000 or £300,000 by way of compensation, 'when the expenditure of very little more money would keep those officers f u l l y employed in other Departments. of the press, and the anxiety of a section in this House, to indulge in what they regard as retrenchment, I say that if the Federal authority had f u l l power to develop on national lines, those who are to be retrenched might be absorbed in the taxation department, or in other branches of the Public Service, with advantage. It is certain that very little will be saved under this B ill , in the first twelve months. I repeat, that in my opinion, this legislation is premature. desires by passing a certain number of measures to proclaim that they are carrying out great reforms, and making savings. The Treasurer will no doubt tell me that he has the State Treasurers in hand, and they must do what he directs. I can see very little difference between the form now issued for returns of income for Commonwealth taxation and that which will have to be filled up under this B ill . Dr. cent, Mr Fenton. man is probably correct in that statement. Those who have to make up returns for State income tax in Victoria are aware that the form which has to be filled in is much more simple than that issued by the Commonwealth GovernHad our ment. Some people would sooner serve six months than write a letter or fill in a taxation schedule, but the filling in of these forms is probably a matter about which a man who is well off does not trouble. He, no doubt, gets a clerk or some one else to do it for him. I admit that I do not take very much trouble in making out my return, and am satisfied so long as I tell the truth . The State and Federal returns have to be sent in I about the same time. My practice is to make out the .Federal return in duplicate, and I need then only make a copy of it in filling up the State form . If that practice is generally followed, very little trouble w ill be saved to the taxThe parsipayers in having to fill up but one form. However, the Government is out for retrenchment, and hopes to be able to dispense w i th the services of a number of persons who are breadwinners in .this country, and are doing useful work. economy. it will result in more of hardship than Notwithstanding the criticism of benefit to the community.

There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with cream, and this B ill is an attempt to put into effect the desire of the Country party. The then Leader of the party clothed his language with ambiguity, which made it difficult for the ordinary reader to detect his desire for retrenchement; but I honestly believe that that was his intention. We have had the same experience in the past.

The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) pointed out the injustice that would be inflicted on these men if they were transferred willy-nilly to State Departments.

The Victorian income tax return is in a simple form, and I think could very well be adopted for the collection of Federal tax. t f the forms were simple, the taxpayers would not object to filling in two returns. The Commonwealth should be the taxcollecting authority, and not six separate States. My main objection to the measure is that it subverts the rights of the Commonwealth.

Other items in the Country party's platform as published in the Melbourne Age are(1) Collection by the States of direct taxation. (2) Direct taxation to be banded over to the States and the Commonwealth to return the whole of the Customs revenue. In return for the handing over of the land tax, income tax, probate, and amusement tax to the States, the sum of 30s. per capita to be paid to the Commonwealth by the States. Part of that proposal is contained, in the B ill now before us. Dr. must have been evolved, by the Age itself. the platform of the Country party.

If the composite Ministry were to seek to bring about an amendment of the Constitution to) reduce the number of Governments, minimize the State Parliaments, and augment the powers and status of the National Parliament, it would be proceeding on right lines. This piecemeal legislation to meddle with the taxation scheme cannot be trul y effective. In the first place it is subverting the rights of the National Parliament, and as such is a retrograde step of the worse character, which incidentally will throw a large number of men out of employment. . It would be better for the taxation arrangements to continue as at present for another twelve months, and in the meantime the Government could evolve an all-embracing scheme for which the people have long been waiting. ' So much do I object to the proposal contained in this B ill , and to the injustice that will be done to the Commonwealth and to a large number of Federal public servants, that I move as an amendmentThat all the words after the word "" That"" be strusk out and the following words be inserted in lieu thereof::-""thi s Bill subverts tbe powers of the Commonwealth Government, to subsidiary authorities, works injustice to a large number of Commonwealth employees, and therefore should be referred back for further consideration.""

If it does, there w ill be an overwhelming majority for the amendment, the B ill will be referred back to the Government, and that wil l be a command to it to go ahead on broad national lines instead of ' proceeding on the narrow parochial lines of which this B ill gives only too much evidence.

I agree with much that has been said by the honourable member for Maribyrnong and other honourable members on this side of the House. I object to the Bill,' on the broad ground that it subverts the interests of the Commonwealth because of the clamour of the State-righters. I realize that this B ill will not take from the Commonwealth the right to impose direct taxation; but it seems to me that if the Commonwealth hands over any of its functions to the States, even temporarily, that action must necessarily weaken the Federal spirit.""

The handing over of the power of direct taxation to the States by a voluntary arrangement would be a retfograde step, which would be calculated to do great harm and encourage those who are, clamouring for State rights and endeavouring to foster the parochial spirit, and detract from the Federal authority. I believe that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr freely coming into Australia. I oppose Austin Chapman) is. sincere in expressing the view that the Federal Parliament should be supreme,' and that State Parliaments and Governors should be abolished, but I cannot reconcile that advocacy with his support of this Bill. Whilst this measure does not permanently surrender any power, it does involve an arrangement whereby the Commonwealth, in certain respects, will become secondary to the States. Moreover, the Bill is premature. It is brought down in the dying hours of the session, and is being rushed through' the House at express speed. Why1 After the conference between Federal and State Ministers, the Acting Premier of New South Wales( Mr talk about finding work for them at Oakes) and the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Cocks) declared that they oould not agree to certain features of the Commonwealth Government's proposals. It appears that only two States are likely to sign an> agreement with the Commonwealth. Even if we pass it , if is doubtful whethei it w ill ' become effective. I shall always oppose measures which militate against the Federal spirit. I am inclined to think ""there is a certain amount of make believe associated with this Bill. If the Government desires to know what the people really think about the duplication of public services, let it take the proper and courageous course and test public feeling by a referendum. It is natural to wish to eliminate duplication, but I am not prepared to agree to any proposal which will weaken the authority of the Federal Parliament. Many big business interests which spent large sums of money to defeat the Labour party's attempt to broaden the Federal Constitution are now clamouring for some relief from the Commonwealth and State duplication. The Government proposes to eliminate* a certain amount of duplication in taxation by sacrificing .its authority in respect of income taxation. Unfortunately, it has) already mutilated our land taxation arrangements. Such actions must in the course of time compel the Federal Parliament to rely upon the Customs Department for practically the whole of its revenue. The development of such a policy will seriously interfere with the progress of Australian industry. Large increases in Customs ancl Excise revenue indicate that foreign goods are too the Bill, and hope the Government will withdraw it for further consideration. An additional reason I have for adopting this attitude is that its passing will adversely affect a large number of Commonwealth public servants, who have been specially trained in the distinctive methods of the Commonwealth Taxation Department. Stripped of all its superficiality, the Bill means economy by retrenchment of some of our best public servants. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) was much concerned lest some returned soldiers should be dismissed. I do not wish to see any employees dismissed. It is all very well to Canberra. Men who have been following a clerical occupation for half their life-time are unfitted to undertake manual labour. That has been proved time after time. It would be disastrous and cruel to put these men to hard outdoor work. The only fair and humanitarian plan for retrenchment is to retire the public servants as they reach the age limit and not fill their places. That method may take a considerable time, but it will be the cheapest and best way. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), and ,1 trust that in justice to the people of Aiistralia this Government will not barter away any of the Commonwealth powers or weaken the Federal spirit. I recognise that it is futile to expect this Government to show any mercy to the public service. Such conduct is not in keeping with its general policy. All its economies are accomplished at the expense of the working class. The advantage of any saving that may be achieved in consequence of retrenchments in the Federal Taxation Department will be more than outweighed by the confusion that will be caused by the action to be",83,Earle Page Thos E Proposals I F There Are To Be Amendments Of The

Our taxation laws and methods are entirely different from those of the States. Eveni f the confusion is only temporary, it will result in heavy loss and considerable trouble to the taxpayer. with the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), that taxation is a Federal function, and that the Government should retain whatever taxation powers it possesses. volves the supremacy of the Federal Government, and as the Labour party stands for the extension of Federal powers it cannot consistently support any proposal which w ill l i m it our present fields of taxation.

A perusal of the measure will convince any one that nothing of the kind is attempted. for the collection of Commonwealth taxation by the States interferes. in no way with the rights of the Commonwealth. In the agreement with New South Wales, which I laid upon the table of the House two or three weeks ago, clause 9 specially providesNothing in this agreement shall be deemed to restrict or impede tbe Commonwealth or tbe State in the exercise of its rights and powers under the Constitution of the Commonwealth or the State, and the laws of the Commonwealth or the State now or hereafter in force.

453,Dr. Earle Page,"I have had now ill be treated in exactly the same way .as permanent men already in the Service. That is as f a r as we can go to meet their ease. We find that there are altogether six limbless men employed, and I have .assured the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) who, because of his own affliction, has a very great sympathy for these men, that without question we shall be able to find employment for them in some other branch of the Commonwealth Service. W it h regard to the balance of ninety odd officers, we have requested the Public Service Board to use every endeavour to see if it is not possible to place them in other branches of the<, Service. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) raised the point that, because many of these men are in the F if t h Class, and, consequently, receive a very small salary, they w ill , if discharged, be entitled to a very small amount by way of compensation. I want to say, in this connection, that, w i th the exception of typists and sorters who are mostly female employees, I hope that most of the others will be absorbed in the State Departments, or throughout the Commonwealth Service. I am informed that the State Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Whiddon, and Mr Stephens, Secretary of the State Treasury, have been in close consultation with Mr Collins, the Secretary of the Commonwealth Treasury, Mr Ewing, the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation, and Mr Hume, the Deputy Taxation Commissioner of New South Wales, and they expect that they will be immediately able to absorb the whole of the permanent staff in New South Wales, though it may be found that some further reduction of staff ' w ill be necessary later. we officers probably several months notice before they are called upon to retire. There is a certain amount of arrears of work to be overtaken in the State offices, and in the Central Office, and it will be possible for us to give officers who are to be discharged comparatively long notice, in addition to the compensation which will be paid to them. It may be possible to utilize the services of some of the temporary men' in this way for a time. W it h regard to returned soldiers and temporary men who do not come within the classes I have mentioned, we will make the same arrangement for them as has been made for the officers, retrenched from the Repatriation Department, who were also temporary employees. We will give them, for eight weeks, half-pay as a sustenance payment, if unable to obtain employment, and will use every endeavour through our repatriation organization to t r y to place them in employment. I would like to assure the House that the Government has, in this matter, recognised its responsibility as an employer of some 2,000 men and women. It will make use of every means in its power to secure that t h e ' hardships attendant upon the re-trenchment, ^ which this step renders necessary, will be felt as little as possible by those concerned. The Government looks confidently to the House to endorse the action it has taken. Even to-night, when we found that there were some other matters which, dealt with sympathetically, would prevent a certain amount of hardship, honourable members wil l have noticed that I brought down a supplementary Governor General's Message to enable amendments to be made in t h e B ill to permit the most generous and sympathetic consideration of these cases. Without wasting further time, I ask the House to negative the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), which is based on absolutely false premises, to carry the second reading of the Bill and enable us to get into Committee, where the real work on the Bill can be done, and we can Coi-sider the points which the honourable members for Yarra and Bourke wish to have discussed.

On the 4th JulyI presented to the House a statement of the finances for the preceding year, and I mentioned that an amount of £200,000 was being allotted from the surplus for the purpose of compensating retrenched officers. It was, in the Defence Department. . therefore, plain to the members of the Service that if they awaited' developments they would participate in the compensation. It is practically impossible to determine why members of the Service retired during the preceding months. Some men may have resigned solely because better jobs were offered to them, and as they would have left the Service in any case, they are not entitled to compensation. To make the compensation retrospective three months is out of the question, and I ask the Committee to negative the amendment. am sorry that the Treasurer has announced his hostility to the amendment before he has heard it discussed, because it will be difficult for him to withdraw from the attitude he has adopted. A strong case can be made out in favour of the amendment. I have with me a number of newspaper extracts showing that the proposed amalgamation of the Taxation Departments was "" in the a i r "" as far back as April. A few officers have taken positions outside the Department-no t always better, positions-becaus e they foresaw this development. They, believed that they, like the officers and clerks in the Defence Department, would receive compensation upon voluntary retirement. There was a clause in the Act relating to the retirement of Defence officers which made the compensation payable to anybody who retired voluntarily before a certain date, which was about three months before the Bill was passed. sented to in September, and the payments were made retrospective to the 30th June. Taxation Department, who retired voluntarily, believed that the compensation would be similarly retrospective. I remember asking the Treasurer, in April, for his advice in regard to one officer who had been offered another position, and the Treasurer, in a friendly way, advised that the man should accept the offer. He certainly did not promise that the officer would receive compensation, but the general impression, was that it would be paid to those who voluntarily retired. January or Eebruary, 1922, that compensation would be paid to the employees the Treasurer can suggest that he »has only made up his mind in the. last week or two that compensation would be paid to the retrenched employees in the Taxation Department. ployees retire from the Taxation Department every year. be affected by the amendment and only a small amount of money will be in? volved. In those circumstances, I think the Government ought to accept it. Why should an injustice be done to any employee? If those who are still in the employment of the-Department are entitled to compensation, I think that those who left it because of the uncertainty of their position, and who thus saved the Treasurer the unpleasant task of dismissing them, are also entitled to it . Morally, they have as much claim to it as the other men. I support the view put by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). I do not know how many persons will be affected, but to my knowledge quite a number of men have left the Department because of the uncertainty of their positions. I know of one employee who left who would have had twenty years' service in another twelve months, and so would have qualified for six months' furlough. Such a man must have retired because of the disturbed conditions arising out of these new arrangements. Why should he be arbitrarily cut-out of the scheme of compensation? member for Batman know that that was the reason for his retirement ?that compensation should be paid in those cases where it can be shown that the reason for, retirement, was uncertainty about the future. .

They would realize when a position offered that even if the salary were not as large as that which they were receiving in the Department, it would be better for them to accept it, and so fee sure of a position, than to wait until they were retrenched and then look for work. If the retirement of these officers had caused the Taxation Department any inconvenience, one could understand the"" Government feeling some resentment, but the action of these men will really make it easier for the Commonwealth Government to effect the change that it desires.

To do so would be to open the way to serious abuses. Hundreds of .changes occur every year in the staff of the Taxation Department. is easy to see, therefore, that if the Government adopted the amendment some men might receive compensation who deserved none. the case was brought before me of a man who left the Taxation Department to become managing clerk to an accountant in Brisbane at a salary 50 per cent, in advance of that which he was receiving in the Department.

Quite a number, knowing that certain changes were pending, took advantage of any opportunity that offered and secured employment outside the Department, believing, no doubt, that they were assisting the Government to get over a difficulty, and all honourable members have received letters from employees asking if it is possible to get a transfer to some other Department. Many of those who have gone out of the Public Service are to-day in positions inferior to those which they occupied in the Department, but they believed that it was better to accept what employment was offering, rather than wait for the retrenchment scheme to be put into operation. If they had hung on to their positions until this Bill was passed they would have received a month's salary for every year of service rendered. They are now shut out. The acceptance of the amendment would not involve very heavy expenditure, but it would be an act of justice to those men. were advised by the head of the Department to accept positions outside in view of pending retrenchment. all probability, -they thought they were helping the Government by accepting outside employment. It was known many months ago that the Government contemplated coming to an agreement with the States in regard to taxation matters. Accordingly, a certain number of employees looked elsewhere for employment. It is possible that, in many cases, they have no chance of permanency. They' may soon be thrown out on the world again. The least we can do is to make the Bill retrospective to April last, so as to include all men who were then in the employ of the Department, and who had given faithful service to this country. The Government should endeavour to be an ideal employer. They should, as far as possible, make the conditions attractive, and, in the event of retrenchment, should treat their employees fairly liberTaxation Department. He said that he ally. I am afraid the Treasurer was rather hasty. Perhaps, on reflection, he -will realize that these men have a just claim to reasonable consideration. Even if there were half-a-dozen cases, such as the Treasurer mentioned, out of forty or fifty, justice should be done to the latter. Perhapsi t will be possible to exclude the cases referred to by the Minister. It is very hard for an employee to be shut out of the provisions of this Bili simply because he left the employ .of the Department a few weeks, or, perhaps, only a day, before this Bill was passed. Some of these employees may have established homes of their own, and have contracted obligations. What is to become of those homes. Possibly also, if they were granted a lump sum, by way of compensation, some of them would be able to start a small business, and make their future secure in that way. It is very hard on a man who, perhaps, had given eight or ten years' faithful service to the Department to be denied compensation simply because he took advantage df an opportunity to obtain employment outside the Department a week or two prior to assent being given to this Bill. I am prepared to accept a compromise in this matter, and if the Treasurer thinks that April is too far to go back, let him agree to go back as far as June. That would not involve very heavy additional expenditure. We have to bear in mind thab a single man need not be greatly concerned about looking for other employment, in view of his possible retirement as the result of this measure, but the married men with dependants must look to the future. He knows this retrenchment is to take place, and he knows what the loss of his employment will mean to his little ones. He naturally looks out for a job, and if. he takes one a month, or a fortnight, before we pass this Bill, he is to be given no compensation, whilst the single man who hangs on until the Bill is passed, will get compensation.

It is perfectly natural that, when a number of dismissals are likely a prudent man should take the bull by the horns and even accept an inferior job rather than remain in the Service to later be dismissed. I do not think that such a man should be penalized, particularly when his resignation assists the Government in their retrenchment scheme. The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition to date back compensation to the 1st A p r i l is going rather too far, but I urge upon the Treasurer to at any rate consider dating it from the beginning of the financial year, the 1st July, ' or preferably the 1st June.

The proviso will then read that the compensation payable to any officer shall not be less than the equivalent of twelve months' pay. On the second reading I pointed out that the majority of these men who have had less than twelve years' service are the lowest paid, and, consequently, will be retired on a very small amount of compensation. About 66 per cent, of the officers in the Taxation Department have less than eight years' service, and about 85 per cent, less than twelve years' service. Officers with less than twelve years' service receive* very small salaries. Replying to my remarks on the second reading, the Treasurer said that the majority of the lower-paid officers would be absorbed in other Departments. stronger, because if the majority will be provided for in that way there will be fewer to compensate. It may be argued that the provision I am suggesting was not made in connection with the retirement of the Defence Department officers, but none of them were below the fourth class, and, therefore, they were drawing higher salaries than are the majority of those who will be retired from the Taxation Department. I understand that the average amount of compensation paid to Defence officers was about £600, but the average under this Bill will be much less. Of the 1,600 officers in the Taxation Department, about 1,250 are in the fifth class, or even lower grades of the Service. A messenger with six years' service receives £144 per annum, and if dismissed will under the clause as drafted get £72 compensation. similar length of service receive £153, and will get £76 in compensation. Male assistants with six years' service receive £180 per annum, and will get only £90 as compensation, and female assistants with six years' service receive £165, and will get £82 compensation. The position of fifth class clerks will be:-On e year's service, salary £90, compensation £45; two years' service, salary £108, compensation £54; three years' service, compensation £63; four years' service, compensation £75; five years' service, compensation £93; and six years' service, compensation £99. Nobody will suggest that these officers can re-establish themselves in employment with such a small amount of compensation. As a plea has been made for returned soldiers, I point out. that a large number of both temporary and permanent officers with short service are returned soldiers, and the brevity of their service is due to the fact that for a number of years they were absent at the war. The majority of those who have less than twelve years' service are receiving small salaries. The Minister may object that if a minimum of twelve months' pay be given in compensation some of the highly paid officers will receive very large sums. To meet that objection I am willing that the minimum compensation shall be fixed at, say, £200. * more than the average twelve months' That makes my plea all the pay.? more. If a fifth class officer were retired on twelve months' pay he would get only £198 after six years' service, but if he had been in the Department for ten years he would get £252, and, if married, £272. The amendment is very reasonable. I do not want to fight the matter any longer. I admit that the amendments prepared by the Treasurer have greatly improved the Bill, and I want to give him credit for so doing; but, apparently, he baulked at the proposal in my amendment. This question and that which concerns the whole of the temporary employees are the most important in the Bill.

I support the amendment, and I trust that the Treasurer will' see his way clear to accept it . Approximately, 1,250 employees will be affected, of whom 289 are in Queensland, and comprise the following :-13 1 clerks, 37 typists, 76 sorters, and 45 assistants and messengers. .Ninety-six soldiers are included, 11 of whom are limbless. One can understand what a hardship it will be for these persons to be compelled to compete in the labour market with, unemployed xlerks, bookkeepers, and others who are accustomed to ordinary commercial occupations. The experience, that the taxation T h a t shows how officers have will be of little service to them in outside employment. Men engaged in ordinary business undertakings obtain a training in one commercial house which fits them to accept a situation in another, whereas men who have spent many years in the Public Service The transition may become adept at interpreting regulations and Acts of Parliament, and The Governgain a good knowledge of taxation affairs, and even become expert assessors, but are not specially qualified for the usual commercial duties. Seeing that these public servants believed that they were absolutely secure in their positions, it is most unfair to t u r n them out with a compensation which is a mere pittance. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) indicated that the amount will vary from it not be ar£ 45 to £ 9 0 in many cases. That is insufficient to enable them to become established in any business, and it will not . "" afford them much relief while they are T h a t could be done; searching folr employment. It is well known that the salaries in the Public Service are such that it is quite impossible for these men to accumulate money.

In consequence of the belief that their employment was permanent, they entered into obligations which in other The circumstances they would not have undertaken. Many of them have purchased dwellings on the time-payment They had to system, and have arranged to continue the payment of instalments over a period of twenty years. They did so only because they considered that they were in permanent employment. Very great hardship has been inflicted upon them by the action of the Government, and they should be paid a compensation .which will tide them over the period in which they will be searching for work. They should have at least the equivalent of twelve months' salary.

Ruin and disaster are awaiting many of them. therefore, that the Treasurer w ill give sympathetic consideration to the amendment I have received the following letter on the subject from a female sorter in the Brisbane Taxation Department: I am a female sorter employed in the Federal and the impossibility of getting suitable Taxation Branch of the Commonwealth Service.

I have quite a number of other letters couched in similar language, and I have no doubt that other honourable members also have had correspondence on this subject. When the proposals of the Government were announced, there was almost a panic in many of the Departments. The position is a very serious one for these officers. Many of these girls entered the Taxation Department during the war. When the male members of their' families joined up, the girls had to go out to work and' help keep the home. boys returned they got married, and in a great many instances the girls are still , continuing to support the home. They have given up the idea of marriage, .with the view to caring for their aged parents. I know several instances of girls who are looking after their mothers. If they are callously turned out of the Department, as the present Government, I regret to say, will be turning them out under the provisions of this B ill , the compensation payable to them should be not less than the equivalent of six months' pay. Contracts made by the Government should be honorably observed, and if broken, the persons concerned should be amply compensated.

If the Treasurer were to realize the position of these unfortunate people who are faced with dismissal and consequent unemployment, for probably a lengthy period, he would know how keenly they feel it. Many of them have financial responsibilities, and are seriously worried about their future prospects. Wherever possible, they are curtailing expenditure, which is necessary to keep the home going, and are looking forward with dismay to impending expenditure which cannot be' avoided.

The Government cannot say that they cannot afford to accept the amendment. We know very well that if the party on this side had come into power at the last elections, the step which the Government is taking would not have been taken, and these officers would have been retained in their present positions, and .the Commonwealth would have gone on paying their salaries. very great blessing fell upon 'the Commonwealth when the composite Government came into power, with its bright and brilliant idea of taking this step. served this blessing, but it has come upon us, and it would not be a very great hardship if its fruits were delayed for twelve months. In the meantime something like justice would be done to these public servants who are going to be turned out of their employment with six months' pay. I know something of the Government Service, and of how its routine unfits men to compete with others in world. If one of these officers receives £100 or £150 as six months' pay on retirement, it is very unlikely that within six months he will be able to place himself permanently and satisfactorily outside. Every Arbitrator and Board that has' assessed the pay of public servants has taken into consideration the continuity of their employment, and the fact that their salaries are likely to be increased by periodical increments. This has been considered a justification for assessing the salaries of public servants at a very low rate. As a consequence, these officers have been unable ""to save anything, and now they are to be cast out with six months' pay, which is by no means ""adequate compensation for their disappointment, the loss of their positions, and the comparatively small salaries they have been receiving for years, on the assumption that their employment would be permanent. ' The Government cannot deny that it can afford to give them twelve months' f u l l pay, which is no more than they should be given. I have no great confidence that any considerable saving will be monwealth may save something, but the expenditure of the State Governments is likely to be increased as a result of the proposal, and we cannot differentiate between the people of the Commonwealth and the people of the States. If the ( Government will not be more just, I am satisfied that before long it will be very severely blamed by many people in Australia. I regret to hear the verdict of the Treasurer No doubt a in this matter. Were the Government to accept the amendment there is not one person in the Commonwealth who would find fault with it, but on. the contrary it would be commended. The Treasurer, I do not say that Australia deas a doctor visiting the homes of average people in his district, must know how difficult it is for a married man to rear a family on casual employment. The civil servants are supposed to be in receipt of fair wages, but I venture to say that there is not 21 per cent, of married men amongst them"" who have saved £20 in the last five or six years. No public servant who has a wife and one child can * live in the city on a salary of less than the commercial a n d in d u s t r i a l £5 per week. These men are to be kicked out with compensation in the shape of six months' salary. There is yet time for the Government to retrace its steps, and I hope it will do so. If these men could follow any class of work it would be a different matter, but they have had no commercial training in the Public Service. It will be argued that there are vacancies for commercial men throughout the Commonwealth, but I venture to .say that if a man offered £20 for a position as a commercial traveller in Victoria he could not get it. Not one of these men have saved £20 from his salary as a civil servant, and the small amount of his compensation will vanish before he is able to find employment. I regret that there has been any need to dismiss these men. In a young and growing country like Australia we should be able to find employment for them somewhere. If the agreement with these officers is to be terminated, the Government should treat them fairly. I favour the suggestion of the honourable member for Yarra to make",99,Pairs

The Government are determined that the compensation shall consist of six months' pay, and I hope the Committee vote will be against them. To do justice to the men concerned, the Government should accept this amendment. They entered the Taxation Department in the belief that they had assured prospects and permanency of employment, and to dismiss them with six months' pay is a gross betrayal of confidence. has been set aside for, compensation, but on the Treasurer's own statement the bulk of these men will be absorbed in the Services of the States. fore, that sum should be quite sufficient to enable the Government to pay those who are retrenched twelve months' salary. If the amendment is carried it will induce the Public Service Board to make » every possible attempt to absorb these men, whereas if only sTx months' salary would be involved, that body might retrench in a drastic manner. Most of these men will have very little opportunity to get other positions. There is a glut in the market for clerical work. The Treasurer stated that there were vacancies for typists. I was secretary of the Australian Clerical Association of New South Wales for some time, and I profess to know a little about the condition of the market for clerical work. In no industry does there exist more depression than in the clerical occupation. so, then the whole of the money that has Thousands of clerks are out of work, as the awards which prescribe a living wage practically prohibit employment, because the employer uses female labour at cheap rates in preference to male labour. Hundreds of junior typists are being thrown on the labour market, and when female clerks reach twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, and require a living wage, they are dismissed and replaced by girls of sixteen or seventeen years of age. Unless these men are exceptionally lucky, or hold special qualiHe sends his boy to school and struggles fications, they will be compelledto sacrifice years of special training to accept labouring work or any other work offering. They should be given a sufficient sum to-keep them while looking for employment. Even twelve months' salary is far from adequate. To appeal to the Treasurer is like speaking to a stone wall, but even stone walls will crack under the weight of persistent effort. I trust that the honourable gentleman will yield to our request. -This request for twelve months' salary as compensation is reasonable, and I am surprised that the Treasurer has not accepted it, but he appears to be adamant. I was surprised at his recent remarks, since they were so much in I understand that £200,000 contrast with his previous utterances. I have pointed out that the estimated saving is problematic, because a large number of additional hands Therewill be required by the various States when taking over the work of the Commonwealth Department. That has been repeatedly denied by the Treasurer. Eirst there was to be a saving of £400 000, 5 and now it is £260,000. To my surprise, he stated just now that Queensland would take 65 per cent, of the men' retrenched from the Commonwealth, and that New South Wales would also take a high percentage. That supports my statement that New South Wales must obtain assistance for the additional work to be thrown upon her in the collection of income tax. The same thing will apply-to the other States. At last we have the true facts, and it is very evident from the Treasurer's statement that nothing like 1,040 officers will be thrown out of employment. That being been allotted for compensation will not be expended. Whatever the Commonwealth saves will be spent by the States, and as they, are acting together in this matter no saving will be effected at all. As not half the employees will be discharged, there will be no difficulty iu adopting the amendment and granting those who are retrenched twelve months' pay. This is a reasonable amendment.

When he completes his education, his parents decide to put the lad into the Public Service, which, to many people, offers an alluring prospect. parents have consulted me I have advised them that the Government Service is not the place for a bright lad, because he will not progress so well in it as he would in private employment. He gets stuck in a grpove, and even when he is moved to a higher class' his salary is increased by only a few pounds. After he has worked in a Department for six or nine years he is fit for nothing, else. Yet, because the Government has decided to make certain changes in taxation administration, some of these men are to be turned adrift in the world. Men who have been trained in shorthand, type writing, and clerical work are, to-day, a drug in the market. They can get no employment. I have in mind one lad whose parents made sacrifices in order to keep him at school until he was eighteen years of age. He engaged in clerical work, but for eighteen months he was out of work, and, eventually, had to undertake ordinary manual labour. Many of the men who are to be retrenched from the Taxation Department will have a similar experience. Since the war, clerical workers have had a very bad run. All positions that are available are given to returned soldiers, many of whom have qualified for clerical work. What is more destructive of a man's spirit, and the incentive to self-improvement, than unemployment? If a young fellow is without a regular income, and has not some ""prospects, his life is blighted, and he becomes despondent and hopeless. If a man is given a fair amount of compensation he may be able to engage in some little business ; at any rate, he can keep the wolf from the door until he finds some new employment, but without money he can dp nothing. To-day £100 does not go far, aud some of the officers to be retrenched will not receive more than about £50 or £60. That is not much to give to men who, after doing good service for the country, have been dismissed through no fault of their own. The Government should be as liberal as possible, and if The boy the Treasurer's statement is correct, the money already appropriated by the House for compensation will be more than sufficient to provide for the increase involved in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra. I have always held the view that when the Taxation Department is taken over by the States When they will not be able to collect two taxes '[without employing considerably larger staffs than they do now. The Treasurer stated that 65 per cent, of the employees ' of the Federal Taxation branch will be transferred to the State Service, and will not require to be compensated If only 35 per cent, are to be compensated, what is there to prevent the Commonwealth paying the compensation which the honourable'member for Yarra has suggested? I cannot, understand why the Treasurer is adamant. Many members opposite are, I believe, in sympathy with the amendment,because they know that the officers to be dismissed are entitled to reasonable consideration. When once the service of these men is dispensed with they may be out of employment, for a very long time. They are not suited to ordinary manual labour, and are certainly not fitted to go on the land. They will have to be absorbed in some form of city activity. The Treasurer admits that even the expenditure of the first year's saving will not be required to compensate them. That being so, I cannot understand why he will notaccept our reasonable amendment. It appears that he will not even compromise. We are getting no response atall to our appeal. It is as though we were talking to men who are deaf or asleepas, in fact, some honourable members are. I do not want unduly to labour the matter, but it is important that all aspects of it should be placed before the Committee. Perhaps, after a little longer consideration, the Treasurer will yield to our appeals. I have had my ups and downs in life, and I know what it means to be unemployed. I am certain that there is every justification for the adoption of this amendment. We are placing every phase, of the situation before honourable members, so that later on they will not be justified in saying they did not realize how much was at stake. If we could visualize for a moment the situation in which these men w ill be placed when they are retrenched, I am sure we would willingly consent to the amendment. formed the Committee that the New South Wales. Government intends to absorb 60 per cent, of the Taxation Department's employees in that State, and that Queensland will absorb 65 per cent. . If the other States will act similarly, a very small amount will be required for compensation. amount for the purpose is already voted. We should, insure that these employees shall receive an amount which will be an incentive to them to earnestly seek for employment elsewhere. We must enable them to make strong efforts to gratify their ambitions in life and to make progress. When once the incentive to progress is destroyed, life follows a downward track. Surely no honourable member wishes to place any of these employees in such a position that they will feel too disheartened to make any effort to retrieve their position. valued-service that they have rendered to the community, we should pay them adequate compensation.

It would appear, however, that no consideration is to be given to men in the lower ranks of the Service.

The action of the Government in this matter demonstrates that they are prepared' to advance the in terests of those who have, at the expense of those who have not. I trust, however, that the Treasurer will show a l it t l e mare consideration for the claims of these deserving public servants, many of whom will find it exceedingly difficult to obtain outside employment, Surely the Minister realizes that unless the amendment is agreed to grave injustice will be done to men, many of. whom, from life-long experience in public departments, are u n In view of the fitted for competition in the outside business world.

The definition clause states that ""DefenceA c t "" means the Defence Act 1903-1918. The Air Force Act is defined as "" An Act to provide for the discipline and regulation of the Ai r Force,"" being .the Army Act modified in accordance with the provisions of the Air Force (Constitution) Act 1917. It will be remembered that, when discussing this subject before, I pointed out .quite clearly, and it was generally accepted, that the Air Force Act in Great Britain incorporated the Imperial Army Act, and that for all purposes they were one and the same. The Minister, instead of bringing the ^Australian Air Force under the Imperial Air Force Act, is bringing it under the provisions of the Imperial Army Act in time of war, and, as all honourable members know, the Imperial Army Act contains provisions to which we strongly object. Clause3 of the Bill provides(3) The Defence Act (except Part XV . thereof) and the regulations thereunder, shall, with certain modifications and adaptations as are prescribed . . . apply in relation to the Air Force and. the members thereof, whether serving within or outside the limits of the Commonwealth.

This is a very important matter, and it passes my comprehension, in view of the discussion on. the first of these Bills introduced, that the Government cannot establish an Australian Air Force without embodying in the Bill for the purpose the provisions of the Army Act. Section 20 of the Defence Act of 1917 readsSection 78 of the principal Act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead:' . "" 78.

When I looked at the B ill first I thought there was not much in it , but when I looked into it more closely I discovered what I have now placed before the House. Clause3 in this B ill is, with the exception of the omission of a few words, the same as a clause in the first A i r ForceB ill that was introduced. Whilsti n this measure there is no direct reference to the BritishA r my Act, it is indirectly incorporated by the incorporation of our Defence Act of 1917. Minister would be well advised to drop this B ill or amend it in such a way as to provide for a purely Australian Force subject only to Australian legislation. [7.12 a.m.] I have listened to the Leader of the Opposition, and am right in his contention ' that under this B ill the A i r Force would be subject to the British Army Act. know that honourable members opposite differ from me in the matter, but I do [136] not think there is anything objectionable in any part of our Forces coming under the British ArmyA c t . I know it was the intention of the Ministerf o r Defence and of the Government to submit a short B ill providing for the establishment of an A i r Force which should be subject in no way to the A r m y Act. We have too much drafting of measures by legal men, and it is very hard indeed for laymen to follow their meaning. A layman could d r a f t a B ill which an ordinary individual could understand at a glance. I know from previous debates that a majorit y in this House, and I believe a majorit y of the people outside; are against the incorporation of the A r m y Acti n our legislation. . There should be no trouble in overcoming the difficulty by inserting some provision to say that. ' the A r m y Act shall not apply to the A i r Force. I hope that that w ill be done, and that the House w ill pass the B ill so that the A i r Force w ill be established, because we have some very good men who will not continue in our. service indefinitely unless there is a prospect of their permanent employment. a.m.] I am glad to know that it is f u l ly realized by honourable members on both sides that the B ill recently presented for discussion in this Chamber was objectionable by reason of its incorporation of the A r m y Act. The Government having promised us a B ill which would be free from that objectionable characteristic, I do not suppose it would in a devious way impose a measure upon us which would be a repetition of .the B ill which was so objectionable to honourable members on both sides. TheB ill , in one of its provisions, The clearly adopts the DefenceA ct in globo, with the exception of Part 15 of the Act. The Minister referred to section 54A of the DefenceA c t of 1903-18, which reads54A. (1) Members of the Military Forces, .whether on war service or not(a) serving with Imperial Forces outside Australia; or (6) on their way from Australia for the I purpose of so serving; or inclined to think that he is (c) on their way back to Australia after -so serving or after war service, shall be deemed to be on war service and shall be subject to the Army Act as if they were I part of His Majesty's Regular Land Forces, with such modifications and adaptations as are prescribed.",109,Second Reading

The simplest way to meet the objection is to make the position clear, either by an affirmative amendment or by dropping the clause, and I suggest that it would be better to delete the clause altogether. by the Minister, the object js merely to place the separate existence of the A i r Force on a legal basis. that statement was the promise that we were later to have a detailed B ill for thought it sufficient to establish the A i r Force without incorporating in this measure our .own Defence Act, since it is a very long Act, and we do not know how far-reaching the B ill may be. I suggest to the Minister that -we should drop the clause u n t il we know the precise meaning of the B ill . not quite sure that our suspicions of this B ill are not well founded. I am somewhat mystified as to why we have adopted the Defence Act, carefully excluding the unimportant part at the end of the Act relating to military colleges, and embodying everything else. If the position is not clarified it w i ll become necessary, of course, to examine this B ill in detail side by side with the Defence Act. has been suggested that the objection might be met later by a provision to this effect: That notwithstanding anything contained in this section the Imperial Act, called the Army Act, and any Acts amending or in substitution for it and for the time being in force, shall not apply to the Air Force. On the face of it , that appears to be sufficient. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [7.23 a.m.] The Minister seems to doubt the correctness of the Leader of the Opposition's interpretation of this B ill , and its relation to the DefenceA c t . The better plan would be to delete sub-clause 3 of clause 3, and then there would be no doubt about it . Sub-clause 3 says that the Defence Act (except Part XV . thereof) shall apply to this B ill . Then, in the definitions, it is stated that the Defence ActI take it that that is the view means the DefenceA c t 1903-18. That shows plainly that the whole of the Defence Act, leaving out Part XV . , applies to this B ill . I am prepared to accept the opinion of the Leader of the Opposition. If he is prepared to agree to the amendment offered by the Minister, I shall have no objection to it . But I should have preferred to delete sub-clause 3 of clause 3. for Defence) [7.28 a.m.] I do not want honourable members to be under the impression that I have been trying to side-step my promise to them. I remind honourable As already stated members that there are three forces-the A i r Force, the Military Force, and the Naval Force. The forces referred to in Coupled with the Defence Act, having relation to the Imperial Acts, are the Military and Naval Forces. Provision is made in the discussion, but I should have DefenceA c t that the Military Force, in certain circumstances, shall come under certain provisions of the A r m y Act. It also provides that, in certain circumstances, the Naval Force shall come under the Naval Discipline Act. Neither of these two Acts refer to the Australian A i r Force, nor to the A i r Force of England. I am Those Acts will be inoperative as far as the three forces as a whole are concerned, because they relate to either the Military Force or the Naval Force.

The British Parliament passed an I m It perial A i r Force Acti n the same way as we did when we constituted a separate force, which Act, of course, embodied nearly all the provisions of the ArmyA c t and adapted them to the A i r Force, but a separate Act was necessary. of the A r m y Act automatically affects the ImperialA i r Force Act.

We might have included in this Bill all the provisions of the Defence Act that are applicable to the Air Force, but as this is only a temporary measure and the Air Force has, up to the present time, been working under the Defence Act, I thought it better to provide in this Bill merely for the constitution of the Air Force, and to carry on under the Defence Act by reference until a comprehensive measure can be brought down. XV. of the Defence Act is excluded, because, otherwise, the Air Force officers Would be required to go through Duntroon Military College, and that is not desirable. In order to make the Bill as simple as possible, it has been drafted in this way, and its general effect is to continue the Air Force under the Defence Act as heretofore. The only extra provisions arethose duly constituting the Air Force and rendering it unnecessary for officers to pass through Duntroon College. But, in order to meet the view of the Leader of the Opposition, I shall be prepared to move, in Committee, an amendment to specifically provide that the Imperial Army Act shall not apply to the A i r Force.

Surely a Bill could have been drafted which would have stated in its own clauses all that the Government desires done. extended the Bill to about eighty or ninety clauses. the word of the Government as to what this sub-clause means. Is anybody so foolish as to think that an A i r Force can be established by a Bill of three clauses? The original A ir Force Bill which was Part withdrawn contained over \100 clauses. It is clear, therefore, that it is necessary to embody the provisions of the Defence Act, some of which would be eliminated if the House had a chance of voting on them to-day. How can there be parliamentary control under a sub-clause such as this? I have read the A ir Force Act, which distinctly says that any amendment of the Army Act automatically applies to the A i r Force Act; and under this clause the Defence Act, which embodies the Army Act, may be modified and adapted in such a way as to bring the Australian Air Force under the I m perial Air Force Act. the ImperialA i r Force Act in the Defence Act.

The advances by the Commonwealth Bank are not different from ordinary advances, and the time is fast approaching when the whole of the business of the Commonwealth Government will be dealt with by the Commonwealth Bank. a.m.] I am disappointed with the Bill. Although the Prime Minister states that the wheat operations are partly to be financed by the Commonwealth Bank, still it is not specifically stated so in the Bill. By way of interjection he said that other banks would assist to finance the scheme. We on this side consider that there is no necessity to bring in Other banks when we have the Commonwealth Bank, with the whole of the resources of Australia behind it . There is absolutely no need to go outside the sphere of the Commonwealth Bank to financethe Wheat Pool.

There is to-day a great deal of dissatisfaction among the secondary industries of New South Wales owing to the price of wheat for home consumption being higher than that charged for wheat for shipment overseas. consequence the Australian milling trade has been seriously hampered. A properly managed Commonwealth Wheat Pool would not allow of this position. W it h a number of voluntary Pools the competition for available markets will tend to cut prices and to lessen the returns to the growers; but a compulsory Pool under unified control, would limit competition and increase the price obtained for the product. to have a guarantee in good seasons, but we are likely to face a critical period within the next twelve months, when the price of wheat may not be sufficient to cover the cost of production. It is then that every resource at the disposal of the Commonwealth should be used to safeguard the interests of the primary producers. We have had ample evidence to prove that we cannot possibly produce wheat at a less cost than 4s. per bushel, and in giving a guarantee of 3s. 8d. per bushel the Government are throwing the responsibility of any loss upon the shoulders of the primary producers. that the producers will get only 3s. 8d. that the guarantee w ill not be more than 3s. 8d. If the guarantee does not cover the cost of production it might just as well be Is. 3d. or Is. 6d. We maintain that this guarantee of 3s. 8d. per bushel is of no practical use to the man on the land. The argument was brought forward that if the wheat guarantee were made 4s. a bushel any loss would have to be met out of Consolidated Revenue. I remind honourable members that a Tariff duty is imposed to protect an industry which is a direct charge on the earnings of the people. The people' have to pay for the Tariff: but they do that willingly, in order that our industries may be maintained. The Country party do not believe in the Tariff, but still they exerted pressure on the Government to pass several Bounty Bills to assist secondary industries, and of course those grants were taken out of Consolidated Revenue? ber favour meeting any loss on Pools out of the Consolidated Revenue? favour'of making good losses that are due to inefficiency. But there is no evidence that the farming industry to-day is not In efficiently managed. The evidence of the Commission appointed to inquire into that matter reported, that wheat could not be produced year by year under 4s. per bushel. Honourable members objected to a guarantee of 4s. because, as they said, any loss sustained would have to be met out of Consolidated Revenue. The purpose of a guarantee is that if a loss is sustained the primary producer Of course, it is not necessary shall be safeguarded. Such protection is on all-fours w i th Customs duties for the protection of the manufacturing industries. It is a remarkable fact that the so-called representatives of the primary producers in this Chamber who are prepared to vote for bounties for the secondary industries are not ready to support the giving of similar assistance to tbe man upon the land. TheB ill provides that if certain conditions of the guarantee given to the banking corporation are not observed the Treasurer of the Commonwealth may be relieved of all liability thereunder. I do not know that it is competent for ' t h e Commonwealth to contract itself out of a liability.

The reason for these amendments, I understand, was to register the objection by the Senate to the proposed erection of a provisional Parliament House, instead of the nucleus of the permanent parliamentary buildings at Canberra. This question was fully debated in this House on the report and recommendation of the Public Works Committee, and after full discussion it was decided that the better course to pursue would be to proceed with the provisional manent structure to be undertaken at a future date. The Minister for Works had not noticed and Railways( Mr Stewart) advanced adequate reasons why, from every point of view, and particularly from the standpoint of economy, this course was preferable to the recommendation made by the Public Works Committee. As a result of the debate, honourable members came to the conclusion that the provisional building should be erected.

There is also another side to this question. If Parliament decides to proceed with the erection of the permanent Parliamentary buildings, it will be necessary to suspend all operations in the Capital territory, and immediately to take steps for a world-wide competition for the design of a monumental building, and the House has, however, already decided that the Capital shall be removed at the earliest possible date. There is also the question of finance, which I do not propose to go into at length now, but we have to remember that a commencement of the nucleus of the permanent structure would place upon the people of Australia very heavy financial obligations. It is obvious that we could not be content with the nucleus of the building; we should have to continue with the building programme, and, consequently, the Commonwealth would be involved in the-expenditure of a very large sum of money which, in the present state of the finances, should, if possible, be avoided. We have to remember also, that in the design for the permanent, Parliamentary building, accommodation may have to be provided for a much larger number of members than we have at the present time. For these reasons, I move That the amendments be disagreed to. I welcome the action of the Senate. This subject was by no means fully discussed in this House when the recommendation of the Public Works Committee was before it. It was one of those matters that had to go through because, in fhe special circumstances of the debate, it was felt that about the only thing to do was to pass. the proposal put before us. Surely honourable members recognise the pretence that lies behind this idea of a provisional Parliament House. For a long time the question was, whether a temporary or a permanent Parliamentary building should be erected. Then some one conceived the bright idea of suggesting a "" provisional "" Parliament House, "" provisional "" -being something which had all the advantages of a temporary building, in that it was cheap, and all the advantages of a permanent structure, in that it would last for ever. Without the slightest consideration of the plans, this House solemnly decided not to accept the report' placed before it, but determined that a structure, to be described as a provisional Parliamentary building, should be -erected in front of the site for the permanent Parliament House, so that the permanent Parliament House would have the disadvantage of looking into the outbuildings of the provisional parliamentary building. member is reflecting upon the decision of the House. flecting upon a decision with which I do not agree. We recognise that the bargain made by New South Wales, that the capital city shall be in that State, has to be carried out, but most people in Australia now regret that the Federal Parliament is going to move to a place which, in itself, is a very fine site, but which is hopeless as a Seat of Government. Yet, as the work has to go on, we should not waste a considerable sum of public money by erecting what has been described as a provisional building. Why should we not accept the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, and proceed with the erection of the permanent structure? I am prepared to support a motion for expenditure upon the construction of the nucleus of the permanent parliamentary buildings. I cannot support a motion for the building of a provisional, but which I regard as a "" temporary-permanent,"" Parliament House. I hope the Committee will accept the amendment made by the Senate. a.m.] I feel confident that when he is older the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) will be very sorry for many things which he has said in his youth. The honourable member seems to have taken umbrage at the decision of the House with regard to the recommendation of the Public Works Committee. The erection of national public buildings like the Parliament House is usually spread over a long period of time. The British House of Commons, I believe, was seventy or' eighty years in the building. Many of the fathers of my old schoolfellows were engaged as apprentices on that building, and were still working on it in their old age. The Parliament House at Ottawa also took a long time to erect, and we know the history of the Capitol at Washington.

The trend of Australian politics is every day in the direction of Unification. and the abolition of State Parliamentary institutions, so.it is quite likely that within the next decade or two there will be a substantial addition, to the number of members of this Parliament.

I think that if we make proper representations to the Senate, and honourable senators are informed.that an overwhelming majorit y in this House supports the proposal, they w ill give way. The Prime Minister was hardly correct in what he said, because I believe that to rbuild the nucleus of a permanent building would be found to be the most economical course to adopt in the end. I should like to direct the attention of the Ministerf o r Works and Railways and those connected w it h the construction of big works in Australia to the extraordinary conditions connected w i th the erection of buildings in the Commonwealth.

It is a large saving when one considers the number of poles erected for every 100 miles. money to meet the requests for telephonic facilities, and the shorter poles will greatly cheapen the work. A saving of £20 per mile will mean a great, deal to the country people. A t one time.

Another way in which people in the country districts can be further assisted is in regard to the maximum cost of a line for which a guarantee is not required. A t present the amount is £1,500, but I think that I agree might be extended to £2,500 or £3,000. That would enable the Department to build much longer lines without calling upon the persons benefiting to guarantee any proportion of the cost of the service. I have in mind many places, 30 miles or I trust more from the nearest post-office, which -require telephone lines.

It is true that there are only about forty settlers at Byfield, but they are cut off from civilization, and I am glad that recently, as a result of representations I was able to make to the Postmaster-General, approval has been given for the erection of a line of cheaper construction.

( B y leave.)I move That the report of the Committee appointed by the Commonwealth Government to inquire into the value of the late Mrs. Ellis Rowan's collection of paintings be printed. I am taking this course to give the House an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon the report, and upon the action that should be taken by the Government in connection with the proposed purchase of the pictures.' proposal, the Premier of New South Wales, in February, 1921, introduced a deputation to Sir Joseph Cook, which urged that the Commonwealth should purr chase tbe pictures, the value of which was stated to be about £21,000. On the 27th July, 1922, the then Prime Minister said, "" If the House approves of the purchase of the collection the -Government w i ll acquire it at a reasonable price."" In the House of Representatives on the 12th October, 1922, Mr Massy Greene, then Minister for Defence, movedThat this House approve of the purchase, upon such terms as may be arranged, of the late Mrs. Ellis Rowan's collection of' paintings, depicting bird and flower life in Australia, Papua, and New Guinea. Mr Massy Greene explained that the original price asked for the whole collection was £21,000. He addedThe Government will endeavour to carry the negotiations through to a conclusion; but -if that be possible-it will not acquire them until Parliament has had an opportunity of deciding definitely upon the matter of the actual purchase price. Greatly divergent views have been expressed as to the merits of the pictures from both the scientific and artistic point of view. An advisory committee consisting of Mr G. F . Mann, director of the SydneyA r t Gallery (chairman); Professor A . A . Lawson, Professor of Botany, Sydney University; Mr John. Longstaff, and MrW ill Ashton was appointed by the Commonwealth Government to report on the collection. That committee saidAfter a careful and detailed examination of the entire collection, the Committee is unanimous in its opinion that the collection would have great historical, artistic, educational, land scientific value if the drawings were suitably framed, glazed, and labelled, and placed in such a position as to be available to the public. ' It recommended that the collection together w i th the copyrights pertaining thereto, be acquired for the nation. The. reasons for the recommendation were set out at length. In a supplementary report, made at the request of the Government, the Committee stated that they could not take the responsibility of recommending the purchase of the Australian and New Guinea works, numbering 952, for a sum exceeding £2,000. Efforts have been made over a long period to sell the collection. In 1918 Mr. G. D . Meudell applied for permission to In connection w it h this for m a company w it h a capital of £10,000 to deal w i th a collection of 328 pictures of New Guinea birds. Mrs. Rowan was to receive £2,500 from the company and 5,500 £ 1 shares. No business apparently resulted Sir George Fuller, at a deputation, said Mrs. Rowan was prepared to take £6,000 in cash, and the remainder in the for m of property in Papua worth another £6,000. In November, 1922, it was stated that Miss Ryan (the late Mrs. Rowan's sister) would accept £10,000 cash, or £5,000 in cash, and a pension of £500 per annum. The late Prime Minister stated in the House of Representatives on the 29th November, 1921I , however, am not going to offer Mrs. Rowan £2,000 for her life's work. If the House thinks that we should acquire these paintings, we should offer Mrs. Rowan a fair price for them. She has asked £20,000 for the collection. Whether that is fair or not, I am unable to say; but an offer of £2,000 would obviously be absurd. In January, 1-923, a business committee was formed for the purpose of reporting to the Government as to the value of the pictures. The Committee consisted of Alderman the Hon. William Brooks, M . L . C . , nominated by Miss Sarah Hynes, representing Mrs. Rowan's executrix; Mr JamesK e l l , deputy governor, Commonwealth Bank; Mr J"". R. Collins, secretary to the Treasury. Messrs. Kell jand Collins, representing the majority of the Committee, reported as follows: In letters written to the Commonwealth Government by various persons, reference has frequently been made to an American offer for the collection. We questioned Miss Hynes closely as to this, and learned that Mrs. Rowan had written to ia friend in America describing her work, and saying the collection was worth at least £10,000. The friend replied that, when Mrs. Rowan had finished with the pictures, the friend would buy them. This was not a definite offer to buy, and we cannot regard the matter as in any way indicating the value of the collection. The letter was not produced.",128,Commonwealth Offices I N Brisbane

She was a very remarkable woman, a little f r a i l creature, possessing an abundance of energy, and of remarkable gifts.

Parliament should not miss the opportunity of purchasing this magnificent collection. Miss Ryan, sister of Dr. Charles Ryan, is a sister of the late Mrs. Rowan. She is in anything but affluent circumstances, and I understand that she would benefit by the purchase by the Commonwealth of the late Mrs. Rowan's collection.

The reason why I think it desirable that they should be acquired is not because of their value as examples of the painter's art, but because of their value from an educational stand-point. Many of them would be extremely useful to students.

I noticed that many of the pictures were priced at sums varying from 15 to 150 guineas. rapidly, there were very few left, and the pictures I wanted were absolutely unprocurable. That is a fair guide to their value. There are nearly 1,000 pictures in the collection, and an average price of £10, which would be a very low valuation indeed, would mean a total value of £10.000. The Rowan collection is not offered as a collection of pictures, but as a national collection of special value to the student, and the pictures were painted with the idea that they should be acquired by the Commonwealth as a national collection for Australia by Mrs. Rowan, whose love for her country and its birds and flowers was unbounded. her artistic life to the work of reproducing faithfully, in colour, the flowers and bird life of Australia. That was the ambition and dream of her life. I am not prepared to say what the actual value of the Rowan collection of pictures is, but I am sure that £5,000 is very much less We have than its value. » I understand that the executrix of Mrs. Rowan is anxious that the Commonwealth ' should make this purchase, and I submit that it is too late now to discuss the question whether the purchase should be made, because the House has already committed itself to the purchase by a resolution which was passed that the purchase be made subject to terms being arrived at satisfactory to both parties. I understand that it was purI suant to that resolution that the Committee was appointed whose report we have just heard from the Treasurer. It It is very difficult indeed to seems to me that we are bound by our resolution, and it is now merely a simple question' of terms. ' As the Committee referred to has suggested that the sum of £5,000 should be paid for the collection, I submit that that would be a fair price to offer, and I shall have much pleasure in supporting that proposal. is a well-known principle that a new Parliament is not bound by any decision of its predecessors. If the fact that the last Parliament passed a resolution in favour of the purchase of the collection were the That was for a very only argument in its favour, it would be a matter for consideration. I am not an artist or a judge of artistic work, but, They were selling very looking at the Rowan collection exhibited in the Queen's Hall, I have to admit that the pictures struck me as distinctive and beautiful. When we are told that, in the opinion of some artists, the collection is not a valuable one, I have only to say that artistic values and ideas of art change. Many an artist whose name is to-day revered throughout the world, was, in his lifetime, comparatively unknown. I have in mind one, who perished in the streets of Amsterdam, and who, in his last days, earned his living as a public-house artist and by painting pictures on the footpaths. He is to-day regarded as one of the greatest artists who ever lived, and the value of his pictures is She devoted the whole of estimated in millions. The great pity in",131,Rowan Collection

If any one asked me whether I would be prepared to vote £10,000 to purchase these pictures, I would say ""Yes,"" not merely because of their value as pictures, but as a mark of appreciation which this country is willing to pay to this woman of unflinching courage who suffered in health and strength in order to be able to present to her country representations of its flora and fauna, and something of their beauty in their natural surroundings. I do not wish to occupy time unnecessarily. these pictures is dead, and any purchase of them now will be merely an appreciation of her work by those who have reaped the results of her labour. the jungles of New Guinea, which no white man had previously penetrated, is a proof of her courage. from the value of her beautiful pictures, there is the object lesson, which she presents, of what an artist has accomplished. These pictures should be purchased as a national collection. In Holland to-day, the people would not permit a Rembrandt picture to go out of the country. would be regarded as a crime to export it. which was the lifework of Mrs. Rowan in a similar way, and it should be purchased to mark our appreciation of a great woman. I do not think that long speeches are necessary on this matter. the extreme divergence of opinion amongst artists themselves as to the value and excellence of pictures: "" Cubist"" and the "" Vorticist,"" and while a "" Vorticist"" picture may, in the opinion of some, appear to be a representation of a 'bus in a London street with the D.T.'s, and a "" Cubist"" head may look to others like a number of Hansards after an all night sitting, there are people who will eagerly and seriously discuss the merits of these extraordinary pictures. I have seen some of Mrs. Rowan's pictures, and I thought them beautiful. I am not much concerned about art. I appreciate that which pleases me, and if a picture does not please me I have no time for it. But these pictures did please me. I thought they were beautiful. I have spoken of them to people who have been to New Guinea, and I know a good deal of the Australian bush and Australian birds myself, and I felt that I was able to look at these pictures' and express an opinion about them. Notable artists have deliberately stated that the Rowan collection is worth only so much, but we have had notable artists recently criticising the artistic works of a gentleman who, I should say, is the black-and-white artist of this century, and that is Norman Lindsay. His work has been condemned by The woman who painted men occupying high positions in the world of art, but when it came to the question whether Norman Lindsay should send his pictures to London, or not, they were more intolerant, shall I say, than the members of the Government when they ' apply the guillotine to our debates.

If that Parliament desired to take the responsibility for the purchase We should regard the collection of the Rowan collection it was very easy to do it, but it is to my mind very objectionable that a Parliament should have agreed to a resolution approving the purchase without naming the price, and should expect a subsequent Parliament to regard itself as bound by such a resoWe know lution. merely wish to say that I was a We have the member of the last Parliament, and I regard myself as, to some extent, bound by the resolution which it passed.

Many of them are handling explosivesa dangerous occupationand yet are receiving only lis . or 12s. per day.

I am informed thatCertain employees at Swan Island are paid at tbe rate of 12s. per day, which is above the rate fixed by the Federal Arbitration Court for labourers in these districts. The decision on the matter was based on the fact that the men concerned were not engaged as storcmen, or to work in a naval store, but as casual labourers on unskilled labourers' work, similar to that of municipal employees, whose award rate is l is . 6d. per day.

Bill returned from the Senate, with the message that the Senate had agreed to the amendment of the House of Representatives on its amendment. surer) [5.5] I move That this House places on record its deep gratitude to the International Health Board (Rockefeller 'Institute) for its generous and peace unequalled by any other monument valuable assistance in connection with the public health of the Commonwealth. I should like to couple with the motion the names of Dr. Lanza, Dr. Sawyer, and Colonel Longley, who have done work of such incalculable value in connection with the investigation of ankylostomiasis or the hookworm disease, in the endeavour to abolish it from the tropical parts of the Commonwealth. The Rockefeller Institute, through the International Health Board, has given to the Commonwealth extremely generous assistance indeed. Board undertook to contribute approximately £33,000, and a trained supervisory staff to determine the prevalence of hookworm in Australia and its dependencies, and to inaugurate a system for the permanent control of the disease. Subsequently, upon the condition that the Commonwealth established a Ministry of Health, the Board undertook to furnish an expert adviser in each of the fields of tropical hygiene, industrial hygiene, sanitary engineering, and laboratory administration. We have now had the advantage of the presence for two years of the three gentlemen whom I have named, and already the Commonwealth has profited enormously from their preunanimous concurrence of honourable sence and advice. I think it fitting that members in the resolution. the House should place on record its appreciation of the work done by the institute for the uplift of humanity in such a noble and generous fashion. By the charming courtesy of the Leader of the Opposition, I am permitted to second the motion. I brought this matter under the notice of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), and I think it is only fair that this House should recognise this last and splendid effort of the United States of America to show their desire to assist us as a younger brother of the great comity of the British race. I could, if time were not very precious, give members reasons to look upon the civilization of America as being, possibly, the highest at the present time existing in this world. On a frontier of 3,500 miles, beyond which live the people of another strong nation of British stock, she maintains not one single soldier. She is the first nation of which such a thing could be said, and the fact is a monument to throughout the wide world. The return of indemnities to China and Japan also illustrate America's greatness. As for the dread hookworm disease which the International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation is endeavouring to control, its effects are but too apparent in the difference between two members of a family of whom one is affected with the disease and the other free from it. The unaffected person will be physically and mentally the superior; even where if the cases are those of children, he At the outset, the may be three years the younger. Remembering that each of the parasites takes at least one drop of blood from the human system, the deteriorating effects of the disease on the unfortunates whom it attacks can easily be understood. For the knowledge imparted by the scientific institute of the Rockefeller Foundation, with whom the three splendid men mentioned by the Treasurer are associated, we are much indebted. I feel sure that if we are generous in the means we take for the preservation of the public health, we shall be able to entirely eradicate this fell disease. toThat the vote of appreciation just carried be conveyed by Mr Speaker to the Rockefeller Institute. surer) [5.9] Mr Speaker, in movingThat the House do now adjourn, I should like to express the appreciation, which I am sure all members of the",137,Bills Returned From Th E Senate

We regret very much that our Chairman of Committees, Mr Bamford, has been stricken with illness. We hope, however, that he may soon recover. It may be some consolation to him to know that he left with us a sufficient number of Deputy Chairmen to see us through the work of this strenuous session, and that they discharged their duties faithfully and well. In regard to the officers, I can honestly say that I know of no men who have worked harder during the strenuous times through which we have passed. Probably they feel the strain more than we do, because they are in the chamber all the time. A better staff could not be found anywhere. As for the Hansard reporters, they also have had a difficult task during the past few weeks. Frequently I wonder how members of the Hansard staff manage to keep up. The work this session has been very trying for them. In regard to the attendants and messengers, of which you, sir, have control, I do not think there could be a better staff. They do everything they can to assist us. During the past few days they have felt the strain of the long sittings, but never once have I heard a complaint from one of In conclusion, and on them. As for the press, I can only say that, although they criticise us freely, personally I have to thank those who attend in our press galleries.

As we are not likely to meet again before Christmas, I wish one and all a happy Christmas and a bright New Year. -Before submitting the motion, I might be permitted to say to the House that I am deeply sensible of the kindness evidenced in the remarks of the honourable the Treasurer and the honourable the Leader of the Opposition.
