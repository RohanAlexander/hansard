On receiving this intimation, it became my duty to decide whether the course proposed to be taken would be in order. The parliamentary practice on the subject is stated on page 241 of the Tenth Edition of May, and I shall read, for the information of the honourable member and the House, the passage which is applicable to this motion. May saysThe Speaker is bound to apply to these motions the established rules pf debate, and to vent the moving of two motions for the enforce the principle that subjects excluded by those rules cannot be brought forward thereon; stantially with the same matter if they such as a matter under adjudication by a Court of law, or matters already discussed during the current session, whether upon a previous motion tor adjournment, upon a substantive motion, upon an amendment, or upon an order of the day. Honourable members will perhaps recollect that the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) moved the adjournment of the House on Thursday, 5th July, after .giving notice of his intention to do BO, in terms substantially to the same effect as .that of those contained in the notice of the honourable member for Capricornia. That nptice is recorded in the Votes and Proceedings of the House for that day. In the circumstances, I feel obliged to rule that the notice of motion submitted by the honourable member for Capricornia cannot be accepted by the Chair, as its discussion is precluded by the practice of Parliament aB laid down in May, ablp member for Herbert moved the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussingThe unsatisfactory position in which the sugar industry is placed owing to the proposed Again, the honourable member believes that arrangement under which the price of raw sugar will be reduced to £27 per ton, and the placing of an embargo of only two years upon the importation of foreign sugar. The honourable member for Capricornia .proposes to move the adjournment in order to discussThe unsatisfactory treatment meted out to the sugar industry by tbe Commonwealth Government and the advisability, even at this late hour, to grant the sugar-growers £27 net per ton for raw sugar and an embargo for -five years upon black-grown sugar instead of two years, as already arranged. I submit that there is a difference between the two motions, though it may be argued that they are the same in substance. The Mr Speaker. motion of the honourable member for Herbert dealt with the question of an embargo for two years, but the honourable member for Capricornia, in consequence of information received from people interested, contends that it is necessary that the embargo should be extended. It is because of the.urgency of the matter that the honourable member wishes to bring it before the House at the present juncture. This is a very urgent matter in the opinion of the sugar-growers of Queensland. There IB nothing in our Standing Orders to preadjournment of the House to deal subare submitted on different days. I admit that you, sir, are guided by May's Parliar mentary Practice,. bnt I think you will admit that there is some distinction between the motion moved by the honourable member for Herbert and that proposed by the honourable member for Capricornia. The first dealt with the proposal made by the'Prime Minister, which provided for a price of £27 per ton and an embargo for two years. The honourable member for Capricornia wishes to discuss quite another matter. He desires to contend that £27 per ton net shall be paid for raw sugar to the grower instead of £27 per ton gross, ""which, when charges for . freight and other charges are deducted, would leave the growers .only £26 per ton. The honourable member for Herbert did not put that aspect of the matter before the House, and the honourable member for Capricornia proposes to break entirely new ground. It is found that the sugar growers would get something less than £27 per ton, and the honourable member proposes to show why they should get £27 per ton, .aB intended by the 'Government. the sugar-growers are not given sufficient protection by a two years', embargo on black-grown sugar, and proposes to B&OW that the embargo should be extended to five years. In the circumstances, I do' not think that it is quite right to prevent the discussion. It is not as if it would be wasting the time of the House, because this is a matter of grave importance to the people engaged in the sugar industry. I ask, sir, that you reconsider your decision. due respect to what the honourable",13,Paper

I that the verbiage' of ""the two is precisely identical, but the field which might be covered and the matters which might be dealt with by each are identical, and that must determine my ruling. honourable member for Herbert used arguments different from those which the honparts of Queensland putting new phases orable member for Capricornia proposes to submit is not the concern of the Chair. It is upon the form and substance' of the notices of motion that the Chair must rule. The fact that we have no Standing Orders on the subject does not invalidate the ruling, nor does it affect the authority by moving the adjournment of the House of the Chair to decide the question, because, as the honourable member for H u nter knows, under the first of our Standing Orders all matters not provided for by them are to be dealt with according to the practice of. the House of Commons. That practice is stated definitely and clearly in the Tenth Edition of May, from which I have quoted. I , therefore, cannot vary my ruling, or allow the motion to be moved. be discussed; but, with the indulgence of the House, the honourable member may speak. (Hy leave.)-Of course, I must bow to your ruling in this matter, but I regret that I have not been permitted to move the adjournment of the House on this very important question. It was my intention to contend for something different from what the . honourable member for Herbert proposed. Although that honourable member moved the adjournment of the House to discuss the sugar industry, he did not fight the Government. said he was satisfied with the price offered by the Commonwealth Government, but desired the embargo on i m ported sugar to be extended for three years. terms, and I intended to make it clear that I considered that the embargo should be for five years, and not two, as proposed by the Government, and the price of raw sugar to the growers £ 2 7 per ten net, and not gross, as proposed by the Government. I said, i u about £ 1 per ton more to the industry, and by effecting certain economies in the intermediate charges bedo not suggest for a moment tween the grower and the consumer, the latter would still be able to obtain sugar at 4$d. per lb. Since the honourable member for Herbert moved his motion I have received .That the certain communications from sugar associations in my electorate and in other of the question. When I consider bhat over 100,000 people are depending on the industry, I regret that the greatest publicity possible cannot be given to this matter, because I recognise that the sugar-growers have a good case. I,hoped to-day that I would be able to p u t certain facts before honourable members which would influence them to vote for a motion on the subject, which I w ill submit later in some other way. I hoped that they would recognise that the sugar growers have not been given a fair deal, and that it would be, not only in their in terests, but in the interests of Australia generally, to give them more generous assistance than has so far been given them by the Government. It is not my intention to question your ruling in any way, but I wish to say that the arguments I proposed to adduce are substantially different fro m those used by the honourable member for Herbert, and the wording of my motion is altogether different from his. 1 cannot but admit that the two motions cover a discussion of the sugar question, but it is a very wide question; it enters into the everyday life of the community, and therefore affects the whole of the people of Australia. I wished to nut my views in order to give honourable members a better knowledge of the case, in order that they may cast an intelligent vote on the question when T bring it forward in another form. HeI regret that I have been denied that opportunity. I shall, however, avail myself of all the privileges I possess in this Housei n order to put up a fight for the sugar interests of Queensland, because I I am not satisfied w it h these consider that they have not been properly treated. An effort has been made to please everybody. The growers, at. any rate, are not pleased. Probably the.

In Committee of Supply: Consideration -August (vide page 2080),, on motion by Dr. That the first item in the Estimates, under Division 1-the Parliament-namely , ""The President, £1,100,"" he agreed ito. -We enter oh the discussion of this, the first, Budget of the '.present Treasurer ( Mr Page), with heavy hearts, and with a vision that is darkened by the fact that he has given no indication of a remission of taxation in the near future. It may be well said that this Budget is a disappointment, and that it is uninspiring. Itpresents a remarkable contrast to the promises made both to this House and to the electors outside when the honourable gentleman and his friends became a distinct party in the Parliament. I well remember the speeches made by the honourable gentleman during the last Parliament. He promised that if ever he became Treasurer there would be a veritable revolution in the methods and in the extent of taxation. The Departments were to be re-organized and everything would work like well-oiled machinery. I regret that the reality is f a r more disappointing than is generally the case. It is said that anticipation is always better than realization. The Budget illustrates the t r u th of that statement. Honourable members on this side predicted that the Country party would not survive in this Parliament, but that it< would be swallowed up by the more astute and more powerful Nationalist organization. A perusal of the Budget shows that the reforms which we who represent country electorates might reasonably emanate from the Country party Leader have, not materialized. It might be argued that criticism is to be expected from honourable members on this side.' But the [81] great organs of publicity which support the Government are amongst its severest critics. Certainly no more severe criti cism could be levelled by the most hostile member on this side than has been levelled at the Treasurer by one of the most influential a^nd responsible financial organs published in Australia. A l though not favorable to the policy of Labour, the A ge is acknowledged to be one of the best written financial newspapers, 1923-24. in Australia. In a leading article extending over three quarters of a column resumed from 2nd this morning the Age most scathingly criticises the Budget and the Treasurer. article on record, because I believe it should .be read f a r and wide throughout Australia, if only to show that inconiT petence is prevalent in the Government. It says: Mr Page's confused and unsatisfactory Budget does not improve on closer examination. The Treasurer's work has fallen far below his election promise, and it is likely, unless tliere be a,n improvement, that .the Government may 'have to consider the wisdom of transferring him to a more congenial department. The Hughes Government's system of finance, which Mr Page 'himself attacked, has 'been continued, and in some respects accentuated. The economy cry of tlie Country party stands for the present as a political joke. When the honourable gentleman's supporters outside find it necessary to take him to task and even to go so f a r as to say that he should be sacked, I suggest that he be placed in charge of War Service Homes, where, probably, his ability w ill have suflicient scope. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN"" ( Mr Watkins) -The Standing Orders provide that no honourable member shall read extracts 'from newspapers or other documents referring to debates in the House during the currency of the session. The honourable member, therefore, is not in order. one of the main statements.' The Age has on its staff responsible financial writers, and, I believe, expresses the opinion of the man in the street. It is even suggested outside that the Treasurer have expected to should withdraw the Budget and resubmit it in a more acceptable form .

24,Mr Cunningham,"I have quotedinstead of endeavouring to re-organize the public departments and give remission of taxation, which at present is a great bar on investment and industry. Before he joined the Government the honourable member for Cowper( D r . Earle Page) .said that he would drastically reform the departments, that the pruning k n i fe would be applied, and that there would be a cessation of wanton and extravagant expenditure. The expenditure proposed this year is not different from what it was last year. I was astounded at the result when I analyzed the figures of the Postal Department in relation to country and city works. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) last night took to task the honourable member for Angas{ Mr Gabb) and the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) because of the figures they quoted in connection w it h city and country works to be constructed out of loan money. The honourable member for Gippsland quoted figures showing that ISO buildings were to be built in the country and 91 in city and suburban areas. That may be correct; but what is the value of those buildings? Many of the works in the country are merely repairs costing £300, £400, £450 and £500. The buildings to be erected in the cities are to cost £1,000, £3,000, £60,000, and so on. The Treasurer represents a country electorate and knows that men in the back blocks are asked time after time to put their hands in their pockets to subsidize mail contracts, for the extension of hours at telephone exchanges and the provision of otherfacilities which the Government should provide. Dr. General( Mr Gibson) w ill show conclusively that more is being given to given by any previous Government. so. These services have been starved to such an extent by. previous Administrations that the expenditure of a large amount of money is required now to put them in the condition in which they ought to be. I remind the Treasurer again that in New South Wales £58,462 is to be spent from loan money oh country post-offices, and £244,429 is to be spent in the metropolitan area. parison? Should not the comparison be between services rendered and not between values? the great disparity .in the expenditure. It is"" abnormal. It should not be nearly five times as great in the city as in the country. In a number of hamlets throughout New South Wales the post office accommodation for the authorities and the public is disgraceful... D r . EABLE PAGE -Should not the city facilities be increased as well as the facilities in the country? can be spent in the city, we say that more should be provided for the country. The. honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr. Paterson). was placed at a disadvantage last night. He had a number of figures thrown at h i m which he endeavoured to explain. The result of his effort may be compared to a half-baked batch of bread. It was indigestible.. He . said that £3,000,000 was to be spent in the current year on telephone services in the country. The real position is that we are providing £4,161,766 from loan moneys and revenue for new works and buildings and telephones. The Budget figures show that about £3,200,000 of that sum is to be spent on new works and buildings. Therefore, no more than £900,000 is available for telephones. D r . EABLEPAGE I think your figures are incorrect. I suggest that the Treasurer should read his own Budget, and he will see that, in spite of what the honourable member for Gippsland said, we can only have about £900,000 for telephones. Honourable appointed that provision has not been made for giving greater facilities in the the country than has beencountry. Drastic alterations should be made in the proposal to reduce the postage rate T h a t may.be before this Committee finally determines the matter. The' Government could not do better than follow the example of the Labour Government which introduced I d . postage for £-oz. letters. The proposal of the Government w ill be of great benefit to the big firms in the city, which will get 4d. worth of mail matter at our present rates for l | d . , and thus be 2^d.

That would be a real benefit to the general community, and also would mean a good deal to the commercial houses. templated in the Postal revenue this year through the proposed alterations in charges. people whom I represent is that it would be preferable to provide better facilities for them tlian to decrease the postage rate. They would prefer three mails a week instead of the two they now get, and they would rather that the mails were carried nearer to their homesteads.' The business of the mail-man is to deliver the mails. The business of this Parliament is to provide money for the delivery of mails. Peoplei n the country would wil lingly continue the present rate of postage if they could have the mails brought nearer and more frequently to them. In. dry periods it is not always convenient for a man to leave his stock and drive two or three miles on the chance of obtaining letters, but he frequently has to do so because important letters may be waiting his attention. has adequate sum for our mail services in the country districts. The Government these services in the back country. I suggest that the Government should confer with Generali n the various States to see what reorganization is desirable. I have the very highest regard for our Deputy Postmasters-General. honestly endeavouring to do the fair thing with the amount of money placed at their disposal. They could say what the needs of the country really are, and, after all, we should consider the real needs of the country. I ask representatives of city constituencies who have trams passing their doors, and who have a fast train service available for their use every few minutes, to think of the position in the back country. I have been in places where, under dry conditions, we could get a mail once a week, but in wet weather we could only get a mail once a fortnight. The supporters of the Government should think of these things. They should break the masterly silence they have preserved during the past few weeks, and, as free and independent men, say what their mind really is about these matters. they have no mind ? mind outside of this Chamber, but, in A decrease of £930,000 is consome miraculous manner, they seem to lose it when they get in here. These men boast that they are not Caucus-ridden, The . general opinion of i the but are free. is being done. the honourable member to explain how and where it is being done. Honourable members on this side would very much like to hear his views, and also the views of others who are behind the Government. We are surprised at the silence they have cultivated lately. They remind me of the Towers of Silence of the Parsees of India, on the top of which are nothing but bones. I s it any wonder that Parliament is brought into contempt when members opposite, act as they do? It is no wonder that the public outside thinks as it does of Parliament when members are as tame as the honourable gentlemen opposite have been in This Parliament the last two weeks. Honourable members the duty of providing an opposite say that the Labour party does nothing but talk. They say this is a talk shop. I ask them what can we do should thoroughly re-organize here but talk. Do honourable members opposite expect us to yoke up a team of .horses to an eight-furrow plough and the Deputy-Postmastersdrive it through this Chamber? I could do it , but this is not the place for work of that kind. If honourable members opposite have any brains, I ask them to give I believe they are us the advantage of those brains. If they have tongues, let us see that those tongues are in working order. Let us see that they are prepared to endeavour to translate into concrete form the ideas of which they are so f u l l outside this Chamber. It is to be^ regretted that the Prime Minister sees fit to close Parliament so soon. The sorry record of this Government will go down in history. This Government has closed Parliament for a longer period than any previous Government which has been in oflice for the same length of time. I do not know that Ministers w ill continue to hold oflice for very longafter their supporters realize the r i d i culous position in which they are placed.

33,Mr Cunningham,"I would likevery little in common between the in terests of Flinders-lane and the country. On reaching that determination he looked for a wider sphere of activity, and the Imperial Conference was arranged. He proposes now to transfer the field of argument from this Chamber to the other side of the world. This Parliament should be sitting to deal with pressing .problems that will arise between now and Christmas. One matter to which we could well give attention is the formation of a compulsory Australian wheat pool, so that the competition between the voluntary wheat pools shall not continue. It suits buyers from the other side of the world to come here and find this competition. Big business has realized the wisdom of concentrating its activities in one place. In that way the best returns are secured. J f that principle is good for big business, I contend that it is good for the selling t>£ our wheat. It would be far more advantageous to the farmers to have one compulsory pool, and to have their selling business handled by men of experience such as could be obtained in Australia to-day. I regret that the Government have not outlined any proposals to encourage small wool-growers to improve their flocks and herds and bring them to the highest possible standard. 'A good deal could be done in that direction by propaganda. The Institute of Science and Industry could also work more vigorously if Parliament provided more money for it . greater number of scientists could be employed to give consideration to the ways and means oferadicating the pests which afflict (.the man on the land. In regard to the meat industry, I at one time was under the delusion some advantage to Australia derived from the periodical Conferences, gatherings forces us to the conclusion that they are held only for the purpose of securing advantages for Great from the Dominions.. the Prime Minister to gain any benefit for Australia Britain. Commonwealth sums of money towards the creation of a naval base at Singapore. I believe that that is the reason for £2,250,000 being placed to a defence reserve fund, so that after the Prime Minister's return a meaMr Cunningham,. sure appropriating that money for the Singapore base may be rushed through Parliament, probably on the ground of an alleged danger in the Pacific. No advantage has ever come to Australia from the Imperial Conferences. All they have done has been to d in it into the ears of Australian parliamentarians that this country must grant preference to British manufacturers. When trade and commerce are at stake the B ritish Cabinet and manufacturers drive a hard bargain. Having regard to the enormous burden of debt that Australia has to carry, I hope that the Prime Minister w ill represent to the Imperial authorities that if they wish to give some earnest of their desire to help the Dominions, they w ill reserve portion of their meat contracts for the Dominions. I do not expect the right honourable gentleman to succeed in that endeavour. During the war large amounts of B ritish capital were invested in the meat industry in South America, and those interests are so powerful in the Imperial Cabinet and Parliament that they w ill take care that nothing is done to interfere w it h their investments. For that reason no advantage to Australia w ill result from the Prime Minister's mission. Eveni f an agreement were reached at these Conferences, it could have little effect, because the -personnel of the present Governments in GreatB r it a in and Australia w ill not long remain in power. It is said that Cabinets are born A only to die; they commence to decline as soon as they are created. I believe the present Commonwealth Ministry w ill be very short-lived; already it shows signs of both infantile paralysis and senile decay. Therefore, any proposals advanced by the that Prime Ministeri n England w ill not carry would be much weight w i th the Imperial authoriImperial ties, as the right honourable gentleman has but the history of these no mandate from the people: The Commonwealth Cabinet was brought into existence by means of parliamentary in Britain trigue and the subversion of principle I do not expect to political expediency, and that fact is known in Great Britain. I regard the from his visit to Great Prime Minister's mission to London as It seems to be his idea that the involving a waste of public .money that should contribute large might be applied more advantageously to the development of Australian industries and the provision of work for our people. The unemployment that is r if e in Australia to-day is no credit to the present Government, some members of whicli made' lavish promises to the soldiers before they went overseas. Heavy income taxation imposed by the Commonwealth is doing a great deal to paralyze industry and to discourage the re-investment of money in reproductive enterprises. It is undeniable that if taxaGreat War there are still so many highlytion is excessive those controlling industry are forced to adopt a conservative' policy; they cannot afford to take any risks in investment lest they be unable to meet their taxation liabilities. did expect some relief after the accession of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) to the' Treasury. During the hectic period when the formation of the Government was being negotiated, and the present Treasurer and his friends were seeking to placate men like the honourable member for Eiverina( Mr Killen), one justification advanced for the coalition with the Nationalists was that i i the honourable member for Cowper was in charge of the Treasury he would grant the people some relief from the burden of taxation. The Budget gives no promise of any remission. With a great flourish of trumpets the Government submitted to the Premiers' Conference a scheme for the more economical collection of taxation, but it has been postponed for twelve months, and I believe that next year it will be further postponed, because it was so unsatisfactory to the State of New South Wales that the State Treasurer declared that he would be unable to meet his obligations without reducing the exemp-, tion to the smaller taxpayers or, alternatively, imposing heavier taxation upon the wealthy classes. In either case it would have a serious effect upon investments and industry. Dr. been contradicted. do not expect the Treasurer, as the promoter of this scheme, to admit the justification of the criticism, but the Treasurer of New South Wales holds the view which has been expressed by honourable members on this side. He said he would have to reduce the exemption to such an extent that his Government could not survive the next election. suggest that during the approaching long recess the Treasurer should seriously consider the granting of relief from the crushing burden of. taxation. Between sixty and seventy pages of these Estimates relate to the Department of Defence, and I am astounded to find that five years after the conclusion of the paid officials in that Department. Immediate re-organization is necessary. The Oommonwealth spent £400,000,000 in connection with the war, a great proporPeople tion of which was applied to the training of several hundreds of thousands of men, of whom the majority will be available * during the next ten years for the defence of Australia if our safety should be threatened. Methods of warfare are changing. In connection with airships, aeroplanes, and submarines, development follows development very rapidly. Money should be provided for experimentation, with these new arms, and the whole defence system should be re-organized along the most modern lines. There is no necessity to continue to employ large staffs of highly-paid officials in the Defence Department. I believe those officials realize that the maintenance of such staffs is quite unnecessary, and causes popular discontent' with the defence policy. I am very pleased to notice one remarkable change in the attitude of the present anti-Socialistic Government. I remember asking the then Acting Prime Minister on one occasion that something should be done by the Commonwealth in regard to the provision of wire netting for men in vermin-infested areas. I was told rather haughtily that wire netting was no concern of the Commonwealth, but was a matter to be dealt with by the States. But I have always held that as these Commonwealth revenue, it is the duty of the Federal authority, if the States are not realizing their responsibility, to go to their assistance. The Commonwealth has greater monetary resources than have the States, and men on the land should not be allowed to go to the wall through no fault of their own, if this Parliament, by the exercise of its financial'power, can save them. I appreciate the provision of I £250,000 for the purchase of wire netting, but I regard that amount as altogether",19,Earle Page Th E Postmaster Members I N This Chamber Are Very Dis

During the last few years the price of wire netting has increased considerably, and a much larger sum must be provided by the Oommonwealth if holdings throughout Australia are to be safeguarded against the rabbit pest. I trust that the Treasurer will realize the necessity for making further sums available for the purchase of wire netting. 24th of' the same month. It is alleged The Estimates disclose that £5,000,000 of loan money and a further £500,000 are to be expended during the coming year upon the encouragement of immigration. The Labour partes attitude in regard to immigration has been continually misrepresented. Honourable members opposite have said that we are opposed to all forms of immigration. ther from the truth. But we do object to men, .who are probably holding in England positions commensurate with their capacity, being induced, by means of highly-coloured pamphlets and specious promises, to come to Australia where thousands of men, including returned soldiers, are unable to secure employment. losing their population, and offer no scope for the new arrivals. There is in Australia a big demand for men with capital, men who have shown themselves to be thrifty in their own country, and who may be expected to contend successfully against nature in all her varying moods. But is it fair to ask the ""deadenders""-the men who have neither trades nor capital-to Great Britain, where they have friends, in order to come to a new country where they will be amongst strangers, where the conditions are entirely strange to them, and where they, will be required to put up with many inconveniences? The Labour party have no objection to as many immigrants as can be brought here, provided they are of the right type, and that provision is made for them before arrival. We should see that the States make available the most suitable land on reasonable and proper terms, and that it is not overloaded with costs before it is occupied, so that there may be a reasonthe medical examination at Home is so able chance for the new settlers. emigrants being brought are, to a large extent, without capital, and without any knowledge 'of the strenuous conditions tiiat have to be met in the back country. Mr Cunwinohnm. In order to show that under the present scheme undesirable emigrants are coming, I draw the attention of the Treasurer, the House, and the people of Australia to the alleged happenings on the Ballarat, which arrived at Sydney on the 23rd July this year, as reported in the Daily Guardian, of that city, on the that there is insufficient medical inspection before emigrants are shipped in London, and that a boy passenger on the, Ballarat hanged himself just after the vessel reached Fremantle. A post mortem examination disclosed that he had suffered from a notifiable and revolting disease, which must have been Nothing could be furcontracted before he left Britain. This was not ascertained at the medical examination, nor would the fact have become known had the boy not committed suicide. The Daily Guardian saysAt the subsequent post-mortem, however, it was officially declared that the lad'had suffered from a filthy disease, contracted apparently long .before the liner left London. The postVery many country towns are mortem finding was a grave reflection on the medical officers in London responsible for selecting new settlers for Australia. The one isolated instance of the revolting disease was' .only divulged through the boy's untimely death, not by the exercise of medical supervision, either in London or on the ship. That is most startling. It is further alleged that many of the emigrants were of an entirely unsuitable type, and the list is given of the trades and occupasurrender positions in tions represented. Farmers and harvesters were few and far between, and unskilled labourers were in the majority. We certainly do not desire an influx of such emigrants. Amongst those brought were kitchen hands, porters, cooks, shop assistants, clerks, typists, butchers, miners, and motor-drivers. With the sole exception, perhaps, of the miners, there was not one class of which we have not more than sufficient already. A miner is a man prepared to go out and rough it, but it is said that even the miners in this lot were not the proper sort. If The cursory as not to discover the state of the unfortunate boy, we may have landed in Australia many to prove a menace to our people. The whole matter requires probing thoroughly, and drastic action should be taken with those at Australia. House who are responsible. Thompson, the welfare 'officer in charge of the Ballarat emigrants, in his statement published in the Daily Guardian, says that the responsibility lies w it h the officials of Australia House. of this contingent of emigrants? is not given, but evidently the vessel was f a i r l y crowded. saysConcerning the immorality among the men and women, Captain Thompson continued, "" I don't think I've ever seen anything to equal it. Many of the women especially seemed to go to hell almost as soon as they were aboard. Captain Hignett and his officers did all they could to curb tlie evil, but it was impossible to post guards day and night to police cabins."" . . . The immigration officials regarded the grave complaints in a serious light. They communicatedwith London immediately to prevent a recurrence. They admitted that on a cursory inspection the contingent of boys was far below the standard of those previously shipped here under the schefm?. Several had been ear-marked as probable causes of annoyance in the near future. A review of the official lists shows that only four bad come from farms among the boys. before they went on board! all this shows the un desirability of the emigrants now being brought here under the scheme of selection at Australia House. nated passengers? it matter whether they were nominated or assisted; they are such emigrants*as should not be brought to Australia.

Captain Thompson said he considered the basic trouble was at Australia HouseThose responsible for the selection of the lads for New South Wales, he said, were drawn from clerks who had no idea of the type required. Isi t f a i r to vote money to promote emigration, and then leave the selection of the emigrant, not to a hardheaded Australian who knows the type required, but to clerks in London? The Government ought to be kicked from office if they allow this disgraceful Captain administration to continue. The newspaper account goes on to say that the emigration officials are ""perturbed,"" and no doubt they are when such ugly facts come to light. If necessary, we should send men of experience and knowledge from Australia to undertake W h a t was the number the work of selection. We do not want penniless emigrants; the cities are f u l l The number of such people, who are of no use to this country. They are not of the The Daily Guardian type to hump a swag, and face the conditions of the back-blocks in the way many of us have had to do. They insist on staying in the cities, and take the view that, as the community brought them here, it is the duty of the community to support them. On the ground of this maladministration alone, we should be prepared to put the Government , out of office, and in saying that I think I express the feelings of every man who has the welfare of Australia at heart. The question may be burked for days, months, or a year or two, but the electors have to be reckoned w it h . Many new faces appeared here after the last election as an evidence of the great discontent w it h the old band of legislators. Time after time during the. last Parliament, we on this side referred ' to the unsuitability A t any rate, of the emigrants brought from Great Britain, and of the mal-administration at Australia House; and the disclosures then made so affected the minds of the public that at the first opportunity they made great changes in the personnel of the Parliament. Unless the new members wish to meet the same fate as that of their predecessors they must show that they are f u l l y alive to the present position. They must not think they have done enough if by their votes here they can ' ' down "" the Opposition; they must safeguard the in terests of the public, or take the consequences. I ask the Treasurer to have the fullest investigation made, and, if necessary, root out the old gang at Australia House. If men are thriftless in Great Britain there is -not much likelihood of them making t h r if t y citizens of Australia, and men with trades, who yet are penniless, have little chance of success here. An emigrant should be called upon to , show that he has at least sufficient money to keep himself for a time, so, that he may not be a burden on the community from the time of his arrival.",21,Earle Page Tha T Statement Has Settlers Are Taxed For The Benefit Of The

I wish to refer now to the administra-' tion of the War Service Homes. Department. Owing to the d r if t of population from the majority of country towns to the cities, it would appear that the Department is not disposed to give facilities for the purchase or erection of homes in country districts. It takes a very long time, and a considerable amount of trouble, to secure authority for the purchase of a home already erected in a country district, and it is absolutely useless building new homes at the presenttime in many of those districts. The establishment of manufactures in the cities and the introduction of modern methods of agriculture have led many people to leave the country districts. Men do not do this merely in order to secure better conditions for themselves, but in a very great many cases because they are thus better able to secure a good education for their children.> I am very pleased to know that we have heard nearly the last of the old idea that what was good enough for the fathers was good T h a t is what I enough for their children.

48,Mr Cunningham,"suggest to the Treasurer that a larger amount of money should be made available for the purchase of homes for soldiers in country districts. For £250 or £300 a returned soldier may secure a wooden building which would be perfectly satisfactory to him. Many of the houses in the country districts are built of cypress pine, which is known as the "" everlasting timber."" would be satisfied with these houses, and their purchase would not involve such heavy expenditure as the purchase or erection of buildings of brick. If adequate insurance was provided for, the Department would run no undue risk because of the greater inflammability of a wooden house. I wish to bring under notice a case *in which the War Service Homes Department has refused to give the assistance which might have been expected from it . It is the case of a returned soldier living at Inverell. I went to school with him, and know him to be one of the most honourable and upright young men in the community. He was given an advance by a private firm in order to build a home, and he desires that the War Service Homes Department should take over his loan. Although he was granted an advance by the hard-headed business members of a private firm, the Department refuses to make him an advance within at least £ 5 0 of that made him by this firm. Inspectors have been sent out who, in my opinion, do not know the district, and they have put a low valuation on the building, which was honestly and f a it h f u l l y erected by day labour. It them to book. is situated not more than half-a-mile from my own home, and within 3 miles of In verell, but the Department persist in saying that the house is in the bush and in an unsaleable position. It is adjacent to the only brick-works in the district, but the Department argues that if this man should die the property would be unsaleable. That is a matter of opinion, and it is certainly not more likely that this 'man w ill die than that members of the War Service Homes Commission will die. The departmental officials may be right in the stand they take up, and I suppose they feel they must be guided by the valuation placed upon the property by their officers, but members of this Parliament are responsible for assisting the returned soldiers. I ask the Treasurer whether he thinks that the Department is justified in refusing to advance to this man, in order that he may secure a home, as much as has been advanced to him by a private firm. It seems to me that this man has not been given a fair deal, and as I have not been able to secure it for him, I ventilate his grievance here in the hope that there will be some alteration of the practice of the Department ii» this regard The returned soldiers MrE . RILEY -The honourable member is speaking not for one man, but for a number of men similarly situated? I speak of the case of a man who is personally known to me. What applies to his case probably applies to hundreds of other cases. This man, through the action of the Department, is being forced to pay a higher rate of interest on his advance than he would have to pay on an advance from the Department. I say that that is not carrying out the intention for which the War Service Homes Department was established. We wish to take the Government to task for their inaction in connection w i th the Kidman-Mayoh contract. A considerable sum of money was paid over to this firm for nothing. These men should have been prosecuted for a criminal act, because if the boats they built for the Commonwealth had been taken to sea their crews would 'have met the same fate as has overtaken the unfortunate crew of the Sumatra. These men have resisted the payment of an award of the court and the Government should bring going as fast as it can in the matter. a bit more petrol and' a new sparking plug. I say that on the evidence which the Government had, this firm should have been prosecuted for a criminal act. I say without hesitation that they were deliberately guilty of an act which would have resulted in the murder of Australian seamen, if the vessels they built had been sent to sea. They should have been made an example of, because the facts in the case reveal a scandalous sta'te of affairs. The ex-Prime Minister( MrW . M . Hughes) said that the firm should be prosecuted, but his enthusiasm in the matter died out and nothing has been done in that direction.

I hope, that the present Government w ill show itself more in earnest in dealing w i th this matter than the last Government.

The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) has shown The railconclusively that the Northern Territory contains a large area of very desirable country, equally as well suited to closer settlement as any portion of Australia.

If we could convince honourable members opposite that our scheme is a good one, and as a united Parliament go to the country on it , we should easily carry the proposals. new States. the kind of States. We should not perpetuate the evils and anomalies of our present system of government. The natural corollary to Federation is a National Parliament with a national spirit. W h y should we take the retrograde step of creating more States with sovereign powers ? We cannot obtain unanimity at present. We should find it much more difficult if we increased the number of States. ' The only place where we can ourselves .create a new State is in the Northern Territory. If we ran a railway to the Territory, and set up an Administration there which would be answerable to the National Parliament, it would be a fine thing. We could give the people of the Territory the right to elect the Administration and conduct their own local affairs. Provision for placing people upon the land would be all that would be necessary then to make the Territory progressive. We are told that that country is eminently suitable for -cotton growing. The immigrants who are coming to Australia from Great Britain will be required to adapt themselves to new conditions. W h y not provide such facilities that we could send them straight to tfie Territory? That would do much to advance the prosperity of Australia. We should break the stranglehold that our present land settlement policy has upon Australia if we made land available in the Territory, and the subsequent development would very soon be reflected in the prosperity of our people. Sitting suspended from 12.5//. to 2.15 p.m, Judging the Budget speech impartially , one must admit that it is very satisfactory, and I congratulate the Treasurer on' having submitted the. Estimates to Parliament so early in the year. It is highly important tihat honourable members should have an opportunity of discussing proposed expenditure for the coming year, before the money has been actually disbursed. Frequently the Budget has been submitted so late in the year that the greater portion of the expenditure had ' been incurred . before Parliament could discuss it , and that fact practically pledged Parliament to the balance of the proposed expenditure. This year, however, we have a chance of carefully examining al l the proposed outgoings while there is still time for our criticism'' to be effective. We must all credit the T h a t is so. Treasurer with having a desire to economize to the utmost extent compatible with efficiency, and the fact that the expenditure is still very large corroborates what was said by bis predecessor at the Treasury( Mr Bruce), that statutory commitments preclude the possibility of further economy to any great extent. MrE . RILEY -The honourable member does not believe thaE. conclusion. I wish it were possible to further reduce expenditure, because u n t i l we are able to lessen the burden of taxation we cannot hope to lower the cost of living-a n aim which honourable members on both sides will agree is most desirable. Notwithstanding the satisfactory Estimates for the current year, it is absolutely essential that the Treasurer should continue to keep a watchful eye on the expenditure in order, if possible, to discover avenues in which further reductions can be made without impairing the efficiency of the Publio Service. A very pleasing feature of the Budget speech was the announcement that the Gcwernirient intend to propose an increase of the old-age and invalid pensions, and liberalization of the conditions under which they are granted.

The increased payment of 2s. 6d. per week, small though it be, will give considerable relief to those who are entirely dependent upon their pension. pleased to hear that the conditions governing the granting of pensions are to be liberalized to some extent, but I suggest to the Treasurer that he might inquire into other means of making the pension more effective, and removing hardships that undoubtedly exist. A t the present time the pension is reduced according to the capital which the pensioner has in the bank. before the pension is affected is the same as when the original Act was passed, and it would be only reasonable to increase it in the same ratio as that in which the pension has been increased. many thousand more applicants. happening we would be justified in taking that step. enough to be living in his own home there is no reduction of pension on that account; but any income apart from the pension is rightly taken into consideration. It may be, however, that a pensioner has been able to pay £ 2 0 0 or £300 towards the purchase of a cot. tage, and that there is still a mortgage upon the building representing 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, of its value. The interest upon the mortgage should be regarded by the Department as a fair charge against any money that the pensioner earns. The equity of that proposal is so evident that I trust the Treasurer will make a note of it . I know of one old lady who had scraped together enough money to pay a deposit upon a home, but she had to allow £400 of the purchase price to remain on mortgage, and she could get no relief in respect of the in terest she was paying. I am f u l l y alive to the necessity for the Department to safeguard the country, because we all know of instances in which the pension is being abused. It was not intended l o be drawn by all persons who reached a certain age, but, in practice it frequently i * so drawn, regardless of whether or not the recipients are in need of it . They think they are entitled to claim the pennot be paid to any person who is able to maintain himself. According to the view of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports' ( Mr Mathews), even a person with I was an income of £10,000 per annum should be eligible for the pension upon reaching a certain age. In my opinion,' if sumcient money were available for that, it would be better to allot it to those requiring it . However, I am anxious to liberalize the system as far as possible for the benefit of those aged persons who are in need of a pension. plies to the maternity bonus. its application to the maternity bonus, either. In another respect the conditions governing the payment of pensions might, be liberalized. I have had brought under my notice the case of a man with an imbecile son twenty-three years of age. A t the risk of that He maintained that son as well as a wife and another child. His income was If a pensioner is fortunate £ 5 4s. per week, or about £270 per annum. On that amount the father, mother, claimant, and another childequal to three and a half adults-ar e maintained. The total income, divided by 3^, gives a result of £ 7 7 each. In view of the fact that the limi t of income under the Old-age and Invalid PensionsA c t is £ 65 per annum, it.was held by the Department that 'the claimant was in receipt of adequate maintenance, and his application for a pension was disallowed. 1 am glad to say that when I represented this case to the Treasurer he saw the injustice that was being done, and through his intervention, the.pension was granted. If that man, instead of acting the proper part of a parent by maintaining the imbecile in his own home, had at any time after the boy attained sixteen years of age, turned him out to shift for himself or had cast him upon the care of the State, he would not have been legally liable for his maintenance, but because he did his duty, he was debarred from receiving the pension. Disabilities of that kind should not continue. Persons who are entitled to an invalid pension should receive it regardless of the fact that their parents, singly or conjointly, have an income suflicient to maintain",29,Eable Page Si R Neville Howse Farmers And The Sons Of Farmers Are Un

In regard ,to the further liberalization of the pension it is true, as the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) interjected, that every time we make the pension more generous we increase the number of applicants. were increased to £ 1 the additional burden upon the Treasury would be not only the extra payment to the present pensioners, but the additional payments that would have to be made to further applicants. The Commonwealth is not in a position to increase the pension to £ 1 at the present time, but I congratulate the Government on the steps they are proposing to make the payments and the Conditions governing them more liberal. I hope they will give consideration to the other suggestions that I have made. feel sure that if they do, no undue strain will be imposed upon the Treasury. I welcome the announcement by the Treasurer that he has come to some arrangement with the States for the collection of income taxation on one return. I have always felt keenly that either the Federal Taxation Department should be abolished, or some authority should Le created to collect the taxation for both Commonwealth and States. We cannot afford to have two Departments doing practically the same work, and it is not fair to put the taxpayer to the extra expense of submitting dual returns. There is one income, and one set of taxpayers. What is the necessity for ' two returns? returns are compiled in different ways, but that is only an excuse, not' a reason. an estate, I asked my co-trustee what the exact income was. He replied that, according to the Eederal authorities, the income was so and so, and, according to the State authorities, a different amount, but that the real income was yet another. This is an absolute absurdity, and I trust the Treasurer w ill not rest u n t i l he comes to some arrangement w i th the States to remove the anomaly. Why should we collect income tax from the taxpayers of a State, and then hand it back to them. We all know that .every time money passes through hands some of it "" sticks "" . When the "" Braddonb l o t "" was introduced it may have been necessary; any rate, it involved a genuine payment out of revenue collected through the Customs Department. Owing to war commitments, however, the money has to be paid out of the consolidated revenue, whether it is derived from customs or direct taxation. The taxpayers have about reached their l i m it of endurance, If the pension and demand that something shall be done for their relief. I regret that this matter was not settled during recent conferences, but no compulsion can be exercised, and, in any case, it is better to reach finality by compromise. Considerable relief w ill be afforded by the arrangement that has been made to collect the tax through one authority, and on one return only. I should like to make another suggestion which I fancy may call for t h some hostile criticism. I suggest that a d if I ferent rate bf tax should be collected on income from money invested in primary industries. We hear a great deal about the d r if t of people from the country to the cities, and this d r if t is certainly deplorable, and ought to be checked; but we ought also to check the d r if t of capital from the country to the cities. Every inducement should be offered to people to invest in country securities, so as to assist primary production, whether the money be the settlers'' own, or borrowed on mortgage. There are numberless men on the land who, if they could get hold of a little extra capital, could make very good use of it ; and the. Treasurer should consider the advisability of some remission in the case of income derived I know that the income tax from this source. A t present there is every inducement to replace country securities by city securities. I know that When I was a trustee in some of the big financial institutions w ill accept only city securities, but, fortunately for New South Wales, there are other in stitutions' which prefer the opposite policy. The Commonwealth Bank, strange to say, does not, to any extent, lend for investment in the country. It would be a great deal better for the bank if , instead of lending £1,000,000 to the city of Sydneyf o r street exten. sions, it advanced money in such a way as to do great service in country districts. My suggestion, I know, w ill not be accepted without f u l l consideration; but I am sure that, if greater inducements are at held out to capitalists to invest in this very, desirable direction, production w ill be increased, and the lot of the man on the land made easier and mere attractive. I am pleased to hear the decision of the Government not to collect taxes on leaseholds. been caused to ""people on the land by the present policy. holders are very wealthy people. desire to encourage people to go out into the western districts of New South Wales and Queensland, and the northern districts of South Australia and Western Australia, and we certainly ought not to penalize them with a taxation assessment every year. There was no uniformity in the way in which these leases were valued. In some cases ,the value for taxation purposes was more than the value of the leasehold, the stock, and the improvements altogether. In other cases, more particularly in Queensland, leases rented at £400 a year might be valued at £800. the capital sum equivalent to £400 per year for the unexpired term of the lease. So far as I understand, no taxation of this kind has been collected since 1917, but the assessments have been sent out every year, thus holding a sword over the heads of men who are fighting nature under very adverse conditions. Another matter that calls for attention is that of overlapping services. A move has been made with the Taxation Department, but there are other services duplicated most unnecessarily. stance, in the case of dairy produce, there is a State inspector for produce for local consumption, and a Commonwealth inspector when the intention is to export. In the meat industrythe same trouble v arises, so that we have a little army of officials, when one authority could do the whole business. The trouble is that many of our wholesale meat men, when the killing is going on, do not know whether the meat is to be put into the retail trade or exported. Only a few months ago some 80,000 sheep were killed and placed in the freezing chambers at Homebush, with a view to the export trade, but a shortage of mutton arose in Sydney, and the carcasses were put into local consumption. This necessitated double inspection, and double expense; and the same thing happened in the case of beef. When meat is killed with the intention of export, an odd beast, perv haps the best in the lot, is found to haye Much hardship and worry has a bruise, and is rejected by the Commonwealth inspector; before that meat can go into local consumption it must be passed by the State inspector. . I understand that the Cabinet is to take some steps to relieve anomalies in the collection of the lighting dues on the coast. In Sydney Harbor there is only one light kept up by the harbour authorities, and yet the dues to be paid are the same as when those authorities were responsible for the whole. The proper course would be for the Commonwealth to take over the whole management of the lighting. without a light on the Western Australian coast. ther the honourable member blames the The Department then calculated States or the Commonwealth, but the fact he mentions does not justify double charges. There has been much discussion on the administration .of the Postal Department. I must confess that if any one had told me when I was elected to this House, that I should approve of a reduction of the postage rate to 1-Jd., I should have been very much astonished. But conditions have improved so much during the last few months that I think the Treasurer is justified in now making For in the reduction. My opinion always has been that there should be no reduction until there was greater efliciency in the services. At the same time, I realize that we have adopted a wise policy of postal extension by the use of loan moneys. It was absolutely impossible, without imposing a great burden on the community, to make the necessary extensions out of revenue. If we wish to make conditions better for our rural settlers we ought to give them improved postal and telephone facilities. People require to have lived out-back to'realize the advantages of such conveniences, which tend more than anything else could to keep distant parts in touch with civilization. At one time. I lived some 400 miles from Sydney, and, owing to the fact that I had the telephone in ray house, I was able to, keep myself as fully informed with war news as any business man in the capital. 3",30,Eable Page Si R Neville Howse Farmers And The Sons Of Farmers Are Un

The honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) lives close to one of the irrigation settlements, and he knows, as I do, that the settlers cannot be expected to carry the whole burden of, the cost 'of the irrigation schemes. .Experiments in irrigation . had at first to be made, and it has been found that the country of least value for grazing is of most value for irrigation for the purpose of agriculture. It is not' fair that the whole burden of the experiments should be borne by those occupying the irrigated areas, in view of the fact that we have in those areas an asset for all time. There is a market in GreatB r i tain for our products, and I say that it is of no use for the British people to put the ANZAC on a pedestal and worship h i m , while they continue to buy the products of Greek, Egyptian, and Turki n preference to those of their own k i th and kin in Australia. MrE . RILEV -Does the honourable member not think that it is unreasonable to expect' the British public to give more for Australian meat than they can get meat for from other countries? these matters, at more than appears on the surface. We know that Australia is one of the best customers that GreatB r i tain has. We are offering to take her surplus population at the present time.. We are prepared to take them out of the blind alleys they are in in Great Britain, and give them a better existence in Australia. In asking for some trade preference, we are asking only for what is reasonable. We have to solve a very difficult proposition, because, in Great Britain, there is not only a Free Trade school of thought opposed to what we desire, but there is also, as there is in every English-speaking country, a body of people anxious to take advantage of such questions as this for the purpose of making political capital out of them. I believe that we are sending to GreatB r i business. tain the best representative Australia could have to deal with these matters. T consider that it was very inadvisable for the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney( MrW . M . Hughes) to say that while it was right that we should make representations for preference to the people of GreatB r it a in , nothing would come from those representations. I wish ' and semithe Prime Minister God-speed, and a successful mission to the Old Country. I am satisfied that if he is unsuccessful in this matter, the f a u l t w ill not be his. The right honourable member for North .Sydney said that the Prime Minister had issued a threat to the B ritish Government that if they did not give us preference, we would go to other markets,, and he said that there were no other markets. I say that there are other markets, and that we w ill have to develop those other markets. in a position to know that. The Australian Meat Council sent two practical men to the East, and the reports we have had from them are most satisfactory. We have every reason to think that, as a result of the efforts of our delegation, a most advantageous market for our meat will be opened up in Japan. The Japanese are anxious to get it . The refrigerated space available is insufficient, and it is a matter of getting it to Japan at a price which the people there can afford to pay, and which, at the same time, w ill pay Australian producers. The honourable We must look, in member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) said that there was a market for £1,000,000 worth of our meat in Japan. Whether that is so or not, I cannot say; but I do say we have had most satisfac-. tory reports from our delegation that is now leaving Japan, and intends to go round the coast of Asia and to India. they travellers? presentatives whom the Australian Meat Council has sent on its own account.

I do notthat he knew that it was right that Imperial preference should be granted, but the slightest chance of our getting what we were asking for. honourable gentleman did not adopt that attitude during the war. . That was not the spirit which animated the Australian soldiers, who made a name which will never perish, when they were confronted with difficulties that appeared to be insurmountable. They went right on and attempted to overcome those difficulties. When the ex-Prime Minister was faced with difficult questions in Great Britain he did not give up trying because they appeared to be insoluble. We know that we are asking for that which is in the interests of Great Britain as well as of Australia. It is our duty to support the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), and to trust that he will secure satisfactory results. In the British Parliament the other day an honourable member said the only loan that had not been floated on the Britisli market was that for Empire development; and it would probably pay the British investor much better than any other loan. A great deal of discussion has revolved round the present position of the wheat market. I am a wheat-grower, and 1 know that the position is not very satisfactory at the present time. I do not, however, consider that it is hopeless. We may obtain a lower price this year than we have obtained for years. I do not think that the Government would have been justified in guaranteeing as a firstpayment for the wheat at country railway stations a price greater than 3s. per bushel. The United States of America are large wheat-producers. Before the war that country had practically ceased to be a wheat exporter, and the reason it increased its production was the high prices that were ruling. Landi n tbe United States of America has become too valuable for wheat-growing in many cases, and unless high prices are obtained the land can be utilized more remuneratively in other directions If the price of wheat becomes low, some of the land which at present is being devoted to its growth will cease that production. Quotations have been made from a report of a Special Committee of the Legislative Council of New costs 4s. 6d. to produce a bushel of wheat. on prolific argument than that of the cost of producing a bushel of wheat. Some he did not think there was very successful farmers in the Cowra district appointed a committee, which went The right into the matter very f u l l y, and arrived at the decision that it cost 7s. OJd. to produce a bushel of wheat. The fact that they were most prosperous men, who had been growing wheat for years, and had never received 7s. OJd. per bushel, disproved their assertion. When ascertaining the cost of production, allowance is made for the farmer's labour at ( current rates, rental value of the land, the return on capital, and depreciation. The farmer makes his profit out of his labour. . No sane man would t r y to grow wheat if he had to rent land and pay for ploughing and planting; he would be insolvent . in no time. When these men engage in wheat production, they probably do in a day as much work as two paid men could reasonably be expected to .do. It is an ' advantage to Australia to have men who w ill work like that. Although the industry may be under a cloud, probably that cloud w ill prove to be not as heavy ' as it appears. The industry must be kept going. It and the gold-mining industry have done more to develop Australia than has anything else. the most valuable asset that Australia has, but wool-growing has not developed and populated the country to the extent that wheat-growing and gold mining have. A great impetus was given to development during the gold-digging days, yet the gold has never paid for its production, as it has not-been produced under £5 per ounce. value, or actual money spent? spent. Yet gold has done more than anything else to develop the country in a short time. A number of districts at present devoted to farming were in past times the scenes of gold digging; thc agricultural settlement followed the gold mine, and many of the miners took to farming when the mines petered out. I hold decided views on the necessity for ' South Wales to show that it land settlement.

A greater population must be settled on such country in order that fares and freights can be lowered. We have before us direct evidence that the only way in which to decrease the burden of taxation is to increase the number of shoulders which are bearing it. I look forward to the time when the Northern Territory land Ordinances will come before the House. AlthoughI know as much, probably, as any honourable member regarding the land in the eastern portion of Australia, I have yet a great deal to learn regarding the Northern Territory. member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) said the other day he hoped that, within five years, 1,000,000 people would be settled in the Northern .Territory. He was laughed to scorn. When .we talk about bringing people to Australia, we are told that we cannot absorb them. I , have here figures which show the extent to which population increased in Victoria in the days of the gold diggings. In 1850, there were in Victoria 71,191 persons. In 1855 the number had increased to 338,315 persons; and by 1860 it had reached a total of 534,055, an increase in ten years of 462,864, despite the lack of transport facilities. The excess of immigration over emigration in regard to Victoria was '400,045, and in regard to Australia 576,328 persons. In the country districts examples are often cited of persons who have started with nothing, < and done exceptionally well. The capital value of a man to the community is not generally realized. Lord Goschen, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, in England, had inquiries made by actuaries to ascertain the capital value of a man to the nation. At that time the average earning power was 15s. per week. The actuaries, after careful investigation, declared that the value was £250. capitalvalue of . 300,000 men to Australia would therefore be about £600,000,000. we can hope to defend this country ' is by increasing The worth the other day gave us some very -Valuable information. that the natural increase in eastern coun' Mr Manning, tries is so great that they must find an outlet. The history of the world proves that a nation which possesses a country that it cannot defend and bring to the highest state of production has to give way to others. Unless we increase our population at a very much greater rate than we are doing, we cannot hope to hold this country. That may be accepted as a maxim. The Commonwealth Government have a possession of very great value in the Northern Territory. It has been said that we should be represented abroad by business men. I feel very strongly on that. Much more cooperation is possible between the ComThe honourable monwealth and the States in our representation abroad. If we could secure it, we should add greatly to the efficiency of our representation, and also achieve considerable economy. At present, each State has its Agent-Generali n England, and we have our High Commissioner. Our representation would be much more effective under one head. Whether he should be Ministerial or otherwise is a matter which could be discussed. Such a representative could easily handle all the financial work of the States and Commonwealth, and better results would be obtained. I also believe that each of our primary industries should be represented in England by one man. Those representatives could meet together at intervals under the chairmanship of the Commonwealth representative. They would be able to do much to increase our markets, and the cost' of such representation would be much less than the present expenditure in that way. out the Agents-General? unificationist.

109,Mr Manning,"I am glad there areenable both small and large land-holders to obtain wire netting, which they are not.able to get under existing conditions.. Some of the large land-holders in our western country need wire netting badly, but under existing conditions they cannot afford it. Few people realize what a curse the rabbits are to Australia. Some think that, because an export trade is being done in rabbits, they are an asset to the country. It is a parasitic industry, the land-holders, including a small inhowever. It may be bringing money into the country, but the rabbits are causing very much greater losses than are compensated for by the trade in their skins and flesh. New South Wales had 63,000,000 sheep in 1893. A t that time, the country was, to a great extent, unimproved. Since then, millions of pounds have been expended in clearing the land and providing water conservation. I believe that New South Wales should be capable of carrying 100,000,000 sheep; but we know we are well stocked if we Have 45,000,000. It is a good many years since we had even that number. The rabbit pest is to blame. It would astonish honourable members to realizp how great the losses have been in the last ten years because of this curse. At anj' time in the last ten years we could have carried 45,000,000 sheep if there had been no rabbits. The carrying capacity of the country is reduced by 50 per cent., because 'of the rabbits. a source of cheap food for the public. greater supply of cheap meat would have been available had we been able to fully stock the country. I realize that at times the rabbits provide cheap food, but' we would have cheap food at all times if we had no rabbits. With one exception, the rabbits are the worse curse we have. They go out into Central Australia where large areas of counttry are unoccupied. In good seasons they breed rapidly, and the dingoes and wild dogs live on them. They also increase exceedingly. When a drought comes, the rabbits die out and the dingoes come into the settled areas and kill thousands of sheep. Unless something is done in the western divisions of New South Wales, similar to what has been done already in South Australia, that country will be unable to carry sheep. It is highly necessary that provision should be made for the landholders to obtain netting to enclose their holdings. One station owner told me the otherday that in the last twelve months he has paid for the destruction' of },500 dogs. The number' of dogs killed was probably much greater. The establishment of this fund will mean that money will always be available to provide ""wire netting, for annual repayments made by stalment and interest, will maintain the fund. An honourable member opposite asked during the debate whether our home markets were not the best markets. It was also observed that, if we increase our population, we shall need all our products. I do not think we can live by taking in our own washing, although the United States of America consumes 93 per cent, -of its primary products locally. We have not its population, however. We have 12,000 miles of coast line, and, if the present population of Australia were spread at equal distances around our coast, there would be only one man, woman, and child for every 12 feet. That is serious, not only from the point of view of production, but also from the stand-point of defence. We cannot defend this country unless we populate it. Honourable members opposite have said that they favour a scheme of home defence. The best scheme of home defence is the provision of a large rural population. amount of country, and Ave should make it available. The old tale has been told by the Labour representatives. They have said, ""What is the good of bringing people from overseas when we cannot find land for our own people ? "" That is not the position. In the first speech I heard from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), he quoted a case in which there were eighty applicants for one block of land. He said the land was in a drought-stricken district. That land was near Armidale, in New South Wales, which is one of the safest districts in that State. A temporary droughtis a godsend to them, because it gets rid of many of their pests. Their trouble is » that they' get too much rain, not that they get too little. At present, they are suffering from the effects of a long and",36,Eable Page Si R Neville Howse Farmers And The Sons Of Farmers Are Un

A few miles from Armidale you have the location of the highest railway station in Australia. the land at Armidale, as mentioned by the honourable member, the country was suffering from a drought. repeat that those periodical droughts are the best thing that could happen for that country. In my own district, country of a semi-arid character was thrown open, and eight blocks were applied for by about 600 people. The conditions were so easy that anybody could apply. If a block of land in Collins-street were offered for sale, it would probably be some time before it would be purchased at its proper value. If such a block were to be given away, all Melbourne would be after it. That is the position with regard to much of our land. It is hard to imagine easier conditions for acquiring land than those obtaining in New South Wales. holds land in New South Wales"" eligible to apply for these blocks? rotten system of balloting for blocks, any one who has a bicycle, or a wheelbarrow, or a sulky has as good a chance to get a block as a share-farmer who has a plant, or a man who has some capital behind him and who is likely to make a success of the block. I can quote a worse instance than that already given by me. On one occasion I drove Senator E. D. Millen to a place in Wyalong where balloting for blocks was in progress. For thirty-seven blocks there were 2,900 applicants. If those applicants had been properly sifted by the Land Board, it would probably have been found that only about 100 of them had a decent prospect of becoming successful settlers. I do not say that a man must have money before he will make a good settler. Many people have started in this country off scratch, like I did, and .have made good. They have not done it by working the hours which are proposed now as proper working hours. honourable member to say that the leaseholds which he mentioned some' little time ago were worth £3,000 at the time of allotterest for the money with which to pay ment? just mentioned; but, in the case of Bolagamy, to which I referred a little while ago, the country had been leased, and was well improved. It was some of the best in the district, and honourable members know the value of wheat-growing I admit it ; but I land in those areas. Each of those blocks comprised from 900 to 1,150 acres of good land, and every acre was well improved, and could be cleared for wheat for probably not more than 5s. per acre. Honourable members who are conversant with the value of wheat-growing land in New South Wales and South Australia will realize that the valuation I mentioned was correct. allowed to dispose of their blocks? can dispose of them without the Minister's' consent, but often they are permitted to do so earlier. If a misfit has possession of a block the sooner he is got rid* of and a man who will bring the land to a proper state of production is substituted the better for the country. It is useless to ' compel a misfit to remain on a block of land, at the risk of the area becoming vermin infested and a menace to neighbouring country. The policy adopted is that which the farmers and settlers have been urging in New South Wales for the last twenty years, namely, that land settlement and not revenue should be the paramount consideration. The lessees should be able to apply the whole of their capital to improvements, in order to bring the lancl to a proper state of production. Under the conditions of these leases the payment of rent is suspended for the first five years if the holder undertakes to expend an equal amount upon improvements. The leases are for twenty-five or twenty-eight years without reappraisement, and the lessees have the right at any time to convert to freehold at the original capital value. Thirty years ago, when I , as a young man, took up a block , of land in belah scrub country, the conditions were very different. When my first instalment became due at the end of three years I had to pay up or surrender the lease The land not being certificated, I could not get anadvance on it from any financial institution, and I had to pay three times the ordinary rate of in-",37,Eable Page Si R Neville Howse Farmers And The Sons Of Farmers Are Un
