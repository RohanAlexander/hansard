Tbe stage was reached which necessitated the preparation of complete facts in relation to the matter. The subject was referred to the Imporial Shipping Committee constituted by the Imperial Conference of 1926, and the various Governments are now awaiting the summary of facts collated by that committee. a question which I asked him, the Minister for Defence informed me that Welfare Committees are not now functioning aboard naval vessels because they are not desired, and, further, that naval ratings have every opportunity through other channels to bring before the authorities uny complaints they may wish to make. I now invite the honourable gentleman to say by whom the continuance of those committees is not desired, and to give details as to the other channels which are available to ratings for the making of complaints. my desire to supply the fullest information immediately I stated what was my recollection of the matter. I shall inquire into the exact position, and advise the honourable member in regard to it.

Its effects, however, do not actually extend over that period, as the Government, with a view to avoiding as far as possible the dislocation of local industry and business, has given importers the opportunity to secure, subject to certain reservations as to time, such supplies as were on order with overseas firms prior to the introduction of the restrictions. I am pleased to inform the House that this new diversion policy, in its results over the last few months, promises to prove highly successful. Its initiation, however, proved extremely difficult in administration.

7,Sir Henby Gullett (Henty,"MiaivCanberra and in tlie various States, has been very exacting. As far as was consistent with complete adherence to the policy, the Government has endeavoured to carry out the administration with as much consideration as possible to business and industry generally. If there have been cases of individual hardshipwhich I shall not venture to deny-the y have been due to the fact that it has proved impossible in the ease of many applications to make exemptions without establishing costly precedents. If a scheme of this kind was to succeed, departmental firmness was absolutely essential. On the whole importers, even those who have been embarrassed, have shown a gratifying disposition to cooperate with the Government. In administration, a distinction has been observed between capital and consumption goods. In certain cases, where immediate curtailment of parts essential for the completion of manufacture in Australia would have interfered with production in this country, the restrictions have been relaxed in some degree to cover the transition period. This applies particularly in those eases in which Australian sources of supply were not available. decision to brine about the manufacture Although it is yet too early to measure in Australia of the motor engine and the effect of the policy in terms of industrial expansion in the Commonwealth, a careful preliminary survey makes it clear that many branches of local industry will enjoy early and substantial expansion because of it. Of still more importance, perhaps, is the fact that the policy is definitely leading to the estabCommonwealth is being shown by a few lishment of a number of new industries within Australia. In this direction, the most important development to date 'is the decision which I am authorized to announce, of the great Armco Company of America, in conjunction with John Lysaght (Australia) Limited, to proceed immediately with plans for the manufacture in the Commonwealth of special steel sheets such as auto body, commercial pane), enamelling and cold-rolled deep 'drawing sheets. In this enterprise, a capital of approximately £1,000,000 will be invested. These are sheets which are now imported for the manufacture of the motor car body. The present annual value of imports, which will cease"" with the local establishment of this industry, Sir Henry (full«tt. exceeds £400,000. I Bhould say that John Lysaght (Australia) Limited had already made the decision to expand its activities in Australia before the announcement of the Government's diversion scheme. The Armco Company, too, had previously given consideration to the matter, but in its ease the diversion scheme was the deciding factor. This famous company, which has a number of plants in America, has also great works in tha TJnited Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy. Its establishment in the Commonwealth will mark a further notable stage in our engineering development. Another happy outcome of the policy is to be found in the refrigoratiug and air-conditioning industry. I understand that the investment of new capital in this field will be approximately £700,000. Wide interest has also been stimulated by the policy in the wireless industry, which is now definitely assured of further parts production, including the production of wireless yalves. In this ease, the new capital investment will run into several hundred thousand pounds. With respect to the Government's chassis frame with accessories, it was not anticipated that a definite decision tn manufacture would be made within a few months by overseas companies. I am, however, in a position to inform the House that very keen interest in engine and chassis making generally within the overseas companies of world-wide reputation, and that the research entered into by these companies, which is still proceeding, is most comprehensive and detailed in character. There appears little doubt that the Government's objective to bring about the manufacture of the complete motor car, less, perhaps, a few parts at the outset of operations, will be achieved within the near future. Manufacturing inquiry haB also covered a fair range of motor oar parta which aTe now being imported. A number of miscellaneous industries of somewhat less importance than thoso which I have mentioned will he established in Australia. At the moment I do not propose to give details of them, as some of the parties concerned do not wish their intentions to be made public. On the whole, the policy is shaping excellently, both in its promise to Australian industry and employment and also as a heavy contributor to the essential overseas financial balance. MT. Curtin (Fremantle) [10.41] by leave-It is quite true that four months have elapsed since Parliament had given to it an outline of the Governwhich the honourable member is associated. ment's trade diversion policy, and certain tariff schedules which have since operated were laid upon the table of this House. The Minister( Sir Henry Gullett) has told us this morning that a very considerable degree of success has attended the application of that policy. I noticed that he made reference only to that part of the policy which concerns the adverse trade balance which Australia hitherto has had with the United States of America, and that no reference whatever was made to the effects of the policy upon the general trade of Australia. My present purpose is merely to suggest that so much argument has been advanced by the Government in support of this policy, in places other than this Parliament, that it would appear to be reasonable for the Parliament now to be invited to consider the merits of it. For the time being, I pass no judgThe earlier he does so, the less necessity ment upon the merits of it. I remind the honourable gentleman and the Prime Minister, however, that much of their criticism of a previous government was based upon the contention that tariff policy was being applied as the result of executive decision rather than as the outcome of parliamentary enactment. They also referred to the fact that in certain instances action was taken without any inquiry or recommendation having been made by the Tariff Board. It must, I think, be clear that the Prime_ Minister is pledged in broad principle* to refer tariff matters to the Tariff Board. I do not say that that is always reasonable, proper or necessary. But he at least has insisted that it is the proper course; and in greater particularity Ministers who sit beside him have been adamant in their contention that there ought to be no alterations of duty without reference to the Tariff Board. I remind the Government that its adherence to the Ottawa agreement pledged it to refer to the Tariff Board all proposals which involve increases of duty. Members of the Government advanced that contention in a quite recent debate in this House. Apparently their policy is merely one of criticism of members on this side of the House. not impose the prohibitions and surcharges introduced by the party with tween the policies of the United Australia party and the Labour party is that the Scullin Government applied its tariff proposals without discrimination as between the various countries. In the present instance, the policy of' the Government is far worse than that of the Scullin Government, in that some traders in Australia will be permitted to continue trading with certain other countries, whilst the great mass of traders will be denied equality of opportunity to compete even with traders in Australia, the inequity of this position is a matter with which the Government should deal later. I challenge the Prime Minister, in order to preserve parliamentary control over the laws operating in regard to the trade of Australia, to permit the tariff schedules to be dealt with by this House. will there be for broadcasting speeches to the public, for the disclosure of confidential information to wool-growers, or for asking for leave to make statements in this House which cannot be generally debated. [10.47]-by leave I rise only to deal with one aspect of the matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition. It is not necessary for him to challenge me to bring forward tariff schedules. Aa soon as this House has disposed of matters that are more urgent than the one to which he has referred, it will be given full opportunity to debate the schedules. for Defence indicate the carrying capacity of the flying-boats proposed to be employed in the England-Australia air",11,Trade Diversion

52,Mr Curtin (Fremantle) [11.12],"£2,412,000. The amount expended from loan funds in that period has been £1,460,000. In other words, although the excess receipts have gone into the general revenue, the department has expended from loan funds an amount within £.1,000,000 of such excess receipts. appears to me to be not altogether wise for the department to pay its excess receipts into Consolidated Revenue and at the same time borrow money to provide additional equipment, though I am aware that to charge the whole cost of such addiexperience of the department bears out tional equipment against any one year would hardly be fair. In view of the fact that the Postmaster-General is administering a profitable department, as a general principle such a department should not unnecessarily add to the public debt by expending loan money simply to make certain reductions of taxation possible. [ was absent when this matter was discussed in connection with the Works Estimates, I take this opportunity to draw attention to the outstanding success of small automatic telephone exchanges in country districts. These have conferred great benefits upon people resident in outlying areas giving them the means to keep in touch with the larger centres of population throughout the night, and being particularly helpful in case of emergency such as sickness in a home. I strongly urge the Minister to see whether it is not possible to carry out this policy more vigorously in the future than has been the case in the past. Downs) [11.16] I support the views just expressed by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). The main difficulty in establishing automatic telephone exchanges in the outlying districts is the absence of electric current, but I point out to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General that that can be overcome, to some extent, in view of the fact that electricity supply companies are now extending their operations considerably in country areas. When I placed certain requests before the Deputy Director in Queensland, I was advised that sufficient money had not been appropriated to enable the department to carry out such work. The amount provided had already been allocated. I ask the Minister how much is being allocated this year for this purpose, and whether he can increase the amount available in any way by allocations from the general departmental funds? It ringah-Minister for Defence) [11.17]. I made a statement on this matter on Wednesday in which I indicated the number of rural automatic telephone exchanges which hare already been established, and admitted that the fully the opinions just expressed by honourable members regarding the value of these facilities. propose to establish automatic exchanges as a general policy? it proposes to do that as widely and as rapidly as possible, but, as I explained previously, these works are fairly costly with the result that much consideration has to be given to such projects before they can be embarked upon. Provision has been made this year to convert 52 additional exchanges in rural districts from the manual to the automatic system, as follows:-thirtee n in New South Wales, fourteen in Victoria, nine in Queensland,, seven in South Australia, five in Western Australia, and four in Tasmania out in small centres, or in bigger centres like Rockhampton? centres concerned are not so large as Rockhampton, but they serve very wide areas. The new exchanges will obviate the necessity for any manual attention and will give subscribers a continuous service. manual exchanges to the automatic system in the bigger centres of population ? work to which I am now referring is quite apart from that proposed to be undertaken in the larger centres of population. The appropriation for the current year' for telephone exchange services is £1,502,850, which is £284,580 in excess of last year's expenditure of £1,218,270, and this amount is",17,Sales Tax Exemptions Bil L

This work has been going on in piecemeal fashion for a number of years, and the reason given for the failure to carry it out as one job was that the old manual exchange was still workable and the department could not see its way clear to dispense with it until it had thoroughly outlived its usefulness. We should imagine that the first consideration of a department which, like the Postmaster-General's Department,"" makes a handsome annual profit, should be not whether an old manual machine has outlived its usefulness, but whether as a department rendering a service to subscribers, it can render them a better service. The Petersham exchange serves a very large residential area and also a large manufacturing area, and subscribers to it are justified, in view of the charges they are obliged to pay, in asking for a more efficient service. It is all very well for the Minister to say that provision is being made for the conversion of the exchange at Petersham, but this work is being done only in piecemeal fashion, whereas if it had been done rapidly as one job, a better service would have been provided to subscribers. This should have been done, seeing that it was always intended that the whole of the exchange was to be converted eventually to the automatic system, and ths department would have benefited through a big saving of expenditure; furthermore, additional employment would have been provided through such work. sham exchange is not the only one in the I assure department's network. that it is, but stress the fact that grievances have long been suffered at Petersham, not only by subscribers, but also by public bodies, and I emphasize that had the department gone about this work properly and done all the job at once, considerable expenditure would have been saved. not have made any difference in expenditure. ter was Postmaster-General, he expressed the opinion that the Petersham exchange should not be converted until the old machine had outlived its usefulness. X suggest that he was wrong in that opinion; although the old exchange is capable of doing duty to-day, the department admits that it is defective. He also said that it would be many years before the old machine outlived its usefulness. I suggest that the fact that the department under a new Minister has decided to complete this work at once, shows also that he may be wrong on this occasion when he asserts that no saving would have resulted to the department through doing this job as a whole. I again appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the conversion of this exchange to the automatic system in one job instead of in piecemeal fashion. If this is done, the department will benefit from increased revenue from additional subscribers. [11.25] I congratulate the Government on its policy of installing automatic exchanges in country areas, and I should like the Minister to give honourable members details of its proposals in tha* direction for the current year. About twelve or fifteen years ago the then Commonwealth Government announced as its policy the extension of automatic exchanges to country areas; but, notwithstanding the fact that successive governments in the interim have subscribed iv that policy, only 29 automatic exchanges have 'been installed in rural",18,Sales Tax Exemptions Bil L

I am of opinion that automatic exchanges current available where it would be would confer greater benefits if installed needed ? in rural areas in the larger States with scattered populations than in a State several places where exchanges should be which has a comparatively compact installed.

Notwithstanding this fact, more sympathetic consideration to the Government proposes to install, durrequests for the installation of rural autoing the ensuing year, fourteen of these matic exchanges in the more remote exchanges in rural districts in Victoria, country districts.

It gives as good service as any manual exchange of the kind can, but, of course, it is not so efficient as an automatic exchange would be. I trust that when the department converts manual exchanges to automatic, steps will be taken to ensure that the girls employed in the manual exchanges are absorbed into the department in other capacities. It would be most unfortunate, if their services were dispensed with altogether, and I hope that the Minister will be able to give an assurance that this will not be done. think that all honourable members are prepared to commend the Government and the Postmaster-General's Department on the progressive policy of installing rural automatic telephone exchanges in various parts of the country. The installation of these exchanges supplies a long-felt want, particularly in areas which hitherto have had to put up with a telephone service from 9 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the evening. A service of that kind is of little use to graziers, who leave tries have been established there, yet the their homes before the exchange opens in the morning and do not return until after it closes. Of course, I know that these rural automatic exchanges can be installed only where electric current is available, but electric power lines are being extended rapidly throughout the country, and most rural centres will, before long, be served with current. I am pleased to note that the department has seen fit to extend the hours during which certain country exchanges remain open, so that men who are out working all day may, upon their return at night, be able to conduct their business. be evident to every one that, for defence This service is greatly appreciated by residents of country districts. In the mountainous areas of New South Wal«v hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of valuable stock are depastured during the summer on what are known as snow leases. When the pastures in the Riverina become depleted, the stock are removed to the higher land, and it ia most important that the man in charge of them should be able to notify the owners by telephone immediately there is a threat of snow. At the present time the telephone exchange in this district is open only from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and it is highly desirable that the hours be extended. m . GARDEN (Cook) [11.42] I realize that if the Government were to comply with every request made by honourable members, this vote of £600,000 would have to be increased to one of millions. However, I take this opportunity again to impress upon the Minister the need for converting the present manual telephone exchange at Mascot to automatic. When I made the request on a previous occasion, I was informed that it was admitted in the department that the work should be done, but the Minister said that he could see no possibility of the necessary funds being made available in the near future. He added that it would probably be necessary to wait until the existing manual equipment was worn out, but that would involve a delay of ten years. There are more industries situated within the borders of Mascot than in any other similar area in the Commonwealth. During the last six months no fewer than fifteen new indusresidents have to depend upon the service rendered by a manual telephone exchange. The municipalities of Botany, Mascot, Waterloo and Alexandria have made requests for the installation of an automatic exchange, aud it is urgent that action be taken. Those who have had occasion to use the exchange know that between the hours of nine in the morning and five in the afternoon it may take anything from ten to twenty minutes to put a call through. Business people whose factories are in Mascot, but whose head offices are in the city, are seriously inconvenienced as the result, while it must purposes, it is very desirable that rapid communication should be assured with Mascot, which would be the chief centre of activity in the event of hostilities breaking out. ringah-Minister for Defence) [11.45].

In regard to country telephone exchanges, I shall bring the critical views of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) under the notice of the administration, and no doubt they will be very much appreciated, because it is glad to have frank speaking on these matters. 52 exchanges will be installed in rural areas? Sir Fifty-two automatic exchanges are intended for country areas. This work has been in the nature of an experiment, but it is now getting beyond the experimental stage. A sum of £50,000 was earmarked last year for this purpose, and a further £25,000 will be devoted to it this year, so that the amount which will be spent on automatic telephones in the country districts this year, according to the Estimates, is £75,000. tions in central Queensland? is quite probable, but I am confident that the position Avill be altered later. The faot that the substantial sum of £75,000 is being spent on the installation of autosum of £600,000 has been made available matic telephone exchanges in country districts is, in itself, a considerable stride in the right direction. Like honourable members tbe Postal Departm&at recognizes that the granting of such facilities as a mail and telephone service to districts that have been described by the honourable member for Macquarie as "" the far-flung outposts of the Commonwealth"" should receive considerationPerhaps the honourable member had in mind at the time the Kurrajong. But the provision of these real amenities of life encourage people to settle in remote districts by making their living conditions reasonably satisfactory. The importance of telephone communication to the country districts is realized by the Government, and the expenditure of £75,000 on providing these facilities this year will prove to be of very considerable advantage to the outback centres, which have been referred to by the honourable member. lation of these exchanges as between Victoria and New South Wales? Sir ARCHDAL E PARKHILL -The system, I understand, was in the nature of an experiment, and it was considered desirable at first to keep the exchanges within the ambit of the head office of the department in order that adequate supervision could be given to them more rapidly than if they had been widely scattered. I think that it will be established here within a couple of years. I emphasize, however, that the position has. advanced beyond the stage mentioned by the honourable member for Macquarie, and the situation which he describes no longer prevails.

98,Mr Casey (Coi,io -Treasurer ),25,Sales Tax Bills Nos 1 To 9
99,Mr Jennings (Watson) [12.9],"reduction than is here proposed, although that is important in itself, but because of the added advantage to the commercial community in connection with the computations which have to be made-3 $ per cent, being 9d. in the £1, or 4£d. in 10s. A tax of 4 per cent, involves a good deal of extra work as well as, possibly, confusion, expense, and delay in computation. Those who have had experience of the sales tax realize that members of business staffs ate not strictly trained in this new form of taxation. As a way out of the difficulty, I suggest that the department issue a table illustrating the manner in which the tax is computed. Such a table would be of considerable assistance to the business community. Fractions are involved in the computation, with a tax of 4 per cent, on such an amount as 27s. 6d., and the same principle of course applies to larger amounts. Much of the objection to the sales tax lies in the work involved, and the delay caused in its computation and the compilation of returns. [12.11] -The matter which the honourable member has brought under notice has not escaped the attention of the Government. Inquiries have been made among a fairly wide range of traders, merchants, and organizations, to ascertain whether a fixed amount in the £1, such as 9d. or 10d., would be an improvement on the percentage basis. The general consensus of opinion is that there is not very much difference in practice, because the majority of sales tax calculations have to be made on broken amounts. In any event, a ready reckoner would have to be nsed. were, say, 9d. in the £1. beyond my capacity to say offhand what the sales tax would be on 14s. 6d. at the rate of 9d. in the £1. Eveni f the rate of tax were 5 per cent., the calculation on a broken amount would not be easy. reduction of i per cent, represent? £500,000. Private enterprise rather than the department should provide a ready reckoner. Some businesses deal in small amounts, while with others large amounts are involved. Not more than a couple of hours would be needed to run out a ready reckoner in respect of the range of prices on which a business would normally have to calculate sales tax. concessions have been given in connection with the sales tax. but there is one which "" I think has for too long been overlooked. I refer to the granting of some compensation to certain merchants for the expense and trouble to which they are put in the making of calculations. In New Zealand, a discount of 2 per cent, is allowed for that particular purpose. This request has been made to the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) at different times, and he has promised to give it consideration. [12.15] -This matter has received a great deal of consideration in the last few months. Representations have been made to the department by various trading bodies over a considerable period that a percentage discount should be allowed (Corio Treasurer) for payment within a given period, but Cabinet has decided that it is unable to agree to the proposal. Some business people are subjected to little or no inconvenience in computing and paying sales tax, whilst others are put to varying degrees of inconvenience, and, to some extent, expense, in computing, collecting and paying the tax. We havo not been able to devise a method of recompensing business people that would operate fairly. A merchant dealing with a. product such as tea has no difficulty in computing the amount of his tax, and he is put to no additional expense in connection with his staff, but there are wholesale grocers and hardware merchants who certainly suffer some inconvenience, and incur expense, by reason of the multifarious returns which they have to prepare. A flat rate of discount for prompt payment, or in recognition of expense involved in connection with the tax, would be more than fair to some, and insufficient to recompense others. The Government is endeavouring to straighten out the law in order to reduce like these difficulties, and further measures to that end will be brought down in the course of the next few weeks. Every effort is being made to simplify the sales",25,Sales Tax Bills Nos 1 To 9

There is some justice in the claim for a discount, but, every phase of the matter having been considered, the Government regrets its inability to take action in the matter. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [12.20] 1 am surprised that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) should attempt to convince the committee that, in some cases, little or no work is attached to the making of the returns. I suggest that, as the Government has made business people a collecting agency on its behalf, a certain amount of work which would not otherwise be done is involved. This fact is recognized by various departments. If a department is called upon to supply information which involves an examination of its accounts, taxpayers are charged for the work done. I have in mind information supplied with regard to telephone accounts. The Postal Department insists on a payment being made for this service, because of the inconvenience of making the necessary investigation. No matter how simple a sales tax return may be, a certain amount of work is involved in preparing it. I see no justification for withholding compensation to the business community in recognition of its services as a collecting agency for. the Government. tion is added to retail prices. Mr E. J. HARRISON -In some instances that may be so. Some people claim that the cost of submitting a return in connection with a sales tax of 5 per cent, is no more than for a tax of 2£ per cent.; but the great majority regard the tax as grossly unfair, because they have no opportunity to pass it on. Owing to the keen competition in the commercial world, many business houses have to bear the full brunt of the tax themselves. They are compelled to submit returns, and to make their books available to the department when requested to do so by an investigating officer. This examination may waste hours in a day, or weeks in a month, yet no compensation is received by them. am surprised at the suggestion that business people should be compensated because of the costs allegedly incurred in making computations for the purposes of the sates tax. Under this bill, and under another measure proposed to be brought down, substantial relief will be afforded by a reduction of the rate from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent, and also, I understand, by a fairly extensive addition to the list of exemptions. Mr E. J. HARRISON -Wher e does the benefit come in? transactions, the purchaser will probably save £1 in every £100 worth of goods, but ' I venture the opinion that, in the great majority of small transactions, there will be no reduction of retail prices, as the purchasers of parcels of goods not exceeding in value, say, £1, will continue to bear the same impost as before. How could the retail prices of clothing, which is generally bought in small quantities, be reduced, because of a saving iu sales tax of £1 in every £100 worth of goods? Although the Opposition will have no objection to the reduction from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent., it feels that in its incidence the tax will operate unfairly, in that the great majority of the purchasers of luxury goods such as motor cars will get a definite advantage of a reduction of price, whilst it is doubtful if a corresponding advantage will accrue ' to the purchasers of goods worth £1 or loss. Surely the business community has brought about something approaching order in its methods of dealing with the tax. I consider that the Treasurer has clone well by the business community by reducing the rate of tax as prescribed in this measure, and by indicating that he proposes to have the list of exemptions extended. [12.29] I do not wish the committee to think that I object to compensating traders for expenditure incurred by them in respect of sales tax collections and returns. Indeed, I , personally, am sympathetic towards the idea, and have gone to a good deal of trouble in investigating the possibility of working out a fair method by which traders could be recompensed for expenditure actually incurred. Although the department has looked into a dozen different .ways of achieving the desired end, it has not found one workable plan, because the",26,Sales Tax Bills Nos 1 To 9

As a further example of the difficulty of the administrating sales tax legislation, I point out to honourable members that, when sales tax is paid at the Customs House, all the calculations are made by the departmental officers. It would be very difficult to make a distinction between the man who pays his tux at the Customs House and the merchant who pays it elsewhere in Australia. As a matter of fact, the man who pays at the Customs House is out of his money for a much longer period than the man who pays on the last wholesale sale. That fact suggests one of the fundamental difficulties of the situation. If we were to give a uniform discount for cash on sales tax payments, I do not see how we could logically defend a failure to extend ehe same principle to customs and excise payments. individual taxpayers who compile income tax returns? remarks to'indirect taxation. Mr E. J. HAIIKISON -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) must be aware that he has introduced a very ' different principle. indirect taxation, the Government would not have very firm legs to stand on in resisting applications for cash discounts on customs and excise payments if it granted them on sales tax payments. though I am pleased to see that the Government has made a reduction of 1 per cent, in the rate of sales tax, I do not think that it has gone far enough. Sales tax bears very harshly on people in a small way of business, who almost invariably lose money in connection with it. It also bears heavily on all the poorer sections of the community, and particularly those who are obliged to accept sustenance. It would have been preferable for the Government to have retained the former rates of direct taxation in order to permit it to reduce greatly, or even abolish, the sales tax, which in my opinion is one of the first forms of taxation that should be eliminated. methods of direct taxation that we adopt it is necessary for people to have a taxable income before they can be called upon to pay tax, but in an indirect form of taxation, such as the sales tax, people who have practically no income have to pay the tax, and in the case of business people in a small way, many who are actually incurring a loss are Obliged to pay it. People in a small way of business are not able to purchase goods in large quantities. It is the retailer-wholesaler who suffers most from this tax, for he is not able to pass on the tax. As I pointed out in a speech which I delivered on this subject last year, a sales tax is not fair, because in many cases people who do not show a profit on their operations are called upon to pay. Small retailer-wholesalers often have to call on their capital in order to meet sales tax exactions. The large wholesale firms in the cities supplying goods to retailers are in a position to collect the tax, but that is not the case with people in a smaller way of business. I favour the imposition of direct taxes based on ability to pay rather than indirect taxes. The sales tax is very unfair in its practical application. If such a tax is necessary at all it should be in the form of a turnover tax at the lowest possible rate, and it should be paid by the wholesaler, the manufacturer and the retailer. adopted, some people would be paying a tax on a tax. very much for the rate would be very low. A tax at the rate' of 1 per cent, or less on such a' basis would yield the Government the amount of money which it is obtaining from the existing sales tax. It is entirely unfair that a man with an income of from £200 to £300 should have to pay upwards, of £100 in sales tax. In these circumstances the retailer-wholesaler should be given special consideration. Probably this point may be considered more appropriately when the proposed exemptions aro before us, but I am strongly of the opinion that some more equitable system of taxation should be devised. If it is necessary for the Government to obtain revenue from an indirect tax of this nature, the rate of Under the various tax should be very low. Many people in",27,Sales Tax Bills Nos 1 To 9

Tbe census taken some years ago showed that a very big proportion of the population of Australia lived on small incomes, and indirect taxes are always unfair to such people. I sincerely hope that if the Government is not able to see its way clear to eliminate this tax altogether in the near future, it will at least take steps to remove some of the inequities in the present procedure. opinion the Government is making too many exemptions in the sales tax with the result that the needy people of the community are being harshly treated. If no exemptions were allowed the rate of tax could probably be reduced to 2£ per cent. Under existing conditions the small business man is invariably hard hit. The man who has ready money available can get cash discounts which are of considerable value to his business, but that is not the lot of the small business man as a rule. Cash-and-oarry stores buy large quantities of goods under conditions which make successful competition by the small storekeeper impossible. The small business man who goes to York-street to buy goods in limited quantities is compelled to buy without any discounts. We know very well that practically all the goods used by the farming community are exempt from sales tax. I consider that the interests of justice would be better served if the exemptions were discontinued and the general rate of tax lowered. Why should the small man be penalized every time? I protest against exemptions being granted to favoured industries. The fewer the exemptions from sales tax the better will be the lot of the small storekeeper. People who are paid only small wages suffer greatly from the incidence of sales taxation. It is unfortunately a fact that many people are to-day still receiving payments at about the same rate as that which prevailed during the depth of the depression. Indirect taxation such as the sales tax is unfair to relief workers and all the poorer people in the community; it is time that the Government realized this. I know that the sales tax is a money spinner which few governments would have the courage voluntarily to dispense with, but that does not justify the maintenance of this tax at the rate of even 4 per cent. If the ' impost were spread over a wider area, the rate could be reduced to at least 24, per cent. [12.43] I hope in the course of the next week, to submit to honourable members, other bills relating to sales tax, which will provide a more appropriate opportunity for the consideration of the incidence of this impost. I , therefore, do not propose to discuss the subject at present. I am quite sure, however, that the information that I have at hand will be enlightening to them, particularly as to the incidence of sales tax in respect of the man on the basic wage and other people in the community who live on small incomes.

The principal acts which it is so\ight to amend by these measures are intricate to follow, and the purpose of these bills is to bring together for the first time all the rates of sales tax that have obtained in the past from the time when this class of taxation was introduced at the rate of 2i per cent., through to the period when it was varied to 6 per cent, and 5 per cent., and they will, of course, cover the tax at the rate of 4 per cent., at which it has been operating since the 11th September. In the past, in order to discover the formal authority for the various rates of sales tax which have operated from time to time, it has been necessary to examine all the measures that have been passed to grant financial relief, and also the acts which have varied the rates of tax. greatly simplify the procedure. It must be remembered that sales tax is still being paid in respect of past transactions at the various rates that have obtained, and the bringing together of these rates into one measure will be of a. great convenience to all concerned.

No budget is quite as bad as its opponents would suggest, nor is it quite so good as Government supporters proclaim. This budget is notable for a number of features, some good, some indifferent, and some bad. Epitomized, it can be said that the Government has a surplus in excess of its estimate because it has collected in taxation an amount with«ut precedent in the history of the federation. Notwithstanding all of the Government's boasts regarding the remis(Corio Treasurer) sions of taxes already effected, the fact remains that the present Treasurer ( Mr Casey), during the last financial year, took more fTom the Australian public than any of his predecessors. And .in the current year, for which we are now budgeting, notwithstanding his declared intention to remit taxes, he proposes to take an amount of over £61,500,000 in taxation, thus exceeding the record of every previous year except his own peak achievement in 1935-36. This budget contemplates a higher customs revenue than was the case last year, when the yield was much in excess of the estimate, and the actual receipts were over £2,750,000 more than in 1934-35. And what is true of customs revenue is also true of excise revenue. The receipts from these two items taken together last financial year, greatly exceeded the forThe passage of these bills will mal estimate, and in the present year the Government has the hardihood to budget for customs and excise revenue over £1,000,000 in excess of that which was collected in 1935-36. Having regard to all forms of indirect taxation, the yield last year was a little less than £5,000,000 more than that of the previous year, and aggregated over £52,000,000. The budget all forms of indirect taxation, of £51,100,000, which is nearly £4,000,000 more than the yield in 1934-35, £7,000,000 more than in 1933-34, and nearly £9,000,000 more than in 1932-33 -staggerin g increases of the revenue available to this Government from what can be described as easy sources of money. A satisfactory feature of the budget is that it indicates a competence on the part of the Government for a full restoration of public servants' salaries, an increase of the maternity allowance, an increase of the rate of invalid and old-age pensions, which should have been granted earlier, and larger provision, both from",29,Sales Tax Bills Nos 1 To 9

All these features of the budget, I believe, will be received with satisfaction by all sections of the community; and the Opposition, no less than the Government, welcomes the fact that these improvements have been made possible. The budget fails, however, to make any provision to meet that part of the problem of the present economic order which is known as part-time employment, sustenance or relief work. The depression has increased the proportion of unemployables in the community. It has greatly restricted opportunities to employ youth. It has certainly rendered far more acute the struggle for a living on the. part of the worse-circumstanced section of the Australian public; and for this grievously-afflicted and very large number of Australian citizens the budget makes little or no provision whatever. Furthermore, in remitting taxes, the part this factor plays in the stimulation Government increases the proportion of of exports, an effect to which the its total yield derived indirectly overthat Treasurer referred, must know that it which is derived directly; it disregards to cannot justly attribute it to its own a greater extent than heretofore the prinpolicy. The third factor wasciple of levying taxes on the basis of ability to pay; and in regard to income tax, both from,' personal exertion and from property, its policy gives a much more substanital saving to incomes on the higher ranges than to those on the lower ranges. The reduction of the rate of sales tax from 5 per cent, to 4 per now being felt definitely, and which I cent, will have a negligible effect on the contend has played a more important lower-priced goods and thus it will be of part in promoting Australian industrial very little benefit in respect of these expansion than any step taken by this articles; in practice it will provide relief Government for the diversion of trade, of an obvious kind in respect of the washigher-priced, and what can be called luxury commodities. Another remarkable feature of the budget is that it contemplates an expenditure on defence this year which is approximately three times the amount spent on defence in 1932-33, more than twice the amount spent in 1933-34, and £1,800,000 more than the amount expended in 1935-36.

I feel sure that the truth of any statement which I may make in the course of this speech will bo confirmed by the Treasurer if he cares to consult with his officers. Of this £74,000,000, not including exchange, £38,900,000 has been saved in respect of tlie debt domiciled in Australia and converted under the Financial Emergency Acts of 1981. An amount of £27,500,000 has heen saved as the result of what was done during the the term of office of the Scullin Government in regard to the suspension of the war debt due to the British Government, in interest and repayment of principal. This sum of £27,000,000 also includes the savings of £8,060,000 as the result of the conversion of the loans held by the public in Great Britain, and effected by Mr Bruce. Therefore, of the total of £74,000,000 savings in interest and loan charges, only £8,000,000 can be credited to the present Government. The remaining £66,000,000 is the direct outcome of the steps taken by the right honourable basic impediment to governmental member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) to stability in Australia was the high cost effect a reduction of the burden of inof the public debt, and the huge demand terest upon governments in Australia.

These savings are exclusive of exchange, which would appear to involve an additional £2,000,000 or about £18,250,000 in all to Australian governments in the latest financial year. Obviously, that is what has enabled the finances of Australian governments so to improve that the Treasurer was able to say that, taken as a whole, Australian budgets now showed a surplus.

143,Mr Curtin,"Fo r the further paying too large a proportion of theiraim at the establishment and maintenance of friendly relations with other nations. We should not be provocative in our international policies and contacts. That is -the positive side of the appaal of the Labour party to the world. It entertains no aggressive ambitions and hopes that other countries will treat the Commonwealth as we treat them. The world is in a state of grievous inflammation and the Labour movement declares that a Labour government will take adequate measures to ensure the safety of Australia against aggression. I emphasize that defence means defence against the threat of war and fascism and is not designed for any other purpose. In a sentence, the Labour party stands for peace and the security of Australia. It believes that the foundations of patriotism are internal order and content. A dissatisfied and unhappy people are vulnerable. Improved social conditions, the assurance of employment, and the building np of the economic order on a basis of justice as between citizens are essential conditions for any effective preprovision of munitions and other war paration for national defence. Military gymnastics and the marching here and there of men in attractive uniforms are not defence. They give but the shadow. The reality in defence ia the existence of the essential industries to arm, feed, clothe and transport by sea, land and air the forces of the Commonwealth. Military, naval and aerial organization must be made as independent of external supplies as it is within the capacity of the country to organise such supplies. Weapons have to be replaced, and munitions can only be provided continuously by the existence of means for their production. This has been the basis upon which the present defensive power of the great nations has been made possible. Australia has to act similarly. We need for the Navy more docks than we have ' at present. greater industrial organization than now exists; and for our air fleet we need aerodromes and aeroplane facilities. We need oil storages and reserves, and a long line of land bases for repairs, replacements, and refuelling away from the coast. Naturally, the fuel required must be at present the subject of acquisition and storage. We should, however, exhaust every possibility of exploiting the natural and artificial sources of oil in the Commonwealth. We need, too, a national survey of all industries, in order to have the requisite data available in. regard to their potential value for defence purposes. I repeat what I said last night, that the cost of defence must be borne by the entire community, because it is solely for the protection of the community. It is a fundamental principle that no individual ought to be permitted to profit to the amount of one penny out of the provision of anything that is needed for the essential defence of the country in which he lives. If there is one purpose more than any other for which the rich should pay, and for which capital ought to be willing to provide production without profit, it is for defence. homes of the workers of no importance t workers are defended by the manhood of the country. The complete control of the material of all kinds should not be available for private profit-making, but should be an essential and a major measure of Commonwealth policy. I have said that it is the quality and the quantity of our people which constitutes the foundation of our capacity for defence. The Government apparently believes that we have not a sufficient population, and that it ought to be increased. The Attorney-General( Mr Menzies), for example, in a' series of speeches which he made recently, appears to have advocated a population of 20,000,000 persons for Australia. In one speech he saidHow could we proceed to hare 20,000,000 people? We should talk in terms of migrating British stock to this country. He went on to say that public opinion We need for the Army a in Australia was very hesitant in the matter of migration, and that one had to be very tactful, addingHe was afraid that he must be one of th* first to go thoroughly untactfully into th* matter.

145,Mr Ourtin,"The homes of theDominions, the Marquis of Hartington, said recently1 do not think I am indiscreet in saying that the Dominions Office has recently had an opportunity of consulting with Australian statesmen who are visiting England, and I think there is a real ground for hoping that a beginning may be made within a few months towards a resumption of immigration. I have asked repeatedly to be advised as to what negotiations have been proceeding, and the answer has invariably been that no finality has been reached. Indeed, the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has stated, sufficiently definitely for me to believe him, that negotiations in regard to schemes of migration have not been proceeding in any practical way. I do not know whether that is the case or not. In any event, the Opposition says that it will not support grandiose schemes for mass migration. It says that such schemes have failed humanly and economically. schemes that are designed to make the standards of life in Australia better than they are, and to promote a more virile population than we have, because it considers that those two factors make the most effective contribution which could be made to our national competence. Recently the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) asked an audience at Adelaide not to accept conclusions which I had presented in regard to the need for increased social services in Australia, in order to provide for the betterment of the quality of the Australian people. errors into which the honourable gentlemen had unconsciously slipped. man said that it was fantastic to use the data of the census year in regard to bread-winners as being applicable to the present time. gentleman, on what data he now proposes to ascertain to what extent an extension of social serviens is either necessary or desirable. If he intends to disregard the census data of 1933 in respect of the disclosures concerning lies only; that is to say, those who have bread-winners, of what earthly use was dependent children. I am quite positive it to incur expenditure in order to obtain that information? Por census purposes a bread-winner, broadly speaking, is neither more nor less than a person of any age or sex who has, or seeks to have, any money coming in. The honourable gentleman would have us believe that the category of breadwinner in the census table relates to any person who has or may have an income. He claims that it is far removed from the popular conception of the head of a family. Very well. [ shall give him another set of conclusions, based upon another portion of the census disclosures, and leave him to deal with them. I remind him, however, that under the War Service Homes Act, in assessing the amount which the Government considers that a widow is able to pay weekly, the wages of the children of the widow are taken into consideration. A l though the Treasurer refuses to have those children classified as breadwinners, Buti t will support in connection with the distribution of income, he takes into account the fact that they are breadwinners in determining what the widow shall pay weekly for a war service home. This is true also in regard to sustenance relief. In all of the States the earnings of the children are taken into account. Even in respect of certain phases of invalid pensions, the ability adequately to maintain an applicant is taken into account. Chief Judge Dethridge, speaking from the bench of the Federal Arbitration Court in Sydney recently, declared that, with the increasing mechanization of industry, room for adult employment was becoming less and less. He added that juniors were doing much of the work performed by adults, and said that the country was up against a tremendous problem in finding employment for adult workers. The Treasurer would refuse to allow me to classify these juniors as breadwinners, although the Statistician has so classified them in his returns. He tells me that' I am to disregard the whole compilation, although the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court says that the earnings of these juniors are, in effect, made at the expense of their elders, in many cases their own fathers.

150,Mr Curtiit,"I do not think that reduction of the accumulated deficit,£21,400,000; and in 1936, it was £24,200,000. [Leave to continue given.] I am impelled to the belief that some part of these funds can be regarded as a legitimate offset to the accumulated deficit. The Treasurer should explain the position. Evidently he does not regard the accumulated deficit as a formidable thing, which should be dealt with as a matter of policy. I submit that he could have used, in a variety of other ways, the -£1,063,000 which is to be devoted to the reduction of the deficit. Concluding his speech, the Treasurer stated that the Government was glad to be able, by this budget, to improve the position of every section of the Australian community. I suggest that this claim rests on very doubtful premises. There is still a vast amount of poverty in Australia. Some thousands capable of being employed are still unemployed, and many others have been so debilitated by the effects of the depression that they must rely mainly upon State assistance. ""When all has been said and done, unemployment still remains the crucial test of economic and social policy, and the real level of economic recovery is to be measured by the level of social well-being. A community which does not ensure full and adequate opportunity to its citizens to contribute, by their work, to their own welfare and the common progress of the nation, has failed to resolve the fundamental problem of statesmanship. An extension of social services, and the organization of public employment, appear to me to be unavoidable steps satisfactorily to ensure the real progress of the Commonwealth. I put it to the Government that economic stability and the maintenance of prices depend upon the diffusion of adequate purchasing power among the people at large. A small number of large buyers, possessed of high incomes, consume less, and less regularly than do a large number of small buyers, even though they have small incomes. A shortage of iucome on the part of the wage earners not only produces misery for them, but is also economically bad for the community generally. Business activity in all its forms depends mainly on the volume of spending, and it must be apparent that manufacturers and merchants Mr Ottrliw. cannot sell unless they find customers ready and able to buy. During the depression, the scale of social services, though limited, contributed greatly towards the relief of Australia from what I shall describe as the more serious consequences of world economic upheaval. There are, however, in thia country, classes of sufferers from the social order which are large in dimensions. Thousands of people are now on part-time relief work, and their incomes do not approximate the basic wage, because they have to stand down for such periods throughout the year as make it impossible for them to enjoy anything like the standard of living which the courts fix as the minimum. To l i ft this class up above the slough of their present plight was, I believe, the paramount obligation of the Treasurer. He could also have given us some instalment of the provision that he should make for the initiation of a system of unemployment insurance. He could also have recognized the claims of those families with dependent children in which there is no male breadwinner, and he could have raised the old-age pension to £1 a week. I believe that this budget confirms th* advantages of capitalism to a clasi limited in number, and minimizes in only very slight degree the disadvantage* which the system imposes in varying measure upon the majority. I have th* feeling that the present financial position of the Commonwealth Government should have enabled it to envisage courses of action whereby we should no longer be obliged to accept the unsatisfactory conditions of life which are to be found, too markedly, a feature of our great cities. The Government should have indicated, by appropriate budgetary provisions', its cognizance of the need for lessening the hours of labour in our established industries. The tyranny imposed upon large numbers of our citizens by economic insecurity could have been abated by a more generous regard for the welfare of the many, as distinct from the monetary interests of the relatively few. In these outstanding aspects of social adaptation to the changing economic order, the budget suffers defect* far outweighing its merits. Progress reported. 1936.

As the Postmaster-General's Department has shown a surplus of receipts over expenditure in the last two or three years, it is not unreasonable to request it to proremitted for the five years 1932-33 to 1936-37, vide facilities in keeping with the public allowing for the cumulative effect of the needs. I have in mind 'one area of 260 residences in the Hindmarsh division which has not yet been provided with a postal delivery. This is unfair and unreasonable. I appeal to the Government to provide them with adequate postal telegraphic and telephonic facilities. The essential needs of every growing community should be met. [3.37] -in replyI assure the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) that the representations he has made, and particularly his request for the construcyears represent a much greater saving to the tion of a new post office at Thebarton, will be brought prominently under the notice of the Postmaster-General.
