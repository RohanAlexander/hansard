There is no question that there is particularly if there are one too many other a need for this sort of body both in the national apples. There is a lot of economic sense in the interest and in the consumers' interest. The fact Government's intention to have a total program of the matter is that, contrary to the implication of rural re-adjustment in many areas of the apple in the remarks of the honourable member for industry. Fraser( Mr Fry), the Government has seen fit, In respect of the IAC's method of looking at because of the economic circumstances and the problem, it has been a common talking point perhaps due to regional dislocation problems or within the corridors of the IAC for some time due to sheer poor standards of living for people that there is an apple grower in one State which I in many sectors of the horticultural industry, to will not mention who handles all his export fruit continue the support for the 1977 season and not himself and does so inriskfruit areas.

By so doing, the Monarch General. At times one gains the impression proadvised and warned, but ensured he avoided republicanists see a Prime Minister fulfilling the controversy.

But just as GeorgeV was forced on at At times I have my doubts. British history has least 2 occasions to intervene in the politics of the evolved a Monarchy divested of virtually all nation, so is the Queen's representative in active influence in daily politics, but the Australia, by the very essence and the frameMonarchy is much more than a simple exwork of our Constitution, forced to intervene at pression of history. If some Australians had critical times in the affairs of our nation. I believe queried prior to 1975 the need for a Governorour Governor General could well have been General in a country that had lacked problems, it praying during October and early November would have been understandable.
