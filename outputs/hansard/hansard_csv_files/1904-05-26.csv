They are aware that, at the request of the King, designs for a Commonwealth Flag were asked for by the first Commonwealth Administration. Prizes, amounting to ^75, were offered to successful competitors, and designs were invited from the citizens of the Commonwealth and of the ad-, joining Colony of New Zealand. Ultimately, the prize-money was divided among five competitors, who, strangelv enough, all sent in the same design. The designs submitted were then publicly displayed in the Exhibition Buildings at Melbourne. To the opening of this display not only were members of the then first Commonwealth Parliament invited, but invitations were extended to many of the prominent citizens of Melbourne, and additional prestige was given to the event by asking the wife of the Governor General, the Countess of Hopetoun, to formally declare it open. After considerable delay, it was announced in the press and in the Commonwealth Gazette that a design had been chosen, and, after further delay-as I could not understand why, since",12,Victorian Mail Services

12,Mr Crouch,"No doubt honorableMinisters had selected a flag, it was not being flown from the public-officesI asked two questions upon the subject, which were reported in Hansard. The first question was asked on the 21st November, 10,01, and was addressed to the then Prime Minister, now his Honour Mr bolised by the larger star underneath them. Justice Barton. His reply was that the matter was still before the Colonial Office. Then, on the 30th July, 1902, I addressed another question to the honourable member for Ballarat, because the flag had not even then been used; and I was told that its use was still unauthorized. But, because of the attention directed to the matter by. mv questions, a cablegram was sent to the Colonial Office, with the result that shortly afterwards the selected design was gazetted, and a coloured copy of it, together with a full official description, was printed and circulated with the CommonweaWi Gazette. I was then informed, as will be seen by reference to Hansard, that the selection of the design had been made by the Ministry at the request of the Imperial authorities, and that the design accepted and authorized was the official Australian flag. Since then the position has been that the Ministry have had a flag, but haye not known what to do with it. _ Possibly the members of the late Administration were rather sorry that they had anything to do with the matter, because they saw that, if the official Australian flag were used it would have to be flown from the ships of the fleet paid for and controlled by Australia, while the British flag would be flown from the vessels partly paid for by Australia, but entirely under ^ P ^ ^ ; trol. It seems to me that the fact that this distinction will have to be made has kept the Government from insisting upon the flying of the flag from vessels lake the Cerberus, the Victorian gunboats, and other vessels of war owned by the Commonwealth, and it has been rarely flown even When at anv military function the Military Forces of the Commonwealth are marched past a saluting base to salute the flag of their country, the Australian flag is; always conspicuous by its absence. Whether that is due to the 'fact that the General Officer Commanding is an Imperial officer, and would not stand under the Australian flag, I am not prepared to say. and is honoured all the same. should be remembered that the Australian -1 Fla &flag bears the Jack, and there is no idea of separation involved in its use. By the Jack in its corner it symbolises the history of the old country, whilst, in addition, we have the States symbolised by distinctive stars, and the Commonwealth itself symWhen we have an Australian flag, it is difficult to understand why it should not be used. I have experienced a good deal of difficulty in my efforts to induce the Department to take any step in regard to this matter. BeforeI gave notice of the motion I am moving to-day, I tried to get the Department to take action. I wrote first of all to the then Prime Minister on the 16th April, 1903, calling his attention to the fact that a flag other than the Australian flag was flown at the recent military encampment, and on the ships of the Auxiliary Squadron during the Easter naval manoeuvres, and that the Australian flag was conspicuous by its absence. I received a reply from the Secretary to the Prime Minister, which I shall read to the House, in order to show the position the Government took up in the matter : Dear Sir, I am desired by the Prime Minister to acknowledge your letter of 16th inst., calling his attention to the fact that a flag other than the Australian flag was flown at the recent military encampment, and on the ships of the Australian Auxiliary Squadron during the recent Easter manoeuvres. In reply, I am desired by the Prime Minister to say that his attention has not been previously drawn to the fact mentioned by you, into which he will make early inquiry. With reference to the fact that the Australian flag is not flown on the ships of the Auxiliary Squadron, the Prime Minister desires me to point out that, as these ships still belong to the British Navy, and that only a proportion of the cost of maintenance is borne by the Commonwealth, it is hardly a matter for surprise that the British flag is flown on these ships. I am, & c , T. R.

In consequence of the issue of the order, I The Secretary to the Prime Minister writing wrote to the Prime Minister on the 28th me as follows on '26th January, 1904 :April, 1903, as follows: Dear Sir, I am obliged to you for your letter of the 24th inst., promising early inquiry into the nonuse of the Australian flag on Australian forts and ships; and would be glad if you would also direct your attention to a Gazette announcement, 1903/253, where the Right Honourable the Minister of Defence, only the day after the date 'of your letter, the 25th April, issued from the Department of Defence an order from His Excellency the Governor General in Council for the use on sixteen forts therein set out of the Royal Standard and the Union Jack, with f u l l details of their use, and containing the statement that they are to be used in certain cases daily and in other cases on Royal anniversaries and State occasions, the official Australian flag not even being mentioned. As it is possible that the Defence authorities consider the Australian flag a kind of inferior ensign, to be used only upon occasions when it suits the official mood, you will doubtless take into consideration this Gazette notice when dealing with the whole question. No reply was received to that letter, and I wrote again, and on the 18th September, I 9°3, I was informed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister that the whole matter had been referred to the Defence Department. I knew what that meant. The matter is still before the Defence Department, and remains there in what may be considered a proper grave for the interment ' of all questions which another Department finds it inconvenient to answer, unless this House is induced to pass some such motion as that which I submit to-day. Seeing that a new Ministry had come into power, I wrote on the 20th of January, 1904, to the then Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in these terms :. Dear Sir, I wrote your Department on the 24th April last, drawing your attention to the fact that the selected Australian flag now officially approved in London, was rarely, and on many occasions never, flown from the Commonwealth public buildings and ships; and, further, in a letter dated 28th April, 1903, called your attention to the 1003/253, in which the use of that flag on the Australian defences was completely ignored. On the 18th September last I was informed that you were obtaining a report from the DeI would be obliged if you will inform me been arrived at by you; and when we can expect the Australian flag to be used in the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth authorities. I have the honour, by direction of the Prime Minister, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th inst., with further reference to the question of the Australian flag being used in the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth authorities, and to inform you that the matter will receive early attention. It is still receiving early attention, and unless honourable members agree to pass some such motion as I submit, it will be impossible for* the Australian flag ever to be used. It appears to me that it was but a farce to have adopted an Australian flag, unless the Government of the Commonwealth intend to ' use it upon suitable occasions. I must say that the late Government under the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, proposed the use to a certain extent of the Australian flag. In the Navigation Bill which they introduced, and which I understand is now withdrawn, they had inserted a clause by which it was provided that the flag of ships registered in Australia was to be the English ensign, with the southern cross and a large star. That was a proposal to adopt the Australian flag for Australian owned ships, and if it is to be adopted, for use by Australian ships, it is a pity that it should not also be used in connection with public services of the Commonwealth.' If there is one feature connected with American school life, which I think might be very properly adopted in Australia, it is the institution of the National Flag Day, when the children are taught lessons on patriotism, what the flag of their country stands for, and what certain institutions mean. The late Senator Sir Frederick Sargood did his best to introduce that feature in Victoria by presenting flags to all the State schools. It is a pity that when children attending State schools in Australia ask what is the Australian flag, they should have to be told that, although one has been selected, the Minister of Defence is frightened to use it. PerhapsI should not say frightened; but Commonwealth Gazette' announcement Ministers have objected to use it, haveignored it, and treated it with contempt,.",14,Australian Flag

18,Mr Crouch,"On any and every day. AgainI was promised further consideration.instead of recognising it as the emblem of the Naval and Military services, and thus conferring upon it the most honourable associations. I trust that the. House will agree to the resolution, and that our flag will be accorded the position to which it is entitled. the House is very much indebted to the honourable and learned member for Corio for bringing forward this, question. Judging from the correspondence in which he has been engaged, it has occupied a good deal of his attention. I think I remember some previous reference to the matter in this House. I suppose that one of the reasons why the Australian national flag' has not been flown from our buildings is that a very long time elapsed before the Imperial authorities extended their approval to the design which was adopted by the Commonwealth Government. I think that the Australian flag should be flown upon all Commonwealth buildings, and that we may reasonably ask the Prime Minister to see that in future our flag is accorded the chief place uppn all great occasions. It is only proper that it should also be flown from the ships maintained by the people of Australia. The fact that it has not been so displayed in the past is probablv due to the circumstance that the officers of the Navy feel that there is nothing like the flag under which they have served in the past. They have, however, a duty to perform' to the Commonwealth, and they should discharge their functions under the conditions laid down by the Commonwealth Government. Even though our naval policy may be changed, I think the Prime Minister should take steps to insure that our flag is always accorded a prominent place, and that the youth of Australia are taught to pay it as much respect as h-u hitherto been"" accorded to the Union Jack. We have adopted the Union Jack as part of the design of our national flag, and upon the face of it also appears a representation of the Southern Cross, and 'a six-pointed star, which is intended to indicate the number'of States in the Federation. It seems to me that the officials of Downing-street have been too tardy in their recognition of the national spirit'which Australians have shown in adopting a flag which is intended to be emblematical of the Federal Union, and I trust that, the Government will do their best to correct their errors of omission. be almost childish. The flag selected, in an I have very much pleasure in supporting the motion, and desire to express my personal indebtedness to the honourable and learned member for Corio for having submitted it. The correspondence which he has quoted shows that he has treated the authorities with every courtesy and respect, that he has thoroughly investigated the matter, and that his proposal is entitled to the fullest consideration. the previous speakers as to the desirability of having the Australian flag displayed upon our public buildings upon all suitable occasions. Perhaps one reason why we have not seen the flag displayed to the same extent that some of us would have liked, is that its design is not one of which we can feel very proud. Personally, I have looked at the flag time and again, and have felt . almost disgusted, because, unless there is a very strong breeze blowing, the distinctive portion of the design is all b u t ' invisible; at any rate, its significance is hidden. I do not presume to say wh.it design should have been adopted, but I think that we have been most unfortunate in selecting the commonplace emblem which typifies the Commonwealth in that flag. At-some future time, probably not very far distant, the States will be further subdivided, and I should like to know what will then happen to that particular star^yhjeb*is intended to represent the number of the States. lar saw. ber suggests it would become not unlike a circular saw, or a childish representation of the moon. Whilst we may decide that the Commonwealth flag shall be adequately displayed, I think that the Government might very' well consider whether the design should not be submitted to experts, with a view to making it distinctly Australian, and of a design which will lend itself to possible, and, in fact, very probable, developments in the near future. I believe in the principle of the referendum as applied to matters upon which the people are able to form an accurate opinion, but I . do not think that the people themselves desire to take such a matter as this out of the hands of experts. The method adopted by the late Government, in order to secure the adoption of the design, appeared to me to almost similar manner, under the auspices of a Melbourne newspaper, is, to my mind, vastly superior to that which has been",15,Australian Flag

22,Mr Fowler,"As the honourable memadopted. It is a matter of common knowledge that a number of prizes were offered by the Government for suitable designs for a national flag, and I shall never forget the feeling, of amusement with which I inspected the work of the competitors. It showed conclusively that in asking the general public to express their ideas upon a subject concerning which they were not competent to form a sound opinion, an entirely wrong course had been adopted. To my mind the most artistic flag of the whole of the Australian States is that of Western Australia. A t the same time. I do not urge for one moment that the symbols upon that flag should be given any special prominence in the Commonwealth flag. Next to the Western Australian design, the prettiest ancl the most distinctive flag from a heraldic stand-point is that of New South Wales. The fact that New South Wales is the mother State, and that when her flag was adopted it was practically the flag of Australia, is quite sufficient in my mind to justify the Government in adopting it as the flag of the Commonwealth. In that emblem we have the Southern Cross depicted in the conventional form, which I take it is a better method of representing it than the Victorian method of reproducing it in its accurate astronomical form. sonally I take special exception to the enormous star.which appears in the Commonwealth flag beneath the Union Jack, and which, I have no doubt, causes in the minds of many who see it for the first time a great deal of wonderment regarding the particular portion of the firmament from, which the constellation has been copied. An Honorable MEMBER the first magnitude. star of such magnitude that it dwarfs the Southern Cross-whic h in itself is composed of stars of considerable dimensionsto very small proportions indeed, in fact, the whole design of the flag is puerile.

Consequently, I am not merchant flag of the Commonwealth-to be prepared to definitely state the opinion of the Government regarding the whole of the suggestions made by the honourable and learned member for Corio. One difficulty, however, presents itself to my mind, which would prevent the Government from giving effect to his proposal to fly the Commonwealth flag upon all vessels. Asi t is framed, his motion seems to refer only to vessels of the Commonwealth, but from his speech I gathered that he intended it to apply to vessels of the Australian Auxiliary Squadron. not fly the flag upon them. and learned member's pardon. I was under the impression that he advanced the opposite contention. Personally, I think there is every reason why the Australian flag should be flown upon all Australian-owned vessels. I quite agree with the views which have been urged by the honourable member for Perth regarding the undesirable character of the design of the present flag. It does seem to me that though it includes the Southern Cross it does not adequately symbolize our national life, and that it is not sufficiently indicative of Australian unity. Before we take any steps in Perthe way of displacing upon our forts a flag of which' we are all proudI refer to the Union Jack-w e should securea design w*hich is more in accord with the views of those who have taken the trouble to carefully examine this question.

If no instructions have been issued for the Commonwealth flag to be flown upon all public buildings under Federal control, I will see that they are issued. It is not an an urgent matter, but the Government and Parliament might very well consider the wisdom of substituting a more distinctive-design for a national flag than that which has been adopted. I have no objection to the motion but before effect is given to it, the question flags that are to be flown over public buildof whether we should continue to use the present flag, or adopt another which in our opinion is more appropriate, should receive serious consideration. inclined to agree with the.

I think that we ought not to deal with this matter with unnecessary haste. I am unable to say at present what Statutes or Royal Warrants relate to the flying of flags in the Commonwealth"", or whether we have any law on the subject. There may be an Imperial Statute governing the floating of flags over ports and other military and naval establishments. ing to the flying of flags on British vessels. that the Australian flag, once selected, shall fly over all Commonwealth buildings; but we should deal cautiously with this proposal. the Imperial authorities sending the Prime Minister to gaol in this connection ? sure that the honourable gentleman desires that all our proceedings shall be transacted with due regard for order.

39,' Debate (On Motion By Mr Watkins),"which tion by honourable members of the last Parliament. I may be pardoned for expressing the belief that tlie question is of far more importance than that which has engaged our attention during the last two weeks. In many respectis that debate has been marked by some of the characteristics of the discussions of the ancient schoolmen on such questions as "" How many angels could dance on the point of a pin?"" and other matters of that kind, to which the old Aristotelians used to devote their spare time. I trust that the consideration which will be given to this subject will bear as much relation to those discussions as does the Baconian philosophy to that of Aristotle. We come now to a question which is to be considered in the light of the philosophy Bacon brought into being-the science which resolves everything from fact, and judges everything, by the fruit it will produce. Whilst we have been engaged during the last week or two in the consideration of a . very serious matter, it seems to me that we have been somewhat discursive, and have certainly failed tb come tb a definite conclusion. I hope that the debate on this motion will be concise, and that as the result of it we shall arrive at a definite decision. When the question was previously under the consideration of the House, the late Treasurer remarked that if a report of a Select Committee was adopted by ths House it was usual to give legislative effect to it, and that the adoption of the Coinage Committee's report would necessarily mean the introduction of a Bill. But such are the exigencies of public life that Ministers very frequently do not give effect to the expressed will of the House in reference to matters of this kind. I ' am supported not only by the manner in which the report was received by the last Parliament, but by what I believe to be a very general belief on the part of the public, that legislative effect should be given to it. Earlier in the session-befor e the present Ministry took office-I . asked the late Prime Minister what despatches or other information bearing on this subject had been received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, or from any other source. I wished to know whether the Government had communicated with the authorities with a view to carry out the various suggestions contained in the report, and whether they had applied for information, as suggested by the Select Committee, in regard to the minting of the coins that would be neceswas shown in the quessary under the. proposed system, at such places as Birmingham and other cities where they are turned out by the million to the order of various Governments. There may have been some well-grounded Ministerial objection to the production of this information, and the late Prime Minister certainly took up the stand that the time was not ripe for the presentation of the despatches and other information which he admitted had been received. Now we have a new Ministry, and probably in the course of the discussion which may' take place, some member of it may see fit to reveal the nature of these despatches and other communications, and so assist us in coming toa conclusion upon the matter. I have alluded to what I believe to be a definite growth of public opinion in the direction of the adoption of a system of decimal coinage, and certainly in favour of coining our own silver and bronze, and retaining the immense seigniorage or profit to be made thereby. I have noticed from time to time, by what I have read in the daily press, as well as in special publications such as banking and insurance magazines, that considerable interest is being taken in this question; and although the Committee could not obtain from bankers and others in their representative capacity any endorsement of its views, I find that many bankers individually are strongly in favour of them. They see the immense saving of time that could be effected by the adoption of the decimal system, and know of no reason why this new nation of ours should not have the advantages which are to be obtained by coining its own money. The late Treasurer told the Committee that the difficulty was to get the ordinary working people to take an interest in the subject; but, contrary to that opinion, I find that the working classes take a much keener interest in it, understand its details better, and appreciate the many advantages to be gained from the system much more highly, than do the better educated classes. That they have taken a real practical interest in it is evidenced by the attitude of the many meetings I have addressed, and by the many letters which I have received from working people and bodies representing them. The electoral division which I represent contains probably one of the largest aggregations of working men in the Commonwealth, and there the question has been received with a good deal of interest, and my action in connection with it certainly endorsed. I feel sure that at the late elections I received considerable support beand there is a growing conviction on the cause of what I had done in securing the appointment of the Committee which reported in favour of the adoption of a decimal system of coinage. I should like now to refer very briefly to the Committee's remal system of weights and measures, will port, because, although the matter has been gone into before, there are now many new members present whom I wish to interest in it. I hope that they will read the document, and thus prepare themselves . to come to a conscientious conclusion on the whole subject. The Committee was one of the most impartial bodies that was ever got together in any Legislature. moved in the matter, the members of this House were, to a very great extent, unknown to each other. I was not then personally acquainted with more than two of the members of the Committee, and it was with a certain amount of difficulty that I succeeded in getting together the requisite number of men to serve upon it. Those appointed came from'different parts of the Commonwealth, and represented diverse interests ; and any one who goes to the trouble of examining in detail the somewhat voluminous report and minutes of evidence will see every indication of an honest and conscientious discharge by them of a public duty. came together with no preconceived ideas. Of course, I myself had a most definite opinion of the advantage of the decimal system of coinage, and of the profit to be gained by coining our own silver and bronze; but the members of the Committee as a whole had, I think I can say, no preconceived notions, and there was no general determination to report in favour of or against the decimal system. mittee sat for a considerable length of time, and took all the evidence it could. I regret that that evidence is not so voluminous as it might have been. It does nor contain the opinions of as many public commercial institutions as I should like to have had ; but that was no fault of the members of the Committee. We went to no end of pains in order to accurately gauge the average opinion of institutions representing various commercial and industrial interests, but with very inadequate results. The difficulty was that most of the representatives of banking and other companies were unable to speak in their representative capacitv. as the matter had not been formally discussed by the members of their corlowed up by the Colonial Oflice issuing letporations. But our report has led to the consideration of this matter by such bodies, Mr O. B. Edwards. part bf their members in favour of the reform which I am now endeavouring to get honourable members to endorse. The corollary .of this reform, the adoption of a deciintroduce itself at every stage of the argument, although we may try to keep it out as not having been included in the reference to the Select Committee. One of the great arguments used against a reform of the coinage is that it has not been proposed to accompany it by a similar reform of our system of weights and measures, many When I first people contending that the two reforms should go together. I shall deal with that question somewhat later. I wish now only to refer to the fact that, in the interval between the adoption of the Committee's report by the last Parliament and to-day, there has been a great advance in the opinions of the English-speaking world on the subject of the adoption of a decimal system of weights and measures. . Some two years ago the Parliament of New Zealand passed an Act making the metric system compulsory there"" after the year 1907, upon the giving of twelve months' notice by the Administration then in power. The Executive can, at any time after the The members of the Committee ist January, 1907, by giving the requisite notice, make the use of the metric system of weights and measures compulsory throughout New Zealand. It was the regret of many of the members of the New Zealand Parliament, when the measure was under consideration, that that Colony had not done what we here were trying to do, and secured a reform of the coinage in the first instance. Then, at the last Conference The Comof the Premiers of the scattered British possessions which assembled in London under the presidency of the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain, the question of the adoption of a decimal system ofmeasures was brought forward, and it was resolved that it would be desirable for the representa. tive men composing the Conference to consult their States as to the best system to be adopted. The representative of the Commonwealth complied with that resolution, and this Parliament forwarded to the Secretary of State for the Colonies a resolution strongly favouring theadoption by the Empire of a decimal system of weights and measures. The decision of the Conference was folters to various Governors and representatives of the Crown, advising them to inquire whether the authorities in their States and Colonies would favour the introduction of such a system throughout the Empire. I have had an opportunity of perusing the various replies,. and a great deal of other information which I regret to say I have not at my disposal in Victoria, as I was not aware tliat the question would come up for consideration to-day. These replies received from so many British possessions are distinctly in favour of the decimal system of weights and measures, and, although it was not a part of the inquiry, in many instances they express a very strong desire to see it accompanied by a reform in the direction of the decimalization of money. out the contention of the members of the Select Committee, when the matter was previously before the House, that it is inevitable that something will shortly be done by Great Britain and her numerous dependencies towards adopting the decimal system. The decimalization of British money must come, and there is only one way in which it seems to me it can-be decimalized-that is by the method we are asking this Parliament to adopt for the Commonwealth. The Committee having, in an impartial way, taken all the evidence which could be obtained, and having consulted all the authorities to be found in the libraries, and in the archives of the Colonial Governments, came to the conclusion that it was eminently desirable to retain for the Commonwealth all the profit and advantage of coining its own silver and copper coins, and that when this proposal was being put into operation, to reap the considerable advantages to which I shall refer later on, we should make use of the opportunity to adopt the decimal system. The members of the Committee were unanimous in determining that no other system offers such advantages as does the decimal system. As a matter of fact there is no other -system in the world. The other so-called svstems of monev are really not systems at all. never having been thought out or directly adopted as systems. the decimal system never originated anywhere by accident. because it was planned by the human mind, -before it was put into operation The members of the Committee were convinced, as have been the majority of people everywhere in the world where the subject has been discussed, that the decimal system is not only the best, but the only system. The Committee were then faced by a difficulty as to which of the many possible decimal systems they should report in favour of. We had to consider long, and carefully weigh the merits of the different systems in force to-day. The subject has been considered by many Conferences of the nations, but they have all been unable, so far, to arrive at what may be called a "" universal "" system of money. Any one who gives the consideration to the question, which I and others have given to it, is compelled to admit that no such thing is necessary. Universal money would not give us a single advantage that I can see, except that of assisting slightly commerce in a large way between nations by saving time in effectThis bears ing translations of money. But for the operations of 999 people out of 1,000 universal money would be of no advantage over any other system. The decimal system, no matter which is adopted, gives a distinct advantage to everybody who handles money, and that is to everybody who lives. When we came to discuss the different decimal systems we had to consider, the United States system of the dollar, divided into 100 cents; the system adopted by the Latin Union, originating in France, of the franc divided into 100 centimes; and also the decimal systems in operation in Germany and elsewhere. We had further to consider the decimal system that had been proposed in Great Britain. There were probably two or three slightly differing systems proposed in Great Britain, and we were forced to recognise the advantage of the definite millesimal division of the sovereign-that is, its division into 1,000 parts. The Committee, after long consideration, were forced to tha conclusion that, by reason of our connection and trade with the home country, the use of the sovereign in all our transactions, its world-wide celebrity and great credit, and the fact that all our records are being kept in pounds sterling, representing sovereigns, they must report in favour of that system which had They are the growth of accident, been demonstrated to be not only the best, but the only system for Great Britain. We On the other hand all believe that that system will ultimately be adopted by Great Britain. We therefore It is a true system, reported in favour of keeping as the gold standard and base of the Commonwealth coinage the existing British sovereign divided into ten florins. Under the system proposed the shilling would no longer be recognised by name as a shilling, but would become half-a-florin, and the sixpence wOuld become a quarter-florin. When we left the sixpence, and came at last into the region where we had to make changes, we found that we could not retain, except temporarily, the existing threepenny piece, because it is not a decimal part of any of the preceding coins. We had, therefore, to recommend a smaller coin the tenth of a florin, and another coin, a tenth of that again, which would give us a coin a little less in value than the existing farthing. scheme for. decimalizing British money is one which makes the least change, and creates the least friction. Those who have argued against the proposals of the Committee have said-"" You get rid of the penny; we could never stand that. We believe in the decimal system, and that it is the best system to adopt, but we must not get rid of the penny."" It is submitted that the penny is in such general use that we have penny stamps, penny fares, a penny box of matches, and a thousand other things which can be bought for a penny. But the people who argue so strenuously against getting rid of the penny, and at the same time say that they are strongly in favour of adopting a decimal system, must admit that they cannot get a decimal system without altering some of the coins in use under the present scheme. If we were to retain the penny or the half-penny as the basis of our system, we should have to alter the sovereign for some other coin, and could not remain under a decimal system based on .the retention of the penny. So that it will be seen at once that any idea of retaining the penny would involve a much greater alteration than the retention of the sovereign. The sovereign is intimately associated with our history, and in our records and statistics, values are expressed in sovereigns. It is well known that it was owing to the desire to ultimately decimalize the sovereign, that the florin was introduced by the British Government, and a resolution was passed a little later in the British House of Commons requesting the Crown to immediately complete that decimal division, by adopting the very coins which this Committee recommended. I think it will be admitted that the recommendation of the Committee presents, not only the simplest and easiest way of obtaining a decimal system, but also the only possible way that will ever be taken into consideration in the old country. Therefore, in order to keep ourselves in line with the inevitable trend of events in the mother land, it will be best for us to adopt the proposed reform. As I have said, the report was adopted in this House Mr G. B. by a majority of only three. That was a small majority having regard to the importance, of the report, but when a matter of this, description is taken up by a private, member, it has a very small chance of securing the consideration which might be given to it if it were made the subject of This a Government measure. It is well known to honourable members who sat in the last Parliament, that when we dealt with private business on Fridays, a number of members left for their homes on Thursday, and consequently private business was always dealt with in a more or-less thin house. Judging, from a personal canvass of the absentees, however, I believe that a much larger majority than was indicated by the result of the division would have been in favour of the proposals of the Committee in a full .House. I think that I may say, without any breach of that respect for private conversation which should prevail, that two,' or probably three, of those honourable members who voted against the report have since admitted to me that they were strongly in favour of the Committee's recommendations, and have expressed the view that I should continue to press for the reform. They did not, however, consider that they were justified in further incommoding the Government, which the florin and the shilling was already staggering under the large amount of work it had to perform. Most of the objections urged at the time were expressed by the late Treasurer, some of whose arguments answered others advanced by him. For instance, the right honourable member said that there was no advantage in a decimal system, and that no saving would be effected in the education bill of the nation. It will be recollected that the Committee pointed out that we might save considerably upon our education bill by adopting a decimal system. The right honourable member denied this, but towards the close of his speech, as reported in Hansard, page 900, he appealed for time for consideration and discussionin order that the people may be taught that the benefits to be derived from the simplicity of keeping accounts and the lesser schooling required will compensate them for the losses they will have to submit to in the first instance. The right honourable gentleman thus answered one of his own objections to the scheme. .Then, again, after saying that there, was no advantage whatever to be derived from the adoption of the. decimal system, he remarkedLet me say that among all the 'SchemesI Edwards. have seen I think the American is the best and the simplest. There can be no question as to its simplicity. If any change were; made. I should much prefer the adoption of the United States of America's system to that proposed by the Committee; but we cannot do away with the sovereign. If it is desired to' retain the. sovereign, as recommended by the Committee, it will be impossible to adopt the American system. The right honourable member said, furtherIn the United' SUates they have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty cent pieces, while, the dollar piece, which has been mentioned, is not very often used. They work out their calculations at so many dollars and so many cents, and the whole system is very simple. It has been well put by some of the witnesses, whose evidence I shall quote for the benefit, of honourable members. WhatI should like to point out is that all manifest advantages of the system of the United States would be secured by the adoption of the scheme recommended by the Committee, the only difference being in the name. The right honprable member stated that in the United States they had the dollar, which was divided into 100 cents, and that their system was verysimple. If the recommendation of the Committee were adopted, we should have a florin divided into 100 cents. The cent would not be the one-hunrjredth part of a sovereign, but the one-hundredth part of a florin. The idea was that the florin would ultimately become the dollar of the Commonwealth and of the Pacific. There were very good reasons for taking that ground. The right honourable member admitted that the dollar was not carried in America. It is too unwieldly a coin to be carried about, and the only coin really in use in America is the half-dollar piece. The same remarks apply to Canada. half-dollar is the nearest equivalent for the florin, which the Committee are proposing to divide into 100 parts. On the other hand, if we turn to the Latin Union system, we have the franca coin rather smaller than our shilling-whic h is used as a standard of value, but which is really too small for that purpose. In the florin we have a happy mean between the too heavy dollar of the United States, and the too small franc of the Latin Union. We should have a coin which could be carried with facility, and one in which we could express values with much more readiness' than if the franc were employed as a standard. under tlie United States system would be conferred upon us if the system recommended by the Committee were adopted. <It does not matter what coin is made the standard so long as it is a convenient one for carrying, and can also be used as the leading coin of account. If accounts are to be made up in dollars, that coin should be of such a size that it can be conveniently carried about, and I think that the Committee did well to adopt the florin as the standard coin of the new system. As was pointed out by some critics in the press, the system contemplates the division of the florin, and not of the sovereign, into 100 cents. ""Why should you say that your system is based on the sovereign?"" they ask. It may appear a little inconsistent, but it is plain that the florin is intended to be the central coin of that system. The reason for retaining the sovereign as the standard is to disarm the ridiculous suspicion that, in favouring the coinage of silver, the Committee were endorsing bi-metallism. If we told people that the florin was to be the central coin of the system, they would conclude that we were relinquishing a gold basis, and, consequently, we felt it' absolutely necessary not to depart from a gold standard We have retained the sovereign, but have introduced the florin as the coin of account, well knowing that, though we retain a gold basis, the habits of the people themselves will speedily establish which coin shall be used in expressing values and keeping accounts. Honourable members will recognize that, though the sovereign is the standard of the existing system-o r want of system-value s in excess of £ 1 are frequently expressed in shillings. Do we not often see suits of clothes quoted at 45s -no t at £ 2 5s.; or The at 55s -no t at £ 2 15s.? It is more convenient to the people that values should be expressed in this way. Similarly, we shall find that the public will adopt the florin as the standard coin of the system. We have merely to look to the -United States to discover that. In that country to-day the dollar is not the basis, of their system-it is the golden tendollar that is the standard. But the coin which really represents the gold system is the half-eagle, or 5-dollar piece, which is somewhat akin to our sovereign This coin stands as the very basis of the system, yet all accounts and daily transactions are reckoned in dollars and their hundredth parts, which All the advantages enjoyed are called ""cents."" I do not think that any objection can be urged to the system proposed, upon the ground that we recommend the use of the cent as expressing the hundredth part of the florin when we adopt destroyed, save a few dies. the gold basis of a sovereign, of which the require to be done beyond the gradual callcent is only the one-thousandth part. The ing in of coins, and re-coining them system is not interfered with if we call a under the new system. At this stage I wish farthing a "" m i l .

The late Treasurer gulate all questions of currency.

Whilst the right honourable member for Balaclava believes that there is something in the system, he does not think it would do for the Commonwealth to reap at one stroke all the profit that would be derived from its adoption. In dealing last session with the probable profits to be derived from the system, he saidAt all events, it is said that it would be over to the report of the Deputy-Master of £1,000,000. When I first saw that statement the Imperial Mint in England, who I felt that we should be prepared to suffer is the only authority upon the subalmost any inconvenience in order to obtain so large a sum of money for the Commonwealth. ject.

Whether we had a system discussion here. of decimal coinage, or adhered to the existing tional one, quantities being high, and silver system, there would be no difference so far as low, and those in charge of the Mint are that matter was concerned. The profit in either apparently most effective in coining silver case would be exactly the same. There is no difference between the right average annual profit for a considerablehonorable member and myself in regard to number of years past, however, has been that point. He admits that a saving is £500,000, a large portion of the silver to be made, but we differ in this way: I coined being exported to Australia, though say that the moment that the Commonwealth we have not shared in the profit.

The Committee agreed that the large profit of £1,000,000 which can be secured should be invested, and held against any possible dislocation of the relative values of silver and gold, so that, no matter what occurred, the Commonwealth currencv would be upon a safe basis. I should like to make it clear, because it does not appear to be thoroughly understood by . many people, that the profit I mentioned can be obtained, and to do so I shall refer Those figures were The year was an excepwhen that metal is at its lowest price. The It would not be ceding year; but it is due to the large num-The right there can be no disputing them, India is a the Mint, though the nominal value of the rupee is higher, in comparison with its intrinsic value, than is that of our florin. The Imperial Mint turned out 83,000,000 odd 41,000,000 odd Colonial pieces. They do a lot of minting in England for tha Colonies. The value of these coins was £9,090,000. We require in the £2,000,000 worth of silver coins used in Australia about 28,000,000 pieces, because great numbers of threepenny and sixpenny pieces are needed. If . honourable members will take the trouble to consult the report from which I am quoting, they will see that the Imperial Mint coined during the last year for which we have information, 125,000,000 coins of all denominations, the cost of the operation, inclusive of interest, rent, taxes, sums paid to the Board of Works, and all other charges which would be debited by a sound commercial concern, but exclusive of the cost of buying silver and gold, being £120,000. number of pieces issued, makes it evident that the cost of coining the 28,000,000 silver pieces required for the Australian currency would be £ 2 6 , 6 6 6, so that the estimate I gave when the matter was last under discussion-£30.000-is not very far beyond the mark. The right honourable member for Balaclava is of opinion that we import only some £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 worth of silver coins from England each year, but I think -that he has made the mistake of taking the average importation for a number of years back. The figures given in the last report -of the Deputy-Master of the Imperial Mint are these: In 1901, Western Australia imported £ 2 4 , 6 5 0 worth of silver coins; New South Wales£ 9 0 , 0 0 0 worth; and Victoria£ 7 2 , 4 0 0 worth. In the following year there was a falling off, Western Australia importing only £ 1 6 , 2 0 0 worth; New South Wales £40.000 worth; ancl Victoria£ 2 6 , 0 0 0 worth; the total importation of the Commonwealth for 1901 being £ 1 8 7 , 0 5 0 worth, and for 1902 £ 8 2 , 2 0 0 worth. It yvill be seen that the average importation of those two years is much greater than the sum mentioned by the right honourable member for Balaclava. In my opinion the estimates obtained from experts in regard to the value of the silver current in Australia are very much under the mark This conclusion is borne in upon me when I read the value of the silver imported and exported. unfairly before the House, and therefore I have to admit that certain deductions 3 12 should be made from the figures just given, inasmuch as a good deal of the silver imported by New South Wales is exported again to supply a Imperial pieces last year, and currency for the Islands of the Pacific. The florin, which the Committee propose to make the chief coin of our decimal system, is already known as the "" dollar of the Pacific,"" and is current every where in the islands which are dotted over thousands of miles of ocean to.the northeast of Australia. But, making this allowance, the figures I have quoted show plainly that there is more silver in use in Australia than the experts are prepared to admit. One has only to look to the circumstances of similar countries to show that that must be so. Canada is, perhaps, the safest criterion I can adopt, because, as the United States currency circulates, freely there, a smaller number'of English coins are required than would otherwise be needed. The English coins in circulation' in Canada are made That, divided by the total 'by the Royal Mint, Limited, Birmingham, a'sort of chartered company which does the extra work which the Royal Mint finds itself unable to get through. Last year 4,100,000 pieces were coined for the use of the Dominion of Canada, the value of the Canadian coinage amounting in 1901 to £ 9 0 , 0 0 0, while in the year 1902 £ 7 6 , 0 0 0 worth of silver coins were sent there. It must be remembered that the Dominion gets the. profit upon that coinage, less the actual cost. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Roughly, about 140 per cent. I shall deal more specifically with that question a little later on. Beforeleaving the report of the Deputy Master of the Mint, I wish to refer to some facts concerning the branches established in Australia. When the matter was last under discussion there was a tendency to consider that it would be desirable, if the Commonwealth took over the coinage of the whole Australian currency, to concentrate operations ; but I have since seen very good reason for altering my opinion that the Western Australian Mint might advantageously be closed,because the figures in the report from which I am quoting show that, although its operations previously resulted in a loss, they are now giving the best profit which is being obtained in Australia. The various mints are kept going by votes of the State Parliaments, in the nature of Treasurers' I do not wish to place the case advances. In some cases £.15,000 is advanced, and in other cases £20.000, and as the receipts come in the money is paid back",18,Commonwealth Coinage
40,Mr Bamford,"What is the profit?to the States Treasuries. the States made a loss on these transactions. Then came the time when a slight profit was obtained, which actual operations had shown to be necessary, and more skilled workmen being employed. Now the operations of the mints in New South Wales and Victoria are satisfactory in varying degree, while in Western Australia a very handsome profit is obtained. In New South Wales tbere has been a decrease of £2,815 H 1 r n e lected. That revenue amounted to £15,396, and the expenditure to £14,900, while a small balance carried forward made the profit to the State nearly £500. where we used 10 be able to show rather large figures, we seem to have receded last year.

At that time most of the gold used to find its wayout of the State, without going through the Mint; but now the greater proportion of it passes through the local Mint, with the result that the Master states that there was a gain of £6.930 to the Western Government on the working of the establish men during the last year. .satisfactory in one way, because, in considering any scheme of dealing with our own -coinage, we have to remember that it will be -necessary for us to make good any losses on the gold coin used in Australia, as well is the loss resulting from the wear and tear of silver coin. see that the Mints are already making a sufficient profit to enable us to defray the cost of rehabilitating all the worn coin of Australia. when we were discussing this aspect of th? question was the practice of exporting large numbers of sovereigns, which were used for the purpose of settling international balances, and which, immediately they reached the countries to which they were sent -notably down again. this was that we should, if possible, relieve ourselves Mr G. B. Edwards. For many years of the necessity of going to the trouble and expense of turning out sovereigns which were simply to be melted down again. economies being effected Not only thousands, but millions of sovereigns have been sent away to the United States in the course of a year, and have been melted down again in order to comply with the currency laws of the United States. The Committee strongly recommended that we should do what we could to adopt, for the purposes of export, a 10-oz. bar of revenue colgold, not minted, but stamped with a mint mark, guaranteeing the gold as being of a certain standard of fineness. This would result in a great saving of expense, and In Melbourne, would also afford those who desired gold for export purposes, an opportunity to send it forward in a convenient shape. The Director of the Mint in the United States points out that The unexThe gold coinage of the country is now being almost entirely stored, the Treasury holding about 500,000,000 dollars, and the cost of the coinage is therefore an unnecessary expense, inasmuch as when gold is wanted for export For the previous year the profit it is required in the form of bars. When we turn to He addsFor domestic circulation the public prefer This was the last Treasury certificates to gold coin. It is considered, indeed, that with some modification in the existing laws certificates might well be issued against gold bars instead of against gold coin. There, I think, we haye an endorsement of the practical suggestion of the Committee with regard to saving money on our present system of gold coinage. I have stated that the quantity of silver coin reAustralian quired for the Commonwealth has been variously estimated at about £2,000,000 This is very worth. I have reason to believe that that is an under estimate; but, for the purpose of calculation, and in order that I may be upon perfectly sure ground, I am assuming that £2,000,000 worth of silver coin will be required for circulation in Australia. I think, however, that I shall be able to Therefore, it is pleasing to show that more than that will be needed. The price of silver, in London, on 24th May, according to to-day's Argus, was 25 11-16 pence per ouncea rise of £d. Another point that cropped up per oz. since Friday last. It requires 1 oz. of silver to turn out 5s. 6d. worth of coins, or, to use the ratio given in Lord Liverpool's famous letter, every pound troy of silver should turn out sixtysix shillings . worth of coins. Here we have a basis for calculating the actual cost of the silver that would be required the United States-were melted to turn out silver coins of a face value of It appeared to me that £2,000,000. The amount of silver required a .senseless practice, and would be 7,272,726 ozs., which, at 2s. 1 n i 6 d. per ounce., would cost £777>575 12 s. 3d. Mantalini, we may "" d e m "" the 12s. 3d. That leaves us a clear difference between the first cost of the silver and the value of the coin, which we may regard as a first profit. Then we have to take into account the cost of producing such a large amount of coin. Honourable members will, perhaps, recollect that, by a rule-of-three sum which I worked out by making a comparison with the British system, I calculated that the cost of minting £2,000,000 worth of silver coin would be £ 2 6 , 0 0 0. I have, however, put down the amount at £30,000. This would, bring the total outlay up to £ 8 0 7 , 5 7 5 . This would leave £ 4 6 , 5 3 6 less of the experts have given a much lower gross profit than I said would be derived when the House last considered this question. That is owing to the fact that silver was then worth only 2s. o£d. per ounce. The effect of that slight rise in the price of silver has been to reduce the profit by that amount. silver, and Of turning out the coin, we have to make provision for wear and tear. average life of a silver coin is thirteen years, so that for some years to come we should have nothing to pay on that score. ( think it is safer, however, to make provision from the commencement for wear and tear, and I set down an amount of £ 7 , 0 0 0 as sufficient to rehabilitate both our gold and silver coin. has been carefully checked, by means of comparison with the various reports of the Master of the Mint, and I am sure would correctly represent the amount of depreciation. of a sovereign?

The life of a sovereign is much greater than that of silver coins, because it is not subjected to the same rough usage. upon the coinage of £2,000,000 of silver would be £1,185,000. I am prepared ro stand by those figures in spite of anything I think that, like the immortal that the right honourable member for Balaclava may care to say. If the Legislature chooses to derive this profit in driblets by spreading it over a number of years it can do so; but I think that we should be f u l l y justified in deriving it as fast as we could, by turning out the coin as rapidly as possible, under some arrangement with the Royal Mint, or with some private firm possessing the necessary facilities. I have estimated that £2,000,00 0 worth of silver coin would be required to meet the necessities p f the Commonwealth, but I believe that is a much less amount that we should need-althoug h many estimate. On page 15, of the report of the Master of the Mint, he gives an answer to some inquiries which"" were made from India with regard to the quantity of silver required for currency purposes. The Master of the Mint entered into some very abstruse In addition to the cost ,of the calculations, and came to the conclusion that in England silver coin to the value of Theu s . 5d. per head of the population was required to provide a sufficiency of currency to carry on the operations of every-day life. II f we multiply n s . 5d. by 4,000,000-the population of Australia-w e shall find it will give us an amount of £2,283,333. I d ° not think that the ordinary man in the Commonwealth requires less silver for everyThat calculation day purposes than does the ordinary man in Great Britain. If anything, I should say that the average man here carries more coin than the average man in Great Britain. Therefore, if the Master of the Mint is justified in coming to the conclusion that IIS . 5d. per head is required to meet the necessities of the people of the United Kingdom, we shall want £2,283,333 worth of silver coin to meet the necessities of the ComThe average life of monwealth. The Master of the Mint works out a similar calculation in regard to the bronze coinage, and estimates that i6-5id. Of course some soveper head of the population is required. Upon There that basis, we should require £272,221 worth of copper coinage. We can submit this calculation to another test. In Germany, in order to guard against the overissue of silver, it has been enacted that no This coin has remained unmore than 15 marks, roughly 15s., per head of the population shall be issued in the form of silver coins. If we adopted 15s. per head as thS basis of calculation we should require £3,000,000 worth of silver coin in The gross profit Australia. I do not think that we are likely to fal l into any trouble owing to the overissue of silver in Australia. We should scarcely be inclined to play "" ducks and.",27,Commonwealth Coinage
41,Mr Bamford,"What is the average lifedrakes,"" with the operations of such an institution as the Mint. If , however, it should tution; I am satisfied that this reform will be considered that there is any danger of an attempt of this kind we could provide that silver coins should never be issued from the Mint except in exchange for gold. In this way we could institute a certain automatic check against the over-issue of silver. If in exchange for gold, no profit could be derived by the Government from the issue of silver coin over and above that required for the legitimate uses of the people. If the people can obtain silver in excess of their requirements, the thing will regulate itself by the banks refusing to purchase it They will buj only, when from the needs of their business, they can see that more silver currency is required. I do not think there need be any apprehension that Ave shall make use of our power to manufacture silver coin ad lib. We can purchase silver for 2s. an ounce, and if we could mint silver coin without restriction, there would be no need for the introduction of many of the schemes which are proposed by honourable members opposite. would be no necessity, for example, to take over the gold reserves from the banks-a scheme to which I do not object, provided that it is safeguarded by proper regulations-if we could turn out silver ad lib. at 2S. an ounce, and obtain 5s. 66. an ounce for it. There need ' be no fear that the Commonwealth will do anything more than issue silver currency as it may be required for specific purposes of trade within our midst. But we have a right to appropriate this million pounds odd, fund it, and paythe interest upon it into the Commonwealth . Treasury. The ex-Treasurer took exception to that proposal. should not treat any portion of that sum as revenue, but should apply the whole of it towards the extinction of our national debt. His view is very much better than my own, and, therefore, I am only too willing to adopt it. At the same time, it would be a legitimate transaction to use the interest derived upon the profit secured from the adoption of the system as current revenue. But if the-Treasurer prefers it, I am perfectly prepared to agree to any suggestion which will have the effect of reducing, in however small' a degree, our national debt. I earnestly impress upon honourable members that the proposed, reform is a most desirable and practical one. Nothing can be urged against it, either on the score of honesty or of the letter of Mr C. B. Edwards. the law as it is contained in the Constibe brought about in England within a comparatively brief period. Whatever difficulties there may be in the way of effectingit at the present moment will increase rather than diminish with the lapse of time. If we intend to attack the question at all, the silver could be issued only sooner we do so the better, because our difficulties will never be less than they are' now. There is no reason why the Commonwealth should not secure the advantage' which is offered by the adoption of this' scheme, and apply the proceeds to the re-, duction of our national debt, or fund them for some other useul purpose. To those who urge that we can obtain all this financial benefit by getting the silver coined for us without adopting the decimal system, I would put the question, "" Is it wise, when we are adopting a new system, to embrace other than the best'possible one?"" If we are going to initiate any reform, before doing so, we should decide what is best under the circumstances. Having made our choice, it should be a system to which There we can adhere. No nation which has' adopted the decimal system has ever thought of discarding 'it. It is the' natural system. Many people appear' to think that there is some mysterious quality about the number "" JO,"" which makes it the only radix of a system of numbers. But I would point out that we can perform arithmetic with "" 12,"" or practically any radix we choose. There is no mysterious virtue about the number ""10;"" but a system of decimal currency exists : throughout the civilized world, with the exception of Great Britain, its depend1 encies. and Turkey; and I do not He thought that we envy Great Britain, her associate, in opposition to this reform. It is a great reform, which offers us a legitimate profit, and I have every confidence in submitting this motion to honourable members. adjourned. MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H KING ISLAND. Mr O'MALLEY (Darwin) I move_ That, in view of the enormous increase of the population of King Island and the magnitude of its agricultural and commercial importance (the island lying midway between the States of Victoria and Tasmania), in the opinion of this House the Postmaster-General should make arrangements with the Union Steam-ship Company for its steamer plying between Melbourne and'",29,Commonwealth Coinage
42,Debate (On Motion By Mr Batchelor),"Strahan, Tasmania, to call at King Island and to stay there long enough to deliver the mails at Currie Harbor or Sea Elephant Bay. As this motion i j not of a contentious nature. ancl has little relation to politics, I think that it may very well be agreed to without much debate. The facts of the case are that King Island lies abou midway between Melbourne and Strahan, and is situated in the middle of Bass Straits. It has become a very important place, and possesses a population of 600 or 700. These people have no communication with the mainland or Tasmania, save that which is afforded by a sort of antiquated tub, which plies between Launceston and the Island. Settlers there never know when this vessel wil arrive, and when it will depart. Yet the steamer Kawatiri, belonging to the Union Steamship Company, travels from Melbourne to Strahan weekly, and passes within six miles of Sea Elephant Bay. I desire the Postmaster-General to endeavour .to arrive at some business arrangement with that company, which will enable its vessels to remain long enough at Sea Elephant Bay, or Wickham, to land the mails. were unfavorable at one place, the mails could be landed at the other. They could then be carried on horseback to Currie Harbor, which is the chief centre on the island. This island has an important pastoral interest, and contains good fattening country. Indeed, some of the finest cattle come from there. The settlers are all pioneers, really hard workers, and substantial citizens of the Commonwealth. For a small additional expenditure on the part of the Postal authorities, these people would be enabled to send their produce to Melbourne, and to obtain a regular mail service. election campaign, I \vas unable to reach King Island, and none of the candidates could address the electors there. did not arrive there in time for polling day.

MrO ' MALLEY I claim that the population settled upon the island should be given every possible encouragement. The motion, which I have, submitted, really takes the form of a suggestion.

The port to be selected would depend upon the quarter from which the wind was blowing. If the steamer could not land passengers at one point she would be able to do so at the other. There is a landing place on this side of the island, which one might say is in the very track of the Kawatiri, that runs between Strahan and Melbourne.

49,Mr Conroy,"Would the steamer beSir passengers ? Mr O'MALLEY -Yes; but, as a rule, they are not landed at Strahan on Saturdays before 9 p.m., and a delay, of a couple of hours would be nothing, as compared with the advantage that the people of King Island would receive from the granting of this accommodation. The island has become, within the last two years, a most important centre of civilization. At present the mails are carried by a small steamer, which, I would not be surprised to learn, was one of the rowing boats attached to Noah's Ark, but, having been fitted with a steam engine, is now employed in this service. One never knows how long she will take to reach her destination. It is my desire that passengers and mails for King Island should be carried by the Kawatiri, and this arrangement would not involve any large increase on the cost of the present service. ber say that it would cost very little more than does the present service? Mr O'MALLEY -It would not largely exceed the present cost. member believe would be the increased cost ? Mr O'MALLEY I do not wish to make any calculations at the present stage, but we shall haye an opportunity later on to discuss it. I trust that the Postmaster General will accept the motion, and I am sure that he will have ample opportunity to give effect to it. sure that the Postmaster-General will give the motion his careful consideration, for it cannot be denied that the residents of King Island are far removed from many of the ordinary privileges of civilization. island is the largest in the straits, and its population, which consists of men who have made their homes and settled there, is undoubtedly a very deserving one. The land is fairly good. For grazing purposes it is all that could be desired, and as slightly increased expenditure that would a matter of fact the settlers are now supplybe necessary in order to extend the present ing the Launceston market with some of the finest fat stock that has ever been yarded there. This motion does not contemplate any interference with the direct mail and passenger service between Melbourne and Tasmania. The Kawatiri takes the northern course, and in voyaging between Melbourne and Strahan passes so close to the island that it can be plainly seen from her decks. Admittedly, neither of the harbors of King JOHN FORREST -Does she carry Island is first-class, but as there is one on each side of it, the steamer would generally be able to get a lee, and it would rarely happen that she would be unable to land passengers and mails. Honourable Members would be surprised to learn the irregularity of the Straits mail service. If the Union Steam-ship Company would deliver a mail once a week, alternating with the present service, the islanders would secure a biweekly mail, and I am sure that the expenditure which this would involve would be comparatively small. I can assure the House that the honourable member for Darwin has not made one statement as to the condition of the residents on the island that is no""t absolutely correct. We have there some 600 or 700 people, and their only means of comunication with the mainland or Tasmania is the small steamer from Launceston, which certainly cannot be described as a high-class vessel. possess a weekly mail service? do not have anything like a weekly mail.

If his inquiries show that it can, I trust that he will see that it is supplied. The House would readily agree to the mail facilities. markable that a thousand people living on islands within a few hours' sail of Melbourne should be cut off from mail and telegraphic communication with the rest of the world for so long a time as the honourable member for Darwin has mentioned.

I also agree with him that it is remarkable that apparently no attempt has previously been made to secure reasonable postal accommodation for the residents of King Island. Tasmanian Government, when the Postal Department was under its control, did not supply the facilities which honourable members from that State have so eloquently advocated this afternoon. them for years past. should have told us of the causes responsible for his failure. I am sure that the House would have welcomed a more ample explanation of his inability to secure these postal facilities. MrO ' MALLEY A large population has only lately settled on the island. island has been populated for many years, and I have not heard of any reason for a sudden influx of population: Mr O'MALLEY -There has been of late In many parts of my electorate the a very large increase. tutes a very good argument for the proposal. I am entirely in sympathy with the motion, The but I am not at present prepared to accept it as a direction to the Department to immediately make the suggested arrangements. It seems to me that the explanation of the position in which the people of these islands find themselves is that they have no suitable harbour accommodation on their coast line. That being so, shipping companies are naturally reluctant to allow their vessels to touch there. The honourable member for Darwin,and the honourable member for Franklin, have formed a rather economical estimate of the expenditure which would be required to establish the service for which they ask, and I fear that they will be somewhat surprised when they learn that the Union Steamship Company of New ZeaI f new expenditure were land, with which I have already communicated on the subject, require no less than I trust £ 5 0 0 per annum for a fortnightly service. that seems to be a comparatively small sum. ter from the manager of the Union Steamship Company, dated 24th inst., in which it is stated thatWe cannot arrange to call at the island each week, but we will be prepared to make a call each fortnight for ^500 per annum.

An earlier communication from the Union Steamship Company, dated 20th April last, saysThe difficulty we foresee is in arranging for landing at the island, as the depth of water at Currie Harbor is too limited to allow our steamers to enter, and Sea Elephant Bay is exposed to easterly weather.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) I know something about this matter, and can endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Darwin. Some three or four vears ago I made inquiries on the subject invself; and .having friends living upon King Island, I tried to ascertain why a better steam-shiD service could not be given to the place. The Tasmanian Government was applied to, but in all these matters it is rather slow. It must not be forgotten that at the time there was no steamer running directly between Melbourne and Strahan. The service would have had to be done .by is always the way steamers running from Launceston, and would have cost a great deal more than the service which could be provided by the use of the steamer now running between the I am not prepared to two places I have mentioned. The estimate of cost submitted by the Union Company is absurd. The work should be done very much more cheaply, because their vessel plies close to King Island. MrO ' MALLEY W it h in a few miles of it. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE Yes. The population of the island has increased very largely during the last ten years, and there is now a considerable traffic between it and Launceston. The steamer which plies between Melbourne and Strahan would not have to go much out of its way to call af few hours. I do not agree that it would be necessary to keep a boat upon the shore, because a boat could easily be sent from the steamer. Mr O'MALLEY -£2 0 is charged now for every time the steamer stops. Sir.

I think it is only right that the community should know exactly 1H2 sum of money paid to the General Officer Commanding. I find, by reference to ths oflicial papers, that Major-General Hutton receives a salary of £2,500, including all allowances, except travelling allowances. I know that, in connection with certain forces, three different kinds of allowances are provided for under the head of travelling expenses, living expenses, and route expense.;, the latter term being somewhat difficult to define.

If that be so, I do not approve of it. The travelling expenses of public officers of the Commonwealth are fixed by regulations which have been approved by the Public Service Commissioner and the Executive of the day. Those allowances are not of a haphazard character. They are absolutely fixed. Officers of the Commonwealth are allowed two things. In the first place they are granted the actual cost of their transport, whether it be by coach, rail, or otherwise. Then they are allowed a certain sum per day, which, as a rule, is regulated by the amount of their salaries. From the day they leave their place of residence until they return they receive this allowance, which is intended to cover everything. Their only other reimbursement is for out-of-pocket expenses, such as might be involved in the despatch of official telegrams. In the case of Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, his allowance was decided whilst I occupied Ministerial office, and therefore I have some knowledge of the matter. Originally he was granted his actual expenses. That arrangement continued for some time. It did not prove a very satisfactory one, because it was felt that it was undesirable to have numerous small accounts submitted to the Department, in some of which the expenditure was vouched for, whilst in others it was not. Eventually an agreement was arrived at which was based upon the Major-General's expenditure for more than a year. Under that arrangement the Commonwealth agreed to allow that officer £ 2 per day as travelling expenses whenever he was absent from Melbourne on duty. The amount covers all his expenses, with the exception of transport by railway. He has a pass over now. all railways. He is required to pay all his expenses out of the £ 2 per day to WhichI have referred. It is impossible for him to travel without an orderly. It would not be possible for any honourable member, if he occupied Major-General Sir Edward know Hutton's position, to do without an orderly. saddle through Queensland. honourable member had not as many uniforms as has the Major-General? a soldier. doing garrison work. cers are always allowed orderlies. for them. Service are allowed a soldier groom and a soldier servant. penses I have enumerated are covered by the allowance to Major General Sir Edward Hutton of £ 2 per day. I do not know that it is of any interest to the public to learn how many days were occupied by that officer in travelling to Tasmania and back. Surely, it is not implied that he charged for more days than he was absent! In my opinion, the more frequently he is away from HeadQuarters, the better it is for the forces of the Commonwealth. I would remind honourable members that the duties of tbe General Officer Commanding are by no means confined to Victoria, but extend to the whole of the Commonwealth. Of course, the longer he remains in Melbourne, with his family, the more comfortable he is. On the other hand, it is necessary that he should travel, in order to efficiently perform the duties of his office. Instead of having a General Officer Commanding, I understand that it is suggested by some people that we should appoint an Inspector General, who would be required to do a great deal of travelling. The question as to how many days Major-General Sir Edward Hutton was occupied in Tasmania is absolutely silly, unless he has done something which he ought not to have done. The answer to the third question raised by the honourable member is that the Major-General, on his visit to that",36,Travelling Allowances Of Military Commandants

I scarcely think that we are in a position to judge whether he was absent for too long or too short a period.

I am merely expressing my opinion, and I have some knowledge of these matters. The questions raised by the honourable member seem to reflect upon the Major-General, and in my judgment it is wrong to put queries which even insinuate a double meaning. I repeat that it is necessary for . Major-General Sir Edward Hutton to travel in order to faithfull y perform his duty. urge that he endeavours to spare himself, because he is ever ready to do his work. I do'not like to see the slightest semblance of a reflecton cast upon an officer who is lent to us for a short period by the Imperial Government. press me with the idea that there is something behind them, ancl beyond the information which is sought. If that is the case, let it be clearlv stated. with the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan. It seems to me that this motion could have been concentrated under two or three heads, ancl that then the information required by the honourable member for Melbourne, could have been asked 'for in the ordinary way, at a convenient time, in the form of questions. . I should be the last to endeavour to curtail information supplied to any honourable member. But I do think, with the right nonorable member for Swan, that in this motion there is implied an indirect attack on the General Officer Commanding the Commonwealth Forces. I find, in support of my contention, that this motion might have been narrowed down considerably -Looking at paragraph 2, for instance, we find that it is desired by the honourable member to know "" How many days Major General Hutton was absent on his recent visit to Tasmania"" ? I am quite convinced that three minutes' conversation on the telephone , , with the shipping company would have extracted that valuable information. Therefore, I do not think it was necessary to ask for it in this form. As regards the other questions, they mainly concern details of the expenses of Major-General Hutton when he has been travelling. Surely, with regard to those questions, the matter is equally simple. The honourable member might simply have asked what travelling allowances the General Officer Commanding received from the Government. That would cover almost the whole of his questions. Lower down, we find that the same information' is wanted for years back. I do not know whether that is necessary for the honourable member's purposes. Of course, if it is, I would not attempt to suggest anything that would frustrate the obtaining of the information. I would defer to his request absolutely. But, at the same time, it appears to me that the information could have been obtained from the Estimates. The allowance paid to the General Officer Commanding would give the honourable member the result at once. LookNo one can ing further down, we find that the honourable member wants to know the amount paid to the Major-General's aide-de-camp, and also whether he travels with a private secretary and an orderly. As the right honourable member for Swan very rightly said, it These questions imis absolutely necessary for the General Officer Commanding to travel with some servant, if only to look after his baggage. I should say that' it is also necessary for him to travel with his secretary, because, he has a great amount of secretarial work to do. In this connection, I should like to remind the House that some Ministers of the Commonwealth-ver y rightly, I think -hav e taken secretaries with them when they have travelled.

The honourable member for Wentworth suggested that the honourable member might have secured the information he desires as to the length of Major-General Hutton's stay in Tasmania, by telephoning to the Steam-ship Company; but it seems tto me that it would be infra dig for an honourable member to resortto any such source of information. Wh^ should he spy round the shipping offices? wouid have acted practically as a private detective ing Orders the honourable member is entitled to secure this information, and no exception can be taken to his action. Complaint is made of the action of the General Officer Commanding in taking his prderlv with him. But every officer in the British Army is allowed two men-on e to act as groom, and the other as a valet. He takes those men with him wherever he goes on duty and the British Government bear his living as well as his travelling expenses while he is so engaged. It may well be said that we are becoming very niggardly if we refuse to allow the General Officer Commanding to have even one servant in attendance on him when he is travelling from place to place in the performance of his duties. I was surprised at the interjection made some minutes ago by the honourable member for Corio. As a military man, he must know thateven the officers of volunteer regiments are each allowed a batman to polish their swords, and keep their buttons burnished. Surely the honourable and learned member would allow, the General Officer Commanding at least the privileges that are accorded to alieutenant in a volunteer force ? Last year I moved for a return showing the expenses incurred by Major-General Hutton and his staff in connection with his northern tour-inclusiv e of the trip to New Guinea-and was astounded by the information that I obtained. The amount paid to Major-General Hutton was exceedingly small, and I had to admit that I had discovered a mare's nest. I was under the impression that it had involved an outlay approximating I am unable to say what to £ 5 , 0 0 0. When the return was furnished, I at once saw that I was on the wrong track, and allowed the matter to rest. My opinion of Major-General Hutton is such that I feel satisfied that he would not take £ 1 from the Commonwealth if he was not justly entitled to receive it. In this respect. I also believe that mv honourable friend, the member for Melbourne, is on the wrong track. As to the appointment of a private secretary, I would ask bonorable members whether they do not consider that the General Officer Commanding, who has to control the-Military Forces of the Commonwealth in no less than six States, is. entitled to the services of such he done so he an officer. Could he be expected to personally attend to. all his voluminous official . correspondence, and to take notes of the many interviews which he has to hold. Whenever he visits Queensland, he invariably has long interviews with officers and others, and whether we believe in his system or not, we must all admit that his heart is in the work His intentions are undoubtedly good; and I believe that in ability he is second to none. The fact remains, however, that just as honourable members opposite consider that members of the Labour Party would administer the affairs of the Commonwealth in a curious manner, so many persons entertain the opinion that the",39,Travelling Allowances Of Military Commandants

They bear a certain relation to the salaries paid, and are as far as possible identical with the scale of travelling allowances sanctioned by the Public Service Board. seems to me as good an arrangement as can be made. In reply to the cavilling at the amount of money spent by the Military Department generally for travelling expenses, I would ask the House to remember that that branch of the service has of late been in a state of flux, or change, and a considerable amount of travelling has had to be done in connection with the re-arrangement of positions which has been necessary. The Major-General Commanding receives for his expenses a fixed sum. We, who know something about military matters, know that, although the right honorabr member for Swan did not, perhaps, clear.v express his opinion, what he intended to convey was that it is a cheering sign to hai'e military officer claims a right to take with at the head of our Military Forces an energetic man like General Hutton, who is always flitting about the various States of fence Department to say when the the Commonwealth. It cannot be very pleasurable to General Hutton to rush from State to State, as he does, in all"" weathers and at all times, and no one would accuse him of travelling in order to save money out of his allowance. I take it that it is very necessary that he should move round as he does. Whatever accusations may be levelled against him, he cannot l-e charged with not being energetic enough. Something has been said about his action in Tasmania. It is hardly in order to ref jr to the subject on the motion under discussion, but I should like to say that I look upon the action taken in that case as the turning point in the history of Commonwealth Defence administration. occurred in Tasmania was in the nature of a military strike. of us strongly favour the building up of a citizen soldiery. But we must have discipline even where citizen soldiers are concerned, and it is a good thing that on the occasion to which I refer we had a commanding officer who was not afraid to act. about military matters than I ever knew, have spoken very highly about General Hutton's He knew that whenever large bodies of citizens are concerned, attempts are made to bring political influence to bear, and it is a cheering thing to remember that he was not afraid to make the recommendation which he did. Mr Chapman. he would have to face hostile criticism, and that he might be blamed in this or the Other House, but, nevertheless, he did his duty. I myself have on many occasions felt bound That to differ from General Hutton, and to express my views plainly ih this Chamber; but I owe it to myself and to the country, whenever a public oflicer with whom I am acquainted or have come into contact is unjustly censured, to say frankly what I know about the facts of the case. With regard to what has been said about carrying servants and private secretaries about the country-as we all know, officers of high standing are accustomed to take with them certain attendants. In my opinion there should be a line drawn between servants and messengers. It is quite a different thing for the General to take a servant and for the Prime Minister to take a messenger about with him. But I hold that if a high him a private secretary and an orderly, it is for the Minister in charge of the Debounds are overstepped. Members of Parliament cannot go into these details. I take it that the honourable membei for Melbourne wishes to elicit information, so that when the Estimates come be. fore us for discussion, he will be able to say whether the lump sum asked for is too much. I hold a strong opinion in regard to travelling expenses. I believe that in many ways a saving could be made in this expenditure; but, as I have pointed out, a good deal of it has been unavoidable, because of the changes which have been in process. Now that these changes have been made, and men are settled in positions where they will probably remain for some considerWhat able time, the travelling expenditure of the Department should be reduced. do not for a ""moment suppose that Major General Hutton has drawn, sixpence more than the amount to which he is entitled for travelling expenses, and I do not think that the honourable member for Melbourne suggests that he has. do I think it. action on that occasion. able member for Swan and' the honourable member for Wentworth would be among the first to resent any dictation in regard to notices of motion.

The taxpayers are entitled to know what any and every depart-ment of Government costs. I myself am anxious to obtain the information for which the honourable member for Melbourne asks, because I wish to know how the travelling allowances granted to military omcers compare with those given to travelling letter sorters, who receive 2 s. 8d. per clay. The right honourable member for Swan spoke of an officer getting £ 2 a day. I do not say whether that is too much or too little, though to me it appears a very generous amount. WhatI am anxious to see is that justice is done to lower paid officials, such as the travelling letter-sorters to whom I have referred. In many small towns there are' only one or two hotels, where every person stopping has to put up. gone round the country with Royal' Commissions, and have found that we w-ere' charged no more than ordinary visitors. If a Railway Commissioner is stopping in the same town as a letter-sorter, although the one may be getting £ 1 or £ 2 a day as travelling allowance, and the other 2s. 8d., they may both have to stay at the same hotel and pay the same charges. I shall support the motion. honourable members that I have nothing to hide. in connection with the motion. I desire to procure certain information, and I have taken a course which a great deal of experience in the Victorian Legislature makes me think necessary. At the present time no one knows what the Militarv Commandant of Victoria receives in travelling expenses. AlthoughI hada pledge from the late Treasurer of the Commonwealth, when he was Premier of Victoria, that he would give me similar State information, I never got it. The general who commands 250.000 Switzers in time of war gets only £.2 per day. Personally, I have nothing against Major-General Hutton. I do not know this gentleman, and I have yet to learn to take a dislike to a human being whom I have never met. I should like, through the press if possible, to assure this gentleman that I have no animus against him. I hold that,_ in. my position as a member of this House, I have a right to demand this information so that the public, who have to provide these large' sums, may know exact!v how much is spent in this direction. ' I thank honourable members for the courteous way in which the debate has been conducted. Amendment agreed to. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.

As the debate appears to be coming fo a close, and, seeing I have that I am now free from all Ministerial obligations, I do not feel justified in remaining silent in regard to so important a matter as the transfer of the administration from the party with which I am associated to what is known in this House as the Labour Party. I should like to say, at the beginning, in view of the misstatements or misrepresentations as tb the political leanings or proclivities of members of this House, that I am now, and always have been during my political life, a protectionist. It ought not to be necessary for me to make such an avowal, but the circumstances render it necessary. I do not know whether the misrepresentation is intentional, and I am quite willing to admit for the sake of argument that it is quite unintentional. I have called myself, though no one else has so called me, a moderate protectionist; and during the twenty-one years in which I have been engaged in legislative work in Western Australia and in the Commonwealth Parliament, I have never changed my views. Since the inauguration of the Commonwealth I have, as honourable members know, served under two leaders, both representing what is called the Protectionist Party-firs t Sir Edmund Barton, and, more recently, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, Mr Deakin. Three years have passed away, and, being now relieved of Ministerial responsibility, I am quite free to say that I have always been a very open and candid colleague. I have never hesitated to express my opinions, which arc well known to both the gentlemen I have mentioned, and, to a smaller extent, to all",42,Travelling Allowances Of Military Commandants

138,Sir John Forrest (Swan),"Withmy colleagues. I may tell honourable members, that both these gentlemen are now political, friends, to a greater extent than they ever were before. That utterance should, I think, dispel any idea that during our association we did not work together with the greatest harmony and friendship. It would be impossible for me to say that every measure introduced by the Administrations to which I belonged, met with my approval; and the members of the present Government, when they have had longer Ministerial experience, will find that they have to submit to much with which they are not altgether in accord. real ancl vital importance to a Minister's principles and conscience, fore he takes such an important step in politics as to dissociate himself from those with whom he has been working. To take that course involves greater responsibility than may be imagined by those who"" have not had to take it into consideration. In such circumstances, a Minister has to consider, not only his leaving his colleaguesthat would be painful enough-bu t he has also to consider where he is going, and with whom he is going to associate. Therefore it is very seldom in the political history of our country, or of any country within the British Empire, that we find men associated in a Government finding it necessary to separate from one another. I should like also to say that I have always had the fullest confidence of the two leaders under whom I served in the Commonwealth Government; nothing was ever kept back from me. WhetherI agreed or disagreed with them, I always had, as I say, the fullest confidence of those two gentlemen, under whom I am proud to have served. I wish to repeat, that to-night I am free from Ministerial responsibility. I owe no allegiance whatever, which, in my opinionI say my opinion, and not the opinion of other people-is inconsistent with my duty to my constituents and my conscience. On me there is exerted no pressure, either from outside or from any inside caucus of any political party-n o pressure from a few individuals, who, meeting almost in secret, and calling themselves a labour council, may seek to bind me. Can honourable members opposite say the same? members opposite have to reckon not only of a question dealing with the subject, and with an outside caucus, but with a caucus inside. gentleman is wrong. said to be wrong in making that statement, but the printed documents of the Labour Party show that we are quite right. able gentleman not think that one caucus is quite enough for any reasonable man ?

On the contrary, I feel that I am at liberty to vote in a way that will commend itself to my constituents and to my own conscience. and learned member for Adelaide had to leave the Barton Government. Sir JOHN FORREST I shall refer ro the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide by-and-by. I desire, in what I have to say, to be very frank. It is my desire also, as it has been, throughout my' political life, not to exhibit any personal feeling. I wish it to be thoroughly understood that I have no personal feeling against honourable members, opposite, and I am urged only by a* sense of public duty to say what I shall say. We have worked together as friends for over three years, and though I may in some of my remarks upon honourable' members opposite be severe, I hope that what I shall say will not interfere with our friendship in the future. truth, we shall not mind. Sir JOHN FORREST I remind the honourable member that the truth is not always told in a courteous way, but I desire to be courteous, though there may be some difference of opinion on the point before I shall have done. A little incident happened yesterday, which shows how one may be misrepresented. I had noticed in certain newspapers a reference to remarks which were made by the present Minister of Defence.

145,Mr Carpenter,"S o long as it is theI find that the honourable gentleman has written and stated that I am suffering isome pique or disappointment on being relieved of the duties of my office as a Minister. If that is the spirit in which a simple question is to be received, I cannot help it. I believe that I was the honourable gentleman's best friend, if he only knew it, because there was Ian absolutely easy and satisfactory answer to the question I submitted, and the answer which I should have given if I had been in his unenviable position. If I had made any statement at a previous period of my life which was not justified, or which was not creditable to me, I should have said in answer to such a question"" It is perfectly true that I made the statement, and I very much regret it."" If the present Minister of Defence had adopted that course, the incident would have closed to his advantage. When a man has made statements which are not of a creditable character, concerning our public institutions, or public men, he is not entitled to expect, when he enters this Parliament, that he will be shielded, and will not be asked what he meant. I have little doubt that the action which I took in this matter will do good. It will show our public men that they must be guarded in what they say. No man is justified in designating people who are trying to do their duty, and who are doing the bravest thing whicn men can do when they leave their homes ancl kindred to fight for their country in a distant land, incurring all the disadvantages attending that .action, as bucklers,"" ""cowards,"" ""curs,"" or ""dogs."" I think lhat the action I have taken will afford the Minister of Defence the best lesson which the honourable gentleman could receive; it will be good for him and for the community generally. I leave the matter now, and add only that personally the honourable gentleman and I have always been good friends, and I regret to have to say anything that reflects upon him have enlarged it in the last few days, and the railway, too. to show how very unreasonable it is to suggest that, in the course I took, I was actuated by anything but what I considered my duty. We have heard excellent speeches from the honourable and learned member forBallarat and the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney. If anything were necessary to show that either of those gentlemen is fully qualified to lead any party in this country, those speeches gave proof that they are specially well fitted for such a task. It is no doubt to the credit of those honourable gentlemen; but they appeared to me to be a little too complimentary. In my opinion, the Opposition should never say anything very complimentary about the Government, but should find fault with them if they do wrong. If they do right, the Opposition should say, ""That is just what you ought to have done; you have done your duty; "" but if the Government does wrong, the Opposition should hold them to account for it. I do not think it was necessary for those who had just been dispossessed of their positions to pay compliments to those who had turned them out of office. What has occurred serves to show the kindly dispositions of those two honourable gentlemen, and, perhaps, how very superior they are in that regard to what I think I should have been under similar circumstances. I cannot forecast the future; time will tell what is to take place; but I do not look upon the present as a time of political peace. It is, in my opinion, a time of political war. What are the facts? We on this side have been vanquished; honourable members opposite are the victors, and they have taken possession of the spoils. member has spoilt my joke by saying "" That is the grievance.""

With very few exceptions our fathers came here, not as the inheritors of wealth, but in order to establish homes ancl better their condition in this new country.

But what is sauce for the goose may not be sauce for the gander. the honourable and learned member directly, and give him a little sauce. think that the provision inserted by the Labour Party is unconstitutional. If the High Court should decide against us on that point, we should hold that it is inexpedient under existing conditions for the Commonwealth to exercise any .control over the public servants of the States. We contend, further, that never in his wildest dreams did the honourable the Attorney General, who proposed at the Convention the sub-section of the Constitution relating to conciliation and arbitration, ever imagine that it would be construed in such a manner as to confer upon the Commonwealth power to exercise control over the public servants of the States. provision would strike at the very root of the Federation and the autonomy of the States. We said that before we resigned, and we say it now. In spite of this, however, it is stated in the press, and in this House, that the policy of the present Government is the same as ours. Our policy is the very. opposite of that put forward' by the present Government. It differs from it in the fundamental principle involved in the amendment proposed to be inserted in the Bill by the present Government. It is not only with the platform of the Government and the party behind it for this session that we have to deal. We know all about their programme, because, as they have so often boasted, they have published it in books and newspapers all over the country. There is a little difference here and there between the platforms adopted by the State labour leagues. The Victorian platform is, perhaps, a little wider than some of the others, but none of them are less wide than the platform of the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party. It is not their programme for the present session alone with which we are concerned. We might be able to wriggle through if that were all. Are we children ?. Are we goingto approve of a little bit of a programme because it is somewhat in accord with the views of some honourable members on this side of the r House? The members of the late Government are absolutely opposed to the labour programme. We went out of office because we regarded their proposals with regard to the public servants of the States as unconstitutional. We sacrificed not only the emoluments of oflice, which are so frequently mentioned, but we forfeited something that was of much greater importance, namely, We still the control of the affairs of the Commonwealth. When any one talks about our being hurled from office, I hope that he will not suppose that the loss of the salary attached to the office is the important matter. It may be very convenient to receive such a salary-bu t the loss of the emoluments attached to the office sinks into absolute insignificance when compared with the surrender of the control of the affairs of this great Commonwealth. Surely it must be conceded that there must have been very strong reasons and influences actuating us, or we would not have resigned. I am dpposed to the platform and the methods of the Labour Party. I am opposed to the domination of any class, irreMoreover, we hold that such a spective of whether they are members of labour unions or otherwise.

178,But Those Sir John Forrest,"There arecontent to allow my Liberalism to be judged, not by my words but by my acts. I should like to say that there are, at least, haif-a-dozen great Liberal measures which I can refer to as having been passed into law during my Premiership of ten years in Western Australia at my instance. abolished all property qualification for members of Parliament. freehold property qualification when I went into office. I gave manhood and womanhood suffrage. I passed an Immigration Restriction Act in 1897, and I will tell honourable members what I said about the question at that time. It is practically the same Act that we have in force in the Commonwealth-and was based on what was called the "" Natal Act."" 'On the 15th November, 1897, when I introduced that measure, I used these words:The influx of coloured people into al] the Cololive upon it. The land was given free; nies of Australia has been a matter which has caused grave anxiety to the people of the various Australian Colonies. There has always been a difficulty in dealing with the question, and that difficulty I am sure is recognised by every one in this House, and every one in the Colony who takes a reasonable and moderate view of the question, and has any regard to the responsibility which attaches to dealing with the question. ThenI went on to comment Chamberlain had said at the ence in London about the pointed out that he had told us thatHer Majesty's Government have every expectation that the natural desire of the Colonies to protect themselves against an overwhelming influx of Asiatics can be attained, without placing a stigma upon any of Her Majesty's subjects on the sole ground of race or colour. I concluded what I had to say in moving the second reading of the measure-whic h was subsequently passed through both Houses of Parliament-by sayingThe position is a difficult one; but I think Chamberlain cover the whole ground; and he has not hesitated for a moment to say that it is our duty and privilege to try to keep ourselves as free as we can from the disadvantages which would follow the ingress of persons alien in colour, in sympathy, and in civilization, to our own countrymen. He has not hesitated to say that it is'our duty to try to protect ourselves as far as we can from those influences. Honourable members will, therefore, see that so long ago as 1897, I introduced a measure on these lines. ceedingly well. ministered faithfully and fairly, and there has been no objection to it by any large section of the community. Immigration Act, I introduced and carried through Parliament a Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It was the first measure oi its kind in Australia, if we except the South Australian Act, which has never proved to be of any use. I can say this, without any egotism-that if I had not supported that Act, it could not have been passed at that time. I also passed a PayI ment of Members Act. I do not take all the credit for that, because I was' not at There was a £500 first in favour of it ; but certainly it could not have been passed without my assistance. I passed dozens of Bills that were beneficial and liberal in their character, but there is one other, the principle of which might be introduced in other States, which I may mention. I introduced a Biil in 1894I think that was the date-givin g to any man in Western Australia, whether he had recently come in as an immigrant, or was previously settled there, 160 acres of land, on condition that he would go arid all that the settler had to do was to make some improvements upon it. Not only did we give the land free, but the Government lent money at a low rate, and on the easiest terms to improve it. I also passed through Parliament another Act, which is not, I think, in force to any great extent in any other State; that is, a Truck on what Mr Act, which makes it obligatory on employers 1897 Conferto pay their employees in cash, and not in matter, and stores. I passed many other Acts of a similarly liberal and progressive-character. But, sir, the point of the whole matter is this: There was no Labour Party in the Western Australian Parliament at that time. Honourable members who knew Western Australia in those days are aware that there was no body of men of that party sitting behind me, and urging me to pass such legislation. There was no. sword of Damocles hanging over my head. ber did not give them a chance to get into Parliament; they were in the country, and he knew that they were coming. master-General was one of those discontented people at that time. orable member on from outside.

I refer to his promise that if the invitation were accepted we should not be opposed by the Labour Party at the next election. The inference was that we should be allowed to enjoy a walk-over, and thus remain in undisturbed possession of our seats in this House for the next five years.

Let the honourable member look after his own seat; we will look after ours. We are not going to be bribed. the principles I profess, I , for one, should not be willing to kiss the hand that struck me a severe blow.

An honourable mem-bef opposite, I think it was the Minister of Trade and Customs, urged that, as the Ministerial Party was in a minority-and they certainly are at present-the y could do no harm, and therefore we should support them.

I should not have been inclined, I think, to go over to the other party in the hour of our defeat, and leave my friends behind me, on a matter of this sort.

If there is one speaking with regard to administration. thing which I abominate more than another, it is that people should strike, and, by so doing, inflict much injury upon one another.

277,Sir John Forrest,"Will the honorsire to say anything against the New South Wales Act, but I repeat that this is a ter.rible indictment, and it behoves us, as sensible men intrusted with great responsibility, to examine into the working of that measure before proceeding with a Bill of our own dealing with the subject. What has been said by the Chief Justice of New South Wales should be a warning to us to act carefully, and we shall act very foolishly if we ignore what he has said. We shall make a mistake if we sav, "" We do not care what the Chief Justice of New South Wales, or any one else, has said about the working of the Act in that State; we shall not take the trouble to look into it, but are satisfied that it is all right."" Having introduced a similar measure in Western Australia, I perhaps feel a greater sense of responsibility in this connection than do other honourable members. I was guided in the action I took by New Zealand advice and experience; but if the remarks made by the Chief Justice of New South Wales correctly describe the experience of the effect of this legislation in an Australian community, as reasonable and sensible persons we should look into it. posed in the coalition programme. orable and learned gentleman refers to is merely the heading of a proposed B ill . If there should be a coalition, and such a Bill were introduced, and if , even after it had almost reached its third reading, we found in it provisions which would not be to the advantage of the country, we should have only one plain duty before us, and that would be to amend it. that would be the best plan. the remarks of the Chief Justice of New South Wales constitute a terrible indictment against the New South Wales Act, and deserve careful consideration. I ask honor-, able members to consider the effect of it on Australia in the eyes of the British people. Who will embark in business under such conditions, as are described by the Chief Justice of New South Wales? When they are acquainted with the fact that such an Act is in operation here, are there any people in the old country who will be so stupid as to embark capital under conditions of that sort? ment of the Chief Justice of New South 3K Wales is not one which we can afford to treat lightly. It is one of the most important deliverances ever brought under the notice of this House. As a private individual, I should say that, if I had any money to invest in industry, I certainly should not put it into any venture in New South Wales, if the Chief Justice of that State has correctly described the way in which I might be treated. I imagine'that every one would act in the same way, and while those who have capital invested there will not invest more, they will probably withdraw what they have already invested as soon as possible. We, who afcfc in favour of the principle of arbitration, and who have taken action to impose such legislation on the community, are not, I hope, going to be blind ; and, if , after investigation, it is found that such legislation is likely to become law, we must reconsider our position. We must ""see that those provisions in the B ill which are not good are eliminated, and that other provisions are introduced which will make it carry out what we intend. Ave admit that. Sir JO HN FORREST -My own opinion is that the NeAv South Wales Act is' not being treated fairly by the persons for Avhose benefit it Avas passed. It appears to me that it is being run to death.

286,Sir John Forrest,"Thos e engagedentered Parliament some years ago, when I was Premier of that State, and has remained there ever since. We used to regard him as an extremist. He was a young and ambitious man, was full of fire, an excellent speaker, and possessed of a high character. He was imbued with the idea that no community could become great unless it gave its attention to social legislaMinisters, who have been their friends, than tion, even though there might not appear to be any immediate necessity for it. He used to ransack the records of other States with a view to find' desirable new laws, and when any measure took his fkncv he brought it before the Western Australian Legislature. He did not succeed in carrying many of these Bills, as all our time was taken up in providing for the new order of things brought about by the rapid progress of the Colony. I used to say that, although the proposals contained in his measures were in many cases very good, they were not required. I argued, for instance, that there was no use in legislating in the direction of establishing a minimum wage, when all the workers of the State were receiving wages far in excess of any minimum that was likely to be fixed. Now, Mr James, whilst he has been the Premier of Western Australia, has succeeded in placing on the statute-book a large amount of legislation of a more or less radical character. the Labour Party ever since he has been in public life. man should not forget to tell the House -that the Labour Party kept Mr James in power. parently do not intend to keep him in power any longer. Perhaps they kept Mr to support their own candidates when they and James in power for a time, because it did not, suit them to turn him out in favour of others who might be even less favourably disposed to them. Mr James has no doubt been a good friend to the Labour Party, and an advocate of advanced legislation. In the course of an interview on Wednesday last, he was asked why all the members of his Government were being so bitterlyopposed by labour candidates. The James Government is constituted of severaj men who were political opponents of mine. They were never tired of airing their liberal or radical views, and tried to impress on their hearers that they were far in advance of me so far as their ideas of liberalism were concerned. Now the Labour Party are not only opposing their friends at the hustings, but every Minister, including the Premier, has to fight for his life. The contests will be three-cornered in most cases, because there are three parties in the field. I venture to think that the Labour Party will exhibit more bitterness against the Premier and his against others, who have not been on their side. They will probably display the same spirit that was shown at the last Federal elections towards sympathizers and supporters like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Bourke, against whom, so I am told, their oppositionwas more furiously directed, than against other honourable members who had been openly hostile to them. Mr James, in reply to the question I have indicated, said thatThe cause of the workers never had a better or more consistent friend than himself. He is represented as saying, further, that I t was a wonder, after such long and practical sympathy with the workmen, that he and his colleagues shoul'd be opposed. He did not object to labour being represented in Parliament, but he objected to the attempt to make unionism the exclusive mouthpiece of labour in Parliament. Mr James, who was opposed to me in politics-althoug h we have always been very good friends apart from thatHe has been a staunch friend of was supposed to be the "" white-headed boy "" of the Labour Party, and he worked hard for them. He was supported by the party against me, in spite of trie fact that I had given them good measures and good works, and had made the State a land' of plenty for all classes. Mr James went on to say thatHe sympathized with the desire of the workers their policy were progressive, but when the organizations claimed the exclusive right to represent labour, and aimed at making the party representation a practical monopoly of their organization, it was the duty of the people to plead for greater freedom and more democratic views. These are the view's which are entertained by one who has been considered a friend by the Labour Party for many years. the avowed opponent of the Labour Party for manv months. doubt that he is being denounced now, and that he is receiving the same treatment that was meted out to me.

Yesterday I asked the Minister of External Affairs if every passenger from Colombo to Fremantle by the mail steamers was to be hauled up before a Customs official and interrogated as to whether he was under an engagement for manual labour. The reply given was that immigrants are to be asked whether they are bond or free men. Unless they satisfy the officer upon this point, what is to happen?

He has directed thatA special officer shall be instructed to visit vessels likely to contain Austrian and Italian immigrants, and to examine all immigrants separately and carefully, particularly as to whether they are under contract to perform manual labour.

In the meantime all 'possible inquiries should be made by the officer to ascertain whether his suspicion is well-founded. If he comes to the conclusion that such person is really under contract, you.should report the matter as briefly as possible by telegraph, and ask for instructions. What will happen to an immigrant who, after being treated in this way, proves that he is not under contract?

The instructions which he has issued simply show the sort of slap-dash policy indulged in by this new Minister, who has had no But I may tell honourable experience at all in matters of this sort. It is evident that the Minister has not a proper appreciation of our obligations to the Empire. He must have forgotten altogether that incidents of this sort may make the position of the mother country very difficult indeed in regard to her relations with great and powerful foreign nations.

It is impossible for us not to-sympathize with the aims and objects of the Labour Party, although we have no sympathy with the methods they propose to adopt, because we believe that those methods, so far from increasing the prosperity and contentment of the great bulk of the working classes of Australia, will depress them still more than they have ever been depressed.

It is true that I did not always agree with the methods adopted, because they seemed to me to involve a marching that they ought not to have been brought into a House like this, which laid any claim -to advancement. One of the first shocks I received was in connection with the very vote to which I have referred. When I saw a body of men, with the exception of three, all turn round and vote in quite the other way, it showed me very clearly that they were not keeping to their principles as they should, and I have always regarded them with less favour on that account. At all events, they have come into power. not going to question the advisability of selecting a leader from a third party in the House.

I have sympathy with the Labour Party when they are willing to f o l low on the lines of sound legislation, but not when they join with a body which proposes the abolition of wagedom, and, therefore, a possible return to slavery; because, in slave countries, in the absence of wages, the workers are in the position of serfs. learned member not better prove the conI am nexion first? nexion The Prime Minister expressed his sympathy with the May Day Socialists.

MR CONROY I am speaking of the May Day Socialists, of whom the honourable member approves, and not of any other body of men. Kingsley's Socialism? it is quite impossible for the honourable and learned member to proceed, with interjections coming from two or three honourable members at a time, and being constantly repeated. I ask honourable members to give the honourable and learned member for Werriwa an opportunity to express, not the opinions of other honourable members, but his own. nothing of the May Day Socialists, because their movement had not started in his day. I am now speaking of a particular body of men, with whom the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ought to have no sympathy. The honourable member has taught in the Sunday schools of the community, and tried to uphold religion; and I should like him to hear a part of the programme of the May Day Socialists, whose principles are published in two newspapers, and issued in no fewer than twelve manifestoes. It is remarkable how, running through all these declarations of doctrines, there is what, if honourable members like, may be called a revolting idea. The only excuse for the I am a Socialist, and expression of sympathy by the Prime Minister must be his ignorance of the Socialist programme, and I expect from him a complete renunciation of the Socialist doctrines as soon as I have explained what they are. I shall begin with the collective ownership of land and the collective ownershio of all means of production. I have nothing to say against those proposals if they can be carried out; but if a man places his hand on my throat in order to get my share of the world's goods I shall take care to I have no sympathy have my two hands on his throat, and my foot on his stomach at the same time. It is just as well to let it be understood that 1 there are those amongst us who are prepared to fight for their rights; and before anything like the programme of the Socialist is possible there must be the bloodiest of wars, in which one side or the other will be completely wiped out. I now draw the attention of honourable members to the second proposal of the Socialists, because The honourable and there is no doubt that the expression of sympathy by the Prime Minister has been cabled to all the countries of Europe. important. the Prime Minister's expression of sympathy will be printed in all the Socialist journals.

Deville and his party declare that marriage is a regulation of property, and strongly advocate the suppression of all marriage, and the substitution of what is gloriously termed "" free love."" Mr O'MALLEY -What kind of business is that? is it for the Prime Minister to even seem to approve of ? these proposals were written, and who approves of them now? are approved of by the very men whom the Prime Minister has mentioned-Kar l Marx and Engels. clareIt is marriage which gives to the possessing class its hereditary character, and thus develops its conservative instinct. Marriage is a regulation of property, a business contract before being a union of persons, and its utility grows out of the economic structure of a society which is based upon individual appropriation. By giving guarantees to the legitimate children, and insuring to them the paternal capital, it perpetuates the domination of the caste which monopolises the productive forces. . . . When property is transformed, and only after that transformation, marriage will lose its reason for existence, and boys and girls may then freely and without fear of censure listen -to the wants and promptings of their nature . . . . the support of the children will no longer depend upon the chance by birth.

I had decided not to speak, but when the honourable and learned member for Werriwa made the attack, which he has done on-the party with which I am associated, by quoting obsolete documents, and then trying to fasten them on the supporters of the Government, it is time that some one made a reply. The honourable and learned member has been guilty of the most despicable attempt to assail the characters of political opponents that I have ever heard of in all my life. Had the honourable and learned member been a stranger to this Chamber; had he not known honourable members on this side of the House; had he not been associated with them for several years past, I could have excused him in quoting from documents of that character. But, as the honourable and learned' member knows us all personally, and knows that the members of this party lead honest, and 3L pure, and moral lives, for him to make such an attack was the most cowardly piece of work I ever heard of. if I knew only one prominent free-trader who had committed a murder in,New South Wales, should I not be the most cowardly man under heaven if I endeavoured to associate his conduct with that of men like the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, the Tionorable member for Macquarie, or even the honourable and learned member for Werriwa himself? It would be just as reasonable for me to say that I . had known free-traders who believed in bigamy, and to declare, therefore, that honourable members of the Free-trade Party believed in bigamy.. But. what. ..sort .of a man should I be if I were to make any such accusations against honourable members opposite? Should not I be unworthy of a seat in this House? The honourable and learned member has attempted to cast upon members of the Labour Party a slander which neither he nor any other honourable member can justify, and in these circumstances he should for ever hide his head in shame. made the disclaimer that I desired. I knew that he did not approve of these things, and I merely wished him to say so. for me to make any disclaimer.

The honourable gentleman told the House that the Premier of Western Australia had been for some time past a recognised leader of the Labour Party there. It is true that he has been known as a Radical, and has assisted to pass what we call labour legislation,' but he has never been officially conThe complaint was' made yesterday that nected with the Labour Party. He has held office almost entirely by the support of that party, but the fact that it is now in antagonism to him arises purely from his own expressed wish. Only a few months ago, speaking at a meeting at Bunbury, he publicly declared that from that time onwards he wanted only two parties, in Western Australia-the Ministerialists and the Labour Party. Having been challenged in that way, the Labour Party could not do less than take up the gauntlet, and they are, therefore, opposing the honourable gentleman now. I wish to make that statement in justification of their action, and to refute the charge that they are ungrateful to those who have led them.

I am still an independent member, and hope to continue so, although I sympathize with -many of the aims of .the Labour Party, and shall vote with them on many questions which will come before the House. the members of the Ministry are not business -men. NowI am a business man, and -have' had a workshop. When I entered that workshop I wished to see what my men had done for their money. If our masters, the people of Australia, could be brought here, they would find that we have done very little for our money during the past three months. I trust that this debate will not last any longer, and that if a no-confidence motion is to be moved, it will be dealt with as soon as possible. I have not had much experience in politics, and therefore I am new to the method of killing time with which I Sm now being made acquainted.

We were sent here to legislate for the welfare of the Commonwealth.

The honourable and learned member for Werriwa made a vile-attack upon the Prime Minister.

At this hour it is not my intention to say much on the general tone of the debate on the programme I submitted a week ago. I regret that so much time has been taken up with a discussion on what, after all, is only ah abstract matter, because I would have preferred much, if we had"" been able, to have a clear fight on the issue whether this Government is to retain oflice-if that issue is intended to be raised-o r whether 'we are to get on to the work of the country, and, by accomplishing something, justify our existence as a Parliament. I think that the complaint of the honourable member for JBass-that we have been sitting here'for about three months, and yet have nothing to show for our work-is justified. It is about time that, with the help of one side or the other, we buckled to, and gave some result to the country. With regard to the line of attack'which has generally, been f o lhonorable member for East Sydney-sai d lowed, of course it was quite within' the competence of the speakers to fasten'tlieir -attack, not on the programme of immediate' .work presented by us, but rather on the -question of whether our methods of organization are justified; whether we are acting with propriety in insisting on a man doing in our party as he is required to do in every party-that is, to sink his minor convictions -when a crisis arrives, in order that the matters which he holds to be of larger importance should be given effect to. That principle obtains in every party in'a State. The right honourable member for Swan, who -talked so much about the great independence that he possesses, had to subdue his intense desire to burst up the Commonwealth because, being in a Cabinet, he had to give way to the pressure of his colleagues and the circumstances that surrounded him. It is only the sheerest hypocrisy on the part of honourable members on the other side to talk about the rules of fhe Labour Party and the'ir organization, when they know, every Further than that T one Of them, that they must give way to If honourable members can party discipline if they are to accomplish anything under the system . of responsible Government that obtains in every British community. It is an absolute essential that we must give way here and there if we are to acomplish anything; and, I say that honourable, members, knowing that, were onlyspeaking for party purposes when they complained of the methods of the Labour Party. We have followed their example. It is true that our members exhibit a degree'of loyalty perhaps greater than that exhibited by members, of some other parties. show a greater spirit df loyaltv to principle in a programme ori which we are agreed. niore cast-iron than was the honourable member's party when he was Emperor of the West minded, the right honourable gentleman was running Western Australia there was hot a man, not merely in his party, but out of it, who dared to raise his voice in opposition to any proposal, because he knew that if he did he would be thrown into outer darkness without the semblance of a trial.'

I have, however, just as keena regard for the reputation of my party' generally as I have for my own, and I felt it deeply that it should be suggested that any of us sympathized with free love, or the breaking down of the marriage institution. It was a most shameful thing, in my view, for the honourable and learned member, who knows us so well, and knows the labour movement so well, to cast an imputation of that character upon us. He knows very well that no such sympathy is entertained by any man in our party. planations to the effect that I did not refer to the Prime Minister, or to the other members of the Labour Party, but to the May Day Socialists, of whose programme the Prime Minister expressed his approval. I said that the Minister did not know their programme. should not take as much notice as I am doing of what the honourable and learned member has said,' because, after all, I do not think there is .any man in this House who would pay the"" slightest regard to the arguments which he has used. I do know, however, that there is a certain section of the press in Australia which will note any insinuation of this kind, and spread it broadcast through the country, with. a view to injure, not us individually, but the movement with which we are associated. I put it to any fair-minded man whether it is right that those men who waited on me the other day-man y of whom T know to . be just as upright and clean living as any honourable member of this House, and who, whether they be right-or wrong, have made B.

Lecky says, at page 269Connexions which were confessedly only for a few years have always subsisted side by side with permanent marriages; and in periods when public opinion, acquiescing in their propriety, inflicts no excommunication on one or both of the partners, when these partners are not living the demoralizing and degrading l i fe which accompanies the consciousness of guilt, and when proper provision is made for the children who are born, He ""will not deny that. it would be, I believe, impossible to prove by the light of simple and unassisted reason that such connexions should be invariably condemned. He goes on to say thatThere are always multitudes who in the period of their lives when their passions are most strong are incapable of supporting children in their own social rank, and who would therefore injure society by marrying in it , but are nevertheless practically capable of securing an honourable do not approve of career for their illegitimate children in the lower social sphere to which they would naturally belong.
