Leave granted. honourable member for Bourke, speaking in this chamber, made a very serious attack on Colonel Lee, the Commandant of the State of Queensland, and it is my duty to place the House in possession of the facts of the case. member charged Colonel Lee with having embezzled £700 . from a speech which he made on Thursday l as t When the Board dealt with Sergeant Anderson, it said, ""Tour receipts are bogus, we shall not receive them;"" but Colonel Fry's receipts were accepted as genuine, and he was allowed to escape. Following the Board of Inquiry came the court martial. When I read the list of officers constituting the court martial, my mind went back a few years in the history of this country, and I wondered what justice could be expected from a body so constituted. mitted to quote from Hansardt the Assistant Minister leave to make a statement, and, no doubt, if the honourable member desires to make a statement on the same subject, the House will allow him to do so. tionIts president was an officer who some years ago was called upon by the New South Wales Government to account for £700 that had been advanced to him. At the time he was a major. His reply was that the advance hod been £300 in hard caBh, not £700, and that he had receipts from his predecessor for the balance of £400. Ho could not account for a penny of the £300,' however, and it was discovcrd afterwards that he had received the great bulk of the £400 for which he said he had obtained receipts from his predecessor. Out of £700 he stuck to £611. A Board of Inquiry was. appointed to investigate the case, its members being Colonel WaddeU and Major T. F. Knox, one of whom boasted that he was manager of the Colonial Bank, and the other that he was managing director of Dalgety and Company. Further on in the same speech the honS June, 1916. orable member saidI t is the man against whom these charges were made-Colonel, then Major, Lee-wh o was appointed president of the court martial constituted to try the Rabaul cases. He embezzled £611 of the money of the New South Wales Governmeut. Those statements constitute the charge brought against Colonel Lee by the honourable member for Bourke. I havo before me the report, of a Board which investigated ten charges levelled at Major Lee, as he then was. The inquiry was held in New South Wales, and each one of the charges was investigated by a Board consisting of three military officers and a private citizen nominated by the Government of New South Wales. MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON -What is the date of the report? shall read the charges, and the findin"" This is an extract on each of them.

9,Mr Jensen,"-evidence having been signed by the various witnesses, who at the time of giving their evidence were informed that, should the court so -desire, they might be called upon to make a statutory declaration as to the truth of the -evidence given by them. The charges, as set out in the above-mentioned memorandum of the Chief Inspector of Public Accounts, numbered 1 to 10, have been -carefully considered with the evidence given ""thereon, by the eourt, at twelve sittings, ,and the court have unanimously arrived at the following report and findings:1. The sum of £700 was remitted by this State to South Africa for advance on account of pay only of the Lancers. This charge is not fairly set forth. A telegram of advice is misquoted. It reads, "" To pay men of the unit/' and not "" For pay only,"" as stated in the charge. Although the documents advising the remittance of £700 to the officer at that time commanding the Lancers Contingent in South Africa duly set forth that the amount in question was sent for the pay of the detachment, the court is of opinion that Lieut Colonel Lee was entirely warranted in applying certain moneys, portion of this advance, towards making provision for the pressing needs of the officers and men of his command in the manner detailed in the evidence adduced. Further, tlie evidence shows that Lieut -Colonel Lee had no instructions as to how the advance should be expended. 2. That the officers and men of the detachment of Lancers having been paid in full by the Government of this State, the whole of this sum of £700 should have been refunded by Major Lee to the Treasury in cash. The framework of this charge is illogical and incorrect. It is affirmed that it was obligacourt that any statement showing an amount tory on Lieut -Colonel Lee to return cash to the amount of. £700 to the Treasury, whereas it has never been even contended by the Government of New South Wales that at any period he was ever in possession of money to that amount. The court, therefore, is of opinion that this charge is entirely unsnstained. 3. That Major Lee has only refunded £89 10s. 6d. in cash to the Treasury of New South Wales. The Court is satisfied that the explanation offered from the evidence before it, that the amount handed to the Treasury, viz., £89 10s. 6d., representing the unexpended balance of the money Lieut -Colonel Lee received and recovered out of £700 advance made to the oflicer commanding the Lancers should be accepted as* a fair and equitable settlement under the circumstances set forth in evidence. 4. That Major Lee's staff sergeant-major (Winoh) states that out of £400 ad. vanced by Lieut -Colonel Cox to officers and New South Wales Lancers. Under special cirmen, he (Staff Sergeant-Major Winch) recovered £345, which he gave to Major Lee. With reference to this charge, the court, at the outset, finds itself reluctantly compelled to this money for pay and advances. place on record an expression of its opinion concerning the general unreliability of the evidence submitted by Staff Winch (retired). The testimony, which wa3 so unwillingly given by this witness, conveyed a decidedly unsatisfactory impression from every point of view. The documentary evidence on which this charge is sought to be established consists solely of two rough fragments of paper undated (marked "" A "" and "" B "" ) , prepared jointly by the witnesses Blow and Winch, purporting to disclose a statement of advances made to the detachment. That statement was admittedly made out from memory some eight months subsequent to the period of the initiatory and main transactiou concerned, and the court is of opinion that there is no evidence to support Winch's alleged statement that he handed the sum of £345 to Lieut -Colonel Lee. 5. That Major Lee wilfully misled the Chief Inspector of Public Accounts by stating that Lieut -Colonel Cox had to account for £195, Major Lee having given Lieut -Colonel Cox a receipt covering this amount, which Lieut -Col. Cox produced to the Chief Inspector of Public Accounts on his return. The court is quite satisfied that Lieut -Colonel Lee did not ""wilfully mislead"" the Chief Inspector of Public Accounts. Lieut -Colonel Lee's receipt was not for £195, but for £8 15s. only, which sum forms the balance of Lieut Colonel Cox's unexpended cash. The £195 referred to was part of the moneys advanced by Lieut -Colonel Cox to the officers and men before Lieut -Colonel Lee took command, and, furthermore, the court is of opinion _that the receipt above referred to did not constitute a release. 6. That Lieut -Colonel Cox handed Major Lee in South Africa a statement showing £400 advanced by him as pay to officers and men to be recovered and cash £300 in adjustment of the £700. There is no satisfactory proof before the of £400, or any other sum advanced by Lieut Colonel Cox as paid to the officers and men and to be recovered, was ever handed to Lieut Colonel Lee in South Africa, as stated in the charge. 7. That Major Lee deposited the £300 to his credit in the Standard Bank of South Africa on 21st December 1899, and which he improperly used to pay messing accounts and to make advances to himself and officers, and that on 24th February, 1900, Major Lee drew cheques for £20 and £40, for which he has not accounted. The eourt finds that Lieut -Colonel Lee did not deposit the £300, as stated in the charge, to his credit in the Standard Bank of South Africa. The sum in question was actually lodged to the Official Regimental Account, and it is clearly shown in evidence that all withdrawals made therefrom were for the sole use and benefit of the officers and men of the cumstances, disclosed in the foregoing, the court is decidedly of opinion that Lieut Colonel Lee was quite justified in drawing on 8. That Major Lee improperly advanced £3, on 30th March, 1900, to ""Banjo"" Paterson. The court regards this charge as trivial, and exceptional circumstances surrounding the it has been satisfactorily explained by the eviwhole dence of Mr A. B. Paterson. 9. Neglecting, on his return with Lieubursement of that portion of the said advance tenant-Colonel Cox, to New South Wales, of £700 which came to his hand, as well as in January, 1901, to arrange for the rethat portion previously disbursed and unpayment of the £700 to the Treasury. The court recognises the fact that officially be allowed, and that Lieutenant-Colonel Lee there was delay, to some extent, on the part should not be held culpable or personally liable of Lieutenant-Colonel Lee in failing to adjust for them. the matter of this advance immediately on his return from South Africa. In this connection, as has not been vouched for has been expended however, cognisance should be taken of the wholly and solely for the legitimate requirespecial demands made by the Government ments of the detachment, on account of adupon this officer's time and attention at this vances of pay, which the inability to keep particular period in respect to the training proper accounts, and changes and constant and despatch of further contingents for sermovements of the men, had rendered imposvice in tbe war. It is likewise clear that sible of collection; also the adjustment of ImLieutenant-Colonel Lee was further impeded in perial pay accounts. Further, the court dethe task of adjusting his accounts with tbe sires to emphasize its conviction that LieutenGovernment of New South Wales by the necesant-Colonel Lee has not personally benefited sity of fulfilling similar obligations towards by any of the mone3's, but bas shown a will the Imperial pay authorities at the same time. ingness and desire to render every assistance The court, therefore, is of opinion that no to the Government of New South Wales in charge of substantive neglect in the direction endeavouring to arrive at an adjustment. indicated can be established. 10. Illegally retaining £55 15s. 6d., part recommends that the adjustment of the adof the £700, from the date of his return vance of £700 be made by dispensing with the to Sydney (January, 1901), to 2nd production of vouchers for those portions of November, 1901. The court, having in view the gravity of the amount of the war gratuity due and payable offence set forth in this charge, cannot but exto Lieutenant-Colonel Lee be no longer withpress its very deep regret that it was ever so held from that officer. preferred. Lee had been a business man, and seized with pression to its regret that Lieutenant-Colonel the official routine connected with DepartLee has been arraigned upon such slender and ments, he would have handed over this money generally unsatisfactory evidence as that upon at once; but, in view of the unsettled condiwhich the serious charges appear to have been tion of his accounts, he, it seems, considered based; and, furthermore, the court would take it would be sufficient to hand this comparaoccasion to mark its disapproval of the highly tively small sum in on the final adjustment. impolitic, and, in some instances, intemWhen called upon, he at once handed it over perate phraseology in which the various infrom a place of safe-keeping in his regimental dictments have been embodied. It is obvious office, showing he had derived no personal benethat hasty and ill-advised conclusions have fit from the retention of this money; and it been arrived at without due consideration of should be borne in mind that at this time the facts and figures bearing upon the case. Government was in his debt for war gratuities to the extent of £125 to £150. The statements in evidence, supported by a outset to sift the evidence submitted to the sworn affidavit of Lieutenant-Colonel Lee atAudit Department by the witness Winch, intached to this report, go to show that the unasmuch as it is clearly manifest that the adjusted balance of the Imperial pay, £5,364, authorities were entirely misled by the unreand the New South Wales advance of £700, liable information furnished by him to the in all £0,064, which moneys had been mixed Chief Inspector of Public Accounts. and handled together, represent disbursements for which vouchers have been lost or not unmindful of the fact that Lieutenant-Colonel taken, advances and pay to the troops unreLee fought gallantly and well in the defence covered, or for which no vouchers were held, of the Empire in South Africa; also that lie and general leakages inseparable from sucli a rendered signal and valuable service to his campaign.

While, under ordinary circumstances, it ing would be the plain duty of an officer intrusted underinLieutenant-Colonel with public moneys to properly and fully vouch kept for their disbursement, and the failure to do one witness so would be a most reprehensible dereliction daily in the attested, of: duty, the court, after very careful and exfor periods extending haustive consideration of the evidence, has come to the conclusion that, under the very time ilfr.

This being the case and having constantly and steadily in view the allabsorbing main issues of tbe campaign, viz., the discomfiture of the enemy and the safety and well-being of his men, it is quite intelligible to the court that Lieutenant-Colonel Lee might have been forced to neglect minor questions of accounts through lack of time and opportunity-suc h questions being, after all, only of small significance in relation to the paramount interest at stake. Notwithstanding that the court has manifested its entire disagreement with the conclusions arrived at by the Chief Inspector of Public Accounts in respect to the matters at issue, and, furthermore, has taken very marked exception to the phraseology in which the various charges preferred against Lieutenant-Colonel Lec have been embodied, it is still specially desirous of placing on record an expression of its opinion that Mr Brodie has been actuated throughout the entire proceedings solely by a pure sense of duty towards the Government.

Minister informed Parliament, the press, and the country that a court martial dealt with the case of Colonel Lee. There is not a word of truth in that statement. That is my first answer to the honourable gentleman. The report which the Assistant Minister of Defence has just-read to the House makes no reference to a court martial. The whole trouble in regard to Colonel Lee arose out of the refusal of Major-GeneralH u t to n to send him to a court martial. That is clear and distinct. All that the Assistant Minister of Defence has done has been to read the findings of a Board. by the honourable member, that this officer had embezzled £ 6 1 1 . whether it is not as much the duty of a Minister to defend the lowest as to defend the highest member of the Forces. such defence from him. ber is now going beyond the making of a reply to a statement made by a Minister.

It appears that there have been no specifications, and that a local firm of motor cycle manufacturers put in a tender for double cylinder machines, whereas it has come to their knowledge that the Department will be satisfied with single cylinder . machines, so that they have not tendered on a fair basis with those who have offered to supply imI n the .first place, the ported motor cycles of a cheaper grade.

CARE OF THE WOUNDED AT CAIRO "" BAN TAM "" BATTALION MISSINGPRIVATE TERS. MrM c GRATH I desire to direct the attention of the Assistant Minister of Defence to the following statements contained in a letter written by D r .

In view of this fact, w ill the Government reconsider their refusal to recruit a bantam battalion from Australia? I should also like to ask the Minister whether he is aware that the War Ofiice has authorized the formation of a bantam battalion at Glasgow, the minimum height being 5 feet? have a conversation with the Minister of Defence with regard to the first portion of the honourable member's question. In regard to the second portion, I have seen a published statement that the formation of such a battalion has been authorized.

I wish to have the matter looked into.

General) [3.20] -With the permission of the House, I should like to make a statement regarding the arrangements that have been come to as to the collection and delivery of soldiers' letters sent to and from Australia. The statement takes the form of the report of a conference between representatives of the Defence Department and representatives of the Postal Department. follows: Secretary, Postmaster-General's Department. In pursuance of arrangements made by tbe Department of Defence and the Postmaster General's Department, the following representatives of those Departments met at Victoria Barracks at 2.30 p.m. on the 26th May, 1915:Defence Department -Captain H. D. Wynter, Director of Personnel, representing the Military Branch; Messrs. C. H. Spurgeon and G. Sharp, representing the Naval Branch. Postmaster-General's A. J. Chapman, Assistant Supervisor Inland Mail Boom; and M. Moran, Assistant Supervisor Ship Mail Room. 1. The representatives of the Postmaster General's Department present at the conference expressed an opinion that the principal cause of the complaints re delivery of letters is that, in many cases, letters are insufficiently or incorrectly addressed. In consequence of this, a large number of letters which have been forwarded to Egypt have been returned to Australia as undeliverable. As far as the post office is concerned the mails have been despatched with great care, and all soldiers' letters received at the post-office at the time of the closing of the mails have been despatched letters addressed to Australia, the Conference by the mails for which they were intended, and letters bills have been received, proving their receipt. 2. With a view to improving the facilities for dealing with soldiers' letters in Australia and facilitating their delivery in Egypt or elsewhere, the conference submits the following recommendations:(a) That a special branch of the post office be established in the capital city of each State to deal with soldiers' letters, extra sorters being employed where necessary. (b) That separate mail bags be made up for Divisional Head-quarters, Divisional Artillery, Divisional Troops (other than Divisional Artillery), Light Horse and Infantry Brigades, Line of Communication Units and Reinforcements, in accordance with tables to be supplied to the post office by the Defence Department. (c) That separate labelled bundles be made up for each Head-quarters Unit, Regiment of Light Horse, Brigade of Artillery, Company of Engineers, Battalion of Infantry. Company of Army Service Corps, Field Ambulance, and Line of Communication Unit, such bundles to be included in the bag which is set apart for the formation of which the Unit forms part. Id) (i) That a special form (draft attached) showing the manner in which letters should be addressed be printed and issued to all members of the Australian Imperial Force with instructions that they inform their correspondents of the manner of addressing letters. (ii) That the press be invited to give The report is as publicity to this form and that same be published in the usual "" Mail Notices."" (e) (i) That an experienced warrant or non-commissioned officer of the Instructional Staff, with a knowledge of military organization, be detailed to attend at the post-office for a portion of three days per week, as may be arranged, to advise the post-office officials on any matters with which they may be unacquainted, Department -Messrs.

Most of the reservists left their families in Australia, and the Government decided. to pay the difference between the respective rates of pay in order to enable the families to live during the husband's absence. There is not the same disparity in the rates of officers of the Imperial and the Australian Forces, and the amounts paid to the Imperial officers are considered to be quite sufficient to enable them to maintain their wives and families in Australia. There is not, therefore, the same reason for similar treatment to be 'afforded Imperial officers, and the Government do not propose to take any action in that direction.

Nurses have no equipment, and no amount is allowed for equipment. They are allowed £15 for the purchase of clothing. They can purchase it anywhere, or make it themselves. Surgeons and officers are treated alike, and receive equipment free. They can purchase it at any place they desire, and an amount equal to the cost to the Department is allowed them.

CATTS (Cook) [3.47] I yesterday submitted some views on the subject of the supplies of the necessaries of life, and present conditions obtaining in the Commonwealth. I was asked whether I had any concrete proposals to bring forward. I have such proposals to submit, and the only opportunity one has under existing conditions is to submit them to the House. I say that, because at our own party meetings business is so congested that it is becoming more difficult to have a particular matter considered at such meetings than it is to bave it dealt with in this House. able members opposite will bave to come back to parliamentary government after all. MrJ . H . CATTS I have had a notice of motion before the meetings of the party to which I belong since October last, which it has so far been impossible to reach. I have had other urgent business connected with my electorate before the party for the last seven or eight weeks, and it has also been impossible to reach that. I should prefer, in dealing with matters of this kind, to submit what proposals I have to make to the members of my own party before bringing them forward in the House; but in this case ib has not been practicable to do that, and undue delay in dealing with a matter of such vital importance to the people would be inexcusable. It has been stated, particularly by ters arising out of the war -should be treated as non-party matters, and that we should put our heads together to devise the best means possible for relieving the necessities of the people.

I have been asked to submit some concrete proposal in this connection, and I believe that the proposition which I now invite honourable members to affirm w ill provide the requisite machinery for dealing with this difficult and very urgent situation. I offer the friendly suggestions contained in my proposal which will enable the corporate ability of the Cabinet to frame a policy and create machinery. details. The fixing of prices and regulating of supplies has long been an ideal of our party, and I cannot admit that our leaders have no practical scheme for giving effect to it . I have no desire to reiterate the statements which I made in this chamber yesterday. actually sent shipments of butter overseas, and had been obliged to bring them back againa ridiculous position for this Commonwealth to occupy; that we had exported £100,000 worth of wheat to a neighbouring Dominion, notwithstanding that a flour famine in Sydney is notified in the public press; and that, in regard to the meat supply, we have been laboriously endeavouring with insufficient machinery arrangements to ascertain what is the real position in Australia. Only to-day the Minister of Trade and Customs has assured us that this information will be supplied as soon as returns are available. I may mention in passing that these inquiries have been in progress for some time. I do not blame the Minister personally for failure to use the machinery at his disposal to the fullest possible extent to supply th© public with the desired in formation. But I would point out that there does reside in the Government the necessary power to create much more effective machinery than exists at the present moment. I urge, by way of friendly that the Government hibited more public-spirited Mr J. E. Catts. ness, more energy, more originality, and more ingenuity in attempting to devise extraordinary means to meet this extraordinary and vital situation. I would also remind the House that we have no method of ascertaining the position in regard to sugar stocks in Australia to-day. We are in the humiliating position that we must wait unti l Mr. Knox, the manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, condescends to inform us that if certain things are not done, and if certain arrangements are not made by his own company within a specified time, there will be a sugar famine in this country. Whilst1 have no desire to traverse the ground which I covered yesterday, I do wish to call attention to the fact that there is at present a conI f required, I can fill in flict of purpose as well as of action amongst the State authorities. We know that one State has prohibited the export of wheat to another State, and that there has been a veiled threat that a particular State will prohibit the export of sugar to other States. I then showed that we had that he would do so. MrJ . H . CATTS -The question has been put, "" What shall we do if Queensland shuts out its sugar from u s ? "" New South Wales is a good one, it must be equally good in the case of Queensland. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member for Brisbane assures us that the ex-Premier of Queensland threatened to prevent the export of sugar to other States. This evidences a conflict of purpose as well as of action on the part of State authorities. Some States are taking definite action in a certain direction, whilst others are not. There is no uniformity of action, and no adequate means are being adopted to protect the interests of the great body of the consumers. Quite recently a Premiers' Conference was held in Sydney. For that gathering to prove of any practical utility to the people it should have devised some scheme which would have enabled the States to take joint action, if not joint action between the Commonwealth and States. sentatives at that Conference were memcomplaint, bers of Labour Governments. might bave exMrJ .

124,Mr Gkoom,"A majority of the reprethe Conference, and therefore I claim that this Parliament should take the initiative. It is absolutely necessary that we should create machinery which will enable us to obtain accurate information regarding the requirements of the people, the movements of stocks, the prices of commodities, and the factors which influence those prices. We should be able to obtain that information expeditiously and regularly. That is one of the urgent necessities of the moment. . During the course of my remarks yesterday the Leader of the Opposition directed my attention to the fact that shortly after the outbreak of war the Government of which he was the head constituted a Royal Commission to deal with food supplies and trade and industry during the continuance of the present struggle. The Commissioners appointed were the Hon. Alfred Deakin, the Hon. Dugald Thomson, and Mr Knibbs, C.M.G. These gentlemen are well and favourably known to the public of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition specially directed my attention to the instruction given totbat Commission, which readsKnow ye that We do, by these Our Letters Patent, appoint you to be Commissioners to inquire into and from time to time report upon the supply of foodstuffs aud other necessaries of life required by and available for, the people of Australia during the war, and from time to time report upon the amounts of such foodstuffs and necessaries available, or likely to he available, for export, having regard to the requirements of Australia, and also to report upon any matters relating to conditions of trade and industry arising out of the war which, in your opinion, should be brought under the attention of His Excellency's advisers. Then follows some other matter which is not so pertinent to the scope of the inquiry, but which is more of a machinery character. I must confess that the instruction which I have quoted appears to meet some of .the necessities of the present situation. At the same lime, I do not think that the creation of a temporary body provides adequate machinery for dealing with the position in which we find ourselves. continues until it is revoked, but this particular Commission was cancelled. ' Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes; but surely it was never contemplated that Mr Knibbs should leave the control of his great De[133] partment, go away, and give his time exclusively to the work which would arise * from a proper carrying out of the instruction I have read? The demand would be too comprehensive. I understand that even before the appointment of the Commission arrangements were made by the previous Government that Mr Deakin was to be a representative of Australia at the Panama Exposition, showing conclusively and positively that it was not intended that the Foodstuffs Commission should adequately cope with the present situation, because it would be impossible for Mr Deakin to act on both Commissions. somebody in his place. Mr J. H . CATTS -So, knowing that Mr Deakin was to go to the Panama Exposition, the previous Government appointed him to the work, with the knowledge that they would have to put somebody in bis place? the sort.

Is not that the best test? Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes; I will quote what the Commission did. It will be seen that it apparently took that part of its instruction which referred to export and trade matters arising out of the war, and that the supply of the requirements of the people of Australia is not a matterwhich engaged their attention. Mr J. H . CATTS I have looked through the reports. I intend to give the substance of them, and it will be seen that there is no report which deals with the internal situation as a matter of immediate necessity. the things which should claim their attention first?

130,Mr Greene,"Surely the exports areAugust last, and the last of the reports, I find, is dated the 31st October, eo that the inquiries extended over two months. I will not refer to the reports in detail, hut just mention the subject matter of them. The first report is dated the 7th September, and deals with tbe question of wheat and flour for tbe United Kingdom, British Colonies, and the Allies. The second report, dated the 7th September, deals with meat for the Allies. The third report, on the 8th September, deals with the carriage of foodstuffs to oversea Dominions and'the Allies. The fourth report, dated 9th September, deals with meat-canning orders from the British Government, and advises that an effort should be made to obtain such orders, and that, in the absence of them, the Government should go ahead and encourage the manufacture of tinned meats. On the l l t h September, tbere are reports -bearing on the prolongation of .the war, -and recommending that efforts should be made to induce the planting of crops; a report in regard to cargo in foreign bottoms being held up; a recommendation for an international clearing-house, and a report dealing with seized enemy ships. On the 16th September, there is a report dealing with enemy patents, and a report recommending cables to be sent in regard to prize courts. On the 30th September, there is a report in regard to enemy trading, and a report in regard to enemy vessels sheltering in neutral ports, and about to leave such ports. On the 1st October, there is a further recommendation as to communication with State Governments on the sowing of crops, and a further report on the question of increasing the output of locally manufactured goods as against goods previously coming from enemy countries. On the 8th October, there is a report in regard to the prohibition of tbe export of .oats from New Zealand to Australia. On the 13th October there is a report dealing with brands on goods to signify country of origin. On the 22nd October, there is a, report suggesting that the export of Mr J. fl. Catts. wheat and flour should be prohibited, and a recommendation that tonnage should be secured for the export of Australian meat. On the 30th October, there are further recommendations with regard to the proposal for an international clearing-house, the search of enemy vessels for guns in neutral ports, and action on the lines of the British Board of Trade; a report dealing with the treatment of mineral ores and wool, and a report dealing further with the question oi tbe planting of crops and communications with the States. And, lastly, there is a report in the shape of an appendix dealing with the probability of the local production of goods hitherto imported from Germany and Austria-Hungary. These appear to -me to be in their way valuable reports; they seem to be necessary. But there is no information as to existing or probable food supplies, except a reiteration of facts previously published by State statisticians. immediate problems. Mr J. H . CATTS -They did deal with problems which needed attention; but, as I said at the beginning, it is quite evident from a perusal of the instruction that the part which made the most direct appeal to the Commissioners was that which had to do with Empire problems as against the internal requirements of Australia. Commission deal with the immediate necessities of the moment? Mr J. H . CATTS I submit in the light of subsequent events tliat while these matters needed attention there was an urgent necessity at that time for dealing with the question of stocks of sugar, flour, and butter, and supplies in existence, and likely to be produced, of the necessaries of life for tlie pedple of Australia. that they were urgent ten months ago. Mr J. H . CATTS -With millions of -men taken out of the avenues of production and sent to the war, and therefore becoming consumers, it was quite evident ;hat it was a matter of necessity and urgency that a special eye should be kept on the necessaries of life to see that no shortage occurred, especially when w« were exporting goods of this kind oversea.",20,Supply Formal Commonwealth Pood Svpplies

134,Mr Gbeene,"The urgency had notSo much by -way of reference to the Royal Commission. I am very sorry that it was put out of action until something better was created in its place. There could have been something better created, in my opinion, but such as it was the Commission was doing some good, and nothing has been put in its place. The Minister admits now quite candidly that he has not the machinery at his disposal to do any better than he is doing. I come now to the question of what power we have to do better. I believe that we have ample power. I have, or think we have, should be exercised to their utmost in tbe effort to deal with the present extraordinary situation. As I point out in the motion, we have our power in regard to statistics. That is a constitutional power, under which we are entitled to pass legislation empowering our Statistician to make inquiries, and prepare statistics on any matter arising in Australia. For instance, on a question of population, or goods, or anything else, we can instruct that officer to make inquiries, and report to us. Under that power we have authority to give directions that everybody in Australia shall present reports at such periods as we lay down for the information of the House and the Government. ""We could issue a proclamation compelling every producer, manufacturer, and holder of stocks to register output and holdings weekly in the same way as we compel electors to register their changes of address. If there is any difficulty in getting the information with the machinery at present at our disposal-and it is admitted there is the Government ought to take immediate action to augment the machinery, and correct its defects, and to see that the information is perfectly reliable and adequately supplied. Then we have the export power. The power to prohibit exports is almost unlimited in its scope. It has already been exercised, I am glad to say, in regard to wheat, flour, and sugar, and the export of meat, except for the Imperial Government, is also prohibited. The Imperial Government, however, has asked only for meat from the surplus stock of Australia. exercise of this power, the Government would have to ascertain the food stocks of the Commonwealth. [133]2 Mr J. H . CATTS -Undoubtedly . The power to prohibit exports, as well as the power to obtain statistics, authorizes the setting in motion of the necessary machinery. The British Government has not asked that we shall export meat required for local consumption; it asks only that wo shall send our surplus meat. The public of Australia should not be allowed to go short of meat when the supply of that commodity to the Imperial authorities is not a matter of urgency. If meat or other foodstuffs were urgently needed by bold that all the powers we our soldiers in the trenches, we should be bound to sacrifice ourselves to tbe uttermost to meet their requirements, but so far as one can gather from the press reports-and no other information has been given to us-ther e is in the communications which have been received from the Imperial authorities no bint of urgency in this matter. In addition to the powers that I have named, it must be remembered tliat the country is now in the throes of war, and that extraordinary powers have therefore been conferred upon the Government by the War Precautions Act. That Act gives Ministers almost unlimited power. In my opinion, it gives the powers which cannot be given by this Parliament in times of peace. War having broken out, the unexpressed power residing in the National Parliament has enabled us to pass that drastic measure known as the War Precautions Act, under which, it appears to me, the Government is authorized to act in any such manner as may be necessary to prevent the public interest from being jeopardized by causes arising out of the war. Ministers acting under the War Precautions Act have commandeered the output of the woollen factories, laid down specifications as to the quality of the material that must be manufactured, and dictated prices. If Ministers can do that, it is certain in the public interest they can act in regard to the supply of foodstuffs. Beyond and above all the powers that I have mentioned are the powers given by what is known as the law of eminent domain, the right which national necessity gives to every Government over and above the powersexpressed in a written constitution to do what is necessary to conserve the public",21,Supply Formal Commonwealth Pood Svpplies
135,Mr Joseph Cook,"Incidentall y to theinterest. Should it become necessary, the Government could order every individual citizen to do its bidding in regard to his goods, chattels, and all other possessions. To use an extreme illustration, the Government could strip us of our clothing to supply the troops, if the necessity were sufficiently urgent. There is hardly anything that one can conceive of that could not be done under this right to take whatever action may be necessary to preserve the existence of the nation; there is no limit to this national power. It is an unrestricted area of limitless jurisdiction. Putting together all the powers that I have named-the power to demand information for statistical purposes, the power to prohibit the export of goods from Australia, the powers set forth in the War Precautions Act, and the extraordinary powers-unquestione d in a time of wargoing beyond the expressed words, of the Constitution which are inherent in this and every national Government under the law of eminent domain-it must be obvious that Ministers have a source of power from which to draw, which they have yet scarcely touched, much less exhausted. I wish to repeat in this connection a statement that I made last night. It is not sufficient that the Government or individual Ministers should obtain occasional information when spurred to do so. We have received from the Minister of Trade and Customs detached pieces of information which are totally unrelated and without co-ordination. They have to be sought for in piles of Hansard, in which they must be picked out from a mass of other matter. This information has been given spasmodically, without aim or directness, and without any concern for related action. The chaos that is thus created should be reduced to order, and there should be organized aggressive and public-spirited action taken. At a time like this it is not only the duty of indiviventilating suggestions and proposals has dual members to make suggestions to Ministers, and to urge on them the need for action; it is also the duty of Ministers to apply their inventive faculties and ingenuity to search out, suggest, and try out methods for relieving the public necessities. Disjointed information' of an insufficient character has been given' to members from time to time. Undoubtedly it has been given with expedition. But Mr J. H. Catts. no concrete, energetic scheme for the protection of the public interest has been put forward. The duty devolves upon this Parliament of formulating a policy, and of creating machinery to give effect to it , and the first step is to invite Ministers in a friendly way to give the House a definite lead. Ministers should confer together, and, in their conferences, they should be actuated by the desire to do something, not by the desire to prevent things from being done or to put stumbling-blocks in the way of action, or to apply destructive criticism to every suggestion. They should confer, not in the spirit of conservatism, but with the desire to act, with the desire to create and construct machinery for the carrying out of well-considered policy for the safeguarding of the public interest under wise and energetic administration. I ask that the views that I put forward yesterday may be considered in connection with my statements to-day, because I do not wish to go over again the ground that I then covered. I have made these statements in tbe friendliest way, with the desire of offering a constructive suggestion for meeting the difficulties with which we are faced, and which, if not promptly tackled and dealt with, will increase in intensity, and in their destructive influences. I do not expect the Minister of Trade and Customs, who leads the House, to be in a position to say off-hand that suchand-such a detailed scheme shall be adopted, but I hope that my remarks may be considered by the Government as prompted by a friendly spirit, and by the desire to have something done to help the people in their present difficult situation. The motion which I bave moved gives opportunity for the submission of a scheme for this object. This means of been taken by me on previous occasions, and I submit my amendment for the favorable consideration of honourable members. My proposal ought not to be discussed in any party spirit, or regarded as primarily intended to be used in formulating a complaint against one side or the other. The best intelligence of honourable members on both sides should be brought into active play, and there should be sympathetic co-operation to obtain a remedy for our present difficulties. I should have been pleased if , at the commencement, it had been determined to make this a non-party session. There are matters as to which there will be a difference of opinion regarding their party or non-party character. posals non-party measures? Mr J. H . CATTS I think so. Proposals for the granting to the National Parliament of powers which it is absolutely necessary that it should exercise are not party matters. not, desire them for party purposes? Mr J. H . CATTS -No; for national purposes. Labour party's pledged platform. dictated by its super-Parliament. Mr J. H . CATTS I do not know that my views regarding the non-party character of any measure will be acceptable to every honourable member. The course of events in this Parliament has shown that we can deal with very little that is of a party character. We have not yet reached any matter having any party consequence. We have confined our attention to matters relating to. defence, the raising and equipment of troops, and the necessities of the people arising out of the manipulation and shortage of food supplies, all of which are non-party matters. Such matters will probably continue so insistent that Parliament will find itself unable to deal with matters of a strictly party character. I ask honourable members on both sides to approach the consideration of my amendment with the desire, not to tear it to pieces, leaving nothing in its place, but to bring forward constructive ideas which will help the people out of difficulties which are, apparently, becoming more and more serious. The first portion of my motion asks that machinery should be -created for the purpose of supplying the House with accurate, reliable, and immediate information, and that the Government should supply that information to the House; the second portion asks the Government to seriously consider the difficulties of the people in this matter and formulate some definite policy, and, as soon as any other matter of urgency is disposed of, permitting this question to be considered in all its aspects, to indicate what their larger policy is, so that we may know that we have the machinery and a definite plan upon which to operate. It is because I believe the Government capable of determining a course of action to prevent the exploitation of the people, that, instead of submitting a more detailed scheme, I desire the Government to lead the House and the country. Trade and Customs) [4.27] I think' that most lionorable members are acquainted with the difficulties set forth by the honourable member that confront Ministers and honourable members, and also the people outside. I have no objection to the motion, but at tbe same time if we are to wait until we get the statistics for which it asks in the ordinary way, we must wait a long time. I quite agree with the honourable member as to the importance of knowing what we are dealing with before taking any action, but the difficulty is the delay in securing from the States tbe statistics they collect. The matter of the collection of statistics is in their hands, and though time after time the Commonwealth Statistician bas urged upon them the necessity for expedition, the production statistics for 1914 will not be available in Australia for another six months. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Minister requires more machinery for getting them. State Ministers the need for hurrying the collection of their figures. It should be a much easier matter to collect information in regard to factories than to collest statistics in regard to stocks aa required by the honourable member; but as that information is not available until ten or eleven months after the period covered by it has been completed, what opportunity bave we to secure that information which the honourable member desires? What the honourable member is aiming at I have been aiming at ever since I have been in this Parliament.

On the 22nd October, a month after wo had acted, the Commission reviewed the situation and, according to their reportFormed the conclusion, in view of the unfavorable harvest prospects, that the wheat now on hand and the 1914-15 crop would possibly not more than supply the needs of Australia for food and seed.

Our object was to secure trie work of refining it for to the quantities of sugar in stock made men iu the local refineries. I think that the action taken by fhe Government in that case was a proper one. If we had not taken it, this sugar would have been refined outside, and Australian workers would bave been deprived of the employment thus secured by them. Coming to the general question of the price of foodstuffs, I would say that if we can do all that the honourable member for Cook urges that we should do, then there is absolutely no need to ask the people of Australia to give the Commonwealtli Parliament increased powers.

Let me assure him, however, that the Government are fully alive to the importance of these matters. I ask him to withdraw his amendment on the understanding that I shall submit it to the Cabinet, and that we shall do our very best to safeguard the interests of the community. As I said yesterday, in reply to the honourable member for Bendigo, I think it unreasonable that people who have obtained meat for about 2d. per lb., and have placed it in cool chambers, should now be selling it at about 8d. per lb., taking advantage of the necessities of the people. Mr J. H . CATTS -Cannot. something be done to correct that? done; but it is not always advisable to state exactly what is being done. If you throw all your cards on the table, then your opponent knows exactly how to play his hand. I do not know what has been the effect in other States where large stocks of frozen meat are held; but the result of our action has been fairly marked in this State. I hope that the people will see that it is put beyond the power of certain exploiters to take advantage of the necessities of the people. It should not be possible for'these men to do in Australia what is being done by the Meat Ring in America, by freezing produce while supplies are plentiful and bringing it out and selling it at exceedingly high prices in times of scarcity, thus trading upon the necessities of the people. toria been unable to obtain meat? only at such high prices that many people are unable to buy it . The position lately has been somewhat relieved. If the honourable'member for Cook-will withdraw his amendment; I promise him that I shall bring it before the Cabinet and ask that it be given most serious consideration. I can assure him that I stand side by side with him in the desire that the utmost shall be done to protect tbe people in this time of stress. think tliat the honourable .member for Cook did well to introduce to the House this matter of tbe high cost of living, but, while I listened carefully to him, I did not hear him suggest any remedy for the evil with which we are faced. The cost of living has considerably increasedsince the outbreak of the war. I have gone very carefully into the matter and have obtained information, from what I regard as a most reliable source, showing that tbe cost of living to-day is £20 per month, as compared with £15 a month six months ago. That represents an increase of 33 J per cent., or 6s. 8d. in the £ 1 . The purchasing price of a sovereign to-day, as compared with six months ago, is about 13s. 4d. My sympathies go out to the struggling heads of families who have to meet this state of affairs, but sympathy without action is of no avail. I contend that it is within the power of the Government to take action. The Labour party for nome considerable time have made political capital out of this question of high living. They have dangled it before the people as a means of getting into Parliament, but have taken no action to deal with the question. Prices have gone on increasing from day to day, and the struggling masses have been left by them to meet the situation. member support the referenda proposals? cry for the referenda, then the House is being fooled. If we do not intend to deal with the matter effectively and immediately, then we are not doing our duty as the custodians of the rights of the people. We should act at once. If we had in office a good strong Government, it would act immediately, and would be prepared to take the responsibility. It is rather strange that, after all we have heard from the Labour party throughout Australia regarding the high cost of living, it should be a representative of a State which has been governed by a Labour Government for the last four years who has come forward with this proposition. It is rather significant that this wail with regard to the high cost of living comes from New South Wales, which has been under a",27,Supply Formal Commonwealth Pood Svpplies

I know that the sugar growers are prepared to come to a reasonable understanding to let the people have the whole of the Australian sugar crop at the price I have mentioned. Of course, it is of no use to criticise the Government unless one is prepared to suggest a remedy, and I hope that one of the results of this discussion will be that the collective wisdom of the House will evolve a remedy.

"" matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to the State by whose Parliament the matter is referred or which afterwards adopts the law."" The Government should, therefore, immediately suggest to the State Governments-fiv e of whom are Labour Governments-thei r comrades in arms in the great battle against the foe within the gates-to call their Parliaments together, and concede to the Federal Government full power to deal with the question of food supply. In that way the whole matter would be settled in a week or two, and this Parliament would have power delegated to it by at least five States to make laws to govern the cost of living. I put that suggestion, with all earnestness and sincerity, before the Government and the mover of the motion as a way out of the difficulty. It is all very well to say, as one honourable have to do is to discover the existing stocks member opposite interjects, that the Upper Houses will block it. Let us put the Upper Houses to the test.

It is endorsed to-day by men of all classes, and especially by men of standing in the legal world. The Attorney-General, in his discussion with Mr Mitchell the other day, said the Defence powers were the most drastic in the Constitution. That is exactly what I said on the floor of this chamber a few weeks ago. The Attorney-General said he would be a bold man who would dare to put any limits on the powers of the National Government at the present time. If that is so, in what sort of position do we stand ? We have refused to do anything to exercise our powers. We have power to maintain a well-nurtured Army and Navy. We have ample and unlimited power to protect the civil population against the rapacity of individuals. If , without trial by Judge The Minister of Trade and Cusor jury, we can intern private individuals at Langwarrin because we think their presence in the community is not beneficial, so under the same sinister power we can imprison any person who we think has done something inimical to the interests of the country. If ever tliere was a question of paramount interest to the Defence Department it is that of the supply of fodder. We had unlimited power to import from the Pacific coast, India, or the Argentine all the fodder we required for Defence purposes. Instead of doing this, which would have relieved the local market and kept fodder at a reasonable rate, we entered into competition in tlie local market with every private buyer. We the fodder ring to increase their profits; we put an embargo on every man who owned a horse and dray and made him pay enormously more than he ought to have paid. The same necessity for cheaper fodder is indicated by the allowance that has been promised to the mail contractors. It was the undoubted duty of the Government to import fodder from the outbreak of the war, and what is true of fodder for cattle is equally true of food for human beings. The Indian Government took charge of the wheat crop, fixed the price, transported the surplus to Great Britain, and the difference between the price realized there and tlie price paid to the growers of India went into the revenue of the Indian Government to help meet the expenses of the war. What they did we also could have done. The price of meat has risen; the price of wheat has risen. Even the price of firewood has risen, and the price of tea has gone up, although there is no drought in China. Yet the Government, who have absolute power over exports and imports, have not taken a single step to insure the supply of cheap foodstuffs to the people. We propose to put the referenda to the people. After we carry them, what will we do ? We shall do no more than we are doing to-day.",31,Supply Formal Commonwealth Pood Svpplies

Make no mistake about that It is exceedingly refreshing to hear the to know t h a t! the principles of the Labour, movement, and not to support any particular Government which does not uphold those principles. Honourable members talk about the referenda and of nationalizing monopolies, and yet they will not take a single step when they have unlimited power. Even with our present powers in the matter of insurance and banking, no step has been taken; and the chances are that, when it is proposed to move, it will be found that there is no necessity, every State having taken action. A Government, which is here to uphold the national existence can see men going to the war, and their wives and children practically starving owing to the enormously high prices of food, and all they can do is to t u r n round and say that they have no power to bosh, because they have the most extensive power possessed by a Government in any country. the Government have domestic powers sufficient to enable them to protect the common people from the ravages of enemies without and within .

260,Mr Penton,"Ask the honourable memyears ago, and I am speaking of trusts and combines said to be in existence at the present moment. If names are not supplied, the inference might be drawn that those allegations are being made for political purposes. Dr. member accept the name of Armour as representing a trust? names of trusts that are said to be operating injuriously in Australia at the present moment. Specific inquiries were made regarding an alleged Beef Trust, and none was found to exist; and there is information to that effect in the Department of Trade and Customs. It is strange to hear Labour members raising these questions as to cost of living against a Labour Government. In Queensland the Liberal Government was said to be responsible; and I think I hear the honourable member for Ballarat say ""So they were."" If we take the figures for 1914, which are the latest available in the Library, we find that the purchasing power in the various capital cities is represented by the following:-Sydney, 24s. I d . ; Melbourne, 22s. I d . ; Adelaide, 22s. 10d.; Perth, 22s. 10d.; Hobart, 21s. 10d.; and Brisbane, 19s. l i d an average of 22s. lOd. Mr Knibbs, in giving some later figures, adds a comment to the effect that it will be observed that ""Western Australia is the most expensive and Queensland the cheapest State. This shows at once that all those allegations about the high price of food in Queensland were merely made for political purposes. Wales, where tbere has been a Labour Government for years, we find practically the highest rate, namely, 24s. I d . in Sydney, as against 19s. l i d . in Brisbane. What are the remedies that are to be applied? What has the Labour Government of New South Wales done to reduce the cost of living? When it is sought to make political capital out of our present circumstances, it is only reasonable to ask the Government, as the honourable member for Cook has done, to frame some policy. Members of this House and Labour senators went to Queensland during the elections, and strongly denounced the late Government for doing nothing to reduce the cost of living; and it is only fair that a Labour member should now challenge the Commonwealth Executive to come down with a distinct policy. Mr J. H . CATTS -It is a friendly invitation. the Government should be asked to showliving. Complaints are made in Queensland and other States as to the high price of butter; but I can say that, in my own constituency, in many instances, the cost of production has been higher than the price realized in the market. While the price was 2s. per lb., farmers in many districts found that the cost of production was something like 2s. 6d., or, at any rate, considerably in excess of the return. Throughout the drought these men on the land found their stock dying, their capital diminishing, and their overdrafts rising; and yet the people in the cities were urging, as a magnificent remedy, the reduction of the price of butter to possibly Is. 3d. per lb. And similar circumstances bave prevailed in other directions. In New South Wales, with the wheat grab at 5s. a bushel, the return received by the farmer was, in many instances, less than the cost of ploughing and planting. Of course there were cases in which the fanner got higher rates; and I am onlyurging that such problems as these have to be faced squarely and fairly. All that the farmer gets as wages is produced out of the land. He has no Wages Board or standard wage for times of depression, but he must stand the brunt of bad seasons and all other untoward conditions. Yet, although a drought was over the land, the In New South only remedy suggested was a cutting down of prices below cost. If that is the remedy proposed by the Government, it is based on injustice and iniquity, and will bring its own retribution. No remedy will be satisfactory that does not do justice all round. If we are going to regulate prices we must remember what the farmer has to bear during bad seasons. He must buy agricultural implements and other goods manufactured in the cities under Wages Board conditions; and during the drought the rates of wages in the cities were kept at the highest. Thus the brunt of the drought, with its consequent loss and suffering, is borne by the primary producers. There is no suggestion that at such a time a Board should reduce the cost",33,Moloney Instead Of Deal With Me I T Is Not Within The Power

263,Mr Groom,"It is only right that,of the articles he requires-n o suggestion that boots, timber, or his necessary labour should be made cheaper. It is extraordinary that during a drought there is never any idea of reducing wages in the cities, but always the suggestion that the prices of the products of the primary producers shall be lowered. Such an idea is grossly unjust and unfair, and productive of the greatest hardship in the country districts. In all these matters the sense of justice ought to be the basis of our legislation, but I find that honourable members opposite, in their attitude towards this matter, deal only with the products of primary industries. Butter may be quoted as an illustration. That is one subject upon, which a good deal has been said. To arrive at the true position we ought to ascertain the facts. In 'the October-December Labour Bulletin Mr Knibbs statesIn order to obtain an accurate measure of the progress of wage-earners, regard must be had to tbe purchasing power of wages, and the index numbers based merely upon records_ of rates of wages, must consequently be subject to some correction, inasmuch as they take no account of variations in cost of living. Then on page 264 Mr Knibbs statesThe relative positions of the States. . . Whenever there is national distress, honis also of interest. Queensland is lowest but one in regard to nominal wages, but is nearly as high as Western Australia in regard to effective wages. In Queensland it is shown that tbe men enjoy just about the highest effective wages, and applying that test to butter as an illustration, we find that the only* burden the people in the big centres of Queensland are called upon to bear in consequence of the drought is the extra price for butter, which, at the most, amounts to a couple of shillings per week. There bas been no reduction in a standard wage at all. increased prices for foodstuffs is equivalent to a reduction of wages? that there has been no reduction in the standard wages, nor have the country people asked for that; and as tbe result of the increase of butter prices, taking that as one illustration, I suppose the burden, if increased, does not amount to more than 9d. a lb., meaning a small amount per week. burden that these people have had placed upon them. only item required in the household. but I point out that this burden falls upon the farmer to the same extent, because he is just as large a consumer of the necessities of life as the city man, and yet honourable members opposite do not consider him. exploited as anybody else. Do not try to make out that we are against the farming interests. then, that when dealing with the high cost of living, honourable members opposite talk chiefly about reducing the cost of articles which are produced by the primary producers. party was beaten in tbe farming districts at the last election. The farmers there were not gulled. districts stood by the Liberals. I say that deliberately. "" But the honourable member is drawing me away from the point by bis incursion into party politics. orable members opposite talk about the cost of the necessities of life, but as a matter of fact they deal with only three or four things which, as I have shown, are the primary products. They do not talk about reducing the price of the products of the factories in the cities at all. But I am not saying that they should. I am only asking for a fair and square deal all round. If regulation is good for one thing it is good for another. It is not right to talk only of regulating the price of products produced by only one class in the community. orable members opposite only want to regulate the price of primary products, and in this House they make no mention of the other sections of the community.

275,Mr Groom,"If there is a trust oragricultural implements, or if there is any pany deliberately exported 3,000 tons trust or combine likewise affecting the production of boots, clothing, foodstuffs, or anything else, such trust or combine ought to be subject to the strongest condemnation. I have always taken that attitude. But honourable members opposite appear to think that trusts and combines are concerned only with the primary products. They talk only of three or four things, such as meat, butter, food, milk, and cheese, when any reference is made to regulating prices of products, and under these circumstances, if any attempt is made at regulation, it will break down hopelessly. I think Mr Holman was quite right the other day when he said that there were certain economic values which could not be interfered with. If , for instance, the Labour party in Queensland attempted to pass an Act dealing with the price of butter, and to declare that it should not exceed Is. 6d. under existing conditions, many farmers would be unable to carry on. He would have to close down altogether. If , as the Minister states, there are worse combinations than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, he would be quite right in exposing them, and in bringing public opinion to bear upon them. adopted the Canadian system of giving publicity to the operations of combines. No name is given. This is not fair dealing, and I again ask the Minister in charge of the House to inform us what are these trusts and combines which are said to be worse than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and which are exploiting the Australian public. tell us, because you had them under observation when you were in office. You ought to know. ment has not even got them under observation.

From that statement, made by the Attorney-General, the public were given to understand that the company were concealing the facts from the Government, but it is rather interesting to learn from the Minister of Trade and Customs what really was the position. Yesterday he told us he did not know whether any evidence had been given before the Commission. The Minister yesterday did not know whether any of his officers had given evidence, but now he admits that the company did export the sugar after having applied to the Federal Government, of which the Attorney-General is a member. They obtained permission to bring this F i j i sugar into Australia in order that it could be refined here, with the express object of giving employment to Australian workmen. If the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had been as unscrupulous and regardless of Australian interests as the 'Attorney-General would have us believe, they could have sent that sugar straight away from F i j i , and Australia But they have not even would have been the loser by the transaction. It was a wise arrangement to provide employment for Australian workmen, but the Attorney-General and his colleagues should not now seek to hold this company up to ridicule and contempt in the eyes of the Australian public for that very reason. That one little incident gives a fair idea of the value of the whole of the report. I hope, therefore, that the Government will allow us to see the evidence upon which the statement was based, so that we can read it ourselves, and know exactly what was the information upon which the Attorney-General acted. In conclusion, I wish to say that I think the Minister of Trade and Customs treated very unjustly the members of the Food Supply Commission, which was constituted by the previous GovernI t reads more like a political ment to make certain inquiries regarding the position in Australia.

It is all very well for honticulars, seeing that it was not a fish, it orable members of the Government who came in some weeks afterwards, and when things were running more smoothly, to suggest that the appointment was unnecessary.

That shows the comparative cost of living, and yet the honourable member for Darling Downs has been trying to show that in this matter Queensland is better off than are the other States. I am willing to confess that I am not greatly concerned as to whether Queensland is worse or better off than the other States in the matter of the cost of living. I try to look at the question from an Australian point of view, and whether there is a slight decrease in one State and an increase in another, the fact is incontrovertible that all over Australia to-day the cost of living is very high. Our attention should be directed not so much to pointing out who is to blame, or to charging certain political parties with the blame, but to finding out the causes of the increase, and to seeking for a remedy. During the last Queensland elections I accused the Liberal party there of being responsible for the high cost of living in that State. ber at the same time blame the New and, as a consequence, both States had to South Wales Government for the high pay high prices. The same thing might cost of living in Now South Wales? by Mr Denhami n a policy speech, and by every one who was aware of the facts, that, although Queensland does not grow enough wheat for her own consumption, she exported no less than 100,000 bushels of wheat. We had also the fact, admitted by Mr Denham, that £8,000 could have been made by his own firm by speculating in wheat; yet in his policy speech he said that there had been no speculation in wheat. The honourable member for Darling Downs wishes to know the causes of the increase iu the cost of living, and I say that it is due, in a large measure, to speculators cornering wheat and holding it for high prices. They"" bear "" the market at one time, and "" b u l l "" it at another, and simply gamble the whole time with the food of the people from the day the seed is sown until the wheat is ready to be sent to the mill. For the seven months ending January of this year Queensland exported 600,000 lbs. of butter more than she exported during the similar period of the preceding year. Queensland was not short of butter. She had more to spare than she had in the previous year. What caused the high price of butter in Melbourne and in Brisbane? Victoria was short of butter, and Melbourne speculators bought heavily in Queensland. They filled the cold stores to overflowing. They did with it exactly what was done with the wheat supply. They doled it out only in small quantities, with the result that people in Victoria anxious to obtain butter could not get it. The speculators held it back in Brisbane. They sent down small shipments as it suited them to do so. Upon one shipment of butter alone from Queensland to Victoria, no less than £9,000 profit was made by the speculators. I said during the Queensland election, and I repeat now, that these men were doing what the laws of the country permitted them to do. As speculators, it was their business to hold back supplies, and, when it suited them, to unload in sufficient quantities to keep up the price. The people of Melbourne and of Brisbane had to pay high prices, not because there was a shortage, but because the gamblers in butter operated in Brisbane,",37,Maloney Doe S The Honourable How They Are Going To Reduce The Cost O F

In the meantime, unless th© State Governments take action in this matter, the Federal Government is absolutely powerless. All that we are asking for by the proposed referenda is that the Federal Government should have ihe same power to deal with these matters as that possessed by the State Governments. We have had an illustration of what one State can do. The Government of New South Wales exerted their sovereign powers, and commandeered the supply of wheat. The High Court held that they were justified. I think that every honourable member will admit, although, perhaps, reluctantly in some cases, that the New South Wales Government took the proper action so far as their people particularly were concerned. They may have been selfish, and may have laid themselves open to the charge of disloyalty to the rest of Australia; but they acted in the interests of the people of New South Wales. Before the elections in Queensland, Mr Denham stated that next year there will inevitably be a heavy shortage of sugar, and he was prepared to commandeer the whole of the sugar crop in Queensland, and let the other States look after themselves. This was suggested in retaliation for what the New South Wales Government had done in commandeering the wheat supply of that State. I say that the New South Wales Government could have done no better under the existing circumstances; but I say, also, that the Federal Government sliould have the power to do for Australia what the New South Wales Government did for New South Wales. prices of articles of daily consumption are largely due to the heavy taxation upon them. the honourable member, his statement will not bear the test of investigation, because exactly the same difficulty is experienced in Free Trade countries, and in countries where the protective incidence of the Tariff is not so high as it is here. In the Motherland to-day the prices prevailing are as high, if not higher, than the prices prevailing here. The increase in prices there may be due to the war, but it is not due to the war in Australia. It may be due, to some extent, to the drought, but it is chiefly due to the operations of speculators. Here is an illustration of how the thing works: There are eighteen men in Sydney who practically control the business of New South Wales and Queensland. Their names areHugh Dixson, H. B. Denison, E.

So is Mort's Dock; while the name of Pitt, Son, and Badgery, like that of Harrison, Jones, and Devlin, and dozens of others, is merely one of tbe aliases under which this Australian Money Ring cloaks its ownership from the public gaze. Scores of industrial and mercantile concerns running under the old titles are the absolute property of the money power, the original proprietors having been bought out, faked out, crushed out, swamped smothered, merged, or amalgamated. There are twenty-four men whoso headquarters are in Victoria, and who control business in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia. If honourable members desire a list of what they control, I have it here. They controlThe Commercial Bank of Australia, the Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the Bank of Adelaide, the Colonial, the National, the Royal, and branches of the London Bank and Union Bank situated in the three southern States. Out of 700 branches situated in these States, the southern section of the Australian Money Ring controls 400. kindred agencies, the Ring controls the British and Foreign Insurance, the Phoenix Fire, the Mutual Fire of Tasmania, the Derwent and Tamar, the North British, the Colonial Mutual Life, the Colonial Mutual Fire, the Equity Trustees, the Perpetual Trustees, the Union Trustees, the National Trustees, the Trustees, Executors, and Agency Company.

They control not only the wages paid, but what those wages can buy, and the quantities which can be purchased by them. They absolutely control tbe margin between the wages which they pay to the workman and the amount which they take back from those workmen for the food which the latter eat. They are the speculators in butter, wheat, and sugar. has quoted an article from the Labour Call, has he not? sibility for the statements which I have read. The fact remains that to-day the retailers of this country who sell commodities to the people do not control the prices of those commodities. They practically have no voice in the prices which they charge. Their profits are cut down to a minimum; and they are so entirely in the hands of trusts and combines that they are compelled to buy in a certain direction, at a certain rate, and also to sell to the public at a certain rate. I will give an illustration. There is a firm of merchants in Brisbane which placed an order witli the Melbourne agents for the Canadian Fish Packing Company for a certain brand of tinned fish. That order was accepted. But a few days later the firm received a letter from these agents-the letter is now in the hands of the Attorneydrugs-to an enormous extent. The war General-intimatin g that owing to the pressure of the Brisbane Merchants Association they were unable to accept the order, and advising the firm in question to make its purchase tlirough that Association. In other words, this firm could not'get its goods other than at a price stipulated by a third party.

That is to say, the men who form the directorate of one company are also the directors of other companies. The arrangement is a very clever business one. Legally these men are perfectly justified in their action. But the people who say that they own this country, and who should have the right to control their absolutely helpless in the hands of these commercial magnates. We have established Wages Boards, and we have been told that the high cost of living is due to the high rates of wages which obtain. My experience is that the high cost of living is responsible for the repeated demands for increased wages. Only a few weeks ago I saw in the Age the report of an address by a gentleman who I am assured is a well-know supporter of honourable members opposite. He had* just returned from a two years' visit to England, and he spoke before a meeting of the Victorian Hardware Association. He told that meeting that much had been said about the strikes which occurred in the Old Country, that he had been there, and that, so far from criticising the men because of their action, they were absolutely justified in going upon strike. He pointed out that since the outbreak of the war the cost of goods had increased so much that what a sovereign would, purchase previously-h e spoke in February of the present year-the n required an expenditure of 24s. He told his hearers that this was not due to the goods being scarce, but merely to the fact that people were holding them to reap an extra profit. Honourable members know that in Australia, immediately war was declared, the prices of goods held in stock were increased-eve n the prices of was made a convenient excuse to put up prices. The cost of goods that were not affected in the least degree by the war was. immediately raised. Yet honourable members opposite complain that the working man is getting unreasonable and is demanding outrageous wages. The surprise to me is that he-is so modest.

346,Mr Palmer,"I applaud those whoThat Ministers know all about the situation is proved by the statement in paragraph 10 of the Governor General'3 SpeechMy Advisers recognise tbe necessity, caused by the higher cost of commodities, of increasing old-age and invalid pensions, and also for the provision of pensions to widows and orphan children. Legislation to effect these objects will be introduced as soon as the state of the finances makes it practicable. That has not been done, and cannot be done, and it is now generally recognised, as it had been earlier recognised by all thinkers, that the increased cost of living is imposing a serious hardship on the masses. In the Governor General's Speech the Government gave this as a reason for increasing the amount provided for old age pensions, and seeing that its supporters claim that it has the power to remedy the matter, why does it not exercise that power ? In paragraph 11 of the Speech, tbe Governor General was made to sayThe necessity of restoring normal conditions in Australian industries is fully recognised by my Advisers. To that end the Commonwealth public works will be vigorously proceeded with, and active measures will be taken to co-operate with the State Governments, and also to supplement as far as practicable the efforts of individual employers. Normal conditions are natural conditions, and tbe present Government is creating abnormal conditions. It is making the position more and more artificial, and discouraging production. member confine himself to the question? do so, and am trying to show that the object of the amendment is to incite the Government to give relief to the workers by doing something to reduce the cost of living. I suggest that the Government should try to restore confidence among the employers, so that, instead of capital being sent out of the country, it will be used to stimulate production as much as possible. Excluding altogether the effects of the drought, I say that our agricultural production is being seriously decreased because of the abnormal conditions created by Government measures, and the sooner we get back to normal conditions under which confidence will reign the sooner will supplies be increased and prices diminished. The promotion of new industries has been suggested as a means for decreasing the cost of living. The establishment of new industries would, no doubt, have that effect. Every true citizen wishes to see our industries multiplied so that employment may be available to as many as possible, but men will not put their capital into labour-employing industries so long as legislation tends to prevent them from getting a fair return for their money. Those who have money usually have it because they are men of common sense. Such men engage in business enterprises for the sake of profit, and if you make it almost impossible for them to obtain a profit on their operations you create conditions inevitably leading to an increase in the cost of living. According to the Government StatisticianI take my information from page 259 of the last Labour bulletin issued-wage s have increased each year from 1901 to 1914. orable member object to that? good thing. The prosperity of the country depends on the welfare of the masses, but at page 265 of the same publication it is stated that during the period named the purchasing power of wages, that is, the effective wages of the community, has diminished. orable member account for that? of living. cause of that? give credit to the Tariff for everything, though I am certain that every increase in protective duties means a corresponding increase, in the cost of' living, and therefore to that extent the Tariff is responsible. The contention of honourable members opposite appears to be that the more money the working man passes through his hands the better off he is. But it is obvious that if wages are increased all along the line the cost of the commodities produced must be advanced. Take, for example, the production of wheat. The ploughman has to be paid more; the man who sows the ground has to be paid more; the man who reaps the crop has to be paid more; tbe man working on the threshing machine has to be",43,Maloney Doe S The Honourable How They Are Going To Reduce The Cost O F

All that they have done has been to create a still greater degree of dissatisfaction in the minds of the workers, which is one of the very things that are making for the undoing of our Commonwealth. referring to the agricultural industry, in his endeavour to show that the higher wages paid to the men employed on harvesters, those doing the stooking, and those carting the grain, tended to increase the cost of living, the honourable member for Echuca forgot one very important factor, namely, that the ever-increasing efficiency of machinery is continually tending to decrease the cost of production. To-day, although wages in the agricultural industry have had a badly-needed increase, it is cheaper to harvest a field of 100 acres than it was twenty years ago, machinery, to a great extent, having superseded the necessity for employing nearly every industry. Many people believe that the increase in the price of boots is due to the increased wages paid to the employees in the boot factories; but the Pederal Statistician has shown conclusively tliat, whereas four years ago the workers received £28 out of every £100 worth of boots produced, to-day he is not getting quite £28 out of every £100 worth produced, notwithstanding he has received an increase in wages.

The Minister of Trade and Customs has reminded me that the manufacturers in the boot industry do not buy this machinery; they pay a royalty on it. which is equivalent to the same thing. ment of high wages; then it is the cost of machinery; then it is the royalty; and, lastly, it is the rent. Honourable members ascribe the increased cost of produce to anything but the true cause, which is, that a few people of great wealth are manipulating the articles that have been created by the many. That is why we have, on this side of the chamber, a spirit of discontent. We realize that all is not being done that ought to be done. done anything in the Federal arena. much chance of doing anything. But I do not wish to be drawn off my line of argument.

I hope that I am a faithful member of the Labour party, and loyal to its principles, but I have yet to learn that, because I sit on a bench behind the Government, I am to remain for ever silent though I think the movement of the party is not going fast enough.

What more do you Avant than a statement like that? ber said that he owed no allegiance to the present leaders. He did not say that he owed no allegiance to the Labour movement. I believe, with the honourable member for Bourke, that we do possess these powers, and I am fortified in that belief by the opinions expressed by some of our constitutional 'authorities. Let us see what our present Attorney-General has said. There is one quotation which I cannot use, but which, if I could use it , Avould strongly fortify the position taken up by the honourable member for Bourke. Mr Mitchell, K . C , in questioning the validity of the Enemy Contracts Annulment Bill, said that he believed that it was unconstitutional, and the Attorney General next day, in criticising Mr Mitchell's statement, said. Mr Mitchell had apparently assumed the has acted to be exclusively confined to the trade and commerce powers, section 51, subsection 1. But this was not the case. These powers were wide, but it might well be that doubts as to their sufficiency for the present purpose existed. The n he Avent on to sayBut the defence powers of the Commonwealth were most elastic. He would, indeed, be a bold man who would set a limit to them, particularly at sucli a juncture as this. In other words, the Attorney-General argued that the Enemy Contracts Annulment Bill Avould be unconstitutional if passed in times of peace, but owing to our being at Avar our defence powers automatically extended, and we possessed powers Avhich we would not possess in times of peace. I follow the lead set by the Attorney-General, one of the leaders of this party, and I ask: If Ave do possess these Avide powers, why do we not act upon them, and endeavour to defeat those means of increased prices?",45,Maloney Doe S The Honourable How They Are Going To Reduce The Cost O F

It is imperative, therefore, that we should take every precaution to safeguard the community against a shortage of sugar. The Government have exercised their power to take sueh steps as are neeessary to insure the availability of an adequate supply. I argue from this that it cannot be denied that the Government have power to buy sugar to supply the requirements of our troops at Broadmeadows; that no one can doubt that the Government have power to buy sugar to supply the requirements of men employed by us in building the transcontinental railway, of the men making boots for our troops at Broadmeadows, of the men and women making clothing for the men at Broadmeadows, or the requirements of those engaged in making ammunition for our soldiers. No one will question our power to buy fodder and to sell it to those engaged in the manufacture of these several commodities. We can do this because the Empire is at war, and it is necessary that our troops should be maintained. I believe-and I wish I could induce the Ministry to see eye to eye with me-that just as it is essential for the Government to provide sugar or wheat for the men engaged in making war materiel, so it is equally essential to buy sugar and other requirements for the men who are ploughing our fields and growing the wheat to be turned into flour for the use of the men who are fighting our battles. It requires no stretch of imagination to believe that the Commonwealth Government has the necessary power to enter into commerce to-day in . respect of practically every line that is required for our people. When a few oi us hold that opinion, and hold it very strongly, I am surprised that we should be denounced by any member of thewe should ask the State Parliaments to Labour party for giving expression to concede us power to act at once. it in Parliament.

I would sooner hand in my resignation, walk out of tbe Labour party, and be finished with it than remain silent in such circumstances. I do not think it is the desire of the majority of honourable members on this side of the House that I should be stifled. The honourable member for Hunter and one or two more may think that I should be; but the majority of our party are Democrats, and believe that an honourable member is merely exercising an undoubted right in voicing his opinions in this House. These are the opinions I hold, and I hope that as the outcome of this discussion the Government will immediately take action.

We should have, for in% stance, to approach the Liberal Government in Victoria, and if that Government were favorable to the project it would have in turn to approach the Legislative Council. I was. a member of the Legislative Assembly for eleven or twelve years, and I know that the State Government-would not have a million to one chance of passing such a measure through the Legislative Council. man? difficulty to contend with. could carry such a Bill through the Legislative Council he would have to induce the State Government to make from fifty to 100 new appointments to that Chamber. able to such a proposal? question. The point is that if one State Parliament stood out our efforts would be nullified. mained outside the compact, the trusts and monopolies operating in Australia would have their registered offices in that State, Since there are five State Labour Governments in Australia, some may ask why this suggestion should not be adopted. I hold that it is not practicable. What is more, I believe that such an appeal is unnecessary, since we already have the requisite power. We have power to do anything we deem desirable. We havo shown that we possess it by commandeering woollen goods in the various stores, ancl no one has dared to object to that action on the part of the Government. Having the power, the Government should exercise it. I would go even further, and say that, even if we had not the constitutional power, we should nevertheless take this action. ought to be done, and that the people ought to be protected. The question with which we are faced is a serious one. If we could foresee the end of the warif we knew that it was going to end a week or two hence-the question would not be so serious as it is; it must be most serious while the war lasts, and I hope that the Government will do something. It has been argued that we, who speak in this way, want to confiscate the earnings of the farmer. We desire nothing of the sort. I do not want to take from any man anything that he has justly earned or created. A t the same time, I do not think that one section of the community, because of the war, should benefit at the expense of every other section. There are a number of people in this country who claim to be patriots. In the last three months of 1913 England exported 1,000,000 lbs. of tea, whereas in the last three months of 1914 she exported to Holland alone 16,000,000 lbs. Before he of tea. This was done because an extra 3d. per lb. could be procured, and the tea went through Holland to Germany. What did these men care about supplying the enemy with food or stimulants? The figures in regard to the export of cocoa from England to Holland are very much the same. German doctors have said that tea and cocoa are the best stimulants their soldiers could have, and Germany went to merchants in Great Britain to secure these stimulants. There are many people who talk patriotism, but do not practise it to any extent. They are making an immense profit out of the war. In this country alone there are a few who will be millionaires after the war, but while it lasts there will be a good deal of suffering among the wives and children of the men who have gone to the front. Holding these views, I support the amendment, because, while I think it is inadequate, I hope that the Government will do something stronger in the near future. can well understand that the honourable member for Cook, tbe honourable member for Ballarat, and several other members of the Labour party should desire the Government to give effect to their policy. It is only natural that they should; but I find it difficult to understand why they have not learned by now that certain gentlemen occupying high positions in their party would regard the action which these honourable members are urging upon them as the very last that should be taken. even if the honourable member does. members, holding high positions in the",47,Maloney Doe S The Honourable How They Are Going To Reduce The Cost O F

393,Mr Greene,"Thes e honorableLabour party, know perfectly well, in the first place, that if they attempted to carry out that policy it would fail; and, secondly, that they would thus be deprived of a political cry which has carried them to victory over and over again in Australia. That is their position in a nut-shell. They have sufficient acumen to know that their boasted policy of regulating prices, once it was applied in a general way, would break down, and that by its failure they would be robbed of a political cry which has done so much for them. Let us consider for a moment what has been the result of the one or two attempts that have been made to regulate certain prices in Australia. A little while ago they regulated the price of sugar, and did so, no doubt, with the very best of intentions. Mr J. Fx. CATTS -Who did so? ment of New South Wales more particularly forced it on. vernment in Victoria do the same thing? so; but I am not selecting any particular Government for criticism. I am referring to this matter only by way of illustration, of sugar was fixed the ruling price was because the regulation of prices is part of the acknowledged policy of the Labour party. They would regulate prices, not only in time of war, when there might be special reasons for attempting to do something of the sort, but in times of peace. I am taking this one attempt to regulate the price of sugar in order to show that the policy, not only does, but must, inevitably break down in the long run, and that arbitrary interference with the general course of trade, in almost every instance, ultimately results in higher prices than would have had to be paid. In New South Wales the price of sugar was fixed at £21, and in Victoria at £21 2s. 6d., whilst in Queensland the price was allowed to go to £23. I think that this was most injudicious, and, that if the circumstances had been fairly considered, it would not have been done. A reference to the statistics will show that the average price of sugar in Australia, over a number of years, was considerably more than the price fixed by the Commodities Boards. This action, as the honourable member for Moreton has pointed out, was of no benefit to the consumer. price being charged. not the figures at hand, H>ut I think I could show that, in any circumstances, the price of sugar, in Australia, would not have gone beyond £23 per ton. sugar in London? ties Boards came into existence the price in London was very much greater than that ruling in Australia, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and those responsible for the price of sugar in the Commonwealth, had not, up to that time, attempted to raise it. stoppage of export? one particular phase of the question. The fixing of prices did not affect the consumer. The grocers in New South Wales continued'to sell their sugar at the same price as tliey had been charging for a number of years. The price of sugar had risen and fallen from time to time, bub the grocers had simply resolved to sell the sugar for 3d. per lb. across Che counter, and to abide by the rise and fall of the market. A t the time at which the price £21 per ton all over Australia. The grocers were selling the sugar at 3d. per lb., and when the wholesale price was raised in Queensland to £23 per ton, the grocers in that State, and also in Victoria, still continued to sell at 3d., and the only people who got any advantage from the fixing of prices in New South Wales and Victoria were the middlemen. But that is not the serious part of the position. It was well known to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company some considerable time ago that there must be a big shortage in the sugar crop. certain of that prospective shortage in March, at any rate. In all probability they had a suspicion of such a state of things a little earlier, and I venture to say that if the company had been free agents in February last, they would have immediately secured such supplies of sugar as tbey thought the circumstances would warrant, and that sugar could have been bought then, and landed in Australia right through this period of scarcity, which we are about to pass through, at",48,Maloney Doe S The Honourable How They Are Going To Reduce The Cost O F

404,Mr Greene,"The company were-£23 per ton. Moreover, it would have -been landed in Australia at that price. We know that to-day it is impossible for the company to land and hold sugar in bond in Australia at under £25 per ton, and the consequence will be that immediately our supplies are exhausted, they will be obliged to immediately raise the price of sugar, even if the duty is taken -off, to £25 per ton, and the consumers ;all over Australia will have to pay more tfor their supplies. The Commodities Boards cannot in fairness and justice reduce the price after that date. know that in all probability our Australian crop will be exhausted by the end of March, and goodness knows what we will bave to pay for sugar after that date if the war is not at an end. The position in regard to sugar is just one inscance of the absolute barm tliat has attended the attempt to fix prices. But that is not the -end of the evil, because in regard to the far greater proportion of the sugar supplies, if the price had gone up to £23 per ton, as would have been only reasonable at the time, the growers of all but the small proportion produced in New South Wales, would have received out of every £1 increase 18s. and the company 2s. The Minister of Trade and Customs must know that my statement as to where the increased price goes is absolutely true. The agreement under which the company buys -sugar at the mills is that of every £ 1 increase above £19, 18s. goes to the producers of the raw sugar-who , in most instances, are the growers themselves, because they are interested in the co-operative mills-and the company gets only 2s. -side the mills ? able member knows that a great deal of the sugar, in New South Wales particularly, is sold direct to the company from the field under an agreement which generally operates for from three to five years. -say thaE only one-sixth of the producers would participate in the increased price? ber is quite wrong, because a much .greater proportion of the producers will get the benefit of tbe rise in prices. They would not, of course, get the benefit of the rise in regard to raw sugar which the -Colonial Sugar Refining Company had purchased and held at that time; that is to say,, the producers would not have got the benefit of any rise in regard to sugar actually held by the company at the time, but those producers who had not sold their raw sugar would have derived the benefit. have held that sugar? held it all. However, that does not affect the argument I am endeavouring to put before the House, namely, that whenever the Government attempt We to arbitrarily interfere with the general operations of trade, the result, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, will be the hitting of the man whom the Government action was intended to help. Let me now deal with the butter supplies, about which there has been a good deal of argument in this House during the last few weeks. I heard one honourable member say that there are vast stocks of butter which the producers have hidden away, and will not put on the market. I only wish that the Government would straight away appoint a man to go through every cool chamber in every butter factory and store throughout the Commonwealth; if . that were done it would be found that there is not a single box of butter stored away anywhere. Mr J. H . CATTS -What bas become of the butter produced in this bountiful season on the south coast of New South Wales? ber seems to think that because the season was good before Christmas it is good now. ber mean to say that the farmers on the south coast have not experienced a good season ? the south coast, but that country is responsible for a comparatively small proportion of the butter production of New South Wales. Nobody should know betMr Knox ter than the honourable member that nine-tenths of the milk produced in his district is sent either to the factories or direct to Sydney to supply the wants of the metropolis. Yet the honourable member would tell the House that, because there was a good season in the district he represents, there must necessarily be an ample supply of butter in Sydney.

413,. Mr Greene,"I have not been onof these facts, they still endeavour to bolster up a case which they know to be absolutely rotten. The honourable member for Illawarra must know that the milk produced in his district is not being converted into butter; yet, if I were not conversant with the facts, the honourable member would endeavour to upset my argument by bis interjection. Mr J. H . CATTS -You r statement does not apply to the whole of the south coast. area that is supplying the greater portion of the milk. Practically as far south as Nowra, which country, with the exception of the Bega district, comprises the whole extent of the dairying country along the south coast, nearly every drop of milk produced is sent to Sydney. Honourable members opposite believe that prices should be regulated. The Commodities Board fixed the price of butter in New South Wales, and what has been the net result? MrJ . . H . CATTS -That butter is 9d. per lb. cheaper in Sydney than in Melbourne! but let us endeavour to look a little further thaii our own noses, and bring our considerations down to the bedrock of common sense. The average farmer is not a born fool; he has just as much brains and intelligence as has any one of us. I do not suppose that he is actuated by any peculiar motives of philanthropy or any altruistic notions about working himself to death for the benefit of others. After all, the dairy farmers in New South Wales are endeavouring to make a living, and they look at the present situation from the same stand-point as most people do-as to how they are likely to most beneought about the end of August, it will fit their own pockets. Until recently there had been in the district I represent no rain from the beginning of the year, and the paddocks, instead of being well stocked with grass, were, to a large extent, bare, because shortly after the rain fell the cold which, perhaps, of all others, is not specuweather set in, and the grass did not grow. I have never seen the cattle on the Richmond River looking so miserable. Many of those in milk are in wretched condition, and cows about to calve are in very poor condition, too. dairy stock about so much as milking them in winter, and the farmer puts this proposition before himself: "" Isi t going to pay me to knock my stock about by milking them through this hard winter, to receive, at the most, Is. I d . per lb. for my butter, and to run the risk of losing some of my cattle; or will it not be more profitable to dry off as many cows as possible, and give them a spell?"" doing. sition. If the price went up to 2s. a lb., the farmer would say to himself, "" Well, I have an additional inducement to buy better feed, and endeavour to keep a few more cows in milk during the winter, so that in spring, instead of keeping the cows dry, and having to wait three or four months for a return, I shall immediately benefit from the spring weather."" Mr J. H . CATTS -Then the honourable member advocates 2s. a lb. ? ket conditions warrant. Mr J. H . CATTS -And you say the conditions do warrant it? at the present time. Cannot the honourable member see that if an inducement is held out now to farmers to keep their cows in milk during the winter, they will, when the spring comes with the warm weather, have two or three times as many cows in milk as they probably would otherwise have at the end of the winter, under existing circumstances, in New South Wales, and that' the immediate result will be to increase supplies and bring the price down ? Cannot the honourable member see that the policy which he is advocating means that hundreds, if not thousands, oil milking cows will be dried off to save their lives at the present time, and that, instead of the price falling to a normal level, as it not fall until probably October or November? profit on butter now ? lated in, and from which the producer gets the fullest possible.benefit. ber for Richmond say that the producer Nothing knocks gets the fullest possible benefit from milk? milk, but of butter.

It matters very little to me what schemes are proposed if working men secure less effective wages as the result. employed in Victoria than in any other State in the Commonwealth. They are waiting upon the Commonwealth Government in thousands. represent the average over the whole community in each State, and there is no answer to them. When one quotes the average for the community, it is no answer to that to mention one or two instances which apparently contradict it. Let us consider some Government interference that has taken place recently. examine it as coolly as we can in the beat of what migui be called a party squabble. The Government of New South Wales fixed the price of wheat at 4s. 2d. a bushel, and they commandeered the visible supply in the State. The Government of Victoria fixed the price at 4s. 9d. per bushel, but three weeks later they found they had made a mistake, and raised the price to 5s. 6d. When the New South Wales Government commandeered the visible supply within that State, they found that they had not sufficient for the consumption of the community, and it was necessary for them to go abroad for importations of wheat. tions are now costing them about 7s. l i d . per bushel. There is no system of governmental interference that I know of by which we can fix prices for any longer than a day. If a commission is appointed to fix the price of any article of consumption, and they fix it at the rate ruling for a particular day, that fixed price will be effecwheat on the water. There may be tons tive for that day, but the commission must be prepared, with a change in the market, to fix the price again the next day. They must be always on the spot, and must change the price with every alteration of the market. grace 1915 it should be unnecessary, in an Australian Parliament, to explain to any honourable member that changes take place in the price of every article of commerce. changes. the increase in the price of butter from Is. to 2s. per lb. ? Why are eggs 2s. a dozen ? Isi t due to the operations of a ring? It is because the hens are laying, fewer eggs. Some time ago people could not afford to feed fowls, and they decided to eat them. For a time poultry was cheap; but when poultry could be fed, and they were kept to produce eggs, there were fewer of them for sale, with the result that the price went up. That result was not due to the operation of any ring. What led to the increase in the price of wheat? There was no ring controlling that article. It was the drought that' led to the increased price of wheat,, from 3s. 6d. per bushel up to nearly 8s. Let us fixed in London by Mark Lane? right, to a certain extent, in saying that the price of wheat is fixed -by Mark Lane. The wheat market of the world is controlled by Mark Lane in the sense that operators there know the visible supplies, so far as America is concerned, east of the Rockies, the visible supplies from Russia, from Australia, from the Argentine, and the supplies in the Old Country.

There may be a normal price for certain products as tbe result of men securing a monopoly. A case of that kind is a proper case for governmental interference. Parliament should legislate to prohibit monopolies. I shall go to the fullest extent with tbe present Government in maintaining that principle. I take the case of Government interfering to regulate the price of commodities.. I may advert for a moment to sugar. I believe that most of us will agree that those whose business it is to supply sugar to this community, knowing that there is a shortage ahead, would bave been prepared to supply the full quantity required by Australia at a cheaper rate than can now be quoted, because the Government of the Commonwealth have advertised to the whole world that we are 20,000 tons short of our actual consumption of sugar. member suggest that the duty should be taken off? tiling at a time. When the Government of Australia advertised to the world that we were 20,000 tons of sugar short, it is only human nature that people having sugar to sell should say, "" Australia must have this sugar,"" and up goes tbe price. The men whose business it is to supply the community with sugar would have found out where supplies were to be had; would have ordered the necessary supplies, and they would be on the water coming to Australia under signed contracts to-day at a much cheaper price than will have to be paid for them now that it has been .advertised broadcast that Australia cannot produce any more sugar until next season, and we shall be compelled to import the quantity required to make up our local consumption. The same thing applies to wheat, and to any other commodity that can be mentioned. If an honourable member bas a certain product which I want, and if he is the only man in the town who has it , and I must have it, when I go into his shop he will say, "" This chap is fair game for me; up goes the price to him."" That is what the honourable member would do if he had a shop. does not keep the shop who says, "" I hope so."" The man who keeps the shop does it. If he did not, he would soon have to file his schedule. I believe in the prevention of monopoly not only in war, but in time of peace. Monopoly should be prevented under any circumstances, and any legislation tending to aid the monopolist will always have my hearty opposition. Let me give another illustration from Mr Knibbs' book dealing with the relative cost of living. book. as it is properly read and interpreted, because it will then upset a lot of theories. One of the theories which it will upset is that as to the cost of living. Upon page 232 Mr Knibbs lays down the relative cost of living in the different States of Australia. Again taking 1,000 as the weighted average of Australia, New South Wales worked out at 1,049 orable member for Moreton said. it again, and to put a different interpretation upon it. South Australia worked out at 3,022, Western Australia at 1,140, Victoria at 951, and Queensland at 904. It will be seen, therefore, that the three States which were above the average at the time these statistics were compiled were those which were, and still are, being administered by Labour Governments, whilst the two States which were below the average were being administered by Liberal Governments. When the Labour party have had a couple more years of office, I confidently expect to see the Queensland average a good deal higher. Now my honourable friends opposite appear to be intelligent men.

At that time Parliament thought that it was doing something which would assist the woollen industry; but its action did not have that effect. I say that honourable members upon this side of the Chamber are just as anxious to see the working classes get a square deal, so far as the necessaries of life are concerned, as are my honourable friends opposite.

Seeing that preference to unionists was the platof Defence has received a statement form on 'which the Labour party was returned to power, the union at once made negotiations with tbe Minister of Defence, with the object of giving preference to a union-run bakery. The contract previous to this had only been arranged by the association sending to certain master bakers, and asking them for their tenders. As an outcome of the union's negotiations, a tender was called, and Mr Shead, of South Brisbane, who is a master baker, em.. . . 26 ploying union labour, tendered at about Is. .. 23 below the cost of the Automatic Bakeries.

Then I Have A Statement By Mr Shead","of a letter sent by the Automatic Bakeries boys employed in Automatic Bakeries Limited Limited to the honourable member for was correct (Monday, 15th May). MaranoaDear Sir,I enclose extract from Brisbane Courier of even date. I am sure you feel quite certain of the truth of your statements, and so am writing to defend the company. The wages and conditions of work are specified on the tender. Referring to the conditions. I am sending you, under separate cover, a booklet explaining our process, which certainly shows that the conditions are different. Here the trade is elevated almost to a profession, and a man who once works here does not like to have to work again in a hand factory. Our wages are all governed by the Wages Board. We pay higher than the award-the highest in the city. The present contractor employs four other members of his firm under no award. We are an entirely open shop, never asking whether a man is a unionist or not. In fact, many of our men (not bakers) are unionists Warner scabbed 1914. Over two years ago the Bakers Union refused to allow members to work for us, and the present contractor has been stirring up enmity against us ever since in order to further his trade-usin g the unions as catspaws. Mr stalled their machinery has either scabbed or Hall, the Attorney-General of New South Wales, visited our factory, and was so pleased with it that he has decided to instal a similar one in Sydney, and he says the conditions are all that can be desired -Yours faithfully, J. A. HUNTER. As a reply to that letter, I have a letter addressed to the honourable member for Maranoa by Mr P. Millard, the president of the Baking Trade Employees Union of Brisbane. It was marked confidential, but I have a telegram from Mr Millard in reply to one despatched to him which might be made public. The telegram saysYes. Also statement union prohibits members employment Automatic absolutely untrue. The letter saysSeeing that the member for Moreton( Mr our Industrial Board which will force them to Sinclair) and the Tory papers are making a large noise about the Enoggera bread contract, I deem it my duty to acquaint you of the position of both the Automatic Bakeries Limited and the successful tenderer (W. Shead). As the discussion started by Mr ness, gave preference to members of our union, Sinclair was in the interests of the Automatic Bakeries Limited, I will deal with them first. Automatic Bakeries employ sixteen hands in the baking of bread. Eight are operative bakers, eight are boys. The Wages Board award allows only four boys to eight men; three of such boys must be apprenticed. None of the boys in Automatic are apprenticed. I have tried several times to get the authorities to prosecute them for a breach of the award, but they say they can do nothing. The union is therefore powerless to control this combine. Mr Maher (managing director) gave evidence on oath that the above statement as regards the number of men and It was also stated in the House that Automatic Bakeries Limited were not opposed to unionism. Yet, the following are the facts concerning the past and present employees in the Automatic Bakeries Limited:X. Bovle (foreman baker) scabbed in 1002, 1912, and 1914. Townsend scabbed 1912 and 1914. Griffin scabbed 1912 and 1914. Gardner scabbed 1912 and 1914. Attery scabbed 1912 and 1914. Bergstrom scabbed 1912 and 1914. The above are the present employees. Two other men are employed (non-unionists). Fast employees are as follows:J. Menagh scabbed 1914. H. Spaule scabbed 1914. A. Rollestan scabbed 1914. H. Russell scabbed 1914. Warner scabbed 1914. H. Currell scabbed 1912 and 1914. Every man employed by the Automatic Bakeries in their bakehouse since they inis a non-unionist. In fact, I do not know of any baker whom they have employed who has not scabbed. It seems strange that not one unionist has been employed, if they are not opposed to unionism. But, on the other hand, the scum of scabdom has been and is employed by them. Herbert Sheard (director) at a meeting held for the purpose of forming Automatic Bakeries Limited is supposed to have said that, on the installation of their machinery, there would be no more strikes, that union bakers will not be wanted. It looks at least that if it was not said, that it is being carried out at all events. In evidence, before. Price Fixing Board, P. J. Maher said:-""We can produce 50 per cent, more bread in our factory without any more eost."" So you can see Enoggera bread"" contract to them would not mean the employment of additional labour. Automatic Limited have been always, andstill are, night bakers, but we have a decision on clay work in a few months. (Now that 22nd May happened.) The Position of TP. Shead. 1902 -W . Shead was a member of our union out on strike. He later started in busiabsolutely refused to employ any others; this attitude he has maintained to the present time. 1912 -Employing only unionists, he was one of the few bakers allowed to work, under permit, from the general strike committee. 1914 -He was the only master baker to write to the Bakers Union offering to start day baking (before we issued the ultimatum that we would refuse to work under night baking conditions). Shead again helped us by giving evidence before the Industrial Board in favour of our proposal. And the decision given in our favour was to a great extent due to his evidence. Since securing the Enoggera bread contract, W. Shead has employed four (4) operative bakers in addition to his previous staff. These additional men are constantly employed. He has also employed additional casual labour (jobbers) to the extent of £9 per week; this has been the saving of our unemployed, every one of whom has had a share of the extra work created by this contract. In fact, the securing of the bread contract, besides being a union question, is a bread and butter question. The following are the award rates of pay and the rates paid by Shead since the 10th May, 1914:Award. £ s. d.

Hoping that you will be able to. justify your action hy these few facts. I remain, yours in unity, P. MILLARD, President, Baking Trade Employees Union. I have nothing further to say, except a few words in conclusion. The present Government, heing pledged to the principle of preference to unionists, could have done nothing else, if it were to remain true to its professions and promises, but give the contract to this particular firm. The other firm is notoriously a non-union firm. It does not profess to he a union firm, except in the sense that a man who is out of a job is willing to join a union in order to get in the Government employment; and the Automatic Bakeries Limited is willing to claim some kind of unionism in order to get this contract. The difference in price is very little, especially when we remember that the Automatic Bakeries Limited is a combine of nine bakeries, which was deliberately started in order to get control of the baking trade of Brisbane. The present Government is pledged against combines. It is pledged to give the individual a fair go, and to see that the public are well served. This combine set out, not only to squeeze out the other bakeries of Brisbane, but also to establish the price of bread, and practically to rule the whole of the business in that city. They have failed, and I think the Government are to be congratulated upon the fact that they assisted the other bakers to break the strength of the combine. The honourable member for Moreton laid Afr. Finlayson. some stress on the point that the combine were supplying the bread at a fixed price. That is one of the strongest arguments that could have been adduced in favour of giving the order to the other firm. The Automatic Bakeries Company were able to supply at a fixed price, although flour was showing a tendency to rise, and has since risen, only because, having control of so much money,, and having the business of .nine bakeries Number Shead. of Men. to supply, they were in a position to £ s. d. lay in stocks of flour. On the other hand,, ..3 5 0 4 0 0 1 the ordinary baker, having a smaller capi3 5 0 3 tal, would not be able to lay in stocks of 3 0 0 1 flour, and was therefore subject' to the 3 5 0 I rise and fall of the market. I think the 1 0 0 2 honourable member, having discovered that his statement regarding Shead and his partners was incorrect, might have the grace and courtesy to withdraw the imputation which he made on the firm. I cannot expect him to withdraw his suggestion that the Government acted unfairly. Had they acted in any other way the attack upon them would have come, not from the Opposition, but from this side of the House. If the present Government were giving orders to firms like the Automatic Bakeries Company, which are not union firms, and which will not employ unionists if they can secure the services of non-union men, then they would have to submit to a good deal of criticism from their own supporters. We and the public generally expect the Government to be true to the principles for which tbey stand, and which Labour haa advocated outside as well as in Parliament. advocated preference to contractors. case of preference to contractors. The firm in question obtained the order because it employs unionists. It is immaterial what the employer himself may be; it is preference to unionists that we insist upon. I hope that the honourable member for Moreton, now that he find* them incorrect, will withdraw his remarks in reference to the partners in this firm. I wish to thank him personally for the mistake that he made from his own stand-point in bringing forward this matter when he did. It was brought forward for political purposes at a timewhen it was thought it would help his",63,Adjournment Enoggeba Camp Bread Contract
