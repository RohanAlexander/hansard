After discussion it was agreed that a f>3-hour week should apply in place of the previous 40-hour week. In view of the urgent necessity to complete the building of the Greenslopes Military Hospital in the shortest possible time, I ask the Minister for the Army whether he will arrange a conference of persons interested in this work in order to see whether an agreement can be reached for a longer working week so that the hospital may be completed at the earliest possible date for it. is badly needed to replace wholly the present inadequate No. J12 Australian General Hospital? ber has taken in the construction of the Greenslopes Military Hospital and I invite him to discuss the subject with me concluded. need to assist in every possible way the organization of the Home Guard, or the Volunteer Defence Force, which is composed largely of returned soldiers and other persons not altogether eligible for military service, I ask the Minister for the Army whether he will consider making additional equipment available, especially rifles and ammunition, and also provide facilities for target practice, so that this force may be brought to the highest possible pitch of efficiency? It. is essential that the detachments of the Home Guard located along the east Southport, Tweed Heads and Grafton, shall he properly equipped with rifles and ammunition and given facilities for target practice. honourable member is a good one. I have already issued instructions that continually increasing supplies of equipment, as it becomes available, shall be issued to the Volunteer Defence Force throughout Australia. The Government realizes that the members of this force are doing excellent work and are giving their services gratuitously. It desires, therefore, that all possible assistance shall be given to them in their training.

It was generally admitted that suplies of superphosphate could be rationed only through the manufacturers and distributors. The distributors have been ordered to make the ration according to the quantity used in the previous year. I shall give consideration to the honourable gentleman's suggestion, and do everything possible to overcome any anomaly that may. arise, in order that the most equitable distribution may be made of the limited supplies available. Mr I3REEN -In the last sessional period \ asked the Minister for Supply to consider the advisability of bringing to Australia machinery from factories that had been closed down in England' under the rationalization policy adopted by rhe British Government at the outbreak the war. As the situation is more serious now than it was then, will the honourable, gentleman consider re-erecting somewhere in the neighbourhood of Lithgow a steel works which would help to eke out our supplies of steel should the operations at Port Kembla or Newcastle be interrupted, in view of the fact that the cartage of coal to Whynlla, in South Australia, would involve transport over u distance of approximately 1.000 miles? Munitions has had this matter under consideration, and has submitted what I regard as rather costly proposals. Thuse are beinsr considered by the Government, and a decision will be made in accordance with all the practical aspects of the case. WAR CONTRACT S. ter aware that war production is being retarded in New South Wales because the Board of Area Management in Sydney, consisting of Sir Philip Goldfinch as chairman and other men of ability and experience, is unable to authorize the payment of accounts exceeding £2,000 in connection with war contracts? Payments beyond that amount have to be authorized in Melbourne by the Director of Finance, who on many occasions delays the matter by from six weeks to two months. This restricts the operations of war contractors, because they have to pay cash for the raw materials that they obtain from the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited and other concerns. Has the honourable gentleman seen the report aud recommendation of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure in connection with this matter? If so, will he consider enlarging the authority of the Sydney Board of Area Management, and authorizing progress payments to the smaller contractors in order that they may bo enabled to make prompt payment in respect of wages and raw materials? port to which the honourable gentleman has referred. I also have some knowledge of the circumstances which he has related with a certain degree of emphasis.

Certain anomalies have also been, created in respect, of recent legislation, because the payment, of child endowment has, in some instances-, created a new setof conditions'. Amendment agreedto. Leader of the Opposition) [3.50} -It, is just about two and a half months, ago since tbe party which I led was displaced, and the Labour party took over the administration. Our Government was defeated because of the budget which it introduced. That budget, was' formulated amd presented to the House as a. measure designed to meet the situation then existing, and in anticipation of what the nation might be confronted with in the future. The Labour party strenuously opposed our budget, not on principle, but because,, so it said, we were treating harshly and unfairly those in receipt of low incomes. We, with a full realization of the quantum of tax available from the lower ranges of incomes, sought to obtain from them, for the-financing,of this all-in war effort, a. just contribution. The taxable field, which we proposed to tap amounted to £560,000^000, or 70 per cent, of the taxable capacity of tbe nation. That huge amount is made up of incomes below £400 a year. The only satisfaction which the Opposition can have in the present measure is that the action being taken by the Government to-day totally vindicates our policy which Parliament rejected less than three months ago. .1 do not know what the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) thinksabout it, having regard to the measure now before the House, and to the fact that the country was promised, that the financial position would be reviewed early in the New Year. Now the Government has 1 brought down a measure which treats tint low incomes more harshly than we proposed to treat them. This measure provides that the whole amount shall be raised in the form of a direct, tax, whereas we proposed that a. part of the money raised would be in the f omni of a post-war credit 1 or, if you liie, a. compulsory loan. The Government seeks* to obtain £24,500,000 5 im a full financial year, of which £20,000^000 is to he provided by individual taxpayers, and £4,500,000 will represent a f urther infliction upon the already overtaxed companies'.. Where isthis £20,000,000 to come from? This is the amount which is to be assessed for a full year, not the amount which it is expected will be received in. this financial year. Honourable members should not be misled regarding the amount which will be available tofinance the war as tbe result of this provision. Of the £30,000,000, £11,800,000' is to be raised from incomes of lessthan £400 a year. This, represents 2.7 per cent, of the taxable income of £560,000,000, made up of incomes below £400 a year.. This amount of £11,800,000 can be compared with the amount of £7,750,000 which we proposed to raise under the system! of post-war credits. Under that system the taxpayer would begiven, a credit, to be redeemed, after the war, something that would assist him during the period of post-war reconstruction. Compare that with the straight-out taxation proposals of the present Government. Thosei n receipt of the lower incomes, are being asked tocontribute only 2.7 per cent, oi a total of £560,000,000,. and it must not be overlooked that that total is based, upon last year's figures. It is an ever-expanding total, and will increase as. war expenditure increases. Yet the Government, at",23,Income Tax Assessment Bill
23,Mr Fadden (Darling. Downs,"I his ii MMof national emergency, timidly asks those whose incomes make up a total of £560,000,000 to contribute only 2.7 per cent, of that amount. It must not be forgotten that those in the lower income ranges receive by far the greater part of the annual child endowment payments of £18,000,000. When their receipts from child endowment are taken into consideration, it is probable that they will not be required to contribute more than 1 per cent, of the total of £560,000,000. The Government is not taking a realistic view of the situation. It is even camouflaging its demands by placing a super-impost on incomes over £400 a year. The minimum contribution under this provision is 6d. in the £1 on incomes up to £300 a year, whilst on incomes over that amount the tax is Is. in the £1. This impost is in addition to the disastrously high taxation already collected on incomes of £1,000 a year and more. I hold no brief for the persons in the higher ranges of income, but I warn the Treasurer that the Government, in imposing this additional tax, will pass beyond the limit of safety. Already, salaries exceeding £1,500 per annum are so overtaxed that the Government has imposed a ""ceiling"" of 18s. in the £1. The Treasurer has omitted to explain whether that limit will be affected by the new impost. If the limit is to be raised to 19s. in the £1, the effect UDOU our economic life and the earning capacity of the nation will be calamitous. The Government has failed to tackle this problem fairly and honestly by taxing the lower ranges of income. The Opposition has had very little opportunity to examine the new proposals, but it is noteworthy that whilst ihe lower ranges of income between £156 and £300 a year will be taxed at the rate of 6d. in the £1, a system of rebates will operate. For each dependant, a rebate of Is. a week will be allowed, which will substantially reduce the rate of 6d. in the £1. I am both surprised and disappointed that, in this emergency, the Government has failed to adopt the only honest course of imposing taxation upon an equitable and sensible basis. The Opposition does not desire unnecessarily to criticize the efforts of the GoMr Fadden. vernnient to obtain money for the purpose of waging the war, and desires to assist the Treasurer in every possible way. But the fact remains that the previous Government adopted a realistic outlook in order to safeguard to the maximum degree our lives and our possessions. The present Government has neglected to take similar precautions. I propose to examine the reason that the Treasurer gave last evening for introducing these taxation proposals at this juncture. Two months ago, the Government's avowed policy was based upon extreme confidence. The Government had confidence that the people would voluntarily contribute to war loans and war savings certificates, and deprive themselves of luxuries in order to divert, their spending power from civil consumption to war activities. In a few weeks, the Government has discovered to its dismay that its optimism, as the Opposition prophesied, was ill-founded. The previous Government recognized that the nation cannot possible finance an adequate war effort by handing round the hat, or a "" tarpaulin muster"", and that Australians have to be compelled to contribute their just proportion to war finance. This is no time for appeals to the people voluntarily to support war loans. The peril demands immediate action, and the people look to the Government for a lead. As only meagre information has been placed at our disposal, I have experienced some difficulty in preparing constructive criticism of the Government's taxation proposals. In fact, the Treasurer has supplied to the House no worthwhile information to enable honourable members to estimate whether his proposals are sound. The honourable gentleman declared that approval of the new tax was being sought at the present juncture for the purpose of financing exceptional war expenditure that will be incurred by the entry of Japan into the conflict. According to his estimate, between £40,000,000 and £50,000,000 will be required in addition to the provision that the Chifley budget made two months ago. No data have been supplied to honourable members to enable them to gauge whether the estimated rate of expenditure is being exceeded, whether estimates of revenue iire being realized, and whether the manpower and resources of the country are being adequately exploited. Personally, I doubt whether the budget estimates are being realized; but, for the must be found to wage the war, but honpresent, I shall assume that the Government requires an additional £40,000,000 or £50,000,000. The Treasurer is rapidly approaching the danger point in finance. Definitely, tbe Government must now realize, since the Labour party rejected the Fadden budget, the difference between responsibility and irresponsibility. A l though the Fadden budget contained a gap of £122,000,000 between revenue and expenditure, the money could have been obtained by voluntary loans without disturbing the soundness of our economic structure. [Extension of time granted.J My plan also provided for the sensible use of bank credit. The Chifley budget, which was substituted for the Fadden budget, originally required the finding of £137,000,000 by voluntary loans, but in response to representations Opposition regarding anomalies in the lax proposals, the gap was widened to £139,000,000. member 8 that the previous Government considered that the figure of £122,000,000 approached the danger point; the present Government is obliged to find an additional £17,000,000. The proposed new tax will bring to the Treasury approximately £12,000,000 during the remainder of the financial year, leaving the Government still to find £5,000,000 to make up the leewav of £17,000,000. But the proceeds from"" this tax will not contribute Is. towards the extraordinary expenditure of £40,000,000 or £50,000fi00 which the Treasurer urgently requires for the accelerated war effort. In my opinion, the Government is venturing f a r beyond the danger point and Australia will suffer severely from the effects of inflation. That could have been avoided if the Government had measured up to its responsibility by obtaining the money by equitable taxation, and by diverting money fro m civil consumption to war activities. Deposits in the savings banks have grown substantially since the outbreak of war and retail turnovers have increased. Those are danger signs, indicating that there is too much spending power in the community and that no definite plan has been devised for diverting purchasing power from civil consumption to war needs. The Opposition recognizes that money orable members on his side of the chamber must criticize the methods which the Government has employed to obtain the requisite finance. still believe that, a method of compulsory saving must be introduced, because tke burdens which the war imposes must be raorrequitably distributed than they a\e at present. That implies that the lov ir ranges of income must, in the circi: ns'inces, contribute to a greater dej than they are doing now. The .den budget, if it had been adopted .Id have honestly met the situation ani, 'ould have created a wise psychology <f saving amons citizens, who would have accepted their responsibility to Australia by sharing in this great national effort. When the Income Tax Assessment B ill was being considered by Parliament a I remind honourable few weeks ago, attention was drawn to the fact that at an early date the need would arise for a complete overhaul of our system of taxation. This had been brought about by continual amendments. some of them made under the strain of war-time conditions, that have added to the complexities of an already complicated taxation system. The proposal now before the committee is no exception. As the months pass, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) w ill find that those who advised him in the preparation of this measure did not give to its ultimate effects the consideration that it requires. In my opinion, honourable members must vote for the proposal because of the necessity to find the money for war needs. The Treasurer told the committee last night that he was introducing this tax in this for m because only something simple could be immediately brought into operation to meet, our urgent needs. He went on to sayWc shall have time during the next few mouths to consider any modifications which may ho desirable to f it it more harmoniously into our general financial structure, and make provision accordingly for 1042-43. That, is the redeeming part of his statement, because those who advised h i m on",24,Income Tax Assessment Bill
24,By The Mr Spooner (Kobertson) [ 5 . 1 3 ],"this (measure cannot have fully taken iffito .account its inevitable repercussions.. met was the redeeming part of his speech. .1 ,do .not mean repercussions in the sense of taxation. I do not complain -of taxation, because whatever amount of money the Treasurer jneeds he must have. Biiit how to raise that money is .another matter. I do not refer to the quantum of tax, but I wonder whether those who have advised the Treasurer have taken into account the fact that this measure, like some of its predecessors, will have the automatic effect of reducing other revenues. I explain what I mean by saying that ,£bis tax will affect the personal rates of tax that will be paid by individuals. It commences at lower a-ates of .income .and graduaHy rises until at £300 it becomes 13d. in the £1. Persons earning more than £300 a year will pay Is. in the.fl over .and above the or.dinary income tax. honourable member forgets .the deduction for federal income tax. orable member is right. T used the expression ""12d. in the £1"" because it is the expression used in the bill. The tax will be Is. in the £1 adjusted by federal income tax. That will affect the revenue which the Government proposes to collect from the tax on the undistributed profits of companies, at all events, private companies which represent a considerable part of the tax-paying system. panies pay on their undistributed profits tax at the rate that would be paid by the individual. There is a ceiling rate which the Government was obliged to introduce in the last sessional period because it had to remove the inevitable anomalies which arose under (lie legislation. The effect of the ceiling rate will be that many companies will not pay the additional tax upon the undistributed profits because they have already come on the ceiling rate. The additional Is. in the £1 adjusted by the income tax will bring nothing to the Government. We are leading one by one into these interminable complications. I do not rise to-day to be critical of the Government. I say that earnestly because it is not the time to be critical, although it is the time tn be constructive. As I said earlier, the statement by the Treasurer that this tax will be reviewed before Parliament again Apart from the fact .that he has to raise an additional £25,000,000 of revenue, which makes this bill and a company itax necessary, he recqgaiizes the necessity early :next year conajplately to .overhaul the whole business of taxation, .otherwise he will find as 'the year 1942-43 proceeds that by introducing new taxing .measures he has partly defeated the purpose of the measures which he had previously introduced for the raising of revenue from companies. Wre havse reached .the position where the tax <on the individual and the tax on the company .are so tied .together that they sanest be .separated. By .raising £2O,©.0.0,'OOQ from one tax he will lose a considerable part of that sum which he would otherwise have collected by means of another tax. I drew attention to .this fact when .as a member .supporting the Menzies 'Government I was 'sitting exactly where the right honourable -member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) sits. When that 'Govieraimeniit introduced the pay-roll tax I .supported it , but I made it clear that I did not like the tax in principle. I i was necessary for me to support that tax in order to ensure that a system of .child endowment would be introduced in Australia. I , however, directed attention to the fact that when the Government had raised £9,O0Q.,OOO by means of the payPrivate comroll tax, it -would introduce another deduction from the gross income of the taxpayer. In other words, a company paying £500 a year in pay-roll tax would deduct that payment from its income next year, and consequently the general income tax it would pay would' be correspondingly less. pened had the basic wage been increased. Mi-. SPOONER I am not assuming Ihat the pay-roll tax and the basic wage -have anything in common. allied. believe that they had anything to do with each other. I cannot assume that there would have been an increase of the basic wage but for the imposition of the pay-roll tax. I must assume that they have nothing to do with each other.

Hundreds of taxpayers would never have been affected by the increase of the basic wage even if it in the State emergency measures for the had occurredj so that my remarks are correct about them, even though the right honourable member for Yarra may be right in what he says. The fact remains that the Government is losing general income tax because of the new deduction for pay-roll tax. In the last sessional period I did not direct attention to this because it would have added criticism to the many other necessary criticisms of a constructive nature. When the Government increased the land tax I was not a party to objection to that increase, but as the Government increased the land tax so did it increase the deductions which may be made for land tax in the income tax returns of the same taxpayers. Most of the people who pay the increased land tax are those who pay the maximum rate of income tax of 16s. 8d. in the £1. The increased land tax applied only to the unimproved values of £20,000 plus £5,000 for statutory allowance, making an unimproved capital value of £25,000. It is reasonable to assume that the great majority who would pay increased land tax will pay income tax at the rate of 16s. 8d. in the £1. Therefore, the Government imposed addition to the land tax of £1 and in many cases lost 16s. Sd. which it would have collected through the income tax system. My object to-da.y is to impress upon the Treasurer the state of terrific complication which we have reached and the need for complete revision and overhaul of the whole system if the revenue is not to be seriously affected by the very measures which are being introduced at present. The Government finds when approximately half the financial year has passed that it must supplement the revenues for which it budgetted in November. If my recollection is correct, the Treasurer said when he brought down the budget that it might be necessary early in the new year to revise taxation. He is only a few weeks early, but important happenings have occurred since November. He has chosen to introduce a measure which conforms very closely to the unemployment relief taxes that were in operation in the States during the depression period. It is quite evident that this measure follows the principles which were adopted collection of taxes. Those State unemployment taxing systems were very successful. I am sure that the Treasurer hears me say that with great satisfaction. They were very successful as revenue raisers. They were not successful insofar as they did not cease to exist when the need for their application no longer existed when the special depression and unemployment conditions in respect of which they had been imposed had passed. The taxes continued and became a permanent part of the taxation system. For that reason, I should have been glad if the Treasurer had introduced into this bill a provision to the effect that it would expire automatically a certain time after the wa.r ended, in the same way as he graciously agreed to set a time limit to the war-time company tax after the bill proposing its imposition had returned from the Senate. If the tax be a wartime tax, when the war is finished the country may reasonably be expected to raise its revenue by ordinary methods of taxation aad abandon the special measures introduced for the purpose of war. an I direct the attention of the committee to the fact that there are three essential features in respect of which this bill differs from the general income tax law. This is not an increase of the ordinary income tax. Honourable members must not allow themselves to be confused into imagining that it increases the ordinary income tax. This is a special tax computed in a different way. There are three essential differences in the method of computation. First, it commences from the lower ranges of income. Secondly, it does not grant the statutory and concessional deductions allowed by the general income tax law. Thirdly, it grants a deduction for dependants by way of a rebate of tax instead of a deduction from gross income. Tlie Treasurer is right on the last point, because every one whatever his income, will receive Is. a week or £2 12s. a year for each, dependant. Mr 'Scuixm -It works out about the same. substantial differences. The Treasurer",27,Income Tax Assessment Bill

A deduction of £50 for a dependant would mean to a man on a low income a less concession than it would mean to the man on a high income. were a graduated tax, but this is a tax on a flat rate. tax. It graduates from 6d. on the base income to Is. on incomes of more than i$00 per annum. not rise as high as 16s. Sd. in the £ 1 . week would receive twice the allowance that would be received by the man on £8 a week if the allowance for dependants were a deduction from gross income. That is an important consideration. Tbe Treasurer, 1 believe, is right in adopting the flat rate principle for this purpose. I had endeavoured to make it clear that there are these, basic differences between the war-time tax now introduced and the general income rax. This is a special tax. It is a tax with principles and a structure of its own. It is a tax for the financing of the war. The Treasurer may find it necessary as time passes to increase the rates of tax provided in this bill. Of course, that is a dangerous prophesy to make, but it is evident that this measure, operating on a system that relates peculiarly to wartime conditions and commencing with a very low rate of tax, may lend itself to future adjustment. Eor this reason it is all the more urgent that the tax be reviewed during the early part of next year, with a view to welding it into the general income tax system and removing the complications which will make administration unwieldy. Does the Treasurer realize what extra administrative work w ill be thrown on to the Taxation Department by this measure? The tax will involve the computation of new assessments by entirely new means, and this work w ill require an army of export clerks, because juniors and beginners cannot be employed on such a task. The Taxation Department has not sufficient expert employees to spare for this new job. Already it must be very much behind with its work; this, of course, means that the Government is losing revenue. I ask the Treasurer to ascertain, for example, how many companies have not yet been taxed upon their undistributed profits in respect of the year 1939-40. The amount of unassessed tax, which should be in the hands of the Treasury at the present time, must be very large. I know of a number of companies which have not yet been taxed on their undistributed profits for that year. I know why these taxes are outstanding: The taxing system is so complicated that, before the Commissioner he must wait unti l he can ascertain the personal rate attributable to the shareholders. [Extension of time granted.] The Taxation Department is obviously at a disadvantage, being understaffed and unable to cope with this work, which involves hundreds of thousands of pounds of Commonwealtli revenue. This measure will throw on to its shoulders another complicated tax system requiring the employment of more expert officers. I doubt the wisdom of the proposal. However, I am not prepared to challenge the basic principle of the bill. The Treasurer must raise an additional £20,000,000. This is a means towards that end. I urge the honourable gentleman not to neglect this problem in the rush of other matters during the early part of next year. A fte r a financial period has been commenced, it is easy to ignore the operation of the taxation system unti l a new period is imminent. During the coming year, the Treasurer will be almost overwhelmed by many complications, and those caused by this measure will not be the least of them. I suppose that it would be f a ir and reasonable for the Opposition to say to the Government, with regard to this bill, "" ""We told you so; we told you that it would be necessary to impose some extra rate of tax upon lower incomes, partly for the purpose of raising revenue and partly for the purpose of reducing the amount of spending power in the hands of the publica spending power which is causing an undue increase of the manufacture of non-essential goods."" In this regard, the position is no different now from what it was in October last. However, I do not propose to say this to the Government. Instead, I congratulate it upon what it is doing.

34,Mr Spooner,"'.I'h e man on £8 abelieve that it is doing die proper thing and that it has realized that it must, for the protection of the nation's finances, is already seriously overloaded with work, impose some extra tax upon the lower rates of income. It deserves to be congratulated, therefore, upon having the courage to change its opinion. I believe that it will be necessary to impose even higher rates of tax on lower incomes in the future, not because anybody -wants people to pay more tax, but because, having regard to the huge amount of public income and the cumulative effect, of this increased spending power on the needs of the war industries, the finances of the nation must be stabilized. I repeat that the Government is adding one more serious complication to the taxation system. ""Unless this matter be taken in hand in the early part of next year, it may be a severe handicap to the Government in the conduct of the war. The financial problems of the Government in the year 1942-43 will be considerably greater than they are now. In the early part of next year the Government will have to clear its decks and prepare its plans for the future. If this war demands anything, it demands an assurance that whatever funds the country needs must be obtained by some means. War finance is entirely different from any other form of finance. In peace time, developmental works arc carried out according to the money that is available. In war time, the Government has to decide what work must be done, and then take steps to secure the requisite revenue. The Government must straighten out our taxation system and bring this and other measures into a general scheme that conforms with sounder principles of revenueraising. ?hould have preferred the Government to adopt a method of raising this revenue other than that which it has selected. However. I realize that, the revenue is needed, and that the Government in its wisdom considers the method provided in this bill to be the most, suitable one. Therefore, I believe that the Parliament must authorize its proposals. As the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) has pointed out, this measure will necessitate the creation of additional administrative machinery. The Taxation Department and the collection of revenue is therefore being delayed. However, there is an even move serious aspect of the matter than this. The production of munitions, which is vital to our war effort, is being held up because of the fact that the skilled cost investigators and qualified accountants who arc needed by the Munitions Department are not available to it. The complicated system of munitions production which has been instituted in Australia, including the cost-plus method, requires the employment of capable accountants. However, the Taxation 'Commissioner pays higher fees to these men than are offered by the Munitions Department, and therefore he secures the services of most of those who are available. Also, many qualified accountants are engaged by taxpayers in order to work out income tax returns. The Munitions Department needs these men more urgently than does the Taxation Commissioner or the taxpayer. But. it cannot obtain their services, and, accordingly, payments to war contractors are being delayed and the production of munitions is being retarded unduly. This difficulty can be overcome only by causing the Commonwealth Bank to function as it was intended to function-by using the national credit and simplifying financial procedure. At this grave time, we are called upon to pool the lives of the community. Therefore, we should pool all of our resources, even to private wealth and private homes. Some people may have more than others, but -what does that matte] when everything we have is at 1 stake? If we should be defeated we should all be in the same plight. Speaking on the subject of man-power, the honourable member for Boothby (Dr. Price) said that he would be ruthless, and he asked the Government to be ruthless. But, I nm sure that, on a question of the taxation of wealth, he would favour only a very small dose of ruthlessness. There cannot he any small doses of that medicine, because sooner or later all of the resources of the nation will have to be thrown into the common pool, and national credit will have to be used in order to simplify our financial system and speed up the operation of our war industries. Profits and",29,Income Tax Assessment Bill
35,Mr Morgan (Reid) [4.37],"Ipersonal gain should not be considered at this time. If we should be defeated, all profits would be worthless. All that is needed by the people to-day is a sustenance allowance, so that everybody may be made available to perform service for the nation in whatever sphere of activity they can do so. Many business men, primary producers and others, are struggling to pay income tax assessed on their income for the year 1940-41. Their incomes have fallen considerably this year, and they have not sufficient means to pay their taxes and yet continue to operate efficiently. are working in non-essential industries should be made available for war work. The nation is in the position of a ship in distress and waiting for somebody to come to its rescue. The munition workers and other members of the civil population will come to the rescue of Australia in the event of invasion. If that happens, those people who participate in the rescue of the ship of State-the fighting men, the munitions workers and others--will be entitled to participate in the distribution of the national wealth so salvaged, just as the rescuers of a ship would be entitled to participate in its salvage. Provision should be made for the billeting of munition workers. Soldiers have frequently been billeted in private homes. To-day we have an army behind the lines -it has been termed "" an army in overalls ""-and we should make provision for billeting them. It is too late now to talk about the provision of a proper housing scheme for them. Many munitions workers are working twelve hours a day. They have to leave home at about 5 a.m., and do not return until 9 p.m. Their efficiency is being imdermmed because of the long hours of travelling between their homes and"" the factories. Many of them could be usefully employed during much of the time which is wasted in travelBecause of petrol rationing, it is impossible for many workers to get to work expeditiously. The Government should make animmediate survey of the accommodation available foif naimiitions workers; Owners of houses should be asked to supply details of the unused accoromodation in their homes. All such accommodation should be available'to .munitions workers ia the localities in which they are engaged. Mr Morgan. We are somewhat in the position of persons caught on an ice floe and trying to escape to safety. If they remain on the floe until it breaks up, they must necessarily sink; if they try to step off gingerly, keeping one foot on the floe and trying to put the other foot somewhere else, they must also inevitably perish. If we attempt to patch up the present capitalist economy by orthodox methods of finance, and to keep our feet on the old order, which is breaking up like the ice floe, we shall find ourselves in an impossible posiPeople who tion. In order to extricate ourselves we must take courage and jump with one bound into a new and better order, so that we may develop a more co-operative civilization in which a new monetary system will provide for our needs. It is a matter for great regret that on the day following the endorsement by this Parliament of the declaration of war on Japan and certain other countries we should be considering taxation measures necessary to implement the national policy in a House in which hardly any of the members of the Ministry are present. Having caused members of the Parliament to reassemble from the four corners of the continent, the Government surely should do them the courtesy of listening to the views that they are expressing. These views will naturally show wide divergences of opinion, but, nevertheless,, they are worthy of close attention by the Government. I regret, therefore, that I , as some other honourable members have done, have to address practically empty benches. I make these remarks so that they may be recorded in Hansard, for I regard the situation as a reflection upon the Government and upon the parliamentary system on which we rely. twice as many Government supporters as opposition members in the chamber. able member for Richmond realize that the circumstances of the last two or three weeks have caused an enormous increase of the work of Ministers ? of the present sitting.

39,Mr Anthony,"As, after the closenot meet for two or three months, it is highly desirable that the Government should give close attention to the views that honourable members are now expressing, for these viewa are closely related to the war effort ,and to the financial policy of the country. Whether the views of honourable members are sound or not, it cannot be denied that they are representative of the opinions of a considerable section of the Australian people. With the passing of the war into this new phase there has come a oall for the Administration to exhibit a degree of courage perhaps never previously shown by an Australian government. We all .should be prepared to abandon our old party shibboleths and endeavour unitedly to face the new situation that confronts us. One of our urgent needs is to organize the resources of the country so that a maximum war effort may be exerted.. Taxation .measures in war-time should be designed not only to raise money but also to divert spending from non-essential to essential needs. If money alone were necessary, it could be provided by various methods advocated by -different schools of thought, but money in itself means very little. As an agency for the war-time organization of the country, however, it means a great deal. The honourable member for Reid( Mr sumption goods industries. Thus, the standard Morgan) referred to the insiifEciency of trained accountants to assist in our war industries. He spoke truly when he said that the Government was not able to obtain the services of .sufficient skilled accountants. Why is this so? It is because of the attraction of jobs in civil industry. The greater the demand for civil goods, tlie greater is the call upon skilled labour for the production of such goods. One of the purposes of war-time taxation, therefore, should be to discourage the demand for non-essential civil goods.. Everything possible should be done to divert our activities to war production. Is the Government fully alive to this need, and, if so, to what extent is it fulfilling its obligations 1 Let me direct the attention of honourable gentlemen to some remarks made on this subject in an address which Dr. Schacht, as president of the Reichsbank, delivered ou the 29th November, 1938, before the Economic Advisory Booard of the Deutsche Academie. He said-Simply expressed tJie problem was as follows: The credit money made available for the armament programme produced a demand for consumption goods, in so far as it was paid out in the form of wages and salaries. The CHAIRM AN ( Mr Prowse) I cannot see the applica tion of the honourable gentleman's remarks to the motion before the committee. that taxation measures in war-time should be examined in order to ascertain whether they will be effective, not only in providing money for war purposes, but also in diverting money from the production and purchase of non-essential civil goods. We ought to aim to use all of our materials and labour for war purposes. Germany did this, and, in many respects, that country provides us with an object lesson in the organization of a nation's resources for war. Dr. Schacht went on to sayThe armament manufacturers deliver military goods which are indeed produced but not consumed. This leads to two conclusions-. First, caa-e must he taken that in addition to armament production, .a volume of consumption goods is produced which is sufficient for the needs of the population, including all those working for rn-armament; and, second, the less is consumed the .more workers can he allotted to armaments. This, however, leads to greater consumption and thus to increased labour requirements on the part of the conof Jiving and the extent of re-armament stand in inverse .relation to each other. The less T consume the more I save, and the more I save the TIIOTO I can spend on -armaments. This means that arana-ments, in the Anal analysis, can be financed not through money creation but only through .savings. Taxation is, of course, another means of saving in order to secure money for government expenditure. There is, therefore, a vital .connection between the Government's taxing proposals and its scheme for the war organization of industry .and .armament. I look upon the post of Treasurer in war-time as being comparable to that of the Minister for the Army, the Minister for the Navy, or the Minister for Air. If the Treasurer fails in his duty to provide money for war purposes, the service Ministers must fail in their duty to provide equipment. Consequently, the duty to organize the eonntry for war falls very heavily upon the Treasurer.",31,Income Tax Assessment Bill
40,Mr Anthony,"I am pointing outWhilstI congratulate the Government upon having introduced this measure to provide for a relatively small addition to the war taxes of the country, I must say that I do not think it goes far enough to meet the present difficult conditions. The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) and some of his colleagues who have had experience of government financial difficulties must also be of this opinion. The greatest obligation that rests upon the Government at the moment is to keep our financial structure sound and to prevent, as far as possible, the development of an inflationary condition. This bill will not do very much in that connection. The Government should take all necessary steps to withdraw surplus spending power from the community and to divert all of our energies to war production. During the last year or two between 200,000 and 300,000 additional persons have been found employment in war industries and businesses engaged in the production of civil goods. This has resulted in an extraordinary expansion of the spending power of the community. Unless the Government takes the situation in hand at once it will find that in the not distant future, perhaps about the middle of next year, we shall be in a spiral from which we shall not be able to extricate ourselves. I commend to the Government the adoption of a policy similar to that of the Government of Canada. The effect of this would be not only to yield a substantial increase of revenue from taxation, but also to seal wages and prices in order to stave off inflation. Par too little has been done in this regard in Australia up to date. The present measure may be regarded as an indication that more severe taxation has yet to be imposed. If the Government dawdles, and plays with.the situation, as I sometimes fear that it will, this country will not be able to do itself justice in the fight that lies ahead. organization of our resources. Those ing fast enough to please the honourable member ? certain fields-the company tax, for instance-ha s reached such a point that some companies which produce civil goods are practically being forced out of existence. On the other hand, the vast field of spending power represented by those who receive incomes of less than £400 a year has scarcely been touched. The Government ought to take its courage in its hands, and deal with the problem from the standpoint of national interest rather than from a political point of view. It is all very well to say that we are going to make a 100 per cent, war effort. I applaud the speech made over the air recently by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), but I look for deeds rather than for words. If the gallant words of the honourable gentleman and his Ministers are not supplemented by such action as will organize the resources of this country as they could be organized, the Government will fail lamentably in its duty to the nation. I hope that, in the new year, further measures will be brought clown to increase the range of taxes, by embracing the field referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, namely, the £560,000,000 field represented by persons receiving under £400 a year. That field must be attacked. There is no courage in taxing the higher ranges until they are wiped out, simply because few votes are involved. [Extension of time granted.'] The Government is required to exhibit that courage which the people of Australia demand of an administration in existing circumstances. It will not be exhibiting courage if it avoids the severe taxation of those whose votes it might alienate. I am confident that the working man in the factory, the farmer, the business man, and the high magnate are prepared to do everything possible, and that whatever demands may be made upon the working classes will be cheerfully met, in view of the existing situation. I urge upon the Government, and the Treasury in particular, to regard itself not so much as a taxing machine but rather as an instrument for the resources can be organized. Vast numbers of individuals, and vast quantities of material, can be released from civil industry, if appropriate taxation measures be taken. If the purchasing power of the community in respect of civil needs were diminished hy millions of pounds, that amount could be devoted by the Government, to wartime",32,Income Tax Assessment Bill

I have endeavoured to touch upon the broad principles raised by tlie occasion, rather than to deal with this measure in detail. ""We have to view the whole of our war effort in broad outline; the small details do not matter very greatly. This country will have to put forward a tremendous effort for the organization of our resources. The Prime Minister has expressed that view. That will not be the result if the Government fails to do those things which would make for an all-in war effort. I submit these views with possibly not much hope of their being adopted at the moment. I believe that within the next twelve months the existing circumstances will compel whatever government is in office to do very many unpleasant things, and to tax right down to the bottom of the scale. Every person in this country ought to be required to make some direct contribution to the Commonwealth for defence purposes, and I believe that all would be willing to do so, just as in New Zealand all of the people, from the charwoman to the company director drawing very large fees, are required to pay a flat rate. the whole of the resources of the nation; the nation taking over the whole show? support any measures which will assist us to meet the enemy at the gate.

This, instead of assisting us in our fight, would tion, said, "" When a government begins cause disorganization, as it did in Russia 27 years ago. Any new state of society must await the termination of the conflict; not until then can we embark upon wholesale re-organization. I sincerely hope that the Government and its suj>porters will give some thought to the need for diverting vast numbers of individuals from the production of civil goods into war channels. I reiterate [42] that that can be done only by rationing, allocation, or conscription for industrial purposes. One of the most potent means is the taxing machinery. I suggest to the Treasurer, and to others who are responsible for the Government's financial policy, that this is a major matter, which they must consider-ho w they can best serve the country at the present juncture 'by the organization of its financial resources through the taxing machinery. One is reluctant to speak at length upon this particular financial measure. It h obvious that the Government is faced with the responsibility of raising further money. Buti t is not inopportune to draw attention to the fact tliat the Government has adopted many of the principles advanced by the last Government, which Labour sternly resisted when in Opposition. Nor is it inopportune to refer to the speeches made by, for example, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt)-who , in his first speech upon finance, enunciated the most amazing ideas as to how money could be procured through the Commonwealth Bank-the Minister for Home upon finance hardly square with anything that the Government has brought forward to date-and the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman), who from time to time has delivered lofty lectures upon the subject. The GoI am prepared to vernment has shown that it learns very slowly. It is clear that in the seat of responsibility it has realized, even though belatedly, that before a war can be properly financed it is necessary to apply taxes to the lower ranges of income. Only on the 1st October of this year, the Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposito tax incomes of £150 for the purpose of financing the war, it is beyond all doubt taking everything that tbe people in receipt of those incomes have"".

Yet now we find that those very things which we were told would bring disaster upon' the country are being done by our opponents after only ten weeks iu office. What reason is advanced by the Government for this voile face? It is, that meanwhile expenditure has increased by £40,000,000. We were entitled to receive, in general outline, particulars as to how that increase had occurred, but not one word upon the subject has been vouchsafed. If it be right now to go into the lower ranges of income, as I claim that it is. it was right ten weeks ago. changed in the last ten weeks? the fact that Japan has come into the war. RutI have always assumed that we were putting forward our maximum war effort long before then. The suggestion now advanced is of no moment; it simply indicates that the Government bit by bit has adopted the financial policy laid down by the present Opposition when it was in power. Examples of this tardy realization of inescapable consequences are to -be found in the recent statement of the Prime Minister regarding reduced spending-i a suggestion advanced some months ago by the Government of the day -ith e use of women in war, and now the taxing of lower incomes. Thus the Government, which, ten weeks ago, was accused of introducing a rich man's budget, has been vindicated by the acts of those who then resisted its proposals. I let the matter pass with the comment that the members of the present Ministry have always been apostles of easy finance. Some members of the Government have made speeches which cannot bo reconciled with what is now being done. Fcr example, the Minister for Home Security has made some stirring speeches indicating how the Commonwealth Rank could advance money and the poor could escape taxation. We listened patiently to a lot of such drool and drivel. Now, those men are silent. It seems to me that the Government is dealing with this matter in piecemeal fashion. Finance is just as vital a part of the war organization of this country as are the fighting services. The financial programme of the Government gives no evidence of co-ordination with the general war effort. What lead, for example, has been given to the people in respect of luxury goods? We have been told for weeks past by the Prime Minister that the purchase of luxury goods should be avoided. The question arises, what are luxury goods? Has any lead been given by the Government in this regard? None whatever, and the reason is that the Government is reluctant to face the sectional opposition which it would meet were it to say that goods of this or that class must not be purchased. However, it must face the situation eventually. How are we to achieve the real purpose of war finance, namely, the diversion of effort from peace to war activities? The Government has imposed very heavy taxation on incomes of more than £1,000, and particularly on those between £1,500 and £2,500. I make no plea for the man of property, who must necessarily contribute to the defence of the country in accordance with his ability to pay. He has a greater stake to defend than has the man without property, but I appeal to the Government, when considering further taxation measures, to make them bear some relation to the amount of wealth which the taxpayer possesses. Any one who examines the Government's taxation proposals will admit that they bear very heavily on the professional and executive classes. We say that this is a land of opportunity in which a boy with no money behind him may, in the course of years, advance himself and accumulate property. That is an essential feature of democracy, and young men should be encouraged to advance themselves in this way. However, a professional man cannot, by virtue of his position, accumulate substantial resources. As his income increases, lit* properly and necessarily incurs commitments. He purchases a home in keeping with his income, and he takes out insurance policies for the protection of his wife and family in the event of his sudden death. Thus, when heavy taxation is imposed on him, he has not the same resources to meet, it as has the man",34,Income Tax Assessment Bill

It was not thought that we could spend so much money in that way, but production has been stepped up considerably in recent weeks, and that has necessarily increased expenditure beyond tlie estimate.

The assistance tliat was expected will not now be fully realized and a further strain will be thrown on the budget. Those are matters which should have been obvious to the honourable member for Warringah. Then there is the extra expenditure incurred almost overnight on air-iraid precautions -work, and this will run into a very large sum.

So far as we apply it to income tax, it relates only to tbe upper strata of income. The combination of Commonwealth and State taxes may, on the last few pounds earned by a man in receipt of a very high income, exceed 20s. in the £1. to persons who earn between £1,000 and £2,000 a year. As the result of increasingly abnormal taxation, the burden becomes disproportionately heavier upon an income derived from personal exertion than upon an income derived from property. qualification with that statement. The only way in which to meet the position is to increase the rates on income derived from property compared with those derived from personal exertion, thereby returning to the principles of taxation which existed several years ago. The contentions of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) were supported by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) and by the honourable member for Warringah. The burden of most of their remarks was that the Government was not receiving sufficient tax from the income groups below £400 a year. They pointed out that those groups represent £560,000,000; the total income received by private persons, apart from public income, is £800,000,000 a year. According to the honourable member for Richmond, the Government is somewhat belatedly making a very slight move to tax those groups. I remind the honourable gentleman that receipts from taxation borne by persons in those groups represents nearly £12,000,000 a year. We have become so accustomed to talk in astronomical figures that we refer to a tax which yields £12,000,000 as being a mere trifle. But the contribution which each individual makes to that sum from his small income represents to him a substantial amount. The honourable member for Richmondi n "" war effort. From the'charwoman to the big company, he said, all should make sacrifices. That principle is accepted by the great majority of the people; but if we analyse the real meaning of sacrifice, we must ensure that no section of the community has more meals a day than another section. There is a minimum below which we cannot descend. However much we speak of sacrifices, rates and percentages, we should not reduce one section of tbe people below the living standard whilst others continue to live in most comfortable circumstances. If we advocate all round sacrifices, we must examine not how many millions of pounds are drawn from any one group, but how much is left to each individual after he has paid his tax. That is the crux of the matter-. The Leader of the Opposition declared that persons in the income groups below £400 a year will contribute in taxation only 2.7 per cent, of their income. Percentages are most misleading. What contributions do these individuals make, and how many of them are in each group? The great majority of the people are' to be found in those groups. And what do we mean by "" taxable capacity "" ? The taxable capacity of a person is the amount that he can pay after he has a basic living. I am not prepared to say what that is, but we have established a certain standard in Aiistralia by the basic wage. If the small income-earner be compelled to come below what has been for years the minimum living standard, does that reprean anntial income of sent equality of sacrifice? In order to pay his tax, he may have to sacrifice a portion of a meal each daya potato, or a slice of bread. But the well-to-do sections, after paying their taxes, are still able to afford sumptuous repasts. I mentioned that the combined earnings of the groups in receipt of less than £400 a year total £560,000,000 per annum. One-third of that figure is represented by the incomes of persons in receipt of less than £200 a",37,Income Tax Assessment Bill

Honourable members opposite may declare that in an '-' all-in"" war effort, all should make some contribution.

To describe as inequitable the fact that one person pays tax at the rate of 16s. 8d. in the £1 whilst another pays at the rate of Is. 4d. in the £1 is to disregard the real position. The man who pays at the rate of 16s. 8d. in the £1 may have a net income of £3,000 a year, whilst the poor man, as a result of being compelled to make his contribution, might be obliged to forgo a meal each day. {Extension of time granted.] The following table shows the different groups and the amount of tax that each of them pays:Common* Income.

That'is not the standard by which this should he measured. all individuals and companies were to pool all of their possessions in order to defend their hearths and homes in Australia, we should have to draw from that pool in order to keep each individual fit for the purpose of performing his daily tasks. That is practically all that is left to those groups, which are now being assailed on the ground that they do not make an adequate contribution to the war effort. Later we may be obliged to reduce this standard. Speaking for my constituents, I say that they will face cheerfully any tightening of the belt provided that everybody else's Mr Scullin. belt is brought to the same notch. That is the test. I grow weary of hearing continual attacks upon the Government on the ground that it lacks courage, because of the enormous voting strength of the groups, to impose upon them a reasonable tax. I am concerned not about votes, but about empty stomachs. I shall not say that what we are doing to-day will starve them; but what we are doing is not pleasant to me, and it would not have been done but for the exigencies of war. I admit we have reached the ceiling on some incomes, but not all of them. The middle and upper incomes are heavily taxed, but the earners still have more to live on than the poor. I agree that they have more commitments, but commitments are not a means of livelihood. There is a minimum. I ask honourable members, in fairness, to keep that in mind when they talk about the all-in sacrifice. I War Tax.

The figures given by the right honourable member for Yarra were interesting, but I suggest that a If better way in which to approach the consideration of this proposed war tax is by comparing the figures set out in the first table suppMed to honourable members by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley). That table shows that a taxpayer without dependants in the highest-taxed State will pay in war tax £6 10s. from an income of £200, £9 14s. on £250, £13 18s. on £300, £16 14s, on £350, and £18 18s. on £400. Those payments are heavy, but it must be borne in mind that the Government in the highest-taxed State also imposes heavy taxes, starting at £7 per annum on £150 and rising as follows:£200, £11 4s.; £250, £21 16s.; £300,",38,Income Tax Assessment Bill

I am at a loss to understand why the Treasurer estimates that in the current year he will receive from this tax only £8,000,000, whereas the estimated annual revenue is £20,500,000. This tax is to operate as from the 1st July, 1941, but the tax which is to be paid this year is levied on income earned in the year ended the 30th June, 1941. Before rhe end of the year the Taxation Department will issue assessments not only of income tax, but also of the proposed war tax. although the tax will be payable, it will not be collectable. the department .may find trouble in issuing assessments. collecting the money. lax assessments will be issued concurrently with the ordinary income tax assessments, and I shall be surprised if those assessments are not issued before the end of June. posed, technically speaking, at half the rate for the year and half the year's revenue w i ll be collected. tax and the development tax be deducted before the war tax is assessed? federal income tax w ill be a deduction. lightened as to the proposed increase of the company tax by Is. in the £1. is not now before the Chair. announced the proposed increase last night when he was introducing the new proposals and some discussion has taken place on the proposal to increase the company tax.

I should say that the Taxation Department has taken into consideration, in arriving at its estimate of receipts from this proposed tax, tlie fact that the imposition of other taxes w ill mean that the money in the hands of the taxpayers w ill be lessened. The effect of double taxation of the company and the shareholder will be that the shareholders will not have the income that they previously had to be taxed on. money is taken in one way in another way. I realize that the Government must have revenue and that in trying to devise means to raise that revenue the Treasurer and the taxation officials have been confronted bymany problems. Early next year .Parliament should be given the opportunity to review the whole financial and taxation policy of Australia, not only Commonwealth and State but also municipal. Anomalies, injustices, and burdens increase in proportion to the number of I ' t a k e it that the war taxes imposed. The Treasurer's table shows that a man on £500 a year in the highest taxed State will pay in Federal and State taxes and the war tax £105 6s. as against only £7S in the lowest taxed State. In order to os'ercoine such tax will be imanomalies as that a more scientific and simpler system of taxation must be applied. If that were done the Taxation Department would have reason to be W ill the State income grateful.

But the ordinary The community would also benefit from a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation. This war w ill cause I should like to be endrastic alterations of our monetary system. Those alterations should be brought about in a well-ordered fashion, but whether they are, or whether the problem w ill be intensified, w ill depend on the consideration which we are prepared to The Treasurer give to the matter.

The great number of the people who are to be increasingly taxed under these proposals have no accumulations of wealth from which to pay taxes. They have no savings. Their savings have been canalized, one might say, in insurance policies, and in provision for the education of their childbe absorbed. Certain skilled occupations ren and so forth. They will pay their tax out of their current income. That is an important fact which we ought to remember. It should be possible for any country industries, and ageing law clerks will not to devise a scheme whereby people could pay their income tax out of their income, as and when they earn it, instead of being called upon to pay a lump sum. Australians are in general allowed to pay by instalments, but they have no right to that concession. We should base our income tax system on the payment of amounts week by week, fortnight by fortnight, or month by month, as the taxpayers' incomes are received. If we curtail the civil employment of people in the way that has been suggested, we shall curtail their ability to pay income tax. As war employments and war activities increase, so civil employment and civil activities will diminish. But what are we going to do about those who are displaced as the result of this change? It is true that our young men will be absorbed in the defence forces and receive service pay. Their places will be taken to some degree by older men, but to a far greater degree by young women. Many of our older men will be displaced from employment altogether, and will therefore have no opportunity to earn income. If there is to be a diversion of capital and labour from civil employment to war employment, a vast number of people will be left without the means of living. They will also be without the means of paying income tax, but the fact that they will have no means of living is far more important than that. This country must face this problem. For the duration of the war, we should place everybody in the community beyond the fear of want. Every person should be placed on the "" strength "", to use a military term, and should be maintained. In the early part of next year, this country will face a period of unemployment and industrial crisis comparable with that which it had to face in the early stages of the war of 1914-18. gentleman referring to the displacement of unskilled persons, whose services will not be required in defence industries? a number of skilled persons who will not are of no use to the defence effort. Not all weavers and spinners, for instance, will be absorbed in defence be absorbed. The honourable member's remarks are wide of the motion. discuss this measure as other honourable members have discussed it. I did not originate this line of discussion, but if you, sir, are not prepared to extend to me the indulgence that you extended to the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) and the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), I must defer to your ruling. I have never led an insurrection against the Chair in my life. chair when the honourable member for Warringah made his remarks. ( Mr Chifley) believes that it will be easy to get this income tax from the community under the conditions that will prevail next year, he is gravely mistaken. It will be very difficult to get any income tax from a large number of people, not only working people, but also other persons with small incomes. I agree with what was said by the honourable member for Warringah. I have pointed out before that the effect of taxation and of government policies has been to curtail the opportunities of a large number of people to earn income, to destroy the businesses of small tradesmen, and to take away their prospects of security. I congratulate the Government rather than condemn it, although it has left itself open to much criticism. I do so because it has courageously changed its attitude towards a matter of policy over which it defeated the previous Government. This change of attitude shows that when the Labour party assumed office and",40,Income Tax Assessment Bill

The Government made a great sacrifice in doing this. I know that, although Australia is in jeopardy, when the people learn to-morrow that a Labour Government has imposed an extra tax upon small incomes, many ardent Labour supporters will be severely shocked. Less than three months ago, even the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and his colleagues criticized .the Padden 'Government, and succeeded in defeating it, because it proprevent wastage of government money. posed to impose heavier taxes on the lower incomes. The right honourable member for Yarr a ( Mr Scullin) submitted a good defence of the Government's change of attitude. He made an excellent contribution to this debate, as he does to any debate in which he participates, but the fact remains that Labour has abandoned principles which have been implicit in its policy ever since the party was formed. I am afrai d that, at the next elections, many of its hitherto enthusiastic supporters will approach the polling booths in a new frame of mind. The Government has shown a high degree of courage, for which we praise it, but for which many of its supporters w ill condemn it . In spite of its stand, I consider that it has not acted so wisely as it might have done. It would have done better if it had adopted the proposals submitted by the former Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), because these would not have fallen so heavily upon the working classes. The previous Government proposed to collect large sums from the lower income groups, but much, of this money would have been treated as loans to be repaid after the war. Disagreeable as these imposts would have been, they would have been more acceptable to the people than the present proposal, even though it may be a more honest form of tax. I should not carp at the rate of tax proposed. The contribution of £20,000,000 a year that will be made by the lower income groups under this tax will exceed the amount of income tax paid by all taxpayers two brief years ago. The increase is indeed a severe one. One of the excuses offered by the Treasurer for the imposition of this tax was that we arc now at war with Japan, but three months ago the Fadden Government anticipated this in its budget proposals. Before the war is over, the Government w ill doubtless be obliged to submit proposals for a higher rate of tax. The people of Australia w ill meet their obligations. We cannot afford to lose the war, because it involves everything which we own and hold dear. I shall not grumble at the weight of the burden which I shall have to bear, and I know that my fellow Australians w ill not complain. But the people want to I do not now refer particularly to waste that has occurred under the administration of this Government, because much extravagant expenditure occurred under previous governments. It has been evident in every military camp throughout Australia. I hope that the Government will ensure that such waste shall not continue. An examination of the Government's proposals shows that a man earning £40,000 a year will be obliged to contribute through Commonwealth and State taxes, an amount of £36,000. Most of the persons who receive such high incomes derive them from property, which is also subject to municipal rates, so that, after paying all rates and taxes, they are left practically penniless. I do not know what powers the Treasurer may have in this regard, but he should investigate the incidence of municipal taxation. Many municipalities have made very little contribution to the war effort. There are some outstanding instances, of course, but they are not numerous. We have heard a great deal about the combined incidence of Commonwealth and State taxes, but most honourable members have lost sight altogether of the high rates of municipal tax which prevail throughout the Commonwealth. Whilst we all agree that the highest income earners should make the largest individual contributions to the war, we should study closely the effect of existing heavy taxation upon them. What does a man who earns £40,000 a year do when he is obliged to pay Commonwealth and State taxes amounting to £36,000, in addition to municipal taxes? He must curtail his expenditure, so he dismisses members of his domestic staff. He may have in his employ a motor driver who is over military age. He will discharge that man. He may have other servants who have been with him for almost a lifetime. He will discharge them. He will be obliged to reduce his standard of living, and as the result a number of unfortunate people will he thrown out of employment. This bill has been drafted to meet a war-time emergency. It is panic legislation. I hope that the Treasurer will heed my remarks, and also pay attention to the many letters which have been published in the newspapers recently. Some of these letters point out that, under existing rates of tax, the spending power of a man receiving £5,000 a year is reduced to less than that of u man receiving £4,000 a year, whose net income, in turn, is reduced below the level of that, of a man receiving £3,000 a year. Tliese anomalies should be investigated by the Treasurer. I am sure that the Government did not intend to put a man in receipt of a high salary in a worse finannot an ordinary occasion. Certain special cial position than that of a man earning a considerably lower salary. I have criticized the Government, but, on the whole, I believe that it has risen to the occasion. When the Labour party was iu opposition, many of its members made irresponsible utterances, but to-day they are behind the scenes and they realize what is expected of them. So far as 1 can see, they are doing their job well. Many people believed that the Labour party's attitude towards the war-time needs of the country was twelve months behind that of the united parties on this side of the House. To-day the disparity has been reduced to three months, because the Government is adopting proposals which its predecessor made three months ago. If it continues at this rate it may become more advanced in its views than the parties on this side of the chamber, t hope that it will maintain this progress. I believe that honourable members who support the Government are as loyal as are honourable members of the Opposition, and I believe that Ministers may be trusted to prosecute the war effort to the best advantage. One of the most bitter political pills that they have had to swallow is this increase of the rate of tax on the lower incomes, and they deserve to be congratulated upon their courageous acceptance of the situation.

I generally confine my remarks to those occasions on which I find myself out of agreement with what is being proposed. But this is circumstances about to-night's meeting of the House call for comment. We have had many taxing measures placed before us since the outbreak of the war in 1939. Not a great deal was said about the taxing measures consequent upon the budget of 1939, but the budget of 1940, introduced after a general election, provided for certain increases of taxes, especially in relation to lower incomes, which were debated at some length. On that occasion the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) succeeded in inducing the Government of the day, wrongly, I think, to adopt what has become known as the compromise of 1940. It is interesting to observe how the attitude of the Labour party has changed on these subjects within a very few months. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Perkins) said this afternoon that honourable gentlemen oppositf were about twelve months behind thij times all the time. Having this in mind I shall refer to some observations made by the present Prime Minister when hp was Leader of the Opposition in 1940.

Later the honourable gentleman referred to certain estimates of the yield of revenue anticipated from Federal trespass in certain fields of taxation and observed1. am not surprised that that table is correct abundant supplies of food so that no one need because the whole theory is that if the Treasurer is in difficulties and has to get the money he can get it only by bringing iuto the field the great number of those who have previously been outside it. You cannot go up; you have to step down. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister is beginning to realize the force of some of his own statements. We debated another budget in October. 1941. posals for substantial increases of income tax, and the. introduction of a system of compulsory savings. It was in consequence of those proposals that a change of government took place. I should not be allowed to quote from the Hansard report of the current session of Parliament in order to direct attention to certain statements by the present Prime Minister but I have available to me a pamphlet entitled Digest of Decisions and Announcements. a.nd Important Speeches by the Prime Minister (Hon. John Curtin). It cannot be said that in making the statements published in this pamphlet the Prime Minister was not in a position to realize the extent to which he was committing himself and his party, for, Heaven knows, he was aware of the situation which faced us. One statement that the honourable gentleman made-and this is from his broadcast summary of the 1941-42 budget-wa s as follows:The new budget, however, contains many new and important features which give effect lo 'Labour's views. It provides for increases iu soldiers' pay and in old-age pensions; it distributes the burden of taxation over those bust able to bear that burden; it relies ou the voluntary principle for loans; it proposes to draw upon central bank credit to finaiice expansion of production. The honourable gentleman made other remarks along these lines, and finished that aspect of the subject by sayingmember for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) It pledges the Government early next year to introduce legislation for a mortgage bank. Another notable observation which the honourable gentleman made on that occasion waslu accordance with this principle that is ability to paythe essential living standards of the basic wage family can and will be maintained under the Government's plans. Happily we have suffer privation of any of the things necessary to maintain the bodily health and strength of our people. Those statements were made six weeks ago. If there were any doubt as to the intention of the Government to proceed along those lines it was removed by a statement of the honourable member for Wimmera, who, in addressing himself to the subject of the taxing of lower incomes, This contained important prosaid that it would not add one iota to the success of our efforts to wage the war. I do not raise these issues in any spirit of vindictiveness or with any desire to delay the passage of essential legislation. We are living in very serious times and one of the most serious things about the meeting of this House to-night-and I make this statement deliberately-is that a goodly number of honourable members of the House have already lef t Canberra to return to their homes. sition side of the House. care to which side they belong. I say that any member of this Parliament who, for private reasons, has left his duties here and gone to his home is, in my opinion, no better than a man who in battle "" rats "" on his cobbers in the firing line.

88,Mr Archiecameron,"I do notinvolve this Parliament in the consideration of certain other very important subjects. Considering the pains to which some honourable gentlemen went to secure election to this Parliament the least they could do, in the circumstances which now face us, is to remain here to see their job through. I do not care who the members are who are absent from the chamber on this occasion. I consider that their names and actions should be published throughout tlie length and breadth of Australia and, particularly, in their own electorates. In 1940) the then Treasurer ( Mr sions on which some of us who have Padden) suggested that the income exemption should be reduced to £150. The present Government has now reduced it to £156, which is only £6 above the figure to which honourable gentlemen opposite refused to agree in December, 1940. They also refused, six weeks ago, to accept the compulsory savings plan. WhilstI was not particularly enthusiastic about that plan, believing that straight out taxation was a better method, I was not willing to make a row about it. 1 say that the opposition to, and condemnation of, that proposal by members and supporters of the present Government WHS unjustified in view of the need to obtain revenue. In any case honourable gentlemen opposite have now to face the necessity to impose additional taxation on people in the lower income ranges. They would not do this three weeks ago, but circumstances have altered so that they have now been obliged to adopt this procedure, even though their leader stated only twelve months ago that wars were not fought with money. Honourable members who are now supporting the Government have changed their minds on many occasions since the outbreak of war. I do not wish to discuss tliese changes at any great length, but we have to recognize that there are serious problems ahead of us. I believe that it will only be by the combined efforts apply generally to both private and of honourable gentlemen on both sides of the House that these problems will be solved. The Government, wrongly, I think, has decided to take a certain course and it must accept the responsibility for its decision. I know that Mr Archie Cameron. many people will say that we should not argue about these things at present, as we know that serious times are ahead of us, but, in my opinion, sooner or later, the fact will inevitably be brought home to the people of Australia that on too many instances the taking of the steps necessary for the winning of this war have been left to honourable gentlemen with a very inadequate conception of how wars should be fought and won. There will have to be a stocktaking in this country, and the reckoning will have to be faced with courage. This is one of the occaheld executive authority in Australia during the war-m y own term of office was not very long-and who, as members of previous governments, know something of the problems that have to be faced, should be called upon for help. The previous Government was never given an ounce of help, or a farthing's worth of assistance by some honourable members. Its efforts were hindered, hampered, and pushed aside on a number of occasions. Sometimes it was to blame because of its lack of punch. Nevertheless, those conditions did prevail and in the circumstances I think it only fair that that side of the case should be stated. Question resolved in the affirmative.

92,Mr Jolly,"The condition withto the deduction of State income tax and State development tax will apply? also, indeed, a number of private persons, will be greatly embarrassed, particularly this year, by having to meet this heavy impost. The incomes of private individuals and the profits of companies will have been considerably reduced by reason of the fact that they have had to meet heavy income tax assessments. Many of them will not have the means to meet this additional call, and naturally will have to adopt measures to acquire it. I have heard it stated that a limitation has been placed on banking institutions in regard to the allowance of overdrafts for the purpose of making income tax payments. Some persons or companies may have considerable assets, but no funds upon which they may call. How are they to meet their income tax, if their arrangements with respect to bank overdrafts are to be limited? surer) [8.18] -As the result of the policy of the private banks, the Commonwealth Bank has given some indication of what is regarded as proper circumstances in which overdrafts may be granted. I have no information in respect of the particular matter raised by the honourable member, but I shall make inquiries regarding it from the Commonwealth Bank. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. OrderedTliat Mr Chifley and Mr Frost do prepare and bring in a hill to carry out the foregoing complete overhaul of the position is nowresolution. read a first time. That the bill be now read a second time. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) will find, as he examines this measure, that it is in the nature of a mathematical illusion. Under the company tax, as it is constituted to-day, company profits are dealt with in three ways. The first part of the profit goes in the payment of company flat rate tax, the second part in payment of dividends, and the third part is what is called the undistributed profit. In. 1940, this Parliament adopted the principle of taxing dividends in the hands of the shareholders, without allowing a rebate of the tax that had been paid by the company. Consequently, the position now is that the first part of the company's profit is absorbed by taxation, the shareholder pays tax on the dividend that he receives, without rebate from the company, and the company pays on the undistributed profit. Under these conditions, when the Government increases from 3s. to 4s. the flat rate of tax on the company, it increases the amount absorbed by flat rate taxation and reduces the amount that can be collected from dividends or undistributed profits. If the Treasurer asks his officers to investigate the matter, he will be satisfied that this measure will not produce the additional revenue of (Macquarie-Trea £4,500,000 which he anticipates. I agree, however, that the application of the Is. in the £1 as a flat tax immediately will mean its collection before June, 1942. Were the tax levied on the dividend in the hands of the shareholder, it might be collected a year later, because the personal assessment of the shareholder -would not go out for some months. Were the company to pay on the undistributed profits, in all probability it would still be paid before June, 1942. I make this observation in furtherance of what I said on an earlier measure this afternoon, namely, that the combined effect of all of the amendments made to the taxation laws during the last year has been to bring them almost to a ridiculous stage, and that therefore the case for a stronger than it has ever been previously.

101,"Bill 'Brought Up By Mr Chifley, And","[8.25] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. Honourable members have already been advised of tbe purpose of this measure, and have also been given a broad statement of its provisions. In general outline, persons in receipt of an annual income of over £156 ,are now being called upon to make a special contribution to aid the country in the prosecution of the war effort. The nature of the tax is denoted by the title to the principal part of the bill, that is, "" war tax "". The tax will responsibilities of a taxpayer by .the be levied upon all persons, other than companies, resident and non-resident, who derive a war tax income, and the ordinary machinery of the Income Tax Assessment Act will be used for the purposes of the assessment and collection of the tax. Whilst no liability will rest upon a person whose income does not exceed £156, the tax is to be levied upon the total income when it exceeds £156. To meet cases in which the income is slightly in excess of £156, there is a saving provision in the taxing act which ensures that the tax will be not greater than one-half of the income in excess of £156. The liability for war tax is to be based upon the same amount of assessable income as for ordinary income tax purposes. Income which is assessable for income tax is to be liable to war tax, and income which is exempt from income tax is likewise to be exempt from war tax. At this point, the basis of the war tax differs from the ordinary income tax in that deductions of a concessional nature which are allowed for income tax purposes are to be excluded from the calculation for war tax purposes. The general conception of the measure is that the war tax should be levied on the income of a taxpayer actually available to him for his expenditure. The deductions to he excluded are State income tax, rates and taxes on nonincome-producing property, subscriptions to trade associations and trade unions, charitable gifts, election expenses of members of Parliament, expenditure of a capital nature allowed to primary producers on wire netting, and other improvements to pastoral properties. Other deductions which it is proposed not to allow are those for wife, children under sixteen, mother, medical and funeral expenses, life insurance premiums, contributions to pensions funds, losses of prior years, and the statutory exemption. A deduction will, however, be allowed in respect of the Commonwealth income tax payable on the income on which the war tax is levied. In providing for this deduction, the Government has taken the view that Commonwealth income tax absorbs so muoh of the income of tbe individual to-day that the liability for the war tax should be determined only after allowance had been made for the Commonwealth tax payable on that income. The bill recognizes the domestic allowance of concessions in respect of dependants. These concessions will take the form of an annual rebate of tax of £2 12s. for each dependant, irrespective of the amount of the taxpayer's' income. The dependants in respect of whom the rebate will be allowed are wife, dependent mother, and all dependent children under the age of sixteen .years. One-half only of these rebates will he allowable in the present financial year, as the tax will he in operation for only six months of this year. Ear this reason, also, the rates of tax to be applied in the current year are only one-half of those specified for a full year. A provision has been included in the bill which will have the effect of exempting from both ordinary income tax and the special war tax the dependants' allowances paid by the Commonwealth in respect of the wife, children and other dependants of members of the fighting forces. These allowances are not received hy the members of the forces, and it is inappropriate that they should be taxed as his income. The hill also contains a concession to members of the forces by limiting liability to war tax to those of the personnel of the forces whose war tax income exceeds £200. I commend the bill to honourable members. House should take note that this bill introduces a new principle in respect of State income tax and State development tax, in that those taxes are no longer an allowable deduction, whereas federal income tax is. I am at a loss to know why the Treasurer has done this The disallowance of this deduction will seriously affect those on higher incomes, and will place some taxpayers in an embarrassing position.",46,Income Tax Assessment Bil L

103,Mr Jolly,"(Lilley) [8.30] -Th esupport the remarks of the honourable member for Lilley( MrJ o l l y ). A taxpayer is entitled to the same consideration in respect of tax paid to a State as in respect of tax paid to the Commonwealth. In neither case is the money expended for the benefit of himself or his f a m i l y; it becomes a part of the revenue of the Government. Tax paid to a State should be an allowable deduction, just as is tax paid to the Commonwealth. I regard the Treasurer's proposal as an interference with State rights. surer) [8.34] -in reply-My personal view is that no deduction should he allowed in respect of tax paid to a State. It is recognized, however, that Commonwealth income tax on the higher incomes is a very severe impost. income tax imposed in some of the States. true of all of the States. The Government was influenced by the fact that Commonwealth taxation on the higher incomes is very solid, and it believed that some concession was justified. Werei t not for that I , personally, would have advocated that no deductions should be allowed at all, though in saying this I am not speaking on behalf of the Government. This tax is designed for a specific purpose, namely, the financing of the war. The responsibility for financing the war rests on the Commonwealth Government. It is true that the burden is borne hy the people, but the Commonwealth Government, is their agent. Whetheri t be for air-raid precautions, or for anything else connected with the war, everybody holds out his hand to the Commonwealth Govern in en t -Seeing that the usual memorandum State taxation constitute a very big obstacle. Mir. SPENDKH -Why not State Governments? people, as a result of this war. will recognize the importance of.the role of the Commonwealth Government in providing for defence of the country, and in organizing the nation for war purposes. In many respects, the State Governments are a hindrance rather than a help. I do not say that in a spirit of captious criticism, because some of the State Premiers have shown a keen desire to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government, but the State parliaments are imbued with a spirit which makes their members constantly afraid that the Commonwealth Government is trying to steal away their prestige and their privileges. Question resolved in the affirmative. B ill read a second time. In committee: Clauses1 to 4 agreed to. Clause5 (War tax). This measure provides that a rebate shall be allowed in respect of a spouse or female relative having care of the taxpayer's children under sixteen years of age if the spouse or relative is wholly maintained by the taxpayer, and if the income of the spouse or relative does not exceed £50. However, if the Yes , but it is not taxpayer's mother is wholly maintained by him, rebate is allowed irrespective of the income earned by the mother. Why is this distinction made? Again, why has the amount been fixed at £50, when the Government itself has indicated that, it proposes to increase the amount, to £63 in respect of old-age pensioners? Further, does the rebate apply only in the case of the taxpayer's mother, and not in the case of the taxpayer's father ? receipt, of some income which properly ought not to be taken into account. to allow the rebate in one case, and to refuse it in another. has not been circulated setting for th the differences between the act as it now stands, and as it is proposed to be amended, will the Minister repeat what T h a t , is true. he said in his second-reading speech reabolish the garding deductions which will not be allowable for war tax purposes, but are I hope that the normally allowed for income tax purposes? surer) |.8.40] -The deductions to be excluded are State income tax, rates and taxes on non-income producing property, subscriptions to trade associations and",47,Second Reading

124,Motio N (By Mr Curtin ) Proposed,"for Munitions) [9.31] -On the 27th November, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) asked for an inquiry "" as to whether Defence Job No. P.240 at Australian Consolidated In dustries Limited, at Waterloo, Sydney, concerning the making of a rotary swaging machine to be used in manufacturing shells, held up on Thursday of last week because a blacksmith was too busy making fittings for horse-boxes to take Reading and other racehorses to America."" I now inform the honourable member that the swaging machine was uot being made in an annexe, but in the workshop of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited at Alexandria. It was being made by Australian Consolidated Industries Limited for the use of Plumb's Limited to swage short ends of bars used for fuze stampings which otherwise would have been wasted. Australian Consolidated Industries Limited finished their part of the swaging machine three weeks ago, but it is not yet in use, because its completion is held up pending delivery of a steel ring ordered on the 8th October from Courtney and Bohlsom. There is only about fifteen minutes' blacksmithing work in the whole job. At no time has Plumb's Limited failed to supply all annexe requirements of fuze stamping. It is added that the horse boxes referred to were completed six weeks ago. Repeated appeals have been made by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and other Commonwealth Ministers for increased output of coal in Australia, and to that end the Menzies Government appointed a coal commission to supervise the acceleration of production, transport, distribution sixteen hours a week. Tannymorel and and allocation of coal to tbe various war industries. The regulations have been amended by the present Government, hut so far as Queensland is concerned that commission has proved utterly useless. The Queensland coal mines could increase their output by thousands of tons of coal a week, but at present the men in most of the mines are working only part time. Other mines are closed down for lack of orders. Nothing has yet been done to increase the output of the mines that are in production and to re-open those which are closed [43] down. The coal-owners of Queensland are not only willing but also anxious to mine more coal so that Australia's war effort shall be improved. The industry is asking the Government to ensure that a market is provided for the coal they can produce. Queensland is divided into three coal-mining areas. In the north, from Mount Mulligan to the Collinsville district, the industry is able to supply the trade in that area, and the miners are working full time. The central district extends from the Styx to the Blair Athol district. The Styx mine, which is owned by the Queensland Government, is operated for the f u l l five days a week. In the central district, the Cambria mines are working fairly regularly. The Windsor mine has not been operated since the 24th October last, and is wanting orders. The Blair Athol mines have been working intermittently. The Burrum, Howard and Torbanlea district mines are practically closed down until after the holidays, owing to lack of trade. Previously they were working only intermittently. In the West Moreton district, which is the largest district in Queensland, the mines are working only intermittently, and have been operated on that basis since they supplied from three to four months' stocks to all the big Queensland industries, including the railways, the gas companies, the Brisbane Electric Light Company, and the Brisbane City Council. .Some of the large mines have already closed down for the Christmas holidays, and it is not known when they are likely to resume operations. The Darling Downs mines, on the OakeyCooyar line, work only about twelve to Injune work on an average four days a week. In view of the fact that the southern States are crying out for coal-apparentl y they will use only Maitland coal-the Coal Commission, which was appointed to control the industry, should not allow the position to be controlled by the consumers, but should decide what coal they may and may not use. On several occasions, the circumstances of the industry in Queensland have been brought to the notice of Mr Mighell, the chairman of the Coal Commission, and, although he has been",49,Supplies Kerosene
125,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh,Minister,50,Supplies Kerosene
126,Mr Francis (Moreton) [9.33],"sympathetic, he has always stated that the proposals of the Queensland industry could not be considered on account of the cost of production, freights, and shipping difficulties. He has said that any method of bringing coal from Queensland to the southern States, other than by sea transport, would be too costly, and that the claims of the Queensland industry could not be considered. Recently, the industry received a telegram from the Prime Minister( Mr ment was four and a half hours late on Curtin) asking it to produce more coal, as the various industries needed an increased supply of coal. It is clear that the Prime Minister has not been apprised of the position in Queensland, where both the mine-owners and the miners are anxious to do their best to produce coal. Up to the present time, not one ounce of Queensland coal has been taken to the southern States. All of the mines of southern Queensland, from which 60 per cent, of the coal of the State is procoal needed in northern New South duced, are working only intermittently. At the New Chum colliery, 110 men have been working only two days a week. The mine has been closed down since the 5th December, and the men are still idle. The mines in southern Queensland could produce 3,000 tons, or more, of coal a week. As the mines are idle, the employees, particularly those who have no family obligations, would be quite prepared to go south in order to assist in the production of coal. The Coal Commissioner should organize this. As I have already said, the mines in the Howard district, because of lack of orders, are closed down over the Christmas holidays, and for an indefinite period thereafter. The industry has asked the Coal Commission to allow Queensland to supply all railway trade from West Maitland to South Brisbane and from West Maitland to Wallangarra. New South Wales railway officials have told the commission that they will not use Queensland coal. Honourable members are aware that the Kyogle-South Brisbane railway is one towards the cost of which the Commonwealth pays substantial sums annually. Queensland and New South Wales have met their share of the cost of this railway. regard of Queensland's interests should The Commonwealtli has had to meet not only its own share but also that of all of the other States which would not, for the time being, stand up to their own obligations. Accordingly, the Commonwealth should see that Queensland coal is used on this railway. suitable for railway purposes? coal used on the Queensland railways. In my State, the trains are run to time, but the train on which I travelled through New South Wales in order to attend the present sittings of this Parliaits arrival in Sydney. The Prime Minister, or the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Beasley), should not hesitate to declare that the coal produced in Australia shall be distributed where it is required, since it is essential to the war industries. The coal mines in and around Sydney should supply the coal required in southern New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, whilst Queensland should be permitted to provide the Wales. The coal supplies of Australia should be properly organized, and the work of organization should be carried out by the Coal Commission, yet not an ounce of coal from Queensland is used in connection with the war effort. As thousands of coal miners are working only part time during the present national crisis, it is clear that the coal resources of Australia, particularly those of Queensland, have not been utilized as they should be. I appeal to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Supply and Development to see that the coal resources of Queensland are properly utilized, particularly as the mine owners and the miners are anxious to render the best possible service to the nation. The Coal Commission should be called upon to say why it has not organized the industry so that coal supplies for northern New South Wales are obtained from Queensland. The standard gauge railway from Kyogle to South Brisbane has been showing a considerable loss, and, as the Commonwealth is responsible for a considerable part of the financial outlay incurred in its construction, it should have a voice as to whether the utter disbe continued. In the interests of the war industries and of the mine owners and miners in Queensland, I appeal to the Government to call upon the Coal Com-",50,Supplies Kerosene

It is the onlymission, to investigate this matter immediately, so that an all-in war effort may be obtained by the proper development of the coal resources of Queensland. wish to refer to a matter which, although it may appear to be of slight importance at this time, is of great concern to the people whom it affects. Altliough special badges are provided for wives and mothers of members of the Australian Imperial Force, Tasmanian women have for some time had difficulty in obtaining them. Some of them have had to wait for months after making application, and others have not received badges yet. I know of a mother whose two sons joined the Australian Imperial Force; one of them was killed. So far, she has been unable to obtain a relative's badge. The badges are not expensive, but the wives and mothers of soldiers place a high value on them. The unfortunate ones see other women wearing badges, and, naturally, tbey desire the same privileges. Distinctive badges should also be provided for men who have offered themselves for service with our armed forces but have been rejected on account of physical defects. Unless such men are provided with a distinctive badge, they will have the "" bone"" pointed at them by perhaps well-intentioned but misguided people. It may be said that they can produce rejection cards, but these cannot be worn like a badge. I have already communicated with the Minister for the Army on this subject, and I hope that he will heed my representations.

The restriction came into force only last week, and there was a great deal of confusion. Some business establishments remained open, and others were closed. The discontinuance of the late shopping night will make a big difference to the lives of country people, for whom it has become a sort of social institution, as the Minister for 'Commerce( Mr Scully) must be aware. It provides an opportunity for town people and farmers to meet, and business houses benefit from it. I shall support any measure that is in the interests of national security, but I cannot see any wisdom in preventing night shopping in small country towns which are miles away from any place where there is likely to be a raid. The restrictions will cause economic and social stagnation. Already our rural districts are hearing the full brunt of the war. Scores of thousands of country men have enlisted and 'there has been a general migration of workers to the munitions industries in the cities. There are empty business premises in almost every country town. This new restriction will drive another nail into the coffins of these districts. I should agree to the enforcement of this regulation if the Prime Minister or any body else could prove to me that it was necessary. It has been said that the restriction will effect a saving of coal as the result of the decreased use of light and power. But the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) has just pointed out that not one ton of coal saved by this means in Queensland and northern New South Wales would be diverted to the war effort.

Before the Prime Minister agrees to the total elimination of the late shopping night in country towns I ask him to satisfy himself that some good purpose will be achieved thereby. 1 ask the Government to give special consideration to the position which has arisen in connection with life assurance policies recently taken out by members of the Australian Imperial Force. I have here a letter from a young man who, with others, took out a group life assurance policy at his place of employment. The policy contains a provision that should he die as result of service outside Australia and New Zealand, or within six months after the termination of that service, whether his death be the direct or the indirect result of that service, all that will be paid to him will be the amount of his premiums together with compound interest at 3£ per cent, per annum. It is further stipulated that should he enlist for service overseas he will be fully covered if he pays a premium of which the company approves. The society in question states that the premium in respect of persons who have enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force shall be an advance of 150 per cent.; that is to say, the premium will be two and a half times as much as the present premium. This is a matter to which the Government to mention the name of the life assurance company, as other companies may have similar provisions. I shall send the letter to the Prime Minister in the hope that the Government will give a ruling in regard to such cases. port the remarks of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) with regard to the abolition of the late shopping night in country towns. I was prompted to ask a question of the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) to-day in connection with a proclamation which I understood was to be issued. Although special precautions may be necessary in towns near to the coast, the position in inland towns, particularly in agricultural areas, is different. Especially at this time of the year considerable hardship and inconvenience may be caused to people in country districts if they are not permitted to purchase their week's provisions on Saturdays between the hours of, say, 6 o'clock and 8.30 in the evening. Many of these people work the whole of the Saturday morning, and sometimes into the afternoon, and by the time they return to their homes and are ready to go into the town, it is sometimes too late for them to finish their shopping before six o'clock. Most workers in the country work late in the summer in order to harvest as much of their crops as possible. ping night in Queensland.

Prime Minister. why the Commonwealth Government, in exercise of its national security powers, should abolish the late shopping night. that Queensland has abolished the late shopping night, but I am concerned with any interference with the general course of business in country towns, and with the usual and customary freedom of people to purchase their goods on. Saturday evenings. I hope that consideration will be given to this matter, so that people in the country districts of New South Wales particularly, who are feeling the effects of business stagnation because of the exodus of people from the country to the city and the call-up of men for military service, may not suffer unnecessary hardship. At the request of members of the Canberra branch of the Australian Labour party I bring to the notice of the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior the action of his department in transferring a man named Evans from one position to another in the territory, thereby causing him a loss of 9s. a week, and replacing him with a person of foreign birth,Who is now a naturalized British subject. It is felt by the persons concerned that during recent months there has been some discrimination against Australians in the Australian Capital Territory. Their views on this subject were expressed by Mr A. E. Gardiner at a recent meeting of the Advisory Council of the Australian Capital Territory. Mr Gardiner brought before the 'Council particulars of a contract for the felling of pines at Mount Stromlo, which was given to a naturalized British subject in preference to an Australian. The discussion in the Advisory Council showed that the difference in the amount involved was only Id. a tree. Mr was engaged on this job. His signed Gardiner alleged that the department had an anti-Australian bias. I bring these matters forward at the request of people who feel strongly and who are entitled 1441 to have their views placed before the Government, and I ask the Minister to investigate them. no desire to add to the difficulties of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) in connection with Friday night and Saturday morning shopping. I know that the hon7 orable gentleman has sound reasons for the action that he has taken. One of these, I understand, is the desire to give people some appreciation of the need for self-denial in these perilous times. I agree with that objective. In Hobart, however, we have no Saturday morning shopping, and now we shall have no shopping at night. All of our shopping is done in a five-day week. The decision, in this regard, cannot be varied by the Commonwealth Government. An alteration of the State law would be required to permit shops to open on Saturday morning. The Labour Government, which has just fought an election campaign on this issue and others, holds the view tliat Saturday morning shopping should not be permitted. Another difficulty arises in this connection. In most of the mainland States hotels close at 6 p.m., but in Tasmania they remain open until 10 p.m., and with this I agree. It looks, therefore, as if people are to be forced out of the shops into hotels. In all the circumstances I ask the Prime Minister to give some further consideration to the desirability of treating this subject on the reasonable basis that. I suggested this afternoon. this opportunity to refer to several matters that I brought under the notice of the previous Government. I do not hold this Government responsible nor, for that matter, do I particularly blame the previous Government for what has happened. I hope, however, that the subjects to which I refer will be given close attention by the present Prime Minister( Mr Curtin). The first matter relates to the production in a certain factory of Bren gun parts. The facts in this connection have been given to me by a skilled worker who statement on the subject reads as follows:Part of tripod of Bren gun: When this particular piece is out of gauge it must throw",53,Supplies Kerosene

Prime Minister to give consideration to the needs of those who live in the outback of Western Australia., where, as the honourable gentleman knows, the danger of an air raid is remote I draw the attention of the Government to the need for taking suitable action to marshal available labour and direct it to those points where it is most needed at present. I refer particularly to the shortage of labour for the harvesting of wheat and fruit crops and other crops of a perishable nature. In the past, there has been a lamentable lack of organization of this kind despite the fact that there is still a large number of registered and unregistered unemployed in certain areas. Many of the unemployed are not able to afford to pay rail fares to the places where they are needed and as a consequence, there is a very grave shortage of labour for harvesting purposes, particularly in the grape and dried fruits industries. This is an important matter to the growers because these crops must be harvested quickly at the right time. Appeals have been made to me to do what I can to have all available labour utilized to the best advantage. It would be helpful if a conference of Commonwealth and State authorities were held with the object of arriving at an agreement under which fares may be advanced to approved unemployed appliI am glad to have cants to travel from their homes to those places where work is available. If the crops of these commodities are garnered they will provide for our internal requirements and for the supply of our troops overseas and, at the same time, will enable us to build up reserves of foodstuffs. I propose now to refer to the conservation and production of oil in Australia. I do not need to stress the fact that we do not know how long we can carry .on with the supplies that are available The withdrawal of and those that we can get from outside sources. It has been brought home to us to-day that we should have taken more active and positive steps in the past to develop industries for the extraction of crude and fuel oils, and petrol and power alcohol from the products which we have in abundance in Australia. Some steps have been taken for the development of oil shale deposits, but a considerable source of supply is still untapped in the brown coal deposits that are to be found in many parts of Australia, particularly in Victoria, where it is said there is an almost unlimited quantity, which would last for perhaps hundreds of years. A few years ago, officials representing the Government of Victoria made investigations in Germany and discovered that petrol and other classes of oil of various' degrees of crudity could be produced from brown coal. Germany was, in fact, supplying at that time 50 per cent, of its normal requirements from this source. The recommendation was made that steps should be taken to give to Australia a degree of independence of imported supplies, but so far as I know nothing sul>stantial has been done to that end. Even now, the Government would be wise if it were to set in operation some degree of development of these resources. The processes are well known, to experts. At one stage, it was stated that for quite a reasonable outlay on plant and machinery, some of which would have to be imported, refined petrol could be produced at a cost of Is. a gallon. I suggest that, experts in the Department of Supply and Development should confer with the Victorian officers who have gone into tlie matter, and with the Premier of that State, who still has in his possession much data concerning the investigations that were made.",56,Supplies Kerosene

Morgan) and tbe honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) mentioned certain matters in relation to the Department of the Army, the Department of Munitions and the Department of the Interior. They cited specific cases, and T shall be glad to look into them. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) and the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) referred to the position of the primary producers, and mentioned articles that are in short supply. I can only repeat what I have said before, namely, that the Government is wholly conscious of the importance of the primary industries. We know that they are suffering because of our inability to get our products to the consuming countries. Where possible, certain adjustments are being made. As for the moratorium, honourable members will realize that that is a matter of major dimensions, but the views which they have expressed will be considered very carefully. We have had to stop the practice of mixing kerosene with petrol, a practice which developed because of the restrictions imposed upon the use of petrol. Every gallon of kerosene imported necessarily took the place of a gallon of petrol, because both are brought to this country in the same sort of containers. We have had to stop the use of kerosene a.= a blend with petrol in order to conable for the harvesting of essential crops ? Army( Mr Forde) gave a general reply this afternoon regarding the effect on industry of the calling up of men for military service, and I refer those honourable members, who spoke on the subject to-night to the Minister's remarks. I thank all honourable members, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, for the assistance given to the Government in the work of Parliament yesterday and to-day. I do not feel in the mood to repeat the felicitations expressed prematurely a fortnight ago, but I do hope and pray that Christmas will he as good as we can make it ; certainly, that it will not be so bad as our enemies seek to make it. 1 trust that, whatever the future, we shall face it with unstinted industry, undaunted Leader of the Opposition) -by leave I endorse the sentiments which the Prime Minister has just expressed. Like him, I hope that, before Parliament is called together again, the dark clouds of war will have passed away, and that commous'ense, understanding, and national goodwill will prevail. I hope that we shall continue to enjoy the privilege of free and constitutional government, and that we shall retain the freedom which is symbolized by the Union Jack. I join with the Prime Minister in wishing to yourself, Mr Speaker, and to the staff of the Parliament, the compliments of the season, and I trust that our Christmas will be as merry as the circumstances permit.
