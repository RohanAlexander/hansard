Argus, in the monetary and commercial column, it is stated that an arrangement has been made by the Government in reference â€žto -the seigniorage on silver coined in London for use in Australia. I ask the Prime Ministeri f that statement is Correct, and, if so, will he inform the House what arrangement has been made? It is also stated that the depreciation in the gold coinage minted in Australia will . have to be provided for ""by the Commonwealth. Does that statement refer to the gold coinage in circulation ;in Australia only, or to all the gold coined in Australia ? subject to which the honourable member's question refers, but, as the question is a very important one, I ask him to give notice of it, so that I may make a more satisfactory statement than I could make offhand. I should like to remark that I have never known a House in which so many questions are asked without notice. It is scarcely fair to Ministers to expect replies offhand to questions which involve, at times, very careful consideration. It would be much more convenient to the Government, and, I think, more satisfactory to members asking questions, if , as far as possible, notice were given. there are occasions when the question is one of great urgency; I do not allude to questions of that kind. My remarks apply to questions in obtaining an lanswer to which the loss of a day is not of the slightest consequence.

MrM c LEAN I regret that I overlooked the promise which I made to the honourable member, but I can tell him how the matter stands, and I shall be very glad to lay the papers upon the table. I had a communication from Mr Sandford, pointing out that he was entitled to interest at' 5 per cent on the money refunded, which was held by the Department for over three vears. That claim was'allowed, interest at that rate having been paid in similar cases.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not know that I need give an explanation now, but there is a history attached to this matter.

It was a concern of a Government of which the honourable member was a Minister. I have information on the Sir WILLIAM LYNE The matter has been before two or three Governments.

It seems to me that it is proposed to create very ponderous machinery for the control of a very small number of men. The Minister will probably tell us, as he has already told me privately, that it will be convenient to permit the Inspector General to travel over the various States in order to see that defence matters are put in proper order whilst the Minister is sitting in Melbourne, and requires his frequent advice. The same result might be brought about, however, if the Inspector-General remained at Head-Quarters, and sent his principal staff officer to perform the work of inspection.

Then, I ask, why should the Naval Commandant be appointed to the Naval Board, while the In spector-General is not appointed to ; the Military Board? the constitution of two boards, and it seems to me that if the Naval Commandant is to be appointed to one body, the Inspector-General should occupy a seat upon the other. In my opinion, the principle which should be laid down in connection with our Military Forces is that of direct responsibility to the Minister, and through him, to this House. I feel that the BillA n d , to that is a step in the wrong direction. The right honourable member for Swan has pointed : out that the Minister of Defence has given no reason for his change of opinion. I do not think gave reasons previously. gave no valid reason for his change of views'opinion. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I should like to know whether the Cabinet have discussed the question of who is to be appointed Inspector-General? I notice that Brigadier General Finn has been temporarily appointed General Officer Commanding the Commonwealth Forces. I interpret that fact .to mean that he will subsequently be called upon to fill the office of Inspector General. I understand that an officer has been temporarily appointed State ComNo provision is mandant of New South Wales? no secret that the Government propose to If the honourable member offer the position of Inspector-General to Brigadier-General Finn. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am very glad to hear that. It seems to me that he should I have not seen be offered the position; but I think that the Government would be acting more wisely if they appointed him General Officer Commanding. If they did so, I am convinced that there would be very little I s there in the principal friction between the military and tbe civil side of the Defence Department during the I do not tfiink next three years, and that there would be no occasion whatever to pass a Bill of this character. In my judgment, the measure is a retrograde movement, and is a piece of legislation which may require to be repealed in three or four years' time. congratulate the Minister upon the action In my which he has taken.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -When the right honourable member for Swan, as Minister of Defence, introduced the first Defence Bill to the House, I made the suggestion that it should embody the principle of a Council of Defence somewhat analogous to that which existed in the Defence Act of Victoria. I believe that I was the first to make that suggestion in the House, and I remember that it received but scant support. The honourable and learned member for Corio was the only member who supported the proposition. providing for a Council of Defence. Sir JO HN QUICK -But that was in the second session of the Parliament. I cannot help contrasting the indifference with which my proposal was received thus early in the history of the Federation with the very strong support which is now being given to the principle. experience of a centralized administration.

It is a change in harmony with the principle which has existed in the Victorian Act, and which I understand worked well. received the hearty support of the Victorian Military Defence authorities, and the late Lieut -Col. Sargood was one of its strongest advocates. several conversations with him upon the subject, and from him I received strong inspiration in favour of a Council of Defence being provided for in the first DefenceB ill . this the opinion of the House is dueas the honourable member for Laanecoorie has somewhat delicately hinted-to the very extraordinary military administration under which Australia suffered while our forces were under the command of the military officer who has just left our shores. Of absent men. perhaps the least said the better, but I can ascribe the great change which has occurred in the opinions of honourable members only to the manner in which our military laws were administered strongly and heartily approve of the main outlines of the scheme which has ter.

I would not, for one moment, suggest that it should be abrogated. The only criticism which I have to offer on the whole I had the honour of scheme is directed not to the essence of the Military Board, but merely to its composition. The Board should undoubtedly be composed of the most prominent military officers available, and, that being so, I I have no doubt that cannot understand why so important an change in the sentiment and officer as the Inspector-General should be excluded from its deliberations. the Council. vised, I think it would be a great mistake to provide that the Board shall merely be advisory to the Minister. I wish to know why the Inspector-General is to be excluded from it? Prima facie he is to be a military officer.

57,Sir John Quick,"As at present adI f we have so important an officer occupying this position, why should he be excluded from the Military Board? Even assuming that it is not to have supreme power-that it is to be only a board of advice-wh y should he not have a right to take part in its deliberations ? He might be brought into military contact with the board, and his advice and his information might be accepted and rendered available. It is said that because the In spector-General, in England is excluded from, the Military Board, the same course should be followed in Australia. There is a great difference between the positions and the functions of the two boards. In England there may be an abundance of military talent apart from the Inspectorpeneral to advise the Board, but here there is a limit to it. On this point I wish to read an extract from a letter which has been received in Australia from a very distinguished officer, who was immediately associated with the Imperial scheme, and whose identity may be conjectured by honourable members. I should like to lay great Stress upon the following passage, which although it is merely an expression of opinion, is worthy of special attention: If you have a good Inspector-General, you rather require his presence and advice upon the Board. On the pther hand, he ought to be constantly away from head-quarters if he is to do his work properly. Later on, in the same letter, this officer writesI do not think your Inspector-General can be outside the Board, which will need his administrative experience, but within his assigned domain he could exercise executive authority. I would suggest that the matter of the appointment of the Inspector-General a member of the Board should be reconsidered. My own opinion is that his inclusion would be a decided advantage. Certainly, if the Naval Director is to be a member of the Naval Board, If a i l to see on what principle of justice, fairness, or logic, the Inspector-General can be excluded from the Military Board. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney). -The honourable member for Hume has shown that for once he is in accord with the right honourable member for Swan, and I also am surprised to find myself for once holding views in harmony with those of the honourable member. I condemn the proposal to hand over the control of the Department to a Council of Defence. I have previously expressed the opinion that Parliament should retain control, through its responsible Minister, of the Department, as affording the best check against the very evil which those who support the Bil l think it will prevent. I see no reason why we should place the administration of our defence system in the hands of a Council any more than we should hand over the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department to a like body. ' It may be argued that we may have Ministers of Defence who are not familiar with the work which the administration of the Defence Act involves; but it might also be said that, from time to time, we shall have Postmasters-General who could not be expected to be acquainted with all the details of the Postal Department. No one can say that the present Postmaster-General is a first-class electrician, and his knowledge of many other branches of his Department may also be deficient. But the honourable gentleman, and those who have preceded him, have succeeded in administering the Department, with its immense expenditure and its army of retainers, without any special knowledge. They have had to -rely on their ordinary business ability, and to avail themselves of the advice of their responsible officers. We certainly ought to retain control, through the Minister, of the Defence Department. I admit with sorrow the statement made by the honourable member for Laanecoorie, that our first experience of the system of having a General Officer Commanding was not satisfactory. But this was not because of any particular fault on the part of the gentleman who occupied that position. He is a renowned soldier of very great ability, but, as has been pointed out, he was lamentably out of touch with Australian sentiment. I have been surprised at the silence which has been maintained by honourable members regarding the great want of sympathy which the late General Officer Commanding displayed with Australian sentiment in the matter of defence; but I do not think we should rid ourselves of the difficulty by adopting the proposal made in this Bill. To my mind, the new presbyter would be old priest writ large. With a Council of Defence we shall have to contend with greater difficulties than we have had, or would be likely to have again, with a General Officer Commanding. Whatever the Minister may say, such a Council would be, to a very great extent, a barrier between, if not him, at least some of his successors, and the Parliament. When honourable members complained of certain acts of adDefence Department.

The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has pointed for twelve years, and he knew the feelings of out that the Inspector-General is not to be Australian troops better than any man in the Ema member of the Council. Mr G. B. EDWARDS derstand that. The mistake emphasizes my complaint that the Minister has not put his case before us with sufficient clearness. TheB ill itself should expressly state how many and what military and naval officers are to be members of the boards and councilj and how many civil members there are to be. The measure is wanting in many details, and the Minister has not made up for its shortcomings by a statement sufficiently f u l l to enable us to thoroughly understand it. Honourable members who support the measure have argued in favour of what they term the civil control of our defence system. I do not think we can obtain civil control more perfectly than by having a General Officer Commanding, subject to such limitations as we may see fit to impose, and a Ministerial head responsible to this House for the policy adopted, and the manner of administration. I regard the introduction of the Bill as a retrograde step, because I think that it will to some extent lessen the civil control of our defence system, and the responsibility to Parliament of those intrusted with the administration of the with the machinery provided in this B ill . other night, such as those relating to the The charge position of the Inspector-General, which I have, howtoo hastily in this matter.

He has, however, recognised the sentiment to which I have referred, which culminated in friction between him and the Minister. It seems to me that we might very well experiment with the present system a little longer under the new General Officer Commanding whom the Minister has in his mind, because I believe that Brigadier General Finn is likely to get on well with the Australian troops, and before his term of office expires, we may have been able to adopt the system suggested by the Minister, of sending men to be trained where there are the best opportunities' f 01 acquiring knowledge.

If we are to hold our own, defence must belife as it is that of the Swiss, and in the same as far as general training is concerned.

The present electoral divisions can form the electorate in the battery or regiments of riflemen ..of his electorate. The polling booths to form mustering stations, and the entire nation could be called out in one day by keeping a proper system of records and a skeleton army in time of peace. Each electorate must have a rifle range up to the f u l l extent of the modern rifle, 3,200 yards, and not one fitted for the Brown Bess, tp keep the boys, now men, in practice. Five or six establishments of a Field Battery can be drilled in turn on the guns of a single battery, and so more than one battery of gunners 'can be trained to supply casualties, although fighting as riflemen. When I was at the battle of Ingogo, in South Africa, the whole of the officers attached to the battery with which I was connected were killed or wounded, and all the -gunners, except myself, were placed hors de combat. Some of the members of the Rifle Brigade were called upon to assist me, but they had no knowledge of big-gun drill, and the consequence was that the whole of the training Of the guns, the sponging, loading, and firing was left in my hands. I had to do the best 1 could, and I did it with effect and saved the whole position. That is why I say that men should be drilled in the use of field-guns, and if not required as artillerymen utilized as riflemen. At the battle of Ulundi, when the men belonging to my battery were not required as artillerymen, Lord Chelmsford mounted them upon the artillery horses, and used them as cavalry in turning the enemy's flank. The memorandum continuesThe Boers in their ordinary clothes were just as invisible as the British in their khaki uniforms. We could follow theirexample, and so save expense, which can be but ill borne; I propose ; J that the outfit be limited to (1) rifle, the best going; (2) a leather bandolier; (3) a water bottle ; (4) a haversack; (5) a pair of leather leggings; (6) a hat ribbon (as in the Navy for each ship) bearing the name of the electorate.

The States are not going to fight against each other. And it is far better for riflemen guarding the coast, or moving rapidly from point to point on the coast, to be transferred in trains. Yet this absurd transformation of Colonel T. Price's Mounted Rifles into Australian Light Horse has cost thousands.

I have always displayed the. utmost courtesy towards the right honourable member not MrM c CAY lecture the right honourable member, I must express my regret, because I had not the slightest intention of doing so. propose to read what I said upon the question of the appointment of a Council of Defence, and I venture to think that when ' I have done so, honourable members will say that wherever I criticised the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, it was because it did not accomplish what the present scheme will accomplish. I saidI hope the honourable member for Melbourne 'Ports will not press his amendment. I think that I may .fairly say that during the course of this debate I have not displayed any great subservience to military authority, or any great advocacy of the absolutism of that authority. I think a Board such as the honourable member suggested, w/iuld be entirely unworkable, in view of the large area of the Commonwealth and its scattered population. There is no parallel between the Council of Defence in England and the Council which it ' is now proposed to constitute. English Council is really a semi-political body, which is intended to harmonize the"" relations between the political and the military administrations upon all important matters of policy. That is what this scheme, does. tinuedOne can understand the desirableness of such a Board, in view of the conflict that has existed between the financial and the executive branches of the administration. The proposal of the honourable member is modelled upon the Council of Defence which existed in Victoria up to the time of the establishment of Federation, and the wording of the new clause is practically the same as that of the section of the Victorian Act. Victorian Council of Defence at times did great service; but, as a matter of fact, every member of that Council for many years past was a resident .of Me.bourne, and it was very easy to call a meeting of that body.

JOHN FORREST -The Minister is --composed of the best available men. I proceededI do not think that reVery often valuable suggestions were offered by the junior members of the Board, which proved of service' to the administration, but during the term of one officer as Commandant, the Council of Defence simply served as a battlefield for the struggle which was waged between lecture' me. the Minister of Defence and the Commandant. If I even appeared to Unfortunately, the Council nevei possessed the power that it purported to exercise, because the Minister on the political, and the Commandant on the administrative side, exercised the real conI now trol. That criticism is not applicable to the measure which is under consideration. It must always be so, unless Che command is put into commission as is the case with the Admiralty. That is exactly what is being done in the present instance. The Admiralty precedent is being followed. I addedI think that the Minister's proposal fairly meets the case. In other words, a Board of Advice was required in addition to a General Officer Commanding. I continuedI am afraid that we have not sufficiently developed our national life to be. able lo tell exactly what form of .boards, and what methods of procedure, it will be best to adopt. In the meantime, I think we may well adopt the suggestion The of the Minister. However strongly we may feel that a Council of Defence is desirable, we are not in a position to say how it would work or the best form which it should take. Personally, I do not see how it could exercise effective control unless all the members composing it were I conestablished at the Seat of Government while they retained their positions upon the Board. I venture to say that in those remarks there is not a single word which does not absolutely confirm the position which I take up to-day.

However, I promise to look into the matter with a view to ascertain if the provision does limit the executive power in any way, and if it does, to provide a remedy. would draw the special attention of the Minister to the necessity for providing that in time of war the Governor General shall have power to appoint an officer to command the whole of tbe Foices.

From time to time the Forces of the different States may be brought together to take part in a review or for military exercise, and I think it would be well to give the Inspector-General the power to command the whole Forces on such occasions. If there were a meeting of troops in Victoria, and troops from Queensland and New South Wales took part in it, there might be some friction as to who was to command. officer would take command. would be better to provide that the Inspector-General when present shall take precedence of the District Commandants and all other officers. observation, and the Government are taking steps to insure the result mentioned by the right honourable member Minister will submit a new clause providing, that, in time of war, the Inspector-General shall command the Forces, and I trust that do not see the neit will also provide that that officer shall different States meet in time of peace. right honourable member has in mind car* be overcome by giving the Inspector-General the necessary rank. That is the regular way. -might not always be effective. It is unwise, I think, to leave everything to regulations. the assurance of the Minister that he will consider the point I have raised; but I apprehend that, in passing this Bill, we should take care to provide for a fairly complete and workable scheme. The Government should not seek to get rid of any point that is raised, merely by saying th-ir the matter will be provided for by an executive act. It does not do to depend too largely upon executive acts, and I am not sure that the suggestion I have made could be carried out in such a manner. By the Constitution the Command-in-Chief of our Forces is vested in the Governor General, and it may be that by executive acts he may delegate his power to any particular officer. But it would require legislation to enable the Governor General to be represented on the field by an officer occupying the position of Commander-in-Chief. The Defence Act, as it stands, provides for the office of General Officer Commanding.

The right honourable member for Swan must have found-as I have found since-that the General Officer Commanding was often away inspecting when he was required 'in reference to matters of administration. The individuals carrying on administrative work must be separated from the individuals carrying on inspecting and executive work, if both classes of duty are to be properly performed. I wish to take f u l l advantage of the knowledge of the Inspector-General by putting him on the Council, and I do not wish him to be prevented from doing his essential work-seein g that the Forces have been properly trained-by keeping him in an office transacting administrative duties. If the Inspector-General were given a position on the board, which is an administrative board, what administrative duties would be assigned to him-becaus e a member of an administrative board without administrative duties would be in an extraordinary position? If he were on the board to control it, he would be in the position of a General Officer Commanding having a Board of Advice, and one of two things would happen; he would dominate the Board, or the Board would dominate him. be there. be made an arbiter between the Board and bis General Officer Commanding. Besides being a member of the State Legislature, I occupied a position in the State forces at the time, and this made me fully cognizant of the fact that under the Victorian system the Minister sometimes had to resolve the battles between the Commandant and the Council, while sometimes the Council had to try to resolve the battles between the Minister and the Commandant, owing to the indistinctness of the lines which divided their duties. The work of inspection is quite enough for a good man, ^vhile others will be told off for the work of administration, and within their own districts the State Commandants will be the: executive officers. The system which we now propose is in force in every country of import ance, and has been satisfactorily carried out in England in regard to fhe Admiralty for two centuries, so that every precedent is in our favour. It cannot be said that British experience in any of the wars of the last century has proved the value of the General Officer Commanding system. spector-General were placed on the Board ex officio, he would either dominate it or be dominated by it, and would, moreover, be reporting to himself. In reporting after an inspection, he would say, "" Soand-so is going wrong,"" and then, as a member of .the Board, would take his own report, and say, "" This must be remedied in the way I suggest, or things will not go on properly,"" so that we should get back to the General Officer Commanding system again. is not on the Board, we shall have officers of lower rank criticising his proposals. does not seem to fully grasp what are the duties of the Board/ and what are the duties of the Inspector-General. The Board is running the machine, so far as administration is concerned, and the Inspector General is no more subordinate to it than is the inspector of machinery under the Mines Act to the engineer in charge of that machinery. The Inspector-General reports to the Boardi f he thinks that anything is going wrong, so that the Board may have an opportunity to put it right. The Minister will be a member both of the Board and of the Council.

He is no more subject to the Board than the Auditor-General of tbe Commonwealth is subject to the Departments whose accounts he audits. The Government may be wrong in the view which they hold in regard to this matter, and the rest of the world may be wrong in having adopted this system ; but it is essential to our proposition that the Inspector-General shall have nothing to do with actual administrative work, which is left to the Board.

We are reverting to the state of things to which the Duke of York, with infinite industry and labour, put an end a hundred years ago. It has to be recognised that the system of controlling the British Army by means of a 'board, is no new experiment. It was being pursued in England about 120 years ago; but the Duke of York, the son of the reigning King, saw tiiat the Army, needed to have the administration of one vigorous mind, and in consequence, the system was changed. Mr Fortescue goes onto sayA Commander-in-Chief, then, there must be; but his title might, with advantage, be changed to that of Captain-General; and he should be the elective head of the military government jof the army, and nothing more. As the senior officer of the army, he should have a seat in the Secretary of State's Council, of which presently; but he should not be the sole military adviser of the Secretary of State. His duties should consist in the maintenance of discipline and instruction, of expending the moneys allotted to him by the Secretary of State for current services of the army; and he should be responsible for keeping the army up to the strength fixed by the Cabinet for the maintenance of its military policy. When the right honourable member for Swan -was criticising the proposed new system the other day, he remarked that the Board proposed to be appointed was on similar lines to the Victorian Board of Railways Commissioners. But' as a matter of practice, there is a supreme head of the Victorian railway system. know the Railways Commissioners Act, will .remember that there are three Commissioners of whom one, Mr Tait, is the superior officer, and the Chairman of the Board. As a matter of fact, Mr Tait really has the governing voice in the direction of affairs. Although he has two colleagues, he is able, under the law, to override their decisions, and if that happens, all that they can do is to enter their protest in writing against what he proposes to do. In a large business concern like a railway system, just as in an autocratic organization like an army, there must be some one ruling and directing mind. That is what our army requires, and what the Victorian Railways have at the present time. This desire to have a board to control our Military Forces, rather than a Commander-in-Chief arisen in consequence of what occurred in South Africa. that war were sufficient to make the English people come to the conclusion that it was necessary to have a change in the method of organization. Mr Crouch. to the system which we see in operation in the Board of Admiralty. They thought that the Board of Admiralty afforded a type which should be followed in connection with the administration of the army. But does the Minister of Defence propose that the members of his board shall be similarly placed?

261,Mr Crouch,"To the extent that amembers are really under the First Lord of the Admiralty. That article contains the following: When, in December, 1868, Mr Gladstone became Prime Minister, Mr Childers, who had in a previous Administration been Junior Civil Lord of the Admiralty, was appointed First Lord It seems to me, therefore, that the First of the Admiralty, and knowing that he could Lord of the Admiralty is the one man renot carry out Mr Gladstone's economies with the sponsible, while the others are allotted only B,oard, in January, J869, procured an Order in certain duties, for the performance of which Council which abolished' the responsibility of the Board, and made the First Lord' solely rethey are answerable to him, and not to the sponsible to the King and Parliament, and the Cabinet directly. It was admitted by the Naval Lords responsible only to the First Lord Minister of Defence, in reply, I believe, for whatever work he allotted to them to carry to the honourable and learned member for out, and this system has been continued to the Bendigo, that there must be a Commanderpresent day. The machinery of the Board was retained, in case the First Lord wished to call in-Chief in time of war, although an effort them together to ask for their advice, which he is being made to divide other duties amongst can take or not as he thinks f it ; but the Board, members of the Board. as a Board, are in no way directly responsible to the King and country. And the anomaly remains that, although they are appointed by Patent was stated by me. as Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral, they are prevented from doing so so particular, I by the Order in Council referred to (January the ""admitted,!"" 14th, 1869). Referring to the War Office, the article proceedsHow the organization I have sketched (purposely, briefly, and without details), would suit the War Office, it is for those who are more conversant with military matters than I am to judge. Personally, I feel sure that a Board on the lines of the present Admiralty, would not answer; the reason the Admiralty is more or less satisfactory at present is not because a civilian is solely responsible for its conduct, but owing to its old traditions, the extreme loyalty that pervades the Navy, and the fact that the procedure is carried on on much the same lines as previous to 1869, when the Board, and not the First Lord, was responsible. If the War Office is to be reorganized on the model of the Admiralty, it must be as the Admiralty was previous to 1869. This and other articles are by experts and tain, and their opinions, deliberately given in the reviews, are worthy of consideration. Sir George T. Lambert contributed to the Nineteenth Century a criticism of Lord Esher's note, which was the basis of the final proposals of the War Office, now followed in the B ill before us. In that article it is statedThe sibility is absolute, and equal deference is required to be paid to all. It has been the custom, however, to give precedence to the Lords Commissioners, according to the order in which their names stand in the Patent, and the first name is invariably that of the Cabinet Minister who is to represent the Cabinet at the Board, and the Board in the Cabinet. thus occupies as the representative of the Lrovernment makes the First Lord facile among his colleagues at the Board, and as, of course, their chairman. Under the Patent he cannot overrule, his colleagues, but, in the event of his differing from them, he has the Cabinet to f a l l back upon, and the decision of the Cabinet is, as in all matters, conclusive. withdraw the word and substitute ""stated."" It seems to be the desire of the Minister, according to the Bill, to divide the duties previously performed by the Commanderin-Chief in time of peace. In his speech the other day, the Minister said his first ideaI do not know whether he intends to give the matter further considerationwas that the Inspector-General should be the Commander-in-Chief in time of war. would be the best man for the position. that the Inspector-General would not be responsible in time of peace for the excutive command, would have nothing to do with the training of troops, and was to be changed every four years.

That is where we see the great defect of the scheme. The Inspector-General is not to be responsible for executive commands, nor for the training of troops and yet he is to take charge of those troops in time of war. That seems to me to be a fatal mistake; .and experience will prove that such a scheme must break down in time of war. inhere in the scheme; those are only exto the right honourable member for Swan, pressions of opinion on the part of the Minhave to take a State command under some ister as to what should be done.

According to the Minister, the man who has to lead the troops in time of war, will have nothing to do with their training.

I want honourable members to see that if the Minister devises any other use for the Inspectorregiment,, the colonel writes to the State General, or any other way of abolishing present proposal will have to be amended, and we shall then arrive at the one man who must be responsible. The scheme of having an Inspector-General who is to be changed every four years, will give rise to an extraordinary position. Throughout the debate there seems to have been a feeling that there is too much centralization in the Military Forces, but personally I think we should have more; and on this point I should like honourable members to listen to one or two figures. This might perhaps be thought a matter more for discussion on the Estimates, but I should like to lay the figures before the House, in order that it may be seen how many staffs we are maintaining.

The fact is that we need more, not less, centralization in connection with the organization of the Military Forces. We. ought to abolish the States staffs. dants ? of the forty-three military clerks who. are employed in receiving, docketing, forwarding, and recommending things, are merely conduit pipes between the central office and the persons whose correspondence they deal with. Supposing that a sergeant in Queensland wishes to communicate with the Minister. The sergeant writes to his captain, the captain writes to the colonel of the Commandant's staff officer, the State Comthe Commandership-in-Chief, his mandant writes to the Chief Staff Officer, the Chief Staff Officer then obtains the recommendation of the General Officer Commanding, and then it goes to the Minister. What the Minister does is to set in motion the same machinery, only by the reverse process. Every one of these persons has to note his minute and forward it, perhaps putting a recommendation on it. Eight or nine men are employed in sending the letter from the sergeant to the Minister, and eight or nine men are employed in sending the Minister's answer to the sergeant. learned member suggest how a matter of that kind can be otherwise dealt with ?

Supposing, for example, that Colonel Price were in charge of the Australian Light Horse. If he were in Queensland he would have to deal with the whole of the Australian Light Horse for the Commonwealth. In the same way, I should have an officer in South Australia to look after the whole of the infantry for the Commonwealth, an officer in New South Wales to look after the whole of the artillery for the Commonwealth, and an officer in Tasmania to look after the whole of the military miners. By that method we should be able to abolish the whole of the States staffs. quire a staff? very much less assistance than at present. member is wrong there. know that it would be impossible for a man's letter to reach the Minister except as I have stated.

The Kalgoorlie Bill must wait. The Minister continues to recognise a Commandant and a staff in each State. In order to get the proper economy which was promised prior to Federation, we should have a recognition in the Defence Department that the Commonwealth is in existence. keeping up each State system which the people, when they voted for the Commonwealth Constitution B ill , expected to be wiped out, to a large extent, as a separate system. methods in Federal affairs. The only advantage which has been gained in thisi Department has been the appointment of one Minister in .place of six Ministers. In the same wav we might have one Commandant instead of seven Commandants. It should be recognisedW ill the honourable and that we have an Australian service and not six States services. I trust that the Minister will do his best to bring about that reform. The duty of the Chief of Staff, under this Bill, I consider, will be to prepare the schemes of defence and intelligence. The duty of a Commander-inChief in war is to possess a complete and detailed knowledge of the schemes of defence and intelligence, and the larger tac-tics, and to put them into execution. The Chief of Staff is the man who prepares the schemes of defence; but under this Bill the Inspector-General, who will have nothing to do with the training of troops, But. the honourable and and who will be a mere critic, like a company's inspecting auditor, will take charge in time of war. I do not think it is possible at any time to work a military force by means of a Committee. In connection with the Russian and Japanese war, a proposal was lately made in Russia to create a second army, under General Gripenberg, while General Kuropatkin, No ; they would each want the present Commandant, was to retain charge of the first army. But all the military experts in Europe pointed out that such a plan would only lead to disaster. They urged that it meant that two 'men would have control instead of one. No . That proposal is very much like the Minister's scheme of a Committee to guide and control the Defence Force. On the It is part of my duty to 28th September the London Standard published the following criticism of the proposal which had appeared in the Vienna Fremdenblatt:Now that a second man has been co-ordinated with General Kuropatkin, the old military rule must be cited that two good leaders at the head of an army are worse than one inferior .leader. Largely as the present arrangement contributed towards bringing about the disasters of the past, the new one is likely to lead to nothing but new defeats. The critics recognise that with apparently the Minister does not recognise, We are really namely, that an army cannot be carried on by a Committee, that it must be in control of one man, who will be resposible for everything. The Minister said that, under his scheme, the Cabinet is to finally We need unification in our control, and I noticed that the House approved of his remark.

This really means that the Secretary of Defence, as the permanent head of the Defence Department, will control the forces in the future, as he has done in the past. I do not say that that control has not been to a certain extent beneficial. is no doubt that when a struggle arises between the Chief of Staff and the Permanent Head, and the Inspector-General, as to who is to control the forces, there will be a return to the present system. If the Minister, through the Cabinet, is to control, it means that the Secretary for Defence will have the largest, because the more dangerous in to have political control. when Lincoln and the men in charge of the Civil Department at Washington ceased to try to control matters in connection with military operations from which they were ral his For that reason attempts have been made in the past to give the English Commanderin-Chief a place in the Cabinet. do that on the Continent, where they are largely autocratic in their military ideas, and where there is generally a member of the Royal family who has acted as Commander-in-Chief.' The English Constitution and the Australian Constitutions, however, have found it difficult to graft an autocratic department on to a democratic system. In spite of the proposed new organization, the Minister of Defence will continue to control matters as he does now. I have tried to show that the Council of Defence will not f u l f i l the intentions of its author. to do the work which the Minister intends it to do, it will f a i l. As a council of control it will be a failure. If the Minister had followed the lines proposed in 1903, which he then so strongly opposed, and had provided only for a council of advice, he would have provided a useful body. tion of the Minister that it is necessary to import an Inspector of Ordnance from England. cer, he should be the best man obtainable. , The London Times, however, has described ' the English Army as the most costly and the least efficient which the mind of man can conceive, and those of us who have had experience of the organization scheme recently put forward know that .we have done no good by bringing out English officers, and would have been better off had we depended on Australian soldiers to do Australian work. That has been finally ad-mitted by fhe late General Officer ComBut there manding, though the idea was at first repudiated by him.

We have trained some of the best medical men to be found anywhere in the world, men who when they went to South Africa showed that they knew as much about medical science as did the eminent surgeons from other parts of the Empire. Similarly we have trained our own Judges, who I think will be acknowledged to be good lawyers, and it seems to me a pity that we do not give Australians an opportunity to show what they could do in military matters.

343,,"Mr. JOSEPH COOK -This is all too late!This is not only a criticism, but a prophecy. Perhaps my remarks will prove effective in another place, and probably some honourable members, including the Minister, will again change their minds. Last year the Minister was opposed to the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, which was upon rather similar lines to that embodied in the Bill. member is quite wrong. This proposal is entirely different. that he had changed his mind. of the kind. trouble the House by reading what the Minister did say; but he opened his speech withi a statement that he had changed his mind. I have no doubt that in twelve months' time the Minister will realize that this scheme is unworkable, except under a Commander-in-Chief. I can foresee that under the system proposed there will be a constant struggle for supremacy between the Chief Staff Officer and the Inspector-Generala struggle compared with which the dKfferences which have existed between the Ministerial Heed of the Department and the Military Commandant will be as nothing. I maintain that we cannot have a military organization without a definite autocratic head, and any attempt to work the Military Forces by means of a Committee will certainly lead to disaster. I trust that my remarks will carry some weight in another place. Senate will read them. the fact will at least be placed upon record that one protest was entered against the passing of this measure. like to obtain a little information from the Minister in regard to the constitution of the Council of Defence. When .this matter was under consideration upon a former occasion, I emphasized the fact that the proposed representation of the Naval JForces was hot nearly so great as that of the Military Forces. I then endeavoured to obtain from the Minister some statement which would make the position clearer. By way of interjection, he said that due .representation would be given to the Naval Forces upon the proposed Council of Defence. That may mean something, or it may mean nothing. I should be glad to know definitely the extent to which our Naval Forces are to be represented, because if the naval members of this important body are to be out-voted by the military members no adequate expression will be given to .the need which exists for devoting more attention to naval matters. I feel very strongly upon this question, because it appears to me that we are subordinating the very first line of our defence to the least effective line. Upon a previous occasion I asserted that an attempt had been made to build up the Military Forces of Australia, not so much for the defence of our own territory, as for service abroad. Thereupon I was informed that there was no justification for my statement. I affirmed that the building up of our Light Horse regiments was not in accord with the true policy of Australian defence, and that the General Officer Commanding really intended those regiments for service abroad, rather than here in Australia. I now. propose to show from an authoritative source that there was some warrant for my declaration. In ' a paper which was presented to Parliament two years ago, I find that Major-Genera] Sir Edward Hutton deals with what he terms "" the two factors "" in connection with Australian defence. He saysTwo factors, therefore, may be considered as governing the future organization and administration of the Military Forces of the Commonwealth, namely :(a) The defence of Australian soil. (*) The defence of Australian interest* wherever they may be threatened, (a) "" For the defence of Australian soil "" there are two essentials, namely, garrison troops, hereafter styled the Garrison Force, for the .protection of certain pre-determined strategical centres and places of commercial importance ; and field troops, hereinafter styled the Field Force, for those active operations which are, as has been shown, an essential element in conjunction with' the Garrison Troopsf o r the defence of such an extended area as Australia. It is not necessary that the troops for garrison duty, as a whole, should be mobile, but it is absolutely essential that the field troops be, not only well trained, carefully organized^ and well equipped, but also ready for active operations in the field at the shortest notice. The next point, however, is that to which I desire to direct particular attention, as a f for d in g f u l l justification for the remarks which . I made upon a for m e r occasion(i) "" FOT the defence of Australian interests whereveT they may be threatened,""' it will be",42,Honourable Members Hear Hear

It is not for active operations in "" any part of the world "" that we require our men to train; but for effective local service. In permitting the present arrangements to continue, I hold that we are pursuing a wrong course, and, further, that unless adequate representation be given to our Naval Forces upon the proposed Council of Defence, we shall be making an irreparable mistake. give the honourable member for Bourke any more information than I have already afforded him. Naval defence will be adequately represented on the Council by those whose interests and knowledge are specially connected with the Naval Forces; but I would not undertake to set down a definite numerical relation between, the number on the Council, who are specially familiar with military .matters, and the number who, are specially familiar with naval defence I can only say that I shall see, so far as my power goes, that we have in the Council a body that will be able to consider the whole question of Australian defence, in regard to both its naval and military aspects. branches of the one great question. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. That the House do now adjourn. desire to bring under the notice of the Government a matter similar to that which has already been mentioned 'by the honourable member for Fremantle, in regard to the coaling of the war-ship Euryalus, at Fremantle. I refer to the fact that one of the vessels of the squadron, the Challenger. was recently coaled in tbe port of Melbourne by her crew, although it has been the invariable practice to coal these vessels by means of shore labour. I wish to ask the -Prime' Minister whether he.can see his way to make representations to the ViceAdmiral as to the custom which has hitherto prevailed, and suggest that so far as possible it is desirable that it should be continued. I have been reI am connected, to bring this case forward. Those who follow this avocation felt the matter very keenly. There is no particular reason why at this juncture there should be any departure from the usual practice. If it is considered desirable to teach sailors how to coal at sea, it is singular that this should not have been done before, and those to whom this work usually falls are at a loss to know why the usual course should not have been followed on the occasion to which I refer. External Affairs) -It is quite correct to state that this matter has been brought under my notice on two occasions by the honourable member for Fremantle. . AlthoughI have no possible concern in the matter-althoug h the question as to whether war-ships are coaled by their own crews, or by shore labour, is a matter which is absolutely within the discretion and control of the Vice-Admiral-as a matter of courtesy, t suggested to the honourable member a day or two ago that he should address a letter to me on the subject, and said that I .would not hesitate to forward it to the ViceAdmiral. the coaling of another vessel. After all, these are only two shown me a draft of his letter, and it covers the question generally. I intend to send the letter onto the Vice-Admiral, but in doing so, I shall dfsclaim the slightest desire to be a. party to any interference with that which is within his undoubted province. If I receive a reply, I shall certainly forward it to the honourable member for Fremantle for the information of the men concerned. Question resolved in the affirmative.
