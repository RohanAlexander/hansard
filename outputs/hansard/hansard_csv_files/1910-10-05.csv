I draw the honourable gentleman's attention also to a statethis in keeping with my own experience of ment made on the date I have given by the Minister of Lands for Western Australia, to the effect that 1,000,000 acresof land have been surveyed for settlement in that State, but have not yet been sold.

31,Motion (By Mr Hughes) Agreed To,"(d) acquire the land on behalf of the Commonwealth; and for that purpose may, within a reasonable time, by proclamation declare that the land is vested in the Commonwealth, but subject to all leases mortgages and other charges affecting the land. (e) The effect of the proclamation shall be to vest the land in the Commonwealth for the same estate or interest therein as the owner was entitled to at the date of the publication of the proclaby the Attorney-General, but in other remation in the Gazette, but subject to all leases mortgages and other charges then affecting the land, and to entitle the owner to compensation there for upon the basis of the improved value obtained by adding the fair value of improvements to the unimproved value stated in the return. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [2.50] I propose to ask the Committee to amend this clause by adding, after the word "" land,"" in line 5, the words "" to the extent of 25 per centum or more;"" by inserting the same words as a consequential amendment in subparagraph i . of paragraph c ; by striking out sub-paragraph i i . of paragraph c, and by adding to paragraph e a provision that the owner shall also be paid an allowance of 10 per cent, upon the improved value mentioned in the .paragraph for compulsory dispossession. The clause, then, as amended, will provide that where there is an undervaluation to the extent of 25 per cent, or more, the Commissioner may apply to a Justice of the High Court, who, if satisfied that there has been undervaluation to that extent, may make the declaration necessary to clothe the Commissioner with the powers set out in the clause, and the Commonwealth may then acquire the land for that price, plus 10 per cent, upon the whole value, whatever it is. ample of New Zealand. are. Practically, that was the arrangement in the case of the Cheviot estate. Honourable members will see that an important change is to be made in the clause by these amendments. Formerly, it was not necessary to prove any particular amount of undervaluation, and the intention to defraud need not be shown. was a sort of Scotch verdict of "" not proven."" The clause, as it will be amended, will require the Commissioner to prove only the one fact, that there has been, whether wilfully or not, an underThereupon the Governor General may valuation of 25 per cent, or more. That will then place the Commonwealth in the position, subject to the Constitution, of acquiring the land by paying xo per cent, above, not the unimproved value, but the value of the land, whatever it is. clause will be considerably improved in some respects by the amendments suggested spects, if I apprehend the effect of the amendments correctly, it will not be improved. I had on the margin of my Bill a note to insert in sub-paragraph i . of paragraph c, the words "" to the extent of 25 per cent."" after the word "" has."" That is to the same effect as the amendment foreshadowed by the Attorney-General. As, however, this is a rather unnecessary clause, we ought to make it as little drastic as possible. I call it unnecessary because South Australia has no such provision. I understand that New Zealand has it, but I have not been able to find out the number of cases in which it has been put into operation there. I believe there have been some purchases. I have heard of one or two cases in which the Commissioner has suddenly jumped on a man by offering 10 per cent, on his valuation and taking the land over, but I cannot say, from any research that I have been able to make, whether it has been found necessary in New Zealand to put the section into effect. In South Australia, in order to be sure about the matter, I asked the Taxation Department whether they have had many cases of sales of land under the Act owing to the tax being two years in arrear. There, under the Taxation Act, they have power to do what municipal corporations can do when rates are in arrears. They may make application to the Court for the sale of the land, but I believe that in only the exone or two cases has it been found necessary to take that course owing to the extent to which the tax was in arrears. If that is so, it shows that this clause is really unnecessary, because the other remedies were action in Court for the amount, or distress upon the goods and chattels of the defaulting taxpayer; and in all cases except one or two, where I believe the land was derelict, the ordinary provisions for It the recovery of debts, coupled with the power to ask for sale, have been found thoroughly effective. They are always effective in the case of municipalities, which have had legislation on this question",18,Constitution Alteration

That being so, I regard this clause as unnecessary ; and if read in connection with the Lands Acquisition Act of 1906, as it must be, it is likely to lead to a good deal of embarrassment. This clause must be read in connection with that Act. that when the proclamation declaring the compulsory taking of the land is put into force, the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act apply as far as they are applicable. That will mean the dislocation of the terms of wills and deeds of trusts. This power is not vested in an ordinary freeholder as defined by the Bill, but, under the Lands Acquisition Act, in a wide category of persons with subordinate interests, who are regarded as owners for the purposes of the Act. Whether we may have to amplify "" owner"" under the Bill to meet the requirements in regard to the Lands Acquisition Act, I cannot say; but it is quite clear that we can upset settlements by applying that Act; and to the extent to which settlements are destroyed we shall be obliged to make compensation, and to bring into force a whole host of provisions necessary in acquiring lands for public purposes. Bill, however, all that is clearly unnecessary; and it is a great pity to interfere with settlements and other interests under the circumstances. If the clause be not excised its terms ought to be cut down as much as possible; and I suggest that after the word "" Act "" the words "" w i l f u l ly bers are yet fully seized of what the with a view to evade taxation "" be inserted. Unless the Commissioner thinks there is attempt at evasion, he should not ask a Court of Justice to declare for compulsory purchase. If this provision is not required for the purpose of recovering the tax, it ought not to be introduced merely as a penal clause for punishing people for doing something that does not involve injury to the State. All the justification that we find for the amendment of the Attorney General is that there may be undervaluation to the extent of 25 per cent.; and if there be such undervaluation the declaration must be made, however innocently the taxpayer may have acted. he gets 10 per cent, more thanhis own valuation? the loss of his land even if he gets 50 per cent, more than his valuation. An estate may have been left to various children, and those interests may have been mortgaged. make an order in such a case. "" shall,"" and I suggest that the word should be ""may."" If the clause remains it ought not to be more drastic than our sense of expediency prescribes. I venture to say that in 25 per cent, of the cases, there will be innocent errors of the sort mentioned, and I nm speaking on the evidence afforded by the first and only returns asked for in South Australia. all the undervaluations will be "" in nocent "" I and Customs in his short term of office has become almost as suspicious as some of his own detectives. In Customs matters the Department cannot check values which are at the place of export. It should be necessary to show that the undervaluation is wilful with a view to evade taxation ; and the Attorney-General himself saw the necessity for altering the clause, only his alteration, instead of curing the defects, puts aside altogether the necessity of raising the Under this question of wilfulness or evasion. Under the circumstances, I move That after the word "" Act,"" line 4, the words "" wilfully with a view to evading taxation "" be inserted. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [3.9]. I do not know whether honourable memamendment of the Attorney-General really means; but it seems to me that the honourable gentleman's proposal removes the last rag of decency from a measure already sufficiently drastic in the way of spoliation. The valuation of land with all improvements, in some districts, and under some circumstances, admits of innocent error far exceeding 25 per cent.; and this fact is known to any one of experience. I do not say that this applies to'all cases. In the case of city lands it rarely applies, though sometimes it does; but in the case of some country lands it applies frequently. If there be room for error in the case of lands for which there is a market value and price with the improvements, there is infinitely more room in the case of what we call the unimproved value-whe n we have first to ascertain the improved value, and then subtract that very vague and indefinite",19,Constitution Alteration

In all cases in which there is a difference of 25 per cent, in regard to that very indefinite thing, the unimproved value of land, between the valuation of the land-owner and that of the officer appointed to make a valuation, the land-owner is to be deemed a criminal, and his land is to be taken from him, without a chance being given lo him to show that he did not wilfully undervalue his land. Were it not for my belief that the clause will in all probability stated over and over again that land value* be declared unconstitutional, and may drag down the measure with it, I should regard this as an extremely serious matter. doubt, as the Minister of Trade and Customs interjected, the Customs Act imposes on the man who imports goods at a certain valuation the onus of proving that that valuwish to part with their land will be careation is correct; but the value of goods is always definite, and easily ascertainable from invoices.

Contrasting the methods of this Government with those of the last' in regard to vital measures, I am bouhd to say that the advantage is with us. The honourable member must know perfectly well that the Government have a majority. meet objections from every quarter; but the Government must stand by a measure in which it believes, regardless of whether or not the Opposition believe in it, and I am endeavouring, as well as I am able, to put the case from our stand-point. Surely the Opposition do not expect me also to put their side of the case before the Committee. In my opinion, the effect of an acquisition of the land will be to acquire only, as set forth in paragraph e, the estate of a person who has made an undervaluation. My honourable friend has spoken of the position of trustee estates, and I have already said that my opinion is piothat what will pass will be the estate of a beneficiary, whatever that is. member will find that the wording of the forfeiture clause, being different from this, throws doubt upon that contention. of honourable members to paragraph d, and would remind them that "" owner"" includes a trustee.

I remind him, again, that he has had a previous opportunity of addressing his own party in caucus during the last three months The remark is a most imable member to confine his remarks to the clause before the Chair. General has been addressing himself to an amendment proposed by a member of the Opposition, and one would have expected hira, according to the ordinary rules of debate, to address his answer to the side of the House that proposed the amendment. the remarks made by the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Angas, who traversed the whole clause. I am doing my very best to so, the honourable gentleman turned almost completely towards his own party for at least ten minutes. If we advance arguments from this side of the Committee, it is only fair to expect the Attorney General to address his reply, partly, to us. It may be that he wished to address the honourable member for Hume, whom, as the third party in the House, he is entitled to try to convince, in order to turn the scale, in the event of a division. The issue under discussion is very simple, and really reduces itself to a question of whether or not some evidence shall be required to. show that an undervaluation is wilful.

In sub-clause 2 of paragraph c he will find the very principle for which the honourable member for Angas is contending. as usual, is in error. member has struck that identical principle out of his own Bill. is in error. Committee to determine. The Attorney General provided in his own Bill that one of the conditions of forfeiture should be that the Justice was "" not satisfied that the undervaluation was not made wilfully."" That was an adoption of a method of procedure pioneered in Commonwealth legislation by the late Mr C. C. Kingston. The Attorney-General provided that there must be an element of. wilful misrepresentation to satisfy the Justice; but that provision he himself has since struck out. The honourable member for Angas now says to the honourable gentleman, "" Your first thought was right. There should be an element of wilfulness in this offence,"" and he therefore proposes to replace in the Bill the clause which the Attorney-General originally had there. seems to be unable to see the difference between the clause, as amended by me, and the clause as it originally stood. orable member allow sub-paragraph 2 of paragraph c to remain if the amendment be withdrawn? Will he leave the Bill as it was? I refer to this matter to show that the Attorney-General addressed his arguments to his own party to convince them, not that the amendment, as proposed by the honourable member for Angas, was wrong, but that he himself was wrong in the first place, and was now seeking to do that which was right. The question is whether we are going to compel people to be dragged before a Court with respect to an alleged undervaluation, and, as the honourable member for Flinders has contended, to empower a Judge or magistrate to forfeit a man's land at 10 per cent, over his own valuation, or 15 per cent, under the valuation made by the Crown, without some evidence of its being wilfully or knowingly done? able gentleman think that any Court would make such an order? In the clause we have the word ""shall,"" not "" m a y "" ; and a magistrate will be a mere automaton, controlled by this statutory power. In the case of a man who has valued his estate at £10,000, whereas the Government say that it is worth £12,500, the Government now propose, not that they should take over that estate at their' officer's valuation of £12,500, but that they should take it over at £11,000, 10 per cent, over the owner's valuation, or, roughly, 15 per cent, under the valuation of the Government's own officers. The Attorney-General did not seem to understand the argument advanced, by the honourable member for Flinders. He said that, in a case of alleged undervaluation, a man would receive 10 per cent, on the proper valuation. The whole contention, in regard to value, is, however, that that advance would be 10 per. cent., not on the real value, but on the alleged undervaluation. Under the Customs Act the real value is taken. same basis-the value stated by the importer, in the one case, and that stated by the owner, in the other. parallel between the circumstances of this clause and those of the section in the Customs Act to which the honourable gentleman has referred. In the case of goods there is an ascertainable value, concerning which experts will agree; but the position in regard to land is altogether different. I do not know that the Attorney-General has had much practice on questions of land values, but in resumption cases-and I speak with a great deal of experience-half-a-doze n experts will sometimes give widely different valuations, differing, in some instances, to the extent of 50 per cent. It is strange that an attempt should be made to introduce into this Bill a drastic provision of this kind, which assumes that we are dealing with dishonest men. There are, doubtless, plenty of dishonest men in tlie world; but it is a fair rule of life to presume a man to be honest until it is proved that he .is dishonest.

74,Mr Bruce Smith,"There is noform of wealth in this country, it hardly becomes us to begin with the assumption that every land-owner is dishonest, and to throw upon him the onus of showing, not that he is not dishonest, but that he has not undervalued his land, however innocently. This amendment is really a proposal to reinstate a provision of the Bill as originally introduced, and which the Attorney-General has .had time to discuss and to consider with the members of his party. I think I can say that, if he is prepared to restore the clause to the form in which it stood as introduced, the honourable member for Angas will not press his amendment. If that is done a land-owner will have an opportunity of showing that he has not made a dishonest valuation in the return submitted by him to the authorities. I appeal to the Attorney-General to withdraw this clause. Its object is, presumably, to secure correct valuations, and there are already in the Bill penal clauses providing for the punishment of any person who sends in a false return deliberately understating the value of his land with intent to defraud. Any one who does that will be liable, on convictionj to have his land forfeited. If he does any other acts, or neglects to do certain things, with the intention of evading the tax, he is also liable to conviction and his land to forfeiture. Those provisions being already in the Bill, there is no necessity for this clause. member call it a penalty to give a man 10 per cent, more than he thinks his land is worth ? he may be living on his own property and working it as his business. He may be in the city and may not want to sell the land' at all. It may be essential to him to carry his business on in that particular spot where he has the goodwill of his business; but under this clause the Commonwealth can take the whole of his property from him and thereby deprive him of his means of livelihood. If that is not a penalty I do not know what is. If what the Attorney-General is aiming at is a correct valuation, the whole of the machinery of the Bill is directed towards that end. A man sends in his return, and it is the duty of the Commissioner immediately he receives it to go into it and see if it is correct. If the Commissioner does not think it is correct, he assesses the value, and that assessment [147] stands unless the owner successfully appeals against it. There you have the complete machinery to obtain a correct assessment. In this case, the whole procedure is stopped beforehand. The man is not allowed to get to the Appeal Court to see if his valuation is correct or not. The matter is taken out of the hands of the Court altogether. As soon as the man sends iii his assessment, the Commissioner, if of opinion that it is 25 per cent, lower than it ought to be, does not try to have it corrected, but takes steps right away under this clause for the purpose of depriving the man of his land. The clause is evidently not for the purpose of getting a correct assessment at all. create, as it were, a superior Appeal Court? is the fair value of his property; but, without getting it assessed by the Commissioner and heard by the ordinary Assessment Court, he finds the matter taken clean out of his hands, and an application made to the Court for the enforcement of these provisions. The Attorney-General is by no means following the New Zealand proce-' dure in this case. In New Zealand the man sends in his return to the Commissioner, who assesses it. If the owner be dissatisfied, he can go to the Appeal Court, and the Court assesses the value. After the value has been assessed by the Assessment Court, and evidence heard on both the honourable sides, the Commissioner may, if dissatisfied, come in and attempt to acquire the land. If the Commissioner is of opinion that any land has been fixed by the Assessment Court at less than its capital value, he may give notice to the owner that he requires the owner to consent to the capital value being fixed at a sum specified in the notice-bein g the sum which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is the fair value of the land-and that failing such consent being given, after the notice, the Commissioner may recommend the Governor_ to acquire the land on behalf of His Majesty at that sum. The owner may consent to the capital value being fixed at the sum specified in the notice, or at any other sum agreed to by him and the Commissioner. If there be no consent by the owner, then the land may be acquired. On the other hand, procedure is given to protect tiie owner where he is not satisfied with the value of the land as fixed by the Assessment Court. He may give notice to",23,Constitution Alteration

They have substituted a very much fairer procedure, and that is why I appeal to the Attorney-General to modify this clause in accordance with the New Zealand Act, if it is to remain in the Bill at all. He also has some doubts as to its constitutionality. Why is there a preamble to it? There is never a preamble to clauses in our legislation. Customs Act. not put into clauses. The Attorney-General wants to conceal the fact that what he is really after is the acquisition of lands. The preamble is intended to convey the idea that the clause is put into the Bill only for the purpose of protecting the revenue, but paragraph h reveals the real intention of the clause. The object is that, if the State Government does not require ,-the land, the Commonwealth shall acquire it, and sell or lease it as it thinks fit, and -.thus initiate a Federal land policy. The Attorney-General stated during the debate that under this clause he was exercising the power of acquiring public lands. He cannot support the constitutionality of this clause upon that power, because he is not exercising in it the power of acquiring lands for public purposes. by the Constitution is not the way in which the honourable member is exercising it. power in every way that we have it. is going to base the clause on that power, the responsibility rests with him. He is also treating trust estates exceedingly unfairly under this clause. In a great many trust estates the land is vested in the trustee who holds it as an estate of fee-simple. Under this clause, if a trustee quite innocently undervalues to the extent of 25 per cent., power is given to the Commonwealth to acquire the whole of the estate tive answer to the honourable member. is quite wrong. That paragraph protects only leases, mortgages, and other charges. clamation would be to vest the land in the same interests. ' vested in the trustee?

That being clear, I have here two illustrations taken from the State of which the I desire Attorney-General is a representative. I quote them because they are within the exbecause I am firmly convinced perience of a man of standing known to myself. In One instance, that of a suburban area, he placed the unimproved value of his vacant land at £ 2 5 an I speak as a acre. This was set down by the Government valuers at £ 4 0 an acre; ancl on this they insisted under examination and cross examination. The result was that the Judge visited the spot, and decided that £ 2 5 was a fair valuation. Here was an error on the part of the sworn Government valuers of more than 25 per cent.; yet on their side there was no risk and no penalty for an honest mistake. The second illustration is one which the Attorney-General may recognise, because it attained some repute. Again it was a question of suburban There land, in North Sydney, valued by the owner at £ 4 a foot. The Crown valuer and another authorized sworn valuer assessed the land at £ 9 a foot. There was a great deal of cross-examination, ancl in the end the sworn valuer, who had been called in, offered the proprietor in Court jQd a foot, which was promptly accepted. The Judge, not deterred, visited the land with the experts, and, after examination, fixed the It is a question of punishvalue at £ 4 a f o o t ; by this time the gentleman who had agreed to purchase at We must all admit that £ 6 repudiated his bargain. In this case we have an error of over 100 per cent., upon evidence given, no doubt, in good faith.

The object is to penalize an We have to face the fact that in these cases the scales are not evenly weighted.

The two cases I have given are illustrative of many. What we have really to consider is how we can make the sanctions and penalties for true and false evidence anything like equal, so that those who value on the one side shall have the same measure of liability as those who value on the other. Unless we can achieve this, there must be hardship. Mr W. sioner's valuation may be overruled by a Justice of the High Court, and the provision will still apply. In all cases where we have on one side the Crown with its power, authority, and inexhaustible means, and on the other a private individual, protection for the latter against aggression and mistake is essential. Those who wilfully undervalue their estates should be punished severely. That is just. for that. honourable members opposite are not trying to do so. They put on one side professional opinion, with no liability, and on the other the opinion of a man who, having everything at stake, is also subject to a heavy penalty should his valuation be 25 per cent, below that of the person who values for the Government. However large any holding may be, its owner must be a weakling compared with the Crown, with its inexhaustible purse, and power to heap evidence on evidence. The provision is one with which no fair-minded man should wish to be associated. None of us would like to exercise the authority here given. Valuations are opinions, they are estimates, and often assumptions. General should at least accept the suggestions from his own side, to make the scales of justice fairly even, instead of weighting them heavily against the owner of the land. sorry that the Attorney-General will not accept the amendment of the honourable member for Angas, because it is wrong to punish for acts which have not been done wilfully. It must-be remembered that the differences in the valuations of experts, to which reference has been made, occur in regard to the valuing of land with all its improvements, and if experts vary as to the value of land with its improvements, they must vary far more in regard to the unimproved value of land. According to the definition clause"" Unimproved value"" in relation to land means the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bond fide seller would require, assuming that the actual improvements thereon, or appertaining thereto, and made by the owner or his predecessor in title, had not been made. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Such a valuation would require a historical research. H. IRVINE -The Commisculty that arises is as to the improvements appertaining to the land. Had an amendment proposed by the honourable. member for Richmond been agreed to, owners would have had some idea of the allowances to be made in respect to improvements, but the definition I have read is so wide that great difference of opinion will exist as to whether drains, embankments against inundation, and other works of that kind, are improvements appertaining to the land whose value is under consideration. In regard to these matters alone a bond fide error of at least 25 per cent, may be made. It is also provided that"" Value of improvements "" in relation to land means the added value which the improvements give to the land at the date of valuation, irrespective of the cost of the improvements. A bond fide mistake of at least 25 per cent, might easily be made in applying that definition. ber think that a land-owner will be punished for a bond fide mistake? orable member has not read the provision under discussion, which, if the unimproved value of land is understated, allows the Commissioner to apply to the High Court, and if the Justice is satisfied that the owner has understated the value to the extent of The Attorney25 per cent., the land may be acquired by the Government. It is not necessary that the understatement should be wilful. Before a man can value his land he will t have to come to a decision, not merely on questions of fact, but on questions of law arising out of the facts.

Apparently the Attorney-General desires to make the clause more generous in one direction and more unjust in another, penalizing the man who makes a mistake, whether wilfully or otherwise. in charge of the New Zealand Land Tax legislation had informed him that the Dominion had ceased to apply its powers of resumption, because it feared that it might have to resume too many estates like the Cheviot estate. Apparently, the Attorney General looks forward to such a prospect with pleasure, which gives ground for the suspicion that the principle of land nationalization is disguised in this proposal. If the New Zealand Government did not wish to resume a large number of estates, why should the Commonwealth be in a hurry to do so? In my opinion, there is no power to take over this land. Labour party appears to be anxious to get the last drop of blood from every landowner who possesses property of which the unimproved value exceeds £ 5 , 0 0 0 ; but these provisions may come back like a boomerang, and injure those responsible for them. If we on this side cannot carry the amendment of the honourable member for Angas, we can protest strongly against the proposal of the Government. The desire of the Government ought to be to get, not an abnormal, but a fair average, valuation when these assessments are made. Under the conditions laid down by the Attorney General that will be almost impossible. When the Government of South Australia were dealing with an amendment of the Land Taxation Act they were informed by the New Zealand Government, that they had abandoned this very principle, because it was impracticable and unworkable, and because land there was more frequently over-assessed than under-assessed. Instead of bringing about something approaching I have known land on which uniformity of assessment, it led to the opposite result. It was found that one I concur with man was paying on an assessment 25 or 30 per cent, more than his neighbour, and that he was paying, according to the admission of the Deparhnent, more than he ought to. simply because of the fear of the penalty that was hanging over his head. The penalty under the New Zealand Act, however, was as nothing compared with that for which this B ill provides. The Government cannot expect to have for some time a fair and satisfactory assessment. That TheB ill , is not likely to be secured until trained officers have been obtained, and until the whole system has been placed on something like a practical and scientific basis. Meantime, there will be penalties exacting enough without this additional penalty of taking away from a man his home and his land, because of a mistake that may have been He told us that the Minister innocently made. In the experience of every State Government having a taxation Department it is infinitely more difficult to obtain a fair assessment in Australia than it is in New Zealand. In the Dominion there are not such variations as obtain in the Commonwealth. Here, in 100 assessments we may have land that is from 100 to 300 per cent, more valuable than other land not more than a quarter of a mile away. Experience in the Courts shows that valuations of land often vary from 20 to 60 per cent., and another point to be remembered is that for taxation purposes a man is not supposed to have an assessment The made at the top market price. The true principle is to get a fair average valueto determine the value of the land, not to-day, but over a given number of years. The Attorney-General knows that tKat principle is recognised in the Courts in connection with State and municipal assessments, and I sincerely hope that he will accept the amendment and not introduce into the Bill machinery that will very often penalize men when they are quite innocent of any w i l f u l misrepresentation. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [4.30] I hope that since the Committee has thoroughly ventilated its opinion upon this clause we shall have an opportunity to get to a division. The points at issue are perfectly clear. There have been intruded into this discussion questions of constitutionality that are quite irrelevant. Nothing is more certain than",28,Constitution Alteration
128,Mr Richardfoster (Wakefield),,29,Constitution Alteration
129,Mr Hughes,"(West Sydney-Actingthat the clause is constitutional. Otherwise the lawyers opposite would have told us so long ago. If the Opposition were only half as sure as the honourable member for Hume is that the clause is unconstitutional they would have been twice as quick as he has been in saying so. In any case, the honourable member for Hume need have no fear that the measure is imperilled in any way, even if the clause is unconstitutional, it is clearly severable from the Bill, and in no way, therefore, is the Bill as a whole jeopardized. We have the power to do what we propose, and we ought to exercise that power. The honourable member for Wakefield has spoken of the injustice of this procedure, but if it be an injustice to ask a man to take for his land 10 per cent, more than he has said it is worth, then injustice is something with which we have never become fairly acquainted. This is hot a penalty clause in the proper sense of the term. It is merely a method of insuring that reasonable, care will be taken by a taxpayer in estimating the value of his land. I freely admit that one valuator may say that land"" is worth £ 2 per acre, while another declares that it is worth £ 4 per acre. Buti f a man asked me how much I wanted for some land that I possessed, I should know what I wanted, and if he said, "" Will you take anything less ?'' I should be able to tell him at once what my decision was. Every man is in the same position. We may not .know how much another man's property is worth, but we know how much we believe our own property to be worth, and we are asked to state in these assessments what we believe is the honest value. payer's valuation is 25 per cent, below that made by the Commissioner? ber is assuming that taxpayers are going to be so unfortunate as geneially to submit valuations 25 per cent, below the real value of their properties. The trouble in this country is not that land is too cheap, but that it is top dear-no t that people charge 25 per cent, too little for their land, but that very often they ask 25 per cent, too much for it. We merely ask that a land-owner shall put a fair valuation upon his property. sioner may come along and say that the valuation made by the owner is 25 per cent, below the true value. ber has any land, is he not able to say what he will take for it? If I said to a man, "" What will you give me on my watch?"" and I accepted his offer of £ 2 , I could blame no one if , later on, I were informed that I could have obtained £ 3 upon it had I demanded that amount. A man has no right to value his land at, say, £ 2 per acre if he is not prepared to sell it at that price. above the market price, and yet the owner might not be' prepared to sell his land for £ 3 per acre. land at a certain price cannot complain of being unjustly treated if some one gives him that price, plus 10 per cent., for it. MT. ATKINSON -But the unimproved value is the market price, less improvements. ber for Gippsland has been speaking as if the question of unimproved value were something new. It was the unimproved value which he said at the last general election he was in favour of taxing, and I point out that it is idle for a man to be in favour of a land tax if he is not in favour of making such a tax effective. It is well known that evasions are not easier under the Customs Act than they will be under this measure; yet they go on with some regularity, and occasionally we hear of very substantial cases. Section 161 of the Customs Act deals with those honest and honourable gentlemen who are at some loss to put down the real value of the goods they import, and who resort to faked invoices. lutely necessary, because the value referred to is the value in other parts of the world. but my contention is that when a taxpayer has said that his land is worth a certain price per acre, the Commissioner should be entitled to acquire it on paying an extra 10 per cent. I do not blame those who were returned here in opposition to land taxation for endeavouring to defeat this Bill, but I do blame those who, although returned to support the principle, are ready to emasculate the Bill by omitting from it provisions that will make it effective. I emphatically declare this to be one of the most salutary provisions of the Bill-to insure that the assessment made by -every",29,Constitution Alteration

138,Mr Hughes,"I do not deny that;individual taxpayer shall be an approximately fair assessment of the value of his land. If a man values his land at a certain price, and will not sell it at that price, close to a city or means of communication, he must have an idea that it is worth a great deal more, and has undervalued it, because he desires to pay less taxation than he ought to do. The honourable member for Parkes said that this amendment merely repeated the wording of the sub-clause in the Bill as originally introduced. That is true in one sense, but not in the proper sense, because the clause will be so modified by the amendment which I have foreshadowed, that practically its whole purport will be entirely changed, and to retain the whole of the sub-clause would be to defeat the purposes of the section. In reply to the honourable memgiven at least a fair price for it in accordber for Wakefield, I would say that New Zealand abandoned this principle for a reason quite different from that which he gave us. To begin with, the principle in the New Zealand Act differed from this in an essential particular, in that, when a price had been fixed which the owner would not accept as a fair valuation, the State had to take it at its own valuation if it were lower. In view of the existence of large estates like the Cheviot estate, worth £400,000, the New Zealand Government were a little timid at going on. We are not in that position. Mr Fowlds, the New Zealand Minister of Education, who is well versed in the Act, declared that there was no more effective method of securing sound assessments of the true value than such a provision as this. It is perfectly fair and constitutional, in keeping with the whole aim and scope of the measure, and amply justified by precedents, and I hope the Committee will accept it. wish to enter my protest against the clause, and express the hope that the amendment of the honourable member for Angas will be carried. The Attorney-General says the clause is constitutional. I pointed out before that I believe, if it is put to the test, But one man would say it would bring the High Court will probably rule it out as unconstitutional. I gave some reasons on that occasion, and do not intend to go into the point again. for the clause. The Bill contemplates self assessment. Is it likely that tlie Commissioner will recommend the taking over by the Commonwealth of a.property away back from all communication, simply because the owner undervalues it? What would be the use of it to the Department if it was taken over? Consequently, the man away back will be able to undervalue his property almost with impunity, whereas another man, although he may make the most honest calculation possible, runs the risk of having his property taken by the Commonwealth at his own valuation, plus 10 per cent., if the Commissioner thinks the unimproved Value is 25 per cent, more than his estimate. Therefore the man will be given 15 per cent, less than the Commissioner's estimate. We do not want to penalize a man unless it is clear that he has wilfully undervalued his land. Where it is not proved that a man had a wilful intention, his land should not be taken from him at 10 per cent, above his valuation. He should be ance with the Commissioner's estimate, but before any land is taken away, the owner should have the right to have the matter tested by appealing to the Court, or submitting it to arbitration. It is unfair and un-British to penalize a man if he has not intended in any way to defraud the revenue. The Attorney-General seems to think that this is a matter of buying and selling-that because a man has a piece of land, and knows what he wants for it, he should be able to put down its unimproved value at once. That contention evades the whole issue. The question is not what a man wants for his land, but what its unimproved value is. If the Attorney-General knows anything about the lands of Australia, he will know it is most difficult to accurately assess the unimproved value of countless pieces of land. I know of blocks of land which I would not be surprised to see one man value at £ 2 an acre, and an equally competent man, but with no better reputation as a valuer, at £ 4 an acre, unimproved value. The unimproved value of a block of that fine land which is now selling at such high prices in Victoria would be probably what the land would bring if it were in its native state, supposing all the other improvements were in the locality. £[20, another £ 2 5 , and another even £ 3 5 an acre, without an axe being put on to it. I see no necessity That shows that it is extremely difficult to get at the exact unimproved value. It would be very easy for plenty of people to honestly value their land 25 per cent, below the value the Commissioner would fix It is unnecessary to put in a clause like this, because it is contemplated that we shall have a Commissioner to assess the land as",30,Constitution Alteration
139,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot) [4,"41]-Isoon as such a thing is feasible. To come suddenly upon people, and treat every one as being out to defraud the revenue, without proving him guilty of any intent in that direction, is unjust and uncalled for, and practically unheard of in British legislation. It seems, however, tiiat the Government are out to hit the land-holder. They want to go back to a certain class of the community, and say : "" We were after such and such scalps, and we have secured them."" That seems to be their whole anxiety. It has long been apparent to the Opposition that it is futile to appeal to the Government on grounds of justice ancl fair play. The Government say they do not want to do anything unjust, but they take fine care, when easy ways of modifying their own measure without materially injuring it are pointed out, not to adopt any of them.

During one period of the discussion there were fourteen members sitting on the Opposition side, nnd seven of them belonged to the"" legal profession. Every one of those gentlemen is a direct opponent of the measure, and yet they ask the Government not to include a penal clause in the Bill. Every sane man in Australia would laugh at the Government if they did not insert a penal claiise in a Land Tax Bill to deal with people who attempt to break the. law. says that"" it is not a penal clause. Attorney-General said, but members of the Opposition have been anxious the whole of. the afternoon to defend those who would break the law if they got the opportunity. The Attorney-General, on the other hand, has been endeavouring to so frame the Bill as to prevent people from breaking it. All our laws-crimina l and otherwise-contai n penal clauses, the object of which is to deter people from breaking them. The object of this clause is similar, and it would be absurd for this Parliament to pass a Land Tax Bill without it. We cannot help noticing where the main opposition to the Bill is coming from. All those who have been so anxious to remove this penal clause to-day have used their best endeavours to prevent the passage of any land taxation measure whatever. The clause provides that the owner shall furnish a return of the value of his own land. That is only a reasonable request to make to those of our citizens who own land. We have heard a great deal about the difficulty of making valuations. In my occupation, and in positions that I have occupied in New South' Wales, I have had to obtain valuations of land. The valuers I have employed have been respectable business firms, and I have been sometimes in doubt whether they have not been in collusion with one another to arrive at the same figure, because their valuations have been so near to one another. No one outside this House would believe that a man who owns land does not know the value of it. Such a supposition is absolutely ridiculous and not within the realm of reason. The Attorneypart in the discussion of Tariff questions must realize that severe punishments are necessary if the revenue is not to be defrauded. We make laws against the commission of murder in order to deter people from that crime; and we must have punishment in the case of a land tax in order to secure fair returns. I do not know whether the legal gentlemen opposite are looking to future business in their efforts to make this clause vague and uncertain; but my opinion is that if the desire of the Committee be to prevent litigation, the punishments must be severe. It must be proved to the satisfaction of the Minister of Customs that there is an attempt to defraud; and surely we may take it for granted that such an official will perform the duties of his office in a lenient and just way. member has "" got hold of the wrong end of the stick."" orable member is one of those fortunate "" people who own land, and he is, apparently,",31,Constitution Alteration

The honourable member for East Sydney is under a misapprehension as to the scope of the clause, and as to the nature of the objections of honourable members jon both sides. has taken 'any objection to the most drastic provisions against undervaluation. If the honourable member looks at clauses 65 and 67, he will see that there are penal provisions sufficiently drastic to enforce this bringing the fact that the mistake wasland tax. For instance, there is a fine of £500, with triple taxation and even forfeiture. is surely not in order in discussing those The compulsory clauses now. member for East Sydney has stated that we on this side are not in favour of the penal clauses, which I know are not now under discussion; and what I am now pointing out is that the clause before us is not necessarily a part of any scheme of land taxation. We say that the clause-is, so to The Attorneyspeak, an interpolation; it provides a compulsory method for the acquisition of land, and the method of acquiring land or any other form of property is provided for by the Constitution, and should be dealt with in separate and appropriate legislation. we take the land. contend that there is ample provision in the Bill for punishment for dishonest The undervaluation, without taking a man's property from him at a slight increase on his own valuation. The honourable member seems to be under the impression that this compulsory method of acquiring land is only to be brought into operation in cases of dishonest undervaluation; and if dishonesty were the test, there would not be tlie same strong objection to this part of The the Bill. We must remember, however, that the honourable member for Angas proposes that, before this clause operates, there shall be proof that the undervaluation is wilful. Is the honourable memberWhen a man for East Sydney in favour of the amendment to that end?

In revenue cases the onus of proving innocence is sometimes cast on the defendant, but that gives him the opportunity to avoid forfeiture by stating his source of knowledge. Had the olause been allowed to stand as it was, it would not have been so manifestly unjust. The provision now before us amounts to a refinement of' cruelty and injustice, men who are compelled to value their land to assist the Crown being made liable to its forfeiture for an undervaluation, even if innocently made. I object to the clause on three grounds: first, because I believe that it is unconstitutional; secondly, because I regard it as contrary to the principles of natural justice; and, thirdly, because "" I consider it unnecessary for the enforcement of land taxation. None of us objects to the imposition of heavy penalties for wilful undervaluation; but surely the penalties provided by clauses 65 and 67; under which wilful undervaluation is punishable by a fine of £500, the levying of treble taxation, and forfeiture of the land, are sufficient. In view of the existence of these penalties, can any member of the Labour party say that the Bill, even without clause 44, would not be equipped with all provisions necessary for the punishment of dishonest valuation ? lawyers would interpret the word "" wilfully "" as it -is interpreted ordinarily, I should be more easily influenced by the honourable member's arguments. the clearest word in the criminal code; it covers ""intentionally "" and "" dishonestly."" Honourable members do not wish to punish men who have made honest mistakes, but that will be the effect of the provision under discussion. We should not force land-owners to overvalue their properties to avoid the risk of forfeiture for undervaluation.

A great deal of fuss was made about the effect of the proposed tax on the numerous properties which are said to return only 2 per cent, on their value, it being stated that the Government was proposing to confiscate the whole profit, and to reduce the owners to bankruptcy. What would be easier under this provision than for these land-owners to undervalue their estates to the extent of 25 per cent., and to let the Government take the land at I Q per cent, on their valuation? If they did that, they would lose only 15 per cent, of the value of their properties, and could unload them on the Commonwealth. It might be said that the Government would not buy them; but it would have to do so for the sake of its own reputation. Having heard the burden of their song, I think that the singers will be found chirping on this side.

A great deal has been said of late by members of the Labour party about certain men who are in gaol and legironed for having innocently broken the law. Now they are thirsting for the blood of men who innocently break the law by making honest undervaluations. breakers than are the men who are in gaol. honourable member be satisfied if he can send some one else to gaol? Is that the be-all and end-all of his political existence ? l t is a fine Labour aspiration. All that the honourable member wants, it seems, is to put some one under the lash of the law. How that will help those who are suffering to-day I do not know. It is not my desire that any law-breakers shall escape. A man who wilfully breaks this law should pay the penalty; but what we are seeking to do now is to defend the man who honestly undervalues his land from having it taken from him because of that mistake. I see no reason why we should impose such a penalty. When the Attorney General attempts to put it into operation, he will find himself, with his limited Federal powers, in a sea of difficulties, and will be the first to wish that he had never meddled with it. Those who have no thought but a selfish one in this regard could wish him joy, in a political sense, of all he obtained from it. When he puts it into operation the troubles of the Federal Government will begin. The Bill provides for other penalties that are severe enough without our going the length of declaring that a man's land and home shall be taken from him-and that is what the Government propose-in the case of an undervaluation. Let such a man be punished adequately for his offence. to whicli the honourable member refers do not relate to this clause. to this clause as being wholly unnecessary. Punish a man for whatever wilful fraud can be proved against liim, but why go further, and take away his land ? Are not the Government satisfied when justice has been done? If the other penalties are not considered sufficient, make them more drastic, but why pass such a provision as this? Those who have had any experience know that undervaluation and overvaluation of land is an every-day occurrence. The lands of Australia to-day, on the whole, for shire and municipal purposes, are rather over, than under, valued. The reason for that is obvious. The shire taxation is limited in extent. In New South Wales it is based upon the unimproved value, and the limit of the tax is 2d. in the J£i. There is, therefore, a tendency, it seems to me, to place a high valuation on the land. No reasonable ratepayer would object to the valuation being to the uttermost farthing for municipal and shire purposes, because he knows that if the valuation of the land comes down to any extent, there must.be a corresponding increase in the rates. In these circumstances, there is no incentive to be constantly appealing against the undervaluations and overvaluations on the one side or the other, as long as rough justice is done. . Many of the lands within the jurisdiction of shires to-day are, on the whole, I believe, overvalued rather'than undervalued. verse. member does not mean that. illustration. I have a small block of land, the unimproved value of which is fixed today at £ 3 0 per acre. I believe that that is an over-estimate, but I do not complain, for I think the tax, based as it is on the unimproved value, is fair and very low. Half-a-mile away, and fronting the same main road, there is land valued at .£100 per acre. It is not, in my judgment, worth half that amount, yet the shire taxation is being paid upon it on that basis. Here we have already at hand a basis of assessment for the Federal Government. They have no independent machinery, and, in all probability, the shire valuations will be taken as a basis for the imposition of the Federal tax. If a man paying the shire land tax to-day on a small block of. land, at the rate of £ioc» per acre, should honestly say, "" This land is worth only £ 5 0 per acre,"" and value it for the purposes of this Bill at that rate, he will be liable at once to lose his estate if it is big enough to come under the Federal tax. This provision has nothing to do with honest land taxation. The Bill provides many other penalties for undervaluation.

I have pointed out reasons why I believe that land is overvalued for shire purposes. much undervalued for municipal purposes. the bonorable member's statement against that of a vast army of expert men, who have spent most of their lives in valuing land, and whose opinions count for infinitely more than do his or mine. The Minister has plenty of penal machinery elsewhere in the Bill, and I hope he will allow the matter of wilful fraud to be absolutely proved against a man before proceeding to the extreme step of confiscating his property. ment take it from him, at any rate. What is the difference? T hope the honourable member will not proceed to that extreme in this Bill. Give the Act a chance, and if it does not work out well, the honorahle member can always come again to Parliament and get further penalties. My own opinion is that he has plenty in the Bill. like to put one aspect of the matter before the Attorney-General. I am of the opinion of several members of the Opposition, that the clause is very drastic indeed, and will mean endless litigation on the part both of property owners and the Commonwealth. As practical men, we do not want to rush any individual into the Courts and subject him to expensive litigation, simply because he is a land-holder. I do not think any honourable member on this side wishes that. If there are any who do wish it, they are very few. I should like to show the Minister how a man could undervalue his estate, and at the same time not do it wilfully. In fact, at the time of making the return it would be the real value. In the Western Riverina and western portions of New South Wales and Queensland, there are times when the land is practically valueless for pastoral purposes. We have seen that happen many times. I know one man who went to Western Queensland with £70,000, and left Barcaldine railway station with nothing but his swag, so that he did not make much money by taking up land. Suppose the owner of a property had a successful year this year, and land in that district was at a good price; that then a succession of droughts began, and every year the land depreciated in value. Suppose, then, that when the owner put in liis assessment at the end of the financial year, a good spring suddenly followed, and the value of the land rose by, say, 100 per cent. Would the Minister say that that man had wilfully misrepresented the case to the Commissioner, and would he then step in and take the land from him at that price? this clause. not. "" s h a l l "" and ""may""-to the use of which, in Acts of Parliament, I take great exception. The Attorney-General, I know, desires to do what is just. He wants to rope in those who are dishonest; and if he keot the clause as it stood originallv in the Bill, I tliink every honourable member would be more satisfied. It is not mv desire to punish an honest man ; but I think we all desire to punish the dishonest man. The same arguments as have been used to-day",35,Constitution Alteration

We were told that the Government were becoming trading merchants, and would do this, that, and the other. I think that there have been only three cases of action taken under that section of the Customs Act. I appeal to the Attorney-General to do as the honourable member for Parramatta suggests. If we find that the clauses are not drastic enough, it will be within the province of the Government and Parliament to make them more drastic. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [5.48] I hope that the Committee will come to a division on the question, which has been argued at greatlength. I suggested some amendments in the clause, entirely with the view of meeting objections that had been outlined at an earlier stage; but I find that my attempt at amendment is treated with the utmost disdain and scorn. I am now told that I have made the thing infinitely worse than before, which is, of course, most unsatisfactory for me, and, apparently, worse for the Committee. The honourable member for Maranoa spoke about the position of persons with pastoral holdings which are subject to a depreciation of value owing to droughts. A man always knows what the value of his land is. If his land is worth very little, he will put down a very small amount in his return. If it is worth a lot, he will put that down'. After the drought of 1893 had gone over this country, the honourable member knew to within a little what his own property was worth. It may have been worth only one-fifth of what it was before the drought came; but, whatever it was, he knew it. Let him, therefore, put that down in the assessment paper. of value to the pastoralist; it is the grass and water. That is the only asset he has. plies to all classes of land. The value of land used for agricultural or pastoral purposes depends entirely on the extent to which it meets those purposes. cannot get any grass on land on which you are running sheep, you have to feed them or drive them off. The question is, what is. the position of the owner of land in those circumstances? piece of land, and a drought comes, and he has no grass, the capital value of the land is depreciated; but he knows it, and nobody knows it better than he does. He can say, "" My land is not worth one-tenth of what it was five years ago."" There may be plenty of cases where that applies. We are only asking the owner to say what his land is worth. I know many cases where, during drought 5'ears, if a man could have got 10 per cent, above his qwn valuation, he would have been the happiest man in creation, and glad of the chance to unload his estate. I have never yet known a case where a big squatter or pastoral owner was not influenced by one of two things. Either he had confidence that the present was a mere passing phase, and that good times would come again, or he had abandoned all hope and was seeking to unload. If he is seeking to unload, this is the best chance he has; because he has only to put his own valuation on the land, and we will give him 10 per cent, more for it. The honourable member for Maranoa has stated that we desire to do justice. I hope we all have that desire, r however our views may differ as to the means. There is, I know, a strong desire on the part of honourable members on this side to do justice; and one of the most effective refutations of the ridiculous statements that are made from time to time in the press, and by some members on the other side, that those on this side come here with their minds made up, and have no opinions of their own, is to be found in the fact that criticism of amendments put forward by the Government comes quite as frequently from this side as from that. I am prepared to strike out the word "" wilfully,"" from subparagraph i i . , of paragraph c, and then to retain the sub-paragraph. That will, I think, meet most of the objections urged against the clause, .and is going as far as, and perhaps a little further than, I ought to go. I have no other desire than to protect the revenue, and compel people to realize that it is a very serious thing to undervalue their land without some good cause. If that amendment will meet the wishes of the Committee, I am prepared to consider it. If the bonorable member for Angas will withdraw his amendment, If you I shall move my prior amendments, and then move to amend sub-paragraph i i . , as I stated.

The question, "" That clause 44 as amended be agreed to,"" was put to the Committee, and those voting with the "" noes "" took their places on this side of the chamber. There was no opportunity of hearing what you were saying. Every honourable member sitting on this side fully believed that we were proceeding to a division on clause 44, and it would be a denial of justice to the Opposition to allow this clause by misadventure to be passed without a division. 1 venture to say that no one on this side was aware that you had passed from clause 44 to other clauses. Some one has said that the call for a division was withdrawn. I could understand an honourable member, who had moved an amendment, withdrawing a call for a division upon it j but we were dealing with a clause in respect of which every honourable member had an interest and a right to demand a division. The great bulk of us were totally unaware of what was being done by you. We shall suffer a denial of justice unless you enable us, sir, to have our votes recorded on a clause on which we desired to divide. would like to explain that before we adjourned for dinner, it was agreed that we should have a division on clause 44. When the question was put, a few minutes ago, "" That the clause as amended be agreed to,"" seveiral honourable members of the Opposition cried, ""Divide."" I was amongst the number. I wished to go to a division, but at least five or six bonorable members on this side said that they did not. The result was that, although neither I nor any one else that I know of asked that the call for a division should be withdrawn, the Chairman himself, from what was said, thought that there was a withdrawal of the call. I do not think the question was properly put. have been taken one way or the other, but there was some confusion as to what really occurred after that point. In justice to the Chairman as well as to members on the other side, I must say that at least five members particularly asked the honourable member for Darling Downs and myself not to take a division on the question, although it had been arranged before the tea hour that there was to be a division. ting the question "" that the clause as amended stand part of the B ill , "" those on this side cried "" A y e , "" and the honourable member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Angas cried "" No,"" whereupon the Chairman directed that a division should be taken. The bells were rung, tlie honourable member for Balaclava and others came in, and went over near where the honourable member for Angas was sitting. I think the honourable member for Parramatta was also there or thereabouts. I said, "" I have amended the clause to suit you, and now you call for a division.""

It was caused by the disorder in the Committee. We ought to have some opportunity of testing the whole of the clauses that have since been put.

As a matter of fact, I do not believe that any harm would be done if the clause were altogether omitted, first because there is always a remedy against the estate, and, secondly, the remedy inures against the executors and administrators. There is no need for the clause except to accomplish something that is bad, namely, the apparent desire of the draftsman to impose a fine of treble the amount of the tax. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [8.32] -The suggestion of the honourable member creates a fensible distinction between the estate of a deceased person and the estate of a living one. We cannot convict a dead man of having wilfully done anything; and, therefore, the words at the head of the clause, ""whether intentionally or not,"" seem very appropriate to the circumstances. The honourable member says that the estate ought not to be taxed to treble the amount of the difference, which is one of the penalties set forth in clause 65. If the honourable member will allow me to consider the matter and see how far we can safely go, I shall do so in the light of his lemarks. -Paragraph d provides that no lapse of time shall prevent the operation of the clause. It will be impossible for trustees to wind up estates in land unless there is some means of obtaining a certificate from the Commissioner that he has no claim. If the trustees distribute an estate with the formed part of a trust estate, or any other chance of a charge of this kind, they will be liable either to the Crown or to the beneficiaries. tainly ought to be limit of time of, say, one or two years. Under the State Act of Victoria, trustees, before they proceed to distribute, must advertise in certain newspapers and in the Government Gazette that on and after a certain date they are going to do so; and in this clause there is no provision to protect them in any way. Uncler the circumstances, I do not know how trustees are to close an estate in land, because, it may be, ten years afterwards the question could arise whether in any preceding year the estate had been undervalued. speaking of the liability of the trustees, or of the liability of persons who buy the trust estate? charge on the land, then the people who buy are in a difficulty; but what I am pointing out is that the trustees, unless they have a certificate, will not be able to distribute an estate, seeing that before doing so they have to satisfy all claims. A charge should only be on the land until it is parted with, because a purchaser will have to ask if there is any charge on it, and no trustee can prove that there has not been undervaluation, and great difficulty will thereby be caused in conveyancing. Unless some alteration is made in the clause, there will be much complication without any special good resulting. The Commissioner should be able to determine within twelve months whether land has been properly valued. Prime Minister ancl Attorney-General) [8.41] -B y way of reply to the honourable member for Balaclava, let me say that, so far as a trustee is concerned, once an estate has been distributed, his liability ceases. As for those who acquire trust estates, it is proposed to amend clause 52 in a way which will meet their case -The clause contains the proviso that no charge for land tax shall be of effect as against a bond fide purchaser for value who, at the time of purchase made due inquiry, but had no notice of the liability. I propose to amend the clause by adding a further proviso to the effect that persons shall be deemed to have made clue inquiry who have made inquiry of the Commissioner. The man who buys bond fide and for value land which has land, will not, if he has made due inquiry, that is, inquiry of the Commissioner as There cerprescribed, be liable for the tax. The tax is a charge in rem, and not in personam, and therefore a trustee's liability will be extinguished once he has got rid of the trust estate. If a man sells land, and after his death it is discovered that he evaded taxation in regard to it, will the estate in the hands of his executors, supposing it is wholly personality, be liable? ber will look at clauses 44 to 49 he will see that the tax is a debt, and recoverable as such. satisfied that he has power, in a measure of this kind, to create a charge on the personal estate left by a man who evaded",44,Johnson I Mr Vv Elliot Johnson An D

(2.) Where the Commissioner thinks it advisable to register the charge, he may lodge with the Registrar-General or Registrar of Titles or other proper officer of the State or part of the Commonwealth in which the land is situated a certificate under his hand describing the land charged, and stating that there are arrears of land tax payable in respect thereof; and the Registrar or other proper officer shall register it in the register and as nearly as may be in the manner in which dealings with land are registered, and shall deal with and give effect to the certificate as if it were an instrument of charge or incumbrance duly executed under the laws in force in that State or part of the Commonwealth. Prime Minister, and Attorney-General) [8.57] -This clause declares that the tax is to be a first charge upon the land taxed; that it is to have priority over all other encumbrances, and that, notwithstanding any disposition of the land, it shall continue to be liable, in the hands of any purchaser, for the payment of the tax, so long as that tax remains unpaid. The proviso exempts a bond fide purchaser for value who, at the time of purchase, makes due inquiry, but has no notice of liability. -That, in substance, repeats the terms of the Real Property Act of New South Wales; but a doubt arises as to what is "" due inquiry."" The honourable member for Gippsland has given notice of an amendment dealing with the point, and the honourable member for Angas has also done so. I shall ask the Committee to agree to the clause with a further amendment providingThat the following words be added"" Provided further that a purchaser shall be deemed to have made due inquiry who has made inquiry of the Commissioner as prescribed."" That, I think,will meet the case fully; and no bond fide purchaser need be in any doubt as to his liability for unpaid land tax. In substance, I think the amendment will achieve the object at which the honourable member for Gippsland aims; and I ask the Committee to accept it. given notice of a prior amendment which, I think, ought to be inserted. I propose to move That after the word "" liability"" at the end of the proviso, as printed, the words "" or after the expiration of six months from the date on which the tax became due and payable, unless registered under sub-section 2 of this section,"" be inserted. The effect of my amendment would be that, unless the Commissioner, six months after the tax became payable, and, consequently, a charge upon the land, registered that charge in the State in which the land was situated, the charge would not remain. That would overcome the difficulty pointed out by the honourable member for Balaclava. We are dealing with Federal conditions, and it would be rather hard on a person selling land in a distant State to be obliged to write to the Department at the Seat of Government to ascertain what charges under the Land Tax Assessment Act remained unpaid. We have one of the most expeditious systems of land transfer in the world, and we ought not to impose any obstacle to the prompt transfer of property. I pointed out to an English visitor within the last twenty-four hours that a big transaction in real estate might be settled here, and the transfer given, within two hours, as long as the parties could get to the Registrar's office and ascertain whether there were any registered charges or notices of trusts. If a man happened to be transferring land in Western Australia, and had to write to the Seat of Government to obtain information as to the non-payment of land taxation, there might be a delay of a month in obtaining a transfer, and I think that such an amendment as I have stated should be accepted. In the next sub-clause it is provided that the Commissioner may register such a charge; and that shows that it is considered that it will be possible for him to make the necessary arrangements to have it registered. I do not feel strongly on this question, but I think that such an amendment as I have indicated would meet the wishes of the Committee. My object is to see that land transactions are not delayed owing to unregistered charges of the Government resting upon property. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [9.6] An amendment has just occurred to me in consequence of a suggestion made by the honourable member for Balaclava. It illustrates one of the many difficulties that arise in connection with legislation of this kind. This clause purports to impose the land tax as a first charge upon the land, in priority to all other encumbrances. In some of the State Acts various charges are made a first charge upon the land.

292,I T Would Be A Law Mr Hughes,"Does the honourable memMr W. H . IRVINE -Surely the Attoiney-General understands the position clearly. A piece of land may have as many encumbrances on it as you like. So long as they are made by the owner in favour of private individuals, this Parliament can impose a land tax as a first charge or. the land in priority to any or all of tbem, but this Parliament, has no power to impose a land tax or anything else as a first charge in priority to a legally established first charge to a State, which is the State's property.' Take an extreme case. Suppose that the charge in favour of the State was so great as to absorb the value of the land. Then that land in reality belongs to the State, and we are attempting verbally to say that we put a first charge, on that land ir priority to the charge of the State, which law subject to that charge. Does the honwe have no power to do. .1.1 we attempt to make our tax a first charge in priority to all other encumbrances, w.e-ought at least to prevent the clause being altogether unconstitutional by making it subject to that to which if must be subject-namely , the existing, property of the State in that land. quently decided to take all the value of the property, it would leave the Commonwealth none at all. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The Parliament of a State may, subsequently to the passing of this Act, create a first charge, in the exercise of its legislative authority, for any purpose it likes in favour of itself. If a property will a difficulty arise. it does so, it exercises the same function as if it took a portion or the whole of that land, compulsorily. The land becomes its property. We can, however, make a law saying that, until the State has made any land its property, and has therefore taken it out of the domain that we can touch, we impose a charge upon the land. posed a land tax, and made it a first charge, we could not enforce ours at all ? Mr W. H . IRVINE -Not to take priority of t^e State's charge. We could give it priority over any other encumbrance. We cannot make any law to deprive a State of property it has acquired. For instance, large advances have been made fiom the Treasury of Victoria to municipalities for distribution amongst farmers with a view to buying wire netting. That is a debt due to the Crown, collected by the municipalities, and paid to the Crown, and the law under which the money was advanced made the amount advanced to each farmer a first charge upon his land. That first charge is practically a first mortgage belonging to the State.. It is a part of the property of the State, just as much as are the public buildings of Melbourne, which we cannot tax. If we purport now by a law to make this tax a charge, not only on the man's interest in the land, but on the State of Victoria's interest in the land, we are attempting something that manifestly we cannot do. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [9.23] -The honourable member's explanation of his amendment has not, I submit with all deference, advanced his position. He has simply said that, where under any State law there is a charge by the State against any lands, we ought to make our orable member say that we cannot make ours a first charge ? We say that ours shall be the first charge. Mr W. H . IRVINE -We cannot do it. we can. We'say we can. The honourable member wants us to amend our clause so as to make our charge subject to any existing charge to a State, created under the law of a State. First of all, we have a perfect right to create a first charge which will supersede the right of a State under any existing State law, and, secondly, I say that only in a case where the State has acted under its powers and actually seized Mr W. H . IRVINE -Ho w does possession make any difference? the State has seized the land-forfeite d it, and actually got it. Section 114 of the Constitution is as follows: A State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, raise or maintain any naval or military force, o j impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the Commonwealth, nor shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a State. The whole question is whether a right, which may be enforced on a happening of conditions, amounts to anything within the prohibition under section 114. If it does not, we have a perfect right to impose the charge; if it does, we have no right. The question is whether this charge comes within section 114, and, in my opinion, it does not. Mr W. H .

298,Mr Hughes,"The honourable mema difference between' a charge and a' tax. It is a question whether "" tax"" in the section means ""charge""; that is to. say, whether there is no real fundamental distinction between the imposition of a tax and the right to do something in furtherance of a penalty in reference to the collection of a tax. Surely that must be arguable? I submit, further, that if the honourable member be right, there is no necessity for the words he proposes, because the Constitution imposes the limitation, which must be read into the words of the clause as it stands. The proposed words are either a dangerous attempt to limit our powers, or they are superfluous; and in either case they cannot be accepted. looked into the question a little, and it strikes me that the well-known equitable principle applies, namely, that the first in time is the first in right. In the South Australian Act, it is provided that the tax shall be a first charge, but that cannot supersede any Federal charge that may be made prior, nor could any Commonwealth charge supersede, any charge payable to the Statei f the latter be first in time. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is not what the Attorney-Genera] said, but rather that the tax would take priority of State charges. . was the effect of the Attorney-General's argument. The Crown of the State and the Crown of the Commonwealth have equal rights in this matter, because, in the Excise case and in some American cases, it has been held that the powers of taxation are independent-in other words, that the States have independent powers and the Commonwealth has powers. We have, therefore, the Crown in two equal capacities; and the first exercise of the capacity is tlie first charge. I think that the view expressed by the honourable member for Angas .is the correct view. The State can act completely in its own jurisdiction, and the Commonwealth cannot limit or interfere with any valid exercise of its powers of taxation. has actually exercised the powers I think it is very likely that the honState, it can be created a charge on the land, and the Commonwealth. cannot interfere in any way with that charge when' once operative; on the other hand, if the Commonwealth, in the exercise of its powers of taxation, is in first, the State cannot limit, impede, or hinder that power in any way. As the clause stands, I think that is how the .Court would construe it ; and the honourable member for Flinders is simply saying in his amendment what we all agree is the law at tlie present time. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Except the Attorney-General. Attorney-General accepts that'view words suggested by the honourable member for Flinders were superfluous. its powers, and a charge has been created, the Attorney-General does not suggest that the Commonwealth can come in and take away that charge from tiie State? only arise where a State had actually exercised its powers. that before the Cornmonwealth charge came into existence, does the Attorney-General suggest that the Commonwealth can interfere ? desires to know whether the Commonwealth charge could supersede that of the State, when the latter has seized land, and I said that there was a difficulty; but I thought that it would not. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Supposing the State has not seized the land? seized the land, but simply declared that a charge shall exist, I regard that as an independent exercise of the power; and that really is the proposal in the Bill. that question under the Constitution. tion is lhat the Commonwealth and the State is each sovereign within its own jurisdiction; and the whole question is, which charge has been first created, for that is the one which will stand under the Constitution.

I am inclined, on consideration, to agree with the view of the honourable member for Angas and the honourable member for -Darling Downs; but I hope the Attorney General will admit that, in reference to the cost of wire-netting, advances to settlers, and so forth, we are not attempting to make a Federal charge in priority.

The production of such certificate so signed shall for all purposes whatsoever be deemed conclusive proof that at the date thereof no Land Tax or other moneys were due or payable uncler this Act other than those stated in such certificate in respect of such properly."" While the Attorney-General has resolved that inquiry may be made of the Commissioner, it will not be incumbent upon that officer to return an answer. In Victoria, rates are a charge on the property on which they are assessed, and it used to be the practice in connection with land transactions to inquire of the clerk of the municipality in which the land was situated what amount, if any, was owing on it in respect of rates. In one instance, the clerk stated that nothing was due when tbere was really a debt of some pounds, and two or three years later the municipality sought to recover the debt from the purchaser of the land, who had been misled by the clerk's reply to his inquiry. On the case going to thc Full Court, it was held that the clerk's certificate did not bind the municipality, and the purchaser of the land had to pay the rates. This was seen to be unjust, and the Local Government Act of 1903 contains a provision, of which my amendment is virtually a copy, requiring council clerks to reply to applications in writing, and the replies so given bind the municipalities. This provision seems to be a complement to the proviso just inserted by the Attorney-General. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) f°-5 ]-i cannot accept the amendment, z because the proviso just inserted does all that should be asked. We do not wish to deter persons from buying land by reason of the fact that they may thus be acquiring concealed liabilities; but as the clause now stands, a bond fide purchaser for value who. has made due inquiry will be in the same position as such a purchaser is in other respects under the Real Property Acts of New South Wales and Victoria, and the Torrens Act of South Australia. When such a man has made due inquiry, and has been informed that the land, which he wishes to purchase is not liable for taxation, he cannot subsequently be called upon to pay. think that the Attorney-General ought to accept tliis harmless necessary addition to the clause, which will be of great assistance to solicitors and others interested in the transfer of land. Without some such provision, it may be impossible to obtain a reply from the Commissioner, while the public may be kept waiting for months for replies, to the great hindrance of business. The acceptance of the amendment would not weaken the Bill, and would greatly assist all who have dealings in land. -Will it be necessary that all inquiries in respect to transactions in land coming within the scope of the Bill shall be addressed to Melbourne, or to rhe Seat of Government, before it can be known whether there is any tax due on such land ? If so, the settlement of land transactions in distant States will be unworkable, and the whole system will prove most cumbersome. Could not Deputy Commissioners or some other officers be appointed to furnish the information and give the necessary acquittance? would be done. The Commissioner may delegate such powers. be advisable to make provision for the appointment of a Deputy Commissioner in each State capital? Mr HuGHEs.'^-There is such a provision in the Bill. -The Attorney-General might well accept tbe amendment proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland. The new proviso proposed by the Attorney-General deals only with the position of the purchaser, who shall be deemed to have made "" due inquiry"" on his making inquiry of the Commissioner as prescribed. The honourable member for Gippsland suggests, however, that if provision were made for the giving of a certificate delay would be avoided. ficate amount tb? evidence that the tax had been paid, and would he produced by the vendor. chaser would be able to settle up at once.' out that under the clause as it stands the settlement-of a land transaction at Townsville might be delayed for three weeks if inquiry had to be made from the Deputy",51,Paiks

We might extend the clause to cover a class of case which arises chiefly through the operations of wills and settlements, where people will have to pay the whole tax, after paying out various annuities. The Attorney-General might try to relieve a man who has to pay all the tax in that way by giving him power to deduct a fair proportion of the tax from the moneys that a year. He is the legal owner, and liable ... ... ... 22 to pay the tax, but out of that £5,000 ... ... ... 27 he may have to pay £2,000 or £3,000 to different people in annuities. When he pays the tax, in addition to the annuities, his own income will probably have nearly -vanished.

The man responsible for the Smith, Laird tax, as the Bill now stands, would pay Spence, W. G. £1,593 5 i l d taxation. He has to Z S n a n Thomas, J. pay an annuity of £1,000 to A, and anWebster, W. other of £1,500 to B. £1,000 capitalized West, J.

The annuity of £1,500 capitalized in the same way represents £30,000, Johnson, W. J. which is one-fifth of the total improved Moloney, Parker value of the estate. One-fifth of Page, J. £1,500 is £300. Therefore, the man Fisher, A. who has to pay the full tax to the Bamford) F. W. Commonwealth would be entitled to Mahon, H . deduct from his payment of £1,000 to A Carr, E. S. the sum of £133 6s. 8d., and from his payRoberts, E. A. ment of £1,500 to B the sum of £300. The people in receipt of annuities ought to pay something towards the tax. It was never thought by many people, when making wills and settlements, that the man to whom the property was left, subject to annuities, would have to contend with anything like this. There will be many cases in Australia, where, after the annuities are paid, as they must be, and the land tax is paid, the owner of the land will have nothing left. My amendment will not interfere with any principle in the Bill; it will do justice; and I hope the Attorney General will give it favorable consideration.

I should say that a penalty of £ 5 a day would be quite sufficient. penalty. as if we were going to extremes in making this an absolutely penal measure; and I ask the Attorney-General to consider the matter. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [to.35] -The New Zealand Act provides for a precisely similar penalty. opposite seem to think that the tax, and everything connected with it, are too much; but I point out that, according,to the Acts Interpretation Act, the clause means that tbe penalty shall not exceed £50-it may be anything less. I may add that there is a similar provision also in the New South Wales Act. We are dealing with"" powerful companies, and we require pecuniary penalties sufficiently high to deter them from wrong-doing. [10.37] I remember a case in Victoria in which a company, registered in New South Wales, opened a small office in Melbourne, and, under a similar law, was sued for and mulcted in penalties amounting to more than the whole of the assets of the company. If I remember rightly, that took place under an Act which provided that all advertisements in connection with companies must set out the amount of the paid-up capital; and, there being an omission, an informer sued and recovered the penalty of £ 1 0 a day, with the result that the company, through a sheer mistake, was completely ruined. Act provides a penalty for such an omission. parently was not known to the company. These offences are very small, ancl may arise from pure accident. The question was raised on a Bill recently before us, and a number of honourable members exDressed a [148] doubt as-to whether, when a fixed penalty is mentioned as in this case, it has not to be enforced. A limit of £ 1 0 a day would, days, such a fine would have amounted to £1,000, and not much harm would be done if the company omitted to register for that period. It must be remembered that the general public knows little of what we are enacting, not one man in a hundred reading our legislation. SinceI left the State Parliament, I seldom read the measures submitted to it, or even the reports of its proceedings, and it is hardly likely that many members of the general public follow our proceedings very closely.

354,Mr Agar Wynne,"Then, tliat apClause 59 Every contract agreement or arrangement made or entered into, in writing or verbally, shall so far as it has or purports to have the purpose or effect of in any way, directly or indirectly, (a) altering the incidence of any land tax; or (b) relieving any person from liability to pay any land tax or making any return ; or (c) defeating evading or avoiding any duty or liability imposed on any person by this Act; or (d) preventing the operation of this Act in any respect, be absolutely void, but without prejudice to its validity in any other respect or for any other purpose. Amendment posedThat after the word "" verbally,"" line 2, the words "" whether before or after the commencement of this Act "" be inserted. cases where tenants have agreed to pay all rates, taxes, and charges whatsoever, the agreement shall be null and void so far as taxation proposed by the Bill is concerned ? clause is more important than seems to. be realized. Only yesterday my attention was drawn to it by a firm of solicitors, who said that it would very much hamper operations in regard to the development of certain mining leases in South Australia. Under the law of that State, an apportionment is provided, for where a lessee has seven years of his term to run; but future leases are left to the usual operation of the law of contract. My impression is that the High Court will have something to say about this provision, which does not seem ancillary to the purposes of the measure'. Of course, where a leasehold has a sale value, it will be taxable. The provision may be constitutional regarding existing leases, but I doubt whether it can be made to apply to future leases. As the Opposition is willing to facilitate the consideration of the remaining clauses to-morrow, nothing will be lost by reporting progress now. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) {10.54] -The clause must be read inconjunction with clauses 26A and 26B', of which the former takes out of the operation of the measure all Crown leases other and leases giving the right to purchase. Clause 26B deals specifically with the liability of lessees, both before and after the Act. Clause 59, with which we are now dealing, relates to all other attempts to evade the Act, and whatever they may be, they are not necessarily those to which the honourable member for Darling Downs has referred. They seem to be covered by clause 26BJ and, in so far as they are not, this clause will apply. The clause intends, as far as possible, to place the incidence of the tax on the person who ought properly to pay it, and will not permit of any evasion, nor of any attempt to evade. [10.58] I think that this clause goes, a great deal further than the Attorneyit will be retrospective and may, so to speak, rip up numerous contracts for the sale of land that have already been entered into. A person who has subdivided and sold part of his land will have altered the incidence of the tax, and the mere fact of his having done so before the passing of this Bill will make the contracts of sale absolutely void. We are going to give people opportunities to cancel contracts already entered into, and are making it an offence to enter into contracts that will vary the incidence of this measure before it actually comes into force. Surely it was never intended that we should pass retrospective legislation by which contracts in existence shall be declared void as between the parties who have legally' entered into them with their eyes open. They are to be void if they interfere in any way with the incidence of the land tax, or relieve any person of liability to pay the tax, or to make a return under this Bill. Any one who cuts up an estate, and sells part of it, will be relieved of certain liabilities under this B ill ; and all contracts entered into for the sale of that land can be voided. I do not think that the Attorney-General intended that that should be the effect of his amendment. Parliament, as a rule, is strongly averse to retrospective legislation, and I suggest that the Attorney-General should leave the clause as' originally drafted. Any contract entered into before the passing of the Bill should be legal; but the clause cannot be made too strong to deal with any person who enters into a contract after the passing of the Bill, with a view to altering the incidence of the tax, or of attempting to evade it. The than perpetual leases, clause, as proposed to be amended, will go further than any legislation of the kind of which I know.",56,Fairs
