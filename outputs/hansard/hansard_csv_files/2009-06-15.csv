Well done, Herb. Question agreed to. House adjourned at 9.59 pm Monday, 15 June 2009 ----Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 May, on motion by Mr Snowdon: That this bill be now read a second time. Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009, notwithstanding some amendments we will seek to move with respect to parliamentary oversight. It is an important move forward for Defence to provide the standing military with an opportunity to provide ex gratia payments in the event of death or property and the destruction thereof. It is important to understand that defence, in combat operations, is operating in an ambiguous environment across land, sea and air, in conditions generally not of our choosing, on ground we did not select and operating more and more frequently in urban environments with highly technical gear. Whilst with a greater degree of precision in munitions and firepower, inevitably in all wars unfortunate civilian casualties occur. Whilst our Defence Force has made, and will continue to make, every effort to ensure that non-battle casualties are at best zero or at worse extremely minor, the harsh and brutal reality of combat operations is that fighting in difficult conditions, in difficult terrain, in unseasonable weather and against an enemy that at times is unidentifiable makes it extremely difficult. In such an environment, for a bill to come forward that provides a quick and easy manner for a battlefield commander to approve an ex gratia payment on the ground is most welcome. Whilst the death or, indeed, the destruction of property is unfortunate, for a commander to quickly and simply negotiate the issue, to achieve an agreed solution with communities and to exact payment on the ground within days or, indeed, hours will go a great way to ensuring strong relationships are built between Defence Force personnel and those in whose country we serve. Presently the situation in the event of a civilian death, a non-battle casualty or the destruction of property may require an appropriation to Defence Force headquarters or perhaps even to parliament that can take weeks and, indeed, months, and during that intervening period the ability to build a relationship with the people of that community or that nation is substantially and, in many cases, irreparably damaged while the waiting process goes on. If a field commander of appropriate rank could approve a payment on the spot that allows reparations to be made at whatever the going rate in the community is, it will allow our Defence Force to build those bridges, to acknowledge wrong, to compensate at the appropriate rate and level as is culturally applicable, and to move on. In that respect the bill is strongly supported. What is needed of course is a strong accountability process and an ability to understand exactly what is occurring on the field; hence, the amendments to be moved by the coalition on reporting to an appropriate committee such as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security or the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. There is also room, and I acknowledge the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, to widen the legislation at some particular time.

171,Mr Robert (Fadden) (4.06 Pm),"I rise to make some brief comments on the Defenceligence and security and look at exactly how we can widen the ability for payments to be made by field commanders on the ground to achieve a whole range of outcomes-not just in the ex gratia component of a compensatory nature, but also in other areas where intelligence and security works. With that, considering the parliamentary secretary and I both served operationally overseas, and we both know exactly where dollars and cents could be used by field commanders on the ground, I will leave it stated. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (4.10 pm)-It is a great pleasure to speak on this bill, and I acknowledge the words of my colleague the member for Fadden; he makes some very valid points. Certainly we have seen this sort of degree of discretion available amongst our colleagues in coalition environments such as the United States forces, who have what is known as the CERP funds available to them-the Commanders Emergency Response Program funds-which have been used to great effect in many operational environments. This legislation, for the tactical payments scheme and the defence homeowners assistance scheme, is vital for the two operational reasons of (1) dealing with our operational situation and enhancing our ability to operate in more difficult environments where there is no host nation authority available and (2) as an incentive towards retention and recruitment in the Australian Defence Force. The tactical payment scheme is a defence-specific discretionary mechanism, which will be managed solely by Defence. This does not preclude Defence from having the option to use the existing act of grace provisions in the Financial Management and Accountability Act, but it does give the minister the power to authorise payments to a person who is not an Australian citizen who may suffer loss, damage or injury outside of Australia because of an incident that occurs in the course of the operations of the ADF, and the minister considers it appropriate. It acknowledges that in many cases and in many areas where the ADF operates, financial compensation for collateral damage to property or for injury or loss of life is often a common expectation of local cultures. In this respect, I claim some parentage in relation to this scheme in that the very first implementation of some sort of operational payments occurred in the context of Somalia, when the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, was deployed to the area of the Bay province. I was very pleased to institute a tactical field payment system that relied upon the act of grace payments framework at that time. But it is interesting to refer to that experience to understand why this mechanism is so important. My colleague the member for Fadden referred to those difficult operational environments akin to either counterinsurgency or stabilisation operations, also very similar to many peace operations contexts, where we have a situation where a host nation authority is non-existent or is completely broken down, where the threat elements that you have to deal with may not be readily distinguishable from the civilian population and where the day-to-day operations of the troops may cause some incidental damage and disruption to civilian life. In Somalia that was the situation that applied. Quite often when we are dealing with the deployment of our troops to foreign environments in a normal context, we will have perhaps a status of forces agreement framework within which compensation arrangements can be managed. Of course that is not the case when the mechanisms of the state have completely broken down. It is very important for deployed forces to show respect for the host nation culture that we operate in. It is very important that we take their complaints seriously, that we deal with them MAIN COMMITTEE as human beings. It is very important to do that to maintain the relationship between the deployed forces and the community. It also helps to build the support of that community in relation to the threat elements that we are dealing with. So there is a very real and practical purpose in an operational sense in instituting these measures, as well as the moral imperative of dealing with the compensation required for any damage that the force might cause. In Somalia we introduced a system whereby we had a complaints day, if you like, where any person who had a complaint or had suffered some damage as a consequence of the activities of the ADF could come forward to me and register their complaint. We issued the soldiers with field cards. They could hand these out to members of the civilian population who were aggrieved. The civilians could complete those cards and bring them forward to the complaints day. The soldiers would retain one stub of that so that the complaint could be investigated fully, appropriate compensation settled on and then the compensation paid. It is interesting, though, that cultural circumstances do vary from time to time and some flexibility is required. In almost every operational environment that I have been deployed in there was some form of traditional dispute mechanism. In Somalia this was known as the ‘dia’. The death of an individual within a tribe would be compensated with camels. If a male died it would be 100 camels that you had to compensate the tribe with; if a female died it was 50 camels. Unfortunately, there is a degree of inbuilt gender bias there but that was the cultural system. We did not have camels to deal with the community. There was some thoughtas a joke-to maybe ship them over in Tobruk, but what we did was work out the dollar value of a camel. On the basis of about US$100 per camel we worked out that compensation for any accidental death caused would be about US$10,000. We did have a situation where that did arise. In general terms we would always deal with situations where damage to property occurred; for example, where APCs accidentally knocked over walls et cetera. These payments had to be administered through a fairly cumbersome process relating back through financial processes to Australia, which led to significant delays. In this sort of environment the quicker you can operate the less angst and grief you will cause. Somalia was not alone in having this sort of cultural dispute resolution mechanism. In Timor there is the ‘adat’ system. You will see similar versions of this in Iraq, for example, where they have the ‘urf’ system and in Rwanda the ‘gacaca’ system. There are many versions of these tribal systems of compensation that you will encounter in many different environments so it is a very welcome additional tool to the golf bag that the commander will bring to bear in these very complex environments to help smooth the way of our forces. Our experience has shown that the administrative requirements involved in making these payments as act of grace claims makes that system unsuitable for use in operational environments. The new system will allow for small, expeditious capped payments to be made in operations overseas and that will operate independently of the act of grace system. It will be managed and operated by Defence. The payments will be capped at levels set by government, taking into account a number of factors including, as I have mentioned, the prevailing culture and society within the area. Recognition of such customs is vital in building our relationships with local communities. The small delays in making payments can have a negative impact on those relations and this has had a great deal of bearing on the shaping of this legislation. MAIN COMMITTEE The TPS will operate independently of the act of grace payment provisions. Currently payments of this nature can only be made by the government under the act of grace provisions in the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Defence may, of course, continue to have recourse to act of grace provisions, particularly where these amounts are large in nature. The TPS scheme will not necessarily preclude any further legal action that an individual might take in relation to actions of the ADF. One caveat will be that the TPS payments cannot be made more than 12 months after the relevant incident. So there will be a time limitation factor involved there. The Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme that is also before us today is a scheme that I wholeheartedly welcome as well. This is a measure that was specifically designed and directed to deal with our recruitment and retention situation. As we know, the Defence Force has faced a significant challenge in recent times in relation to a very tight labour market, particularly in the area of our skilled Defence Force personnel, many of whom were drawn away to the mining industry. Something definitely had to be done in that respect. Now, of course, with the release of the white paper and the ambitious targets that have been set in relation to recruitment and the size of the Defence Force we require out to 2030, it will be important to implement measures along these lines. I know from my contact with Defence personnel that this is a measure that was eagerly awaited, and lots of decisions about future career and separation from the Defence Force were put on hold pending the outcomes of the introduction of this legislation. Not only members of the regular forces but also those who render regular and committed service in the reserves will be supported and encouraged by this legislation. Introduced on 1 July 2008 as an initiative designed to improve that situation, the legislation provides for the payment of a subsidy on home loan interest for members and former members of the Defence Force. It encourages retention, as the scheme offers an incentive to members by rewarding them with increased assistance as a member passes specified career points. So there are aspects of this which relate to the amount of time that a member serves in a particular service, perhaps in active service or warlike operations overseas. The legislation recognises that due to the nature of their careers defence families and members may find it difficult to purchase a home. This is a very significant point. We often have the situation these days that for a person to purchase a home it is essential that both partners work. But it is a regular requirement for our Defence Force personnel that they be moved around the country. In my own case that meant the sacrifice for my wife of her career, and you quite often become dependent on the single wage of the defence spouse. This is a significantly limiting factor in the ability of a Defence Force member to purchase a home. So this is only an equitable measure that we are taking for Defence Force personnel in distinction to the general community. Since being introduced, the scheme’s administrator, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, has issued 11,255 subsidy certificates to eligible ADF members and 5,197 have commenced receipt of the subsidy assistance. So it shows a very significant take-up of the scheme. The changes to the scheme will also remove the unintended windfall gain in the eligibility and entitlement of members who rejoined the ADF after a break in service prior to 1 July 2008 and will ensure members who rejoined the ADF prior to 1 July 2008 are provided with the same eligibility and entitlement as those who rejoined after that date. ADF service performed MAIN COMMITTEE before a break in service of greater than five years is not considered to be effective service for the purpose of calculation of a member’s eligibility or entitlement. A break in service of not more than two years for members rejoining the reserves and not more than five years for members rejoining the permanent forces does not affect the member’s eligibility or service credit. The bill also ensures that only those members who are buying a home for the first time while a member of the ADF have access to the subsidy lump sum payment option. This legislation represents the continuing concern that this government has for the welfare of our Australian Defence Force personnel. There is no higher priority for us. There is no issue that is higher on our agenda. This government is introducing a raft of measures to ensure the welfare of our Defence Force personnel, bearing in mind the old homily we use in the Defence Force that you recruit the soldier, sailor and airman but you retain the family. It is when a member achieves that position in his or her career, where there has been quite an investment of training and a lot of dollars spent to create a skilled and professional member, that the issue starts to arise about their continued service in the ADF once they have acquired a spouse and family. We have to make sure we target that decision-making period in a defence member’s life to ensure that we can hang on to that wonderful experience and professionalism. We have to be more flexible in their career design so that they can move in and out of reserve or permanent force service and bring back to us the civilian experience they have and perhaps find other creative ways to share their experience with industry but also make sure that when they render service, particularly in remote locations, we can provide them with the support they need in other areas, such as in health et cetera. Added to the measures that we have debated here today, we will now be moving forward to the health test which is being rolled out in remote regions such as in Karratha and Tindal and across the north and, moving into phase 2, we will see that expanded to Townsville and Puckapunyal and other locations such as Darwin. Thousands of Defence personnel will benefit from those health support measures which will make sure that families of defence members will have access to free medical health. There are a raft of issues that we are aware of. We are implementing policies to make sure that we do retain our professional and experienced personnel. We owe them that much. Those in the Defence Force have arduous careers. A lot of people focus on the hazards and the casualties that occur in operations overseas, but extreme endurance is required just to get to the point where you are able to be deployed. Acquiring those skills and surviving the training is quite a hazardous experience. It is well and truly above what a normal member of the community may be expected to experience or endure during their careers. These are measures that I believe we owe to our defence members. They are measures that we need to implement to make sure that a career in the Defence Force is the career of choice for Australian citizens. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (4.26 pm)-The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009 is welcome recognition-although it is very belated-of the changing nature of warfare. In the first half of the century since Federation we were involved in four major conflicts. There was the Anglo-Boer War, also known as the second Boer war, in addition to World War I, World War II and Korea. Those conflicts were essentially conventional in nature. They involved nation state against nation state and there were clearly codified rules of conduct with the warfare. In addition, peace treaties drawn up after the war were very conventional in form. MAIN COMMITTEE Subsequent to Korea, we have been involved in Vietnam, Iran, Afghanistan and a whole host of other what you could call brush fire wars. They certainly have not been conventional in nature. Indeed, the understanding of the conflict by the combatants is not the same as has been conventionally understood. Therefore, it is very necessary that there be some flexibility built into the system to ensure that-to use the terminology-we win the hearts and minds of the people we are at war with in addition to actually physically winning the military conflict. In these sorts of conflicts it is always the so-called peace that comes afterwards that is highly problematic. In these situations we have to recognise the fact that things have changed. We are operating in different areas where there are different cultural niceties and sensitivities to observe. This is something we have not conventionally done. We have been very codified in the way that we do things. It is time for some flexibility to be built in. This is precisely what this legislation seeks to address. It allows payments to be made to families of people who have been killed, or otherwise reparations for damages or injury to be made, by an officer at lieutenant colonel rank or above or APS6 or higher. This is extremely welcome, but we believe there needs to be an accountability step included in this legislation. In our view, there needs to be reporting to a parliamentary committee or an oversight committee. Obviously, many of these payments will be sensitive in nature and you would not want those to be made public, but there should be that accountability step where parliament assesses not the legality but the ethics and morality associated with payments. The other aspect of this bill that has been covered very ably by the parliamentary secretary concerned is defence homeownership. As he correctly stated, there are huge problems with defence personnel having to be shifted from different locations around the country. It is very appropriate that some assistance is provided for this. However, this bill removes the unintended windfall gain of members of the ADF who left the service prior to 1 July 2008 and have subsequently rejoined, effectively stopping the second bite of the cherry. It also ensures that only serving members purchasing a home for the first time have access to a lump sum payment. In summary, I and the opposition support the bill, both the tactical payment scheme and the defence homeownership provisions. However, with the tactical payment scheme it is our view that a further amendment needs to be put in, looking at aspects of parliamentary oversight. ister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change) (4.31 pm)-The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009 makes amendments for two separate measures. I will refer to them in summing up the debate. The first measure introduces a new part into the Defence Act 1903 to allow for a tactical payment scheme which will provide an efficient and effective means for making expeditious, no liability payments to persons who suffer damage, injury or loss due to ADF activities abroad. This is a very important amendment which is a direct response to Australian Defence Force operational experience, particularly, in recent years, in Iraq and Afghanistan. I would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the debate. I also thank the honourable member for Lyne because he put forward a number of questions relating to the current act of grace scheme and why that scheme does not meet the needs of operational matters for defence. It highlighted recent experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan which have shown that the MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009
172,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Mincurrent administrative requirements involved in making act of grace payments do not enable timely and responsive payments to deserving individuals. While Defence and the Department of Finance and Deregulation have developed, over a period of time, a close working arrangement to enable timely payments, the turnaround time is still at least three to five days. As locals have an expectation of immediate financial recompense for damage or for injury, any delay runs the risk of causing ill feeling. This in turn may affect the ability of the ADF to win the hearts and minds of the local communities in which they are deployed. Respect for, and recognition of, local customs is vital for building relationships with these communities. In turn, it enhances the safety and security of our deployed ADF personnel to make such timely payments. As the members for Paterson and Herbert also made clear, it is critically important to empower our people on the ground to be able to take immediate action. The tactical payment scheme allows our deployed personnel to address such instances in very rapid time. The tactical payment scheme has been developed in close consultation with the Department of Finance and Deregulation as well to ensure that it meets the needs of Defence and the relevant financial transparency and accountability requirements. To allay concerns raised in the debate over the reporting requirements and accountability of the tactical payment scheme, I can inform the chamber that the tactical payment scheme will be bound by strict and transparent parameters. Although the bill does not explicitly outline reporting, this does not mean that there are no provisions for accountability and reporting. While there is no specific mention in the bill, the effect of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 is that there is an obligation to report in the Defence annual report. This is similar to other equivalent schemes, such as act of grace payments and special circumstances payments made under section 73 of the Public Service Act 1999. To put this issue beyond any doubt, my predecessor in the portfolio, Minister Snowdon, wrote to Minister Tanner, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, who has agreed to amend the finance minister’s order to explicitly recognise Defence’s obligation to report on the tactical payments scheme in the Defence annual report. The report will identify by operation the total amount paid for casualties and for other damage. The tactical payments scheme may also be subject to audit by the Australian National Audit Office. All payments made in theatre will be recorded at the time of payment, in accordance with guidance provided by Headquarters Joint Operations Command. Specific details of payments under the tactical payments scheme will not be made public for reasons of privacy and operational security: firstly, disclosure may be dangerous to the safety of the recipients and compromise their privacy and, secondly, Defence is obliged to avoid disclosure of operationally sensitive information, particularly where that could endanger the security of deployed personnel. I would also like to confirm that there will be no additional financial impact for this legislation because the tactical payments scheme will cover the payments that in the past have been made by other means, particularly through the act of grace mechanism, which are Defence portfolio funded. In sum, the tactical payments scheme we believe is an overdue initiative to allow small expeditious payments to be made to locals adversely affected during ADF operations overseas. The scheme will be bound by strict transparency, accountability and reporting MAIN COMMITTEE procedures. Equally as important, it will allow Defence to remain respectful of individuals’ right to privacy and the need to protect them from being targeted by enemy forces. There have also been some contributions made by many speakers on the second amendment, which relates to the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Act 2008, which provides the legislative basis for the operation of the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme itself. The Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme commenced on 1 July 2008, but a number of unintended outcomes, inconsistent with the initial policy intent, subsequently became apparent. I think a number of the speakers, including the member for Tangney, made reference to this. The bill addresses these issues, ensuring the scheme is consistent with the initial policy intent. Finally, I thank all the contributors to the debate on this amendment bill and commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Cognate bills: Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 June, on motion by Mr Swan: That this bill be now read a second time. Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (4.38 pm)-I rise in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20092010 and cognate bills before the chamber. Although the main purpose of the bills before the House is to propose appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to do with the 200910 budget, I believe the titles of the bills and explanatory memorandums do not do justice to what the 2009-10 budget delivered by the Treasurer will actually achieve for this country. With the unemployment rate forecast to reach a peak of 8½ per cent during 2010-11, with a write-down of $210 billion from the government revenue, the only thing that a responsible government could do is bring down a budget to deal with major investments in jobs now and infrastructure in the long term. Of course, the initiatives outlined in the 2009-10 budget built on the Rudd Labor government’s stimulus package, which was announced late last year, that saw payments going to many people in need in the community. It delivered stimulus payments before the Christmas period, at a time when countries were under real pressures as a result of the global economic crisis-not the worse of it then but certainly a significant decline had occurred by then. This federal government took very early action in pre-empting the decline in private investment. It saw the need for expenditure to be occurring in the community to support business. That stimulus package back in December 2008 provided stimulus for a very large sector in the electorate of Petrie-that is, the retail sector. We have seen figures in recent times that show that what we have experienced in Australia is extraordinary compared to what many of MAIN COMMITTEE the developed countries around the world have seen in retail. This country is experiencing growth where other countries are experiencing significant decline. No-one on any side of this House can deny that growth in the retail sector supports jobs. You cannot support jobs if you have rapidly declining growth in the retail sector. In addition, this government announced the nation-building package back in February of this year. That built on the stimulus package and started putting initiatives in place, investment in infrastructure in the short term, that saw jobs being supported locally. In my electorate of Petrie, 34 schools have already been successful in rounds 1 and 2 for Pride funding. They are doing work such as painting of classrooms, carpeting, buying new furniture, putting in electronic whiteboards, building covered walkways and building shade areas over playgrounds. This is no doubt going to stimulate local jobs. It is going to support manufacturing. It is going to support businesses who provide the materials, who provide the furniture and who provide the whiteboards in my local area. Those businesses consequently will be able to retain people in employment. But also, in talking about all these initiatives, we should not lose sight of the long-term benefits for schools in all this. I know some may hold the view that building halls and libraries, repainting classrooms, putting new carpet on floors and getting new furniture does not necessarily support furthering a child’s education. I say to all of those people: go into those schools and talk to the principals, the teachers and, more importantly, the parents and the students who are benefiting from those changes in their schools. It changes the attitude of children when they go into a new classroom that is a fresh and vibrant place. It helps children learn. No-one can tell me that sitting in a hall to have assemblies, concerts or graduation ceremonies does not put pride in a school and in its students compared to sitting on asphalt in the middle of winter or summer under a small covered area next to toilet blocks, which is what some of the schools in my electorate experience. I know one particular school that has to cancel the school parade every three or four weeks simply due to rain because the children are exposed to all of the elements by the current structure of the school. This school is very excited at the thought of having a school hall, which is something that they thought was never going to happen. That school is also getting an extension to the library and, with their Pride funding, doing many important refurbishments. Other schools are talking to me about how many electronic whiteboards they will have and that they will have enough to go around all of their classrooms because of previous investments that the schools have made in that technology. These are some of the initiatives that this budget builds on. In my electorate we also have new social housing units going in. We have many social housing homes and units that are being repaired so that they can become available for people in the area of Petrie. I think one of the most important things that has come out of the 2009-10 budget by the Rudd Labor government has to be the investment in major infrastructure in this country. We have seen as a consequence of the two previous initiatives, the stimulus package and nation building, and importantly as a result of this budget the most significant investment in infrastructure that this country has seen in decades. Without the government’s action the level of GDP would have been 2¾ per cent lower in 2009-10 and 1½ per cent lower in 2010-11. We cannot ignore these figures. Government action is expected to support up to 210,000 jobs and without action the forecast for the unemMAIN COMMITTEE ployment rate would reach 10 per cent. These may just sound like figures but in my electorate, my areas, my suburbs, that figure is certainly significant. With areas of my electorate already experiencing high youth unemployment before the global economic crisis we have to do everything possible to ensure that we support jobs and that is what this budget clearly does. I commend this government for their $8½ billion investment in our roads, rail and ports. I know I have spoken in this House previously about my commitment to support initiatives such as a Redcliffe rail line-something that has been rallied for for many years in my electorate. The elected representatives in the area-state, council and federal-all support the need for a rail line. Although we will continue to have that fight, it is important that I recognise and put on the record my support that this budget is committed to improving the metro rail network in Brisbane. Irrespective of a Redcliffe rail line, if we do not improve the rail network in our CBD area we will struggle to cope with the demand for the public system. It would be extremely difficult for the state government to put on any additional trains or services until such time as major investment is done in the CBD area. I see investing in our CBD area as a step forward for the proposal to eventually get a Redcliffe rail line. Improving the central public rail network consequently sets a framework to expand the rail networks out in the metropolitan areas. In relation to the commitment on clean energy, with Moreton Bay as the backyard to my electorate, it is true to say that many of my constituents understand the importance of addressing climate change. They were extremely pleased when this government signed the Kyoto protocol. We are doing what we can to pursue the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and, at the same time, investing in clean energy. Importantly, in this budget, this government has invested $4½ billion in the Clean Energy Initiative, not only to assist Australia’s transition to a low-pollution economy but also, equally, to help build the jobs for the future by investing $2 billion over the next nine years to carbon capture and storage demonstration projects; $1½ billion over the next six years for up to four large-scale solar electricity generation projects; and $465 million to establish Renewables Australia-an independent body to support leadingedge renewable technology research and development. This is, of course, on top of the commitment to the National Broadband Network, which is certainly welcomed in my electorate. I have many black spots. Despite being just outer metropolitan Brisbane, it is amazing how many broadband black spots there are in my electorate. I know that my local community have been eager to see the federal government commit to such an initiative and are pleased that we have done so in this budget. I think it is very important to acknowledge the commitment in this budget to what is, I believe, a 25 per cent increase in research and development for business. When I was campaigning as a candidate, I lost count of how many times people said to me, ‘Why don’t we have a government that supports ideas and sees those ideas turn into businesses in Australia as opposed to watching these great ideas go overseas and grow from there?’ I certainly welcomed the initiative to invest more in R&D in our businesses and to turn those ideas into commercial reality. Another initiative I would like to address in relation to this budget is the important commitment to hospitals. The $3.2 billion for the Health and Hospitals Fund will see much needed investment in the health sector. I am certainly pleased that we have one of the first GP superMAIN COMMITTEE clinics announced in Queensland being built at Redcliffe, with a fantastic consortium-the Redcliffe Hospital Foundation and the University of Queensland. This clinic not only will provide care in relation to chronic disease and acute illnesses but also, importantly, will be concentrating on research and education-training up GPs, registrars, nurses and allied health professionals. We look forward to the day that that facility opens. Lastly, I mention the commitment by this government to provide improvements to the payments to pensioners. I have 21,257 pensioner recipients who will benefit from this budget and this initiative. It is a welcome commitment by this government to increase the base rate of the pension payment. I know it will provide relief to many, many people in my electorate. It was an announcement that was certainly welcomed by many of the pensioners in my electorate. For all these reasons and many, many more that I will not have the time to outline, I commend these appropriation bills to the chamber. retary for Trade) (4.54 pm)-I would like to talk about trade and the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2009-2010. We know that trade has been hit hard by global recession. In fact, we know that the World Trade Organisation is predicting global exports will drop by nine per cent this year and that Australia forecasts that global trade flows could shrink by as much as 11 per cent this year. If realised, this would be the sharpest fall in world trade in the postwar period. For export-reliant economies in the Asia-Pacific this downturn is being felt very hard. Jobs have been lost and incomes have fallen. In this region, both workers and decision makers understand that trade is integral to continued national prosperity. Under these tough circumstances many APEC economies have felt the pressure of calls for protectionism. It has been hard to contain these protectionist measures and pressures. The Australian government remains confident that we have the structure to deal with the worse of the protectionist tendencies-that structure is called the World Trade Organisation-and that there are effective disciplines within that system that guard against protectionism. In April, G20 leaders also renewed their commitment to concluding the WTO’s Doha Development Round, the successful conclusion to which would help underpin the global economic recovery. We have seen continued progress at the recent Cairns Group meeting in Bali, hosted by the Minister for Trade, Simon Crean. On 24 and 25 June, trade ministers will attend the OECD meetings in Paris, fittingly on the theme ‘The crisis and beyond: building a stronger, cleaner and fairer world economy’. This provides another opportunity for discussions aimed at concluding the round at the political level ahead of the G8 summit in Italy in July. The G20 grouping has provided great leadership also, reaffirming the commitment of that grouping to avoid the past protectionist mistakes. Protection and protectionism shackle growth in Australian employment, growth in Australian exports and growth in Australian prosperity. Protectionism leads to artificial barriers being created against higher quality, more competitive production and improvements in the volume of our exports. It actually borrows from Peter-and not Peter Costello-to pay Paul. Protectionism unites disparate political traditions-the collective wisdom is clearly on the side of free trade. In fact, somewhat incongruously, I quote former US President Ronald Reagan in his weekly radio address to the nation on 5 December 1988. He prefaced his remarks on trade by observing that the United States declared its independence for a variety of reasons, one of MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2009
173,Mr Byrne (Holt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secwhich was the restriction of trade with other European powers. He made the following observations regarding the policies exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act: America’s most recent experiment with protectionism was a disaster for the working men and women of this country. When Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930, we were told that it would protect America from foreign competition and save jobs in this country-the same line we hear todayover and over again. He went on: The actual result was the Great Depression, the worse economic catastrophe in our history; one out of four Americans were thrown out of work. Two years later, when Ithat is, Ronald Reagancast my first ballot for President, I voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who opposed protectionism and called for the repeal of that disastrous tariff. Ever since that time, the American people have stayed true to our heritage by rejecting the siren song of protectionism. In recent years, the trade deficitand this is more recentlyled some misguided politicians to call for protectionism, warning that otherwise we would lose jobs. But they were wrong again. In fact, the United States not only didn’t lose jobs, we created more jobs than all the countries of Western Europe, Canada, and Japan combined. The record is clear that when America’s total trade has increased, American jobs have also increased. And when our total trade has declined, so have the number of jobs. Part of the difficulty in accepting the good news about trade is in our words. We too often talk about trade while using the vocabulary of war. In war, for one side to win, the other must lose. But commerce is not warfare. Trade is an economic alliance that benefits both countries; there are no losers, only winners. And trade helps strengthen the free world. In fact, I will refer to another United States President on this very same issue. Upon signing the landmark Trade Expansion Act on 11 October 1962, Mr Kennedy said: This act recognizes, fully and completely, that we cannot protect our economy by stagnating behind tariff walls, but that the best protection possible is a mutual lowering of tariff barriers among friendly nations so that all may benefit from a free flow of goods. Increased economic activity resulting from increased trade will provide more job opportunities for our workers … Lowering of our tariffs will provide an increased flow of goods for our American consumers. Our industries will be stimulated by increased export opportunities and by freer competition with the industries of other nations for an even greater effort to develop an efficient, economic, and productive system. The results can bring a dynamic new era of growth. That was in 1962, involving the same issues. Recently, following the G20 meeting in April, US President Barack Obama observed: … we have rejected the protectionism that could deepen this crisis. History tells us that turning inward can help turn a downturn into a Depression. This cooperation between the world’s leading economies signals our support for open markets, as does our multilateral commitment to trade finance that will grow our exports and create new jobs. That is all on the growth front. As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a common theme emerging here historically. In his tribute to the late John Button in the Australian last year, former Prime Minister Paul Keating recounted a phone call to John Button-then the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce-on a Saturday morning in 1991 and urging him to commit to a reduction to MAIN COMMITTEE five per cent in the general manufacturing tariff by 2000. Paul Keating said, ‘In for a penny, in for a quid,’ and Button agreed. Keating described Button as someone who recognised that the historic economic defence of the Australian model was outmoded and as someone who saw his constituency interests in the longer term perspective. He was right. The current account deficit for the March quarter 2009 fell 27 per cent to $4.6 billion-the lowest quarterly deficit since the September quarter 2001. The March quarter trade surplus of $5.1 billion was the largest recorded by the ABS since it began recording these figures in the September quarter of 1959. These positive figures exist because of a generalisation of sustained trade liberalisation and because we have rejected the insular and the protectionist impulse. On1 June this year, the Minister for Trade, Simon Crean, launched The benefits of trade and trade liberalisation, a report by the Centre for International Economics which demonstrated that trade liberalisation-the rejection of the protectionist approach-benefits Australian families to the tune of $3,900 per year, with higher skilled and higher paying jobs. This is the perfect example of how trade is not to blame for the worldwide recession but can be part of the solution. Evidence shows that an increase of just one percentage point in the ratio of trade to gross domestic product can raise income per person by up to two per cent. On the upside, when economies do recover, there is every chance that trade can rebound just as fast as it fell. The Australian government is doing its part to bolster the international community’s effort to support recovery. We are implementing a nation-building and jobs plan, injecting fiscal stimulus into our economy in line with the efforts of the G20 and APEC countries. At the G20 summit, we joined with other countries in efforts to reform the international financial architecture. This is all consistent with solid and improving macroeconomic conditions in China that would suggest that recovery may not be too far away. Protectionism in this country would only stifle this recovery and lead into a downward spiral of retaliatory measures. As an example, China has been a major driver of export growth for Australia in the past decade and continues to be a major partner and a major destination for our exports. In this context, reported moves by the NSW government to ban exports from China and elsewhere-if this report is true-are entirely self-defeating. The premise of this protectionist move is that it will protect jobs in New South Wales and Australia, reportedly, through an inbuilt discount of 20 per cent on Australian products when compared to products sourced overseas. This ‘protection’ is a misnomer. Protectionism reduces competitiveness. It does not promote growth. It leads to the closing of overseas markets for other producers. It protects nothing. I will tell you one thing: it will hurt Australian exporters if this example is followed. This is no doubt a well-intentioned approach to dealing with the global financial crisis but it will undermine the good work that this government is doing to open up new markets for Australian exports, protecting and creating jobs not just in New South Wales but throughout Australia through both more trade and trade that is free. What would be the effect, for example, if this measure were followed federally? If you add North, South and South-East Asia, these regions together now account for about 68 per cent of our total merchandise exports. The contribution of this trade to Australia’s prosperity is enormous. In 2008, Australia’s merchandise exports to Asia as a whole were worth more than $150 billion. We have gained and continue to gain real economic benefits from Asia’s growth, MAIN COMMITTEE and trade has been the instrument that has tapped Australia into Asia’s growth. If we fell for what President Reagan termed the ‘siren call of protectionism’, New South Wales and every other state would soon find doors closed on these opportunities in Asia, resulting in this country having lower prosperity and lower employment. On3 June, I had the great pleasure of attending the 2009 Australian Export Hero Awards presentation dinner. This dinner recognises, as the name suggests, export heroes, with an export hero being an individual who has demonstrated outstanding vision and made a significant and unique impact whilst achieving success for their organisation and Australia in the international marketplace. The Australian Export Heroes program recognises contributions made by Australians in building our modern export enterprises and helping to further develop a uniquely Australian export culture. This program is an initiative of the Australian Institute of Export and its partners and highlights outstanding careers, dedication and commitment to building Australia’s export and international interest. It recognises the champions of Australia’s export community. These export heroes are role models for future generations of Australian exporters. The Australian Export Heroes Awards recognise extraordinary contributions made by individual Australians in building our modern export enterprises and helping to further develop a uniquely Australian export culture. These are precisely the sort of people we need to be encouraging, again, by removing protectionist barriers rather than erecting them. Pursuing further great trade integration with Asia remains vital to our national interest just as it is important for Asia’s own economic development. It is clear that trade is a driver of economic recovery. For example, according to the IMF, evidence from past recessions in Asia shows that exports have been the main engine rooms of recovery. To be more precise, six of the 10 recoveries in Asia have been led by exports and, during the recovery phase, export growth has tended to rebound strongly. Asia’s recovery can be export led as can ours in concert with a targeted, timely stimulus package. Trade reform is vital to helping our economy recover quickly and robustly. All the evidence shows that export-led recovery in Asia has also been accompanied by growth in developed markets, which is why-as G20 leaders have called for-a combined approach on the parts of governments injecting fiscal stimulus into their economies and committing themselves to reject trade protectionism is of the utmost importance. We in this country and the federal government are of course pushing hard against protectionism. For example, we have registered our strong opposition against the United States government’s plans to introduce dairy export subsidies following on from the recent introduction of the European Union’s dairy export subsidies. On a wider point about protectionism, it is a development we must resist if we are to see true economic growth return. The IMF’s latest outlook forecasts several Asian economies to continue to grow this year and the next. Looking ahead at 2010, Australia forecasts key Asian economies to be amongst those showing positive signs of growth. This is the area that we are most integrated into in trade at the present time. China is growing at eight per cent; Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore are growing at 2¾ per cent; Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are growing at 2½ per cent; and India is growing at 4¾ per cent. With our bilateral trade agenda, Australia is negotiating free trade agreements with China, Japan, Malaysia and the Gulf Cooperation Council. We held the first round of the free trade agreement negotiations with South Korea several weeks ago. Australia will also be joining negotiations towards a trans-Pacific partnership agreement, with other parties likely to be MAIN COMMITTEE New Zealand, Chile, Singapore, Brunei, Peru, the US and Vietnam. And, of course, there is the recently signed ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA, which I will speak about briefly in a moment. If you are wondering why Australia is so vigorous in pursuit of these bilateral and regional trade agreements, it is because we strongly believe that they are the building blocks for multilateral trade liberalisation and regional economic integration. FTAs can make a positive contribution to the global trading system. Why and how? Because they are comprehensive and truly trade-liberalising across all sectors. There is no better example of our benchmark for success than the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA, or AANZFTA, as it is known. Let me briefly outline why. This is the first FTA Australia has signed since the onset of the global financial crisis. In the face of rising pressures to put up trade barriers, there is no better demonstration of a resolve, putting our money on the table, to fight protectionism than settling a comprehensive regional free trade agreement. The AANZFTA has put our region at the front of the global efforts to fight protectionism. For Australia, it is the largest FTA we have ever negotiated. In 2008, our two-way trade in merchandise with ASEAN and New Zealand alone was worth $88 billion, or 20 per cent of Australia’s total merchandise trade. For ASEAN, AANZFTA is the most comprehensive trade agreement it has ever concluded. It covers goods, services, investment, intellectual property, intellectual commerce, temporary movement of businesspeople and economic cooperation. It provides for substantial commitments on tariff elimination and what is known as WTO-plus commitments in other areas. For example, it binds current low tariffs and eliminates tariffs over time from the more developed ASEAN member countries and Vietnam on between 90 per cent and 100 per cent of national tariff lines. These tariff cuts cover 96 per cent of our current exports to the region. Perhaps not surprisingly, few countries find it easy to cut trade barriers at the stroke of a pen. Opening up trade involves painstaking technical work and engagement at the political level. But the successful conclusion of the free trade agreement with Today the US charge d’affaires, Dan Clune, rejected the assertion in the Australian that the US Department of State assistant secretary-designate, Kurt Campbell, is opposed to the Prime Minister’s plan for an Asia-Pacific community. In distancing Secretary-Designate Campbell from this perspective, Clune quoted Campbell, who said: I think the fact that there is a greater interest in finding appropriate forums, not just in Australia, but in China, Japan, the United States, is a healthy thingappropriate forums being avenues for tackling the common problems we face, most obviously the global financial crisis, from all concerned nations, providing the framework for a sustained recovery and a return to economic growth. Through strengthening regional architecture, as Clune has observed, we are better able to pursue these collaborative opportunities. That is precisely what our government intends to do. pleased to bring the second reading debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and cognate bills to a close. The global recession has resulted in a rapid deterioration in Australia’s economic outlook since the 2008-09 budget. The changed economic circumstances have adversely impacted on government revenues and led to successive downward revisions to estimated tax receipts since the 2008-09 budget, amounting to about $210 billion over the forward estimates to 2012-13. As a result of the global recession and the associated drop in govMAIN COMMITTEE",165,Appropriation Bill No 2 2009 2010 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2009 2010
174,Mr Tanner (Melbourne,"Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (5.13 pm)-I amernment revenue, the underlying cash deficit is expected to be $57.6 billion, or 4.9 per cent of GDP in 2009-10. This compares strongly with other advanced economies. In response to the global economic crisis the government considers that the only responsible course is to support the economy and jobs now. This means we will allow temporary deficits to unfold and cover those deficits with temporary borrowings. The government’s budget has been crafted to protect and promote the interests of all Australians now and into the future. To support the economy through the global recession the government’s fiscal stimulus program started with supporting household consumption and then moved to small-scale investments that could be implemented within a relatively short time frame. This budget marks the start of the next phase-a move into larger and longer term nation-building infrastructure projects. I will have more to say about this shortly. The government’s fiscal stimulus packages have helped to cushion the economy from the worse impacts of the global recession. This action is expected to support up to 210,000 jobs. Supporting jobs is a priority for the government. We understand the dignity that work provides and value the contribution that these 210,000 Australians can make to our country. The government is providing $1.5 billion over five years through its Jobs and Training Compact. This program is aimed at providing relief and assistance to those directly affected by the economic downturn. It will also better position Australia in global growth returns by increasing the skills of our workforce. This budget contains a significant infrastructure package. The government will invest $22 billion over six years to improve the quality, adequacy and efficiency of transport, communications, energy, education and health infrastructure across Australia. The National Broadband Network, which is supported by an initial investment of $4.7 billion, $1 billion of which will be spent in 2009-10, is the biggest single nation-building infrastructure project in Australia’s history. The government’s investment coupled with changes to the existing telecommunications regulatory regime will fundamentally transform the competitive dynamics of the telecommunications sector for the benefit of all Australians. The government is providing $1.1 billion in this budget to invest in critical road, rail and port infrastructure to encourage more sustainable urban development and renewal and to lower transportation costs to ensure Australian businesses continue to be globally competitive. To complement investment in infrastructure and improve long-term productive capacity the government is supporting world-class higher education and hospital systems and investing in innovation. The government will invest $1.39 billion in this budget from the Education Investment Fund for priority research and higher education infrastructure projects. In addition, the government will provide $36.4 million in 2009-10 and $491 million over four years to uncap the number of public university places from 2012, allowing an extra 50,000 students to commence studies over the next four years. The government will also provide $29.4 million in 2009-10 and $436.9 million over four years to universities to give students from disadvantaged backgrounds the opportunity of a university education. In this budget the government is providing funding of $465.7 million from the Health and Hospital Fund to support the development of health infrastructure projects of national significance. The government will invest an additional $3.5 billion over nine years including $400 million in 2009-10 for the establishment of the Clean Energy Initiative. The initiative will encourage further innovation in and large-scale commercialisation of clean energy generation MAIN COMMITTEE and low-emissions technologies which will contribute to Australia’s transition to a low-carbon economy. The new measures will focus on carbon capture and storage and solar and non-solar renewable technologies. In the 2008-09 budget the government committed to reform the pension system. Since that time the scale of the global recession has highlighted the importance of the pension as a safety net for those most vulnerable in our society. The government has found room under difficult circumstances to deliver on its commitment with increases in pension payments, reform of the payment structure for pensioners and more assistance for carers at a cost of $16 billion over five years. As a result of some tough decisions and despite the ageing of the population, our secure and sustainable pension reform will be fully offset by 2020-21. To boost workforce participation in the long term and as part of its rebalancing of the family payment system, the government is spending $731 million over five years to deliver a paid parental leave scheme. The scheme is due to commence operation from 1 January 2011. Finally, it is necessary to inject some balance and perspective into the debate concerning the government’s budget position. Australia’s balance sheet is strong and will continue to be one of the strongest in the world. After peaking at 13.8 per cent of GDP in 2013-14, net debt is expected to fall to 3.7 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. In comparison, average net debt in advanced economies will continue to rise to a substantial 80.6 per cent of GDP in 2014. The government’s firm commitment to return the budget to surplus will ensure that fiscal sustainability is maintained. Meeting this commitment will involve further tough choices, but it is important because fiscal sustainability remains one of the key ingredients for sustainable economic growth. The government’s approach seeks to support the economy and to protect jobs. It does so in large part by making substantial investments in worthwhile infrastructure that will yield benefits for the future. It is a budget, therefore, for all Australians and for future generations of Australians. I commend the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and the cognate bills to the House. Consideration in Detail Ms GILLARD (Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (5.20 pm)-May I suggest that it might suit the Main Committee to consider the items of proposed expenditure in the order shown in the schedule which has been circulated to honourable members. I also take the opportunity to indicate to the Main Committee that the proposed order for consideration of portfolios estimates has been discussed with the opposition and non-government members and there has been no objection to what is proposed. The schedule read as followsProposed order of consideration of Portfolios Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-10 Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Portfolio Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Portfolio Health and Ageing Portfolio Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Portfolio The Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts Portfolio MAIN COMMITTEE Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Portfolio Human Services Portfolio Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy Portfolio Defence Portfolio Resources, Energy and Tourism Portfolio Immigration and Citizenship Portfolio Attorney General’s Portfolio Innovation, Industry, Science and Research Portfolio Finance and Deregulation Portfolio Treasury Portfolio Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio consider the items of the proposed expenditure in the order suggested by the minister? There being no objection it is so ordered. Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Portfolio Proposed expenditure, 7,601,757,000 The question is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to. to discuss the consideration in detail for education as often a parliamentary secretary or junior minister would be sent, and that is to her great credit. I have a few questions that I would like to put to the minister which she can either answer today or be prepared to take on notice and return to the House to answer at some point. They largely relate to the common youth allowance changes and also to the Education Investment Fund changes and then my colleagues, the members for Boothby, Stirling and Indi, will also fill the time allocated for education as there are a number of other issues within this portfolio which they handle. What follows are my questions about the common youth allowance changes. The DEEWR fact sheets identify that 30,700 students are likely to miss out on youth allowance due to the tightening of the workforce participation criteria. I would like the minister to provide detail, if that is possible, on the composition of these 30,700 students. How many will come from rural and regional areas? How many will be ineligible because they come from farming backgrounds where the parental asset, the family farm, excludes them from receiving youth allowance irrespective of their parental income? How many will be ineligible because they come from small business families where the parental asset, the small business, excludes them from receiving youth allowance irrespective of parental income? I would also ask the minister if she is aware that, according to the ABARE farm survey results released in April 2009, the equity at 30 June 2008 of the average broadacre farm in Australia is $3½ million dollars and that the average farm cash income from the same farm was $62,400. Given that by these figures the average farm in Australia is well above the level for the personal assets testapproximately $2.2 million this year-can the minister confirm that as a result of the government’s reforms the child of an average farming couple in Australia is entitled to receive no assistance to pursue their higher education dreams unless they first work full-time for 18 months even though their parents’ income would have been well within the range that would MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Asean And New Zealand Shows It Can Be Done

176,Mr Pyne,"I am glad that the Minister for Education has come into the Main Committeequalify them to receive youth allowance were their parents receiving the same income from a salaried job in the city where the student would not even need to leave home to study? Is the minister able to release whatever analysis the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has done into the specific challenges facing students from rural and regional Australia who must leave their family home in order to access higher education? I also ask: how many representations has the minister’s office and the department received from members of the Australian public in relation to the amendments to youth allowance by email, by letter, by phone call or by personal visit? Will the minister consider making transitional arrangements that would allow those students who have taken a gap year in 2009 on advice from Centrelink officials and others at their schools in order to gain independent youth allowance in 2010 to be able to do so and therefore ensure that the government is not imposing effectively retrospective legislation on Australian students? They are my questions in relation to the common youth allowance. I am happy to let you answer those now or continue. Ms Gillard-Please continue. 2007-08 budget for a new Higher Education Endowment Fund, the HEEF, to provide an ongoing revenue source to pay for university infrastructure into the 21st century-an initiative that Peter Costello was closely involved with. Last year the Rudd government added $2.5 billion from the last Costello surplus and renamed it the Education Investment Fund. The minister has claimed to deliver a $5.7 billion package in this budget for universities, research and higher education generally, but I ask the minister: isn’t it true that to create this $5.7 billion figure the government has had to include $934 million of the EIF, the Education Investment Fund, round 2 projects; $901 million of EIF funding for what the government has called its Super Science Initiative; $750 million of undefined EIF future rounds; and $400 million taken from EIF funds for the Clean Energy Initiative? Isn’t it therefore the case that $3 billion of the government’s $5.7 billion higher education package was in fact appropriated in Peter Costello’s 2007-08 budget? How much of the $750 million earmarked for EIF future rounds over the next three years will be spent on university infrastructure, how much will be spent on vocational education and training infrastructure, and how much will be diverted to programs unrelated to further education altogether? I could speak at length about what I regard as the manifest failures of the government in respect of education, but I know my colleagues with responsibility for industrial relations, apprenticeships and training, and the member for Indi, who has responsibility for child care, have other questions, so I will leave it at that. I look forward to the minister’s response. (Time expired) Ms GILLARD (Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (5.28 pm)-I thank the shadow minister for his questions. It would be churlish of him indeed to try to criticise this government’s record on education given the historically large new investments that are flowing into education as a result of this government’s education revolution and particularly the expenditures in this budget. I understand that he cringes when he reflects on the parlous state that education was left in by the former government and that he finds it difficult to make any substantive or real criticisms of the government’s programs. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Asean And New Zealand Shows It Can Be Done
177,Mr Pyne,"In relation to the Education Investment Fund, $6.2 billion was assigned in theI will come directly to the student financing questions that he raised. I want to give to the shadow minister an important statistic that I think he may not be aware of: under the previous government in the period 2002-07 regional participation rates in higher education fell. Under a Liberal government in which National Party members served in significant roles-at the most significant point as Deputy Prime Minister-a government that would have said it was doing things for rural and regional Australia, regional participation rates in higher education fell from 18.715 per cent to 18.08 per cent. That is against a population share of 25.4 per cent of the population. So, even at the higher point, regional people were significantly underrepresented in higher education, and that problem was exacerbated during the life of the former Liberal-National Party government. And the bad news does not end there, because remote participation rates fell over the same period, from 1.27 per cent to 1.12 per cent. That was against a population share of 2.5 per cent, so already significantly below population share and falling under the Liberal government. In those circumstances obviously this government is very determined to make a difference for rural and regional education. That is why we have moved to the student financing package that is part of the budget papers. In very much expanding the number of families that will get benefits and in very much increasing the family income test for those families, this package will benefit rural and regional students. To give just a flavour of that, the parental income cut-off for two students 18 years of age or more and living away from home is $139,388. That is a significant statistic for regional families who are very likely to have to have their students move away from home. We have taken the income test to that point from $79,117 under the old system. So for rural and regional Australians, who tend on average to earn less than their city counterparts, such a huge extension in the family income test and the additional numbers of students that will benefit is very good news indeed. On the question of farm assets, can I advise the shadow minister that the way the assets test works for families in those circumstances is that it takes account of current market values and it is net of business farm related debt, so obviously we are talking about a calculation that goes to the equity, if I can use that terminology. The valuation disregards the principal family home and up to two hectares of surrounding land. The limit currently set on that valuation is $571,500 and it is indexed. However, for business assets, including farm assets, a 75 per cent discount is applied to this assets test. This means that youth allowance and Abstudy are obtainable for young people in small business and farmer families who have assets to the value of $2.286 million. That is the way the assets test works, and I would direct the shadow minister’s attention to each element of that so that he can accurately transmit that message. On the question of-(Time expired) Revolution is not part of my responsibilities but I would be interested to hear the Deputy Prime Minister’s response as to what measure she has put in place or is going to put in place to deal with a number of issues that are arising in the so-called Building the Education Revolution. There are two which appear to be causing the most concern because they involve the use of Commonwealth taxpayers’ money in a wasteful and poor fashion. One is skimming by state governments: the removal of state government spending on school infrastructure in what they see as a bonanza of Commonwealth taxpayers’ money therefore giving them the capacity to remove their own funding. I know that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Asean And New Zealand Shows It Can Be Done
178,Mr Pyne (Sturt) (5.33 Pm),"I have a couple more questions. The Building the Educationhave said they will not tolerate skimming by state governments, but even in my own state of South Australia we saw in the budget handed down about 10 days ago that the state government reduced their spending on state infrastructure in schools by 12 per cent. In most years you would expect a state government to be increasing their spending on school infrastructure, not decreasing it, so 12 per cent is a very dramatic decline in state government commitment to their schools, which of course they are responsible for. I am sure that pattern in South Australia is being repeated around Australia. In fact, there has been anecdotal evidence of that in Victoria in particular and it would be surprising if the hopeless and rancid New South Wales state government was not attempting to do similar things. So skimming is a big issue in terms of the Building the Education Revolution. Another great concern to people is profiteering by private enterprise. There is a great deal of anecdotal evidence that tenders and bids on school infrastructure are being inflated by up to 30 per cent because bureaucrats are telling builders and business generally that they have to get this money spent and out the door as quickly as possible. We have already had examples in the parliament, such Cleve Area School, of where profiteering appears to be occurring. I am sure that was not the intention of the Building the Education Revolution plan. I would hope that the minister would not, through vanity, refuse to accept that there is a failure in the delivery of these projects on the ground. I hope that she will in fact take the concerns raised by the opposition and others seriously and to heart. I hope she will adopt the call of the opposition to let the Auditor-General do a proper referral of the delivery of the Building the Education Revolution so that taxpayers’ money is properly spent and accounted for. There is also the issue of targeting. There are schools that already have very substantial infrastructure, have everything that a school could really want for its pupils, but are being given $3 million grants. Meanwhile, there are other schools where the grants are much smaller but the needs are much greater. That is of great concern as well. No-one is suggesting that schools, especially non-government schools, should suddenly be discriminated against because they already have excellent infrastructure. A properly targeted $14.7 billion program would take into account what schools already have and would ensure that those schools in areas of low-socioeconomic background in particular are properly provided for. There is also the issue of the provision of unwanted infrastructure. There is anecdotal evidence on the Education for Australia website, educationforaustralia.com.au, which I have begun, of many schools that already have the infrastructure that the state department and the federal government are insisting that they build. There are examples of schools that already have gymnasiums that have been told they have to have a gymnasium. There are schools that have perfectly adequate school infrastructure today in terms of classrooms and that want those classrooms to be air-conditioned but are being told only if they knock those buildings down and build new buildings will they be able to include air-conditioning. Finally, just to clear up one matter that the Deputy Prime Minister seemed to misunderstand today: when I was talking about Hastings Public School, I was not confused between New South Wales and Victoria. I was talking about the Hastings Public School in northern New South Wales. The evidence that she needs to perhaps go back to is from 2003, when they were provided with $40,000 for a covered outdoor learning area. My question was entirely precise. They were provided with $40,000 in 2003 for a covered outdoor learning area. They are now being provided with $400,000 for a covered outdoor learning area. That, in anyone’s MAIN COMMITTEE language, is a very large inflation rate. We will continue to ask questions because we are standing up for the Australian taxpayer. I hope that the Deputy Prime Minister will be big enough, woman enough, to accept that not everything she is doing is working and she needs to take another look at it. Ms GILLARD (Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (5.38 pm)-I will address the comments in reverse order. On Building the Education Revolution, you heard it here first: a historic offer. On the issue of targeting, if the shadow minister would forward to me a list of the schools that he believes have adequate infrastructure and should miss out-the schools that he thinks should not benefit under the program-then I will publish that list for community discussion and input. I will wait to get that very quickly from the shadow minister, who says he is concerned about targeting. If he wants to give me the list of the 10, 20, 50 or 100 schools he says have everything they need and should miss out on the Building the Education Revolution program, I will undertake to publish that through all mechanisms available to the government for community debate. I look forward to the receipt of that as soon as he can get it to me. I would be happy to engage in publication of that as early as tomorrow morning. On the various claims the opposition has made about Building the Education Revolution, the problem here for the shadow minister is that when we have got to matters of detail about his claims they simply have not stood up. His claims about the Cleve Area School did not stand up. Regarding his claims about the Hastings Public School today, it is not very helpful to just talk about covered outdoor learning areas and compare one cost to another and then allege profiteering. You have obviously got to see what is in the covered outdoor learning area. I know that the shadow minister had been excluded from question time, as he frequently is for poor conduct, by the time. I added to an answer. What he may not appreciate about the Hastings Public School in New South Wales is that the covered outdoor learning area is a significant building with a solid roof. It also includes an amphitheatre, seating, a sound system to facilitate school assemblies and performances, and science and work spaces. We are talking about a very substantial construction with very substantial facilities. On the other claims that the shadow minister has made from time to time-that we are giving money to schools that close. He was yelling about Gepps Cross in question time today. Those claims have not stood up to public scrutiny and I answered that fully in question time today. On the question of our arrangements with state governments, our arrangements are very clear-that is, states will pay a very substantial penalty in terms of the withdrawal of funds if they do not maintain effort in school capital expenditure. That is very clear. The government is very determined about that. It has been made clear through COAG. If the shadow minister wants an undertaking that any such action by any state government would be acted upon by this government then I can give him that undertaking-it most certainly would be. In the Building the Education Revolution we are talking about a huge and unprecedented investment being rolled out unashamedly quickly to support jobs. I know the position of the opposition is that not one school should benefit and not one Australian should have a job from this $14.7 billion. I know that is their position and I know that, in a desperate attempt to justify that political position, from time to time, they throw up examples that they claim are MAIN COMMITTEE flaws with the Building the Education Revolution program. I think everybody can see through the political desperation that drives these inaccurate claims. I am going to be frank and I have been frank with the Australian people about this-when you are delivering a program of this size quickly to support jobs, from time to time there are going to be concerns, comments, criticisms and complaints. On each and every occasion that such concerns or comments or criticisms come to us we act on the basis of them. Of course, what we do not respond to are things said by the opposition which, after the simplest inquiry, turn out to be completely factually inaccurate. On the question of the Education Investment FundI understand that today is a day to be very generous about Peter Costello’s record in public life but, even being generous about Peter Costello’s record, I do not think that he can claim to have delivered-as this government has delivered-more than $5 billion in education infrastructure for higher education. One billion dollars of it came off budget and that was the Better Universities Renewal Fund. (Extension of time granted) I will just finish with this one sentence and then we will move to other members-having allowed the shadow minister to do the same. With more than $5 billion invested in higher education infrastructure, vocational education and training infrastructure, I say this to the members opposite: it is very interesting to me that when called on to detail an education policy all they can do is criticise. I have not heard an education policy about early learning. I have not heard an education policy about school education. I have not heard an education policy about investing in important things like overcoming disadvantage in schools. I have not heard a substantive response to the Bradley reforms. This is the problem for the opposition-all they do is moan and complain but they are a policy-free zone. And the shadow minister for education more so than most. that we have been very interested in, which is the area of award modernisation. When I have had the opportunity to ask the Deputy Prime Minister questions about this in the past, her answers have been wholly inaccurate. WhatI am hoping for is that we would have a chance to go through some of the problems that are associated with the award modernisation process and get some sensible responses to how she feels that business, in particular small business, will be able to address some of the cost increases that she is going to impose, particularly in certain sectors. I would like to start by referring to a letter that I received recently from a supermarket owner just outside of my electorate in Shenton Park. He talks about the new general retail industry award. Under the award modernisation changes he will need to pay his casual workforce working on a Sunday $39.48 per hour. So that is almost $40 an hour he will need to pay his casual workforce on a Sunday. He is a small supermarket owner; clearly he cannot sustain that increase in wage costs. He says in his letter to us that he is going to have to shed his casual staff. He has asked us to try to do something about it through the legislative process. We will do so during the transitional bill in the other place, but I would be very interested to hear how the minister responds to his queries and what she thinks he can do to stop getting rid of those staff once his costs base has increased substantially. I want to put another few questions on the record for the minister to respond to. Clearly when the minister made the award modernisation requests, she asked the Industrial Relations Commission to do what most would consider to be impossible-that is, to not disadvantage MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Asean And New Zealand Shows It Can Be Done
179,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (5.44 Pm),"I want to move on to another area within this portfolioemployees but also to not increase the cost base for employers. Clearly when you are dealing with these sorts of issues, you are dealing in a zero sum game. If you are taking away from one and adding to the other, it is literally impossible to implement that promise accurately. No matter what the commission does, there is really no chance that they could conform to the wishes and the request of the Deputy Prime Minister. I think that is clear to anyone who has any understanding about what this process entails. And so I ask the minister: does she stand by her promise that no employee will be disadvantaged and that her award modernisation process will not increase the cost to business? I have asked her in this place before about advice that she has received about what the award modernisation is going to do to the labour market, and I would be interested in any advice she could share with House about what sort of information she has received from her department about how the award modernisation process is going to impact on the labour market. If she has not asked for such advice, then I would ask why she has not, as that would seem like a pretty basic aspect of due diligence when you are making such a major change. I would also like to know what she thinks will be the result of these massive increases in wage costs. If you are a small business owner and you are faced with a substantial increase in your wage costs, you could be operating on very tight profit margins. What does she expect the proprietor of these businesses to do? I also ask that isn’t it the case that under the minister’s current arrangements the five-year phase-in period that she often talks about is only an option that is available to the commission to transition the new awards in? When we raise these issues about award modernisation, the minister will always respond by talking about the five-year phase-in period, which in itself is a reasonable option. The reality is of course that that is really up to the commission; the minister does not have any power to direct them to transition these awards in over that period. I also ask the minister to guarantee that the transition to modern awards will not cost one Australian job. Finally, I ask her why the jobs of workers in retail, aged care, horticulture and all the many other sectors that are going to be adversely impacted by this process are not as important to her as those in restaurants and cafes. The minister varied her award modernisation request to ask the commission to do a separate award arrangement for workers within that sector. Clearly that is an acknowledgement that this process has gone off the rails and when she was faced with the evidence that those changes were going to cost up to 8½ thousand jobs within that industry, she varied the request. Why won’t she do so for other sectors? Education Revolution funding that relate to schools in my electorate. Certain schools have been the subject of some discussion and media notoriety. utes. ate have warmly welcomed the funding. For example, on FridayI visited Brassall State School. Money for a multipurpose hall was repeatedly promised to the school by the previous coalition government. Well, the Rudd government is delivering $3 million to Brassall State School. I spoke at the assembly on Friday and they warmly welcomed the funding. Three schools in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland have been mentioned in the local and national media.

182,Mr Neumann,"Unlike the member for Stirling, the school communities in my electorschool in my electorate. It is a great school. I sent my two daughters to Bremer State High School. I am proud to say my youngest daughter was dux last year and my eldest daughter was dux two years before that. It is a great school and I am very supportive of it. sity of Queensland St Lucia campus and doing very well. Bremer State High School has over 1,200 students and, under round 2 of the National School Pride program, it received $200,000 for revegetation and a fitness track. Bremer has been relocated from its current site to an area beside the University of Queensland Ipswich campus, near the site of the Ipswich golf course. There has been some discussion and criticism by the opposition about Bremer State High School and the funding we are providing. I have spoken to the principal about the issue, and I would like to minister to comment on that. The other school is Dinmore State School. Dinmore State School is effectively being amalgamated into Riverview State School. Bremer is being relocated as part of the State Schools of Tomorrow program in South-East Queensland, but Dinmore State School is a small school. A lot of money is being put into Riverview State School, but Dinmore was one of the successful schools in round 2 of the National School Pride program. For a classroom upgrade it received $75,000. I would like the Deputy Prime Minister to comment on where that money is going. Is it going to the existing school site or is it being rolled into the new school site, where Riverview State School is currently located? There is currently a lot of money being poured into that site by the state government. The other school is Amberley State School. In the National School Pride program, Amberley State School received $125,000 for SMART Board data projectors for classrooms and, in round 2 of Primary Schools for the 21st Century, received $1 million for a new multipurpose hall and just over $1 million for an outside school hours care facility. The current site of Amberley State School, Deputy Prime Minister, has been taken over by the redevelopment of the RAAF base at Amberley. It is being relocated to the neighbouring suburb of Yamanto in Ipswich. We have given the state government $26.83 million to relocate because we are effectively purchasing the site to become part of the RAAF at Amberley. So the school is being relocated and a new school is being built at Yamanto in Ipswich. It is going to be a great school and I look forward to it being opened. I seek the minister’s comments in relation to that because there has been some criticism by those opposite. In fact, Dr Bruce Flegg, the opposition spokesperson for education in Queensland, described funding for schools in Ipswich as ‘ludicrous’. SoI am interested in the minister’s comments in relation to Bremer, Dinmore and Amberley state schools. Ms GILLARD (Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (5.53 pm)-I will respond to the questions that have been put to me. The response to the question asked by the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations is, I think, very clear. The government is engaged in a profound reform with award modernisation. I know that the Liberal Party does not really believe in safety nets. That was represented by its Work Choices legislation, where all aspects of the safety net could be stripped away apart from five minimum conditions which, when you held them up to the light, did not guarantee much at all. SoI know that safety nets are not part of the Liberal Party’s ethos because it believes in statutory individual employment agreements MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Asean And New Zealand Shows It Can Be Done
183,Mr Windsor,Name them!,179,Asean And New Zealand Shows It Can Be Done
184,Mr Neumann,"My daughters? Jacqueline and Alexandra. They are both at the Univerthat can strip the safety net away. But, even driven by that profound belief, in government the Liberal Party used to pretend that it was interested in the major reform of simplifying and modernising awards. It had a few goes at it and all of them were spectacular failures because reform is not an easy thing to do. It is an easy thing to give an interview about-and some members opposite do that from time to time-but it is actually not an easy thing to do. Remarkably, this government, in pushing on with award modernisation with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and working hard on it, is working through these issues and working through them very well. If the shadow minister was being fair, he would acknowledge that, overwhelmingly, the award modernisation process undertaken by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is going very well indeed. They have made a large number of new modern awards. The level of stakeholder engagement in the making of them and the level of stakeholder acceptance of them once they are made is very high. The shadow minister might, therefore, want to congratulate the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for that work at some point. The shadow minister points to some areas where concerns have been raised. The position of the government has been clear: we have been prepared to listen to concerns and to respond to them as necessary. I have varied the award modernisation request on more than one occasion. That is because I have responded to concerns from union stakeholders in relation to one variation and to concerns from employer stakeholders in relation to the restaurant and catering area that he raised. We are still in a process of engagement and dialogue about a series of other areas that he raised. The shadow minister refuses to acknowledge that the commission not only has the task of making modern awards; they also have the task of making the five-year transitional arrangements. Many employer stakeholders are there at the commission, pressing to put a case about the nature of those five-year transitional arrangements and the commission is getting on with the job of making those transitional arrangements. We are allowing the independent umpire to do that work. I know that the Liberal Party does not believe in independent umpires in workplace relations, but we do. We are allowing the independent umpire to do that work. We will continue to keep it monitored and continue to have dialogue with employer stakeholders as necessary. I know that from time to time the shadow minister says different things about award modernisation. On some occasions, he goes out and represents publicly that everything will change for employers on 1 January 2010. He knows that is not the case because there are the five-year transitional arrangements. Separately, on other occasions, he says that things should be frozen for the five years and that there should be a sudden, drop-dead date at the end of the five years. Both things represented by the opposition are ludicrous. It is not true to say that all things will change on 1 January 2010 with no transition or phase-in and it would be ludicrous to have a drop-dead date in five years time. I know workplace relations excites those opposite because they are there crying for Work Choices, but we will continue with this reform, which is in the interests of working people. On the questions raised by the member for Blair, it is good to have a member here who knows the details of his local schools. Some opposition members may want to study his example, given some of the ludicrous claims that are made by opposition members about local schools. CanI assure the member for Blair that, despite publicity and opposition claims to the MAIN COMMITTEE contrary, the $75,000 for Dinmore State School under the National School Pride Program is going to the continuing school, which is Riverview State School, so it will be there to benefit students. There have been publicity and claims by the opposition that were meant to give people the impression that revegetation and the construction of a fitness track at Bremer State High School are somehow being done at a school site that is closing. That publicity and those representations by the opposition are completely untrue. That is being constructed at the continuing school-the new school-and will be there for the benefit of students and I think that is terrific. He has raised many issues associated with the Amberley school. It has been a major issue in his electorate and, obviously, that school is being moved to facilitate arrangements relating particularly to RAAF personnel and the study of their children. Of course, the money that the government is allocating is going to the new site where those students will continue to study happily and well-hopefully-for a very long period of time to come. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (6.00 pm)-I would like to ask the minister a question about Job Services Australia. With respect to the Job Services Australia tender, is the minister aware of any employment-services providers who were not preferred tenderers in a specific employment-service area on 5 March, and who were not advised by email in the department’s communication of 16 March that they were preferred tenderers, but were subsequently offered business in that employment-service area on 2 April? Can the minister provide the reasons for these employment-services providers being offered additional business in each ESA in which this occurred? How were the employment-services providers, who were invited in at this stage, chosen? How were the ESAs chosen? Who made this decision? Can the minister advise in which employment-service areas this occurred? ing hard to support jobs and businesses now, and build economic prosperity for the future. The Building the Education Revolution program is a critical part of this plan. The Education Revolution highlights this government’s commitment to the thousands of students and parents around Australia who will benefit from investment in local communities and improved facilities in schools. There has been $62.7 million already allocated to schools in my electorate of Isaacs in rounds 1 and 2 of the primary school program. I am speaking constantly to school principals in my electorate and they tell me that this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to boost learning resources and bring their schools into the 21st century. This funding will provide major infrastructure works in all schools across Isaacs, as well as essential maintenance which will rejuvenate our local schools by providing school refurbishments and upgrades to existing classrooms. Every primary school in my electorate will receive either a new hall, a library, a learning centre or classrooms. These new facilities will provide modern venues to enhance the learning experience of local students. Just last Tuesday, I was joined by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Victorian Premier and the Victorian Education Minister, Ms Bronwyn Pike, at Chelsea Heights Primary School for the announcement of $2.5 million in funding for a multipurpose hall there. Danny Mulqueen, the school principal, was ecstatic at the news, which he says will give his students a better and safer learning environment, in particular, for physical education and performing arts. MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Asean And New Zealand Shows It Can Be Done
185,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (6.01 Pm),"In these difficult times, the Rudd government is workThere is a range of other school projects which have been announced in round 2 of the Building the Education Revolution funding. This includes Rowellyn Park Primary School-a very large primary school in Carrum Downs-where there are $3 million to build new classrooms and a learning resource centre; Carrum Downs Primary School, where there are $3 million in funding to build a new multipurpose hall; Skye Primary School, which has been granted $3 million to build new classrooms and a learning resource centre; St Joachim’s Catholic Primary School, which has been granted $2.5 million to build a new multipurpose hall; Patterson Lakes Primary School, which has received $3 million to build a new multipurpose hall; St Louis de Montfort’s Catholic Primary School, which has received $3 million to build a new multipurpose hall and library; and St Anthony’s Primary School, in Noble Park, which has received some $3 million to build new classrooms and refurbish existing classrooms. I went to St Anthony’s Primary School just last week and spoke at length to the excellent principal of that school, Marg Batt, and some of her students and teachers. Indeed, I have spoken to principals, teachers and parents at each of the schools in my electorate, and I know from them directly just how delighted they are-along with the whole of their school community-with the funds that have been made available. As the largest school modernisation program in Australia’s history, it delivers long-term benefits to students and schools. I am proud to see funding for these works assisting schools in my electorate. These projects are supporting local jobs during this global economic downturn. I find it bizarre that members opposite have come out criticising these works. They are trying to run a dishonest scare campaign on debt, yet they have no alternative plan of action when it comes to dealing with the effects of the global financial crisis on local jobs or on the local economy. This government has placed investment in education front and centre in its response to the current global economic crisis. As the global economy is experiencing its worse recession since the Great Depression, it is important for investment spending to take place now in order to support local employment and future productivity. This government understands the critical importance of education to future productivity growth in our economy. There is a strong link between the development of infrastructure and education services and an increase in productivity in the long term. I have no doubt that these major infrastructure works that give our local primary schools new libraries, classrooms and multipurpose halls will help contribute to an increase in our nation’s social capital. I look forward to seeing the fruits of this program when these major works are completed. I know that many workers in my electorate are thankful to the Rudd government for this stimulus spending, as it has helped keep them employed while delivering the infrastructure that our local schools need. tion funding arrangements that are out there, not because they are part of the stimulus package but because they are very fair. They have treated all schools the same. That is something that governments should look at much more closely. The previous and current governments have the Roads to Recovery program, which is a very fair program. I congratulate the government for the initiative. Obviously, those funding arrangements are very welcome in all of our schools. The point raised in question time today really does need to be followed up. What is MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Asean And New Zealand Shows It Can Be Done
186,Mr Windsor (New England) (6.06 Pm),"I congratulate the government on the educathe general response of the minister where the states are seen to be taking advantage of some of the federal funding-if, in fact, they are? That is something we really do need to keep an eye on. The Minister for Education would be familiar with the Youth Allowance issue. I thank her staffer Jim Round for the assistance he has given me and some of my constituents in relation to their parental income circumstances. Minister, the issue that really does need to be addressed-and maybe the government will be forced to address this by way of amendment in the Senate when the legislation eventually gets to the Senate-is the requirement to be employed for 30 hours a week over 18 months to be considered independent. Essentially in many small communities-and the community I come from has only about 1,500 people-30 hours a week is a full-time job. There are no full-time jobs. For those young people to go down that path, they have to leave home to find a job to prove that they are independent of their parents so that they can go to university in two years time. It really does need revisiting. I encourage the minister to address that issue for those students where it is going to be virtually impossible for them to access that work. The minister will probably say that the parental income test will allow many more students to access some degree of youth allowance-and she is quite correct in saying that-but there is a group of students who will miss out and, by missing out, they will not go to university at all. I do not think that is the general intent of the government. Ms GILLARD (Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (6.10 pm)-In relation to the very specific question asked by the shadow minister for employment participation, training and sport, the member for Boothby, I can say that we will provide him with a detailed answer to that question. Obviously it goes to a set of communications which, he would appreciate, I do not have available to me here in the Main Committee, but I can give an undertaking to provide an answer to him expeditiously, and we will. On the issue relating to Building the Education Revolution raised by two members in their contributions, I thank them for that and I thank them for their understanding about how important this is to their local schools and for supporting local jobs. Whilst the member for New England may not have been in the Main Committee when this was asserted by the shadow minister for education, apprenticeships and training, the shadow minister is asserting that there are some schools that will not benefit at all from the program, and I have asked him to provide a list of those schools so that the government can publish it. I know the member for New England is concerned about student financing and I very much appreciate the fact that in a very detailed way he has worked through with my office his set of concerns. I know that he appreciates that, overall, out of this package more students will benefit and I know that he appreciates that the substantial changes in the family income tests will be of real benefit for students in his community. I also know he appreciates that the government here is delivering a cost-neutral reform and that the aim is to have sustainability in the budget. Of course, we are in days of economic stimulus now, but that is economic stimulus at the time of the global recession; something like student financing is going to be in the forward estimates from now on for a very, very long time into the future. What we are endeavouring to put together is a package of reforms that is cost neutral on the forward estimates and that benefits more young Australians. But I anticipate that the member for New England will continue to raise these concerns with us and I look forward to that dialogue. I note that he has MAIN COMMITTEE always raised these concerns in a very constructive way and worked through them in a very honest and detailed way for members of his local community. SoI thank him for that. tion. In a ministerial statement on education, employment and workplace relations, on page 24 of the budget paper of 12 May, she announced, regarding phase 2: The remaining up to 222 early learning and care centres will be considered when the child care market is settled and based on the experience of the priority centres. There has been a considerable departure from the advice provided previously in this statement and in the fact sheet on the department website that states: … the remaining up to 222 ELCCs would be established progressively by the end of 2014 and delivered as part of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) National Partnership arrangements. My questions to the minister are as follows: (1) now that it appears that the commitment has been shelved indefinitely, can you outline exactly what criteria will be used to determine when the childcare market is settled; (2) if an assessment of how the first 38 centres are operating will form part of the decision on whether to proceed with the other 222 centres, does that mean that a decision will not be made until all 38 are operational? Presumably that will be well after 2011 and, therefore, long after the next election. The minister has created an out by saying that the 222 centres are contingent on the experience of the first 38 centres, hasn’t she? But she is not listening. This was not a caveat in Mr Rudd’s much publicised election promise to build 260 new centres to end the dreaded double drop-off, was it? She is still not listening. Regarding the work done on the government’s paid parental leave to date, did the government pay any external consultants to work on the response to the Productivity Commission’s report which was released with the budget? If yes, who were they and how much were they paid? If not, which department did the policy work and prepared the 29-page booklet, Australia’s paid parental leave scheme which was released on budget night? Of the $2.35 million budgeted for communication and evaluation expenses for the coming financial year, exactly how will that be spent given the scheme will not even be coming into effect until halfway through the following financial year? According to the FaHCSIA budget statement, it will be this department which administers the program. Has a special group or task force been assembled to manage the introduction of paid parental leave? If so, how many people are currently employed in that capacity and what number is that expected to grow to over the coming years? What role will FaHCSIA play in the implementation of the scheme, given that businesses will be paymasters? Is it expected that Centrelink or another body would administer the scheme? In other words, whom would businesses have to deal with in order to ensure that they received the advance payments so that they could pay their employees? On what modelling was the costing of the scheme based-was it the Productivity Commission’s or another body’s? On page 9 of the budget night booklet on paid parental leave it clearly states that an estimated 148,000 parents would be eligible for the PPL payments each year and it also says that they will on average be around $2,000 better off under the current arrangements. Taking into account tax payable and changes in family payments et cetera, is that correct? Without even taking into account the cost of administering the scheme, that would mean a net cost of $269 million a year. How does this equate with the claim on page 1 MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Asean And New Zealand Shows It Can Be Done
187,Mrs Mirabella (Indi) (6.13 Pm),"I have some questions for the Minister for Educathat the scheme would cost a total $721 million over five years, which is an average of $146 million a year. Even taking into account that the scheme will not start until mid-2011 does not that equal at least $1.036 billion not $721 million? While I understand there is a complex mixture of family payments affected, it is quite clear that either the figure of $721 million is incorrect or the claim that families will be better off by an average of $2,000 is incorrect. Even the government has said that 14 per cent of working families would be worse off under this scheme and will have the option to remain under the current scheme. Isn’t that correct? What are the factors that determine whether a family will be worse off? Part of it is timing, isn’t it? Women who take their paid parental leave in the last 18 weeks of the financial year are likely to lose more in tax and family payments than women who take it at the beginning, especially if they intend to take the full 12-months maternity leave as most women do. What consideration has been given to the impact on maternity services if women time their pregnancies for the beginning of the financial year to maximise their benefit? Has any research been conducted on how our hospital system would cope? Of those 14 per cent of working women who would be worse off taking paid parental leave, exactly how will they determine whether they want to take parental leave or not? How accurately will they be able to determine their entitlement and by what method? Will the $150,000 threshold be indexed? The $150,000 threshold applies to the primary carer’s income not to the family income-is that correct-could you please confirm? A woman who earns a tidy $140,000 and whose partner is a multimillionaire would be eligible for paid parental leave but a family couple who each earn around $78,000 are not eligible for the baby bonus-is that correct? The fact is that only around 127,000 families in any given year would receive the paid parental leave and the other 154,000 would not receive any additional benefit. So the majority of new mothers would not benefit from this new scheme-is that correct? I would like to clarify another point. On what modelling was the assumption made that this scheme would result in an increase of average leave taken by women after childbirth by around 10 weeks? Aren’t the objectives of increasing workforce participation between pregnancies and at the same time increasing the length of time spent by women caring for their children when they are very young almost mutually exclusive? Is the message really that only the first 18 weeks are important or that six months, the figure referred to in the government booklet, is the right amount of time? Isn’t it a fact, according to the Productivity Commission’s own report, that at least 83 per cent of Australian women already stay at home with their babies for the first six months? Is the message from the government to these 83 per cent of women that they ought to be heading back to the workforce after just six months? In examining this particular scheme has the government given any consideration to the social capital of those women who do not choose to take time out of the paid workforce for a period? What signal does the government send to women who are often the mainstays of our schools, community groups and sporting clubs that their efforts are important to the nation? Ms GILLARD (Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (6.19 pm)-On the many points raised by the member for Indi, I say as follows. She would be aware that there was a major disruption to the childcare market following the voluntary administration of ABC Learning. She would be aware of that from newspaper reports. She also may be aware of it because there were so MAIN COMMITTEE many Liberal Party members sitting around the board table of ABC Learning they could have had a branch meeting. They could have had a branch meeting at any time that they chose to whilst they were sitting there-including, of course, former minister Larry Anthony. So, if the member for Indi wishes to seek any advice about the nature of that disruption to the childcare market, she is not short of numbers in her telephone book to place a call to. AndI suggest that she does place that call. Of course, because of the policy and other settings of the former government when faced with the collapse of ABC Learning, we have had to sort out what was a huge mess. We have sorted it out piece by piece, bit by bit, working through it to give as much safety, certainty and security as we possibly could to Australian parents caught up in this. The shadow minister alludes to some centres that have closed. Yes, that is true: some centres have closed. But I invite her to consider what would have happened when ABC Learning announced it was going into voluntary administration if the Australian government had not stepped forward to ensure that there was an orderly process that worked its way through. At some point I would hope that members of the Liberal Party might volunteer some apologies to Australian parents who were caught up in that catastrophic corporate Liberal Party mix. On the paid parental leave questions that the member asked me, I would say the following. We are, of course, dealing with budget estimates here. I would suggest to the member for Indi that she may want to take a leaf out of the book of the member for Boothby. WhatI would say about the member for Boothby is that he is a very vociferous user of the questions on notice process. He appreciates thatDr Southcott interjectingBoothby to compare my record in delivering answers with the record of any Howard minister that he wants to pick at random and then come and have a conversation with me about whether or not we get him answers. If you have detailed things that you want answers to, I would recommend questions on notice to the member for Indi. She is obviously not sure about that. She may want to talk to the member for Boothby about it. The member for Indi raised a policy question. This is a government that supports choices by women and by families. This is a government that understands that families will make different decisions at the time that they have a child join their family. Some families will determine for the mother to take a period of time off and then return to the workforce. Some families will determine to take a longer period of time off. We support those choices and, consequently, the government’s policy settings support those choices. It may be useful for the member for Indi to know that, if there is at any point any suggestion that the Liberal Party is going to have a childcare policy, a policy about paid parental leave or a policy about anything else in her portfolio area-for example, preschool or early learning-then we are all ears for it. But we have not heard anything yet. With those words, I think we are at the conclusion of this session. CanI say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the time for this session has expired.

Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (6.23 pm)-I have a brief question to the Deputy Prime Minister. I would like to ask her about the $14.7 billion Building the Education Revolution, which she says will support jobs and which the department says is all about maximising jobs.

I would like her estimate of how many jobs will be created or supported by the $600 million Jobs Fund. I would like her estimate on how many jobs will be created for young Australians through the Compact with Young Australians. I also ask the minister: is she aware that, of the 85,000 places set aside for apprenticeships in the Productivity Places Program, only 154 places have been taken up? Does she regard this as a success? Does she regard this as a failure? What is she going to do about it? Ms GILLARD (Lalor-Deputy Prime Minister) (6.25 pm)-He has snuck one additional question in. I refer the member for Boothby to the macroeconomic forecasts in the budget papers, which make it perfectly clear-and it is something that his party should reflect onthat the government’s economic stimulus endeavours are supporting employment. The difference is more than 200,000 jobs. The difference is a difference of 1½ per cent in the unemployment rate at what is predicted to be the peak of unemployment. That is very important in supporting Australians who want to work and in supporting their families. I think it is to be regretted that the Liberal Party did not see its way clear to support this economic stimulus and the jobs that it is supporting. I refer him to those macroeconomic forecasts. On the Productivity Places Program, this program is working well. He knows that in fact it has been very, very strongly sought after. Indeed, so sought after has the program been that one of the common complaints I suspect he gets is from registered training organisations who want more places and rapid delivery. He would be aware that in this budget we are investing more than $5 billion in apprenticeships and related measures. Proposed expenditure-$7,601,757-agreed to.

(Time expired) Mr Steve Gianola Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.41 pm)-I would like to pay tribute to a long-time Labor Party member, Steve Gianola, who sadly passed away on 13 April 2009 aged 79. Steve was born at Mornington Mills near Wokalup in the south-west of Western Australia, the son of Italian migrants. Steve joined the Western Australian railways at 17 and became a steam locomotive driver at 25, just like his idol, the great Ben Chifley. He joined the Australian Labor Party in 1956 and was very active in both the railway union and the Labor Party. In 1969 Steve was struck by what Chifley described as a ‘shaft of fate’ when he suffered heart trouble and could no longer work as an engine driver. Fortunately, he could find salaried work with the State Energy Commission as a floor supervisor at Muja and then as a turbine driver at the Bunbury Power Station until he retired in 1991. Steve held many union and party executive positions and worked on all Labor campaigns in the Collie and Bunbury area, including my own unsuccessful bid for the state seat of Mitchell in the December 1996 election. I have very fond memories of Steve, who was always cheerful and would do anything to help. Steve was a very active branch and community worker and a Labor true believer in every sense of the phrase. Steve will be sadly missed by his family, the Eaton and Australind community and members of the ALP’s Australind branch and Forrest electorate council. He is survived by his wife, Betty June; a son and daughter; and five grandchildren. Maternity Services my electorate who came to see me about their concerns over the Rudd government’s failure to accommodate the needs of women choosing to birth at home with a private midwife. Midwives, of course, have a concern that after this budget they will not be allowed to attend home births due to the new national registration of health professionals planned to be implemented in July 2010. Of course, midwives are the only health professionals without any indemnity insurance, despite $500 million being given in 2001, and this appears to me to be an extremely valid concern. I want to note here that since 1993 the UK’s official policy has been that women should have more choice in the place of birth, and this is a position which the coalition supports. We certainly support the choice of childbirth options for women. The government has not resolved this situation despite it being noted in the maternity services review, and from listening to the experiences of these midwives and mothers within my electorate I can understand their concern. Despite an overwhelming 53 per cent of responses to the recent maternity services review advocating more accessible home birth services, the outcome of the review appears to MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Statements By Members

An Iranian analyst has reported that in the Iranian election there is no requirement to vote near one’s residence. Voter turnout at a particular voting station or even in a city can theoretically exceed the estimated number of eligible voters in that locality. A person’s voting eligibility is determined by a birth certificate. In previous elections, reports surfaced that the Imam Khomeini committee, a large state charity affiliated with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, rented birth cards (BCs) belonging to the poor. According to the National Organisation for Civil Registration, the number of birth certificates considerably exceeds the number of Iranians. Many birth certificates are issued as replacements for reportedly lost ones and there is little to prevent people using duplicate BCs to vote at two different polling stations. The victory of the Ahmadinejad regime was described by a very knowledgeable analyst this lunchtime as ‘regime change’.

If the states did not improve their performance, he would take over the public health system. Well, since the Rudd government was elected, the public health system in New South Wales has continued to deteriorate, particularly along the North Coast. The North Coast Area Health Service is currently cutting 400 jobs, and hospitals such as Maclean in my electorate are being subjected to cutbacks. This is the hospital that the local community has been supporting for many decades. Over the past 18 months the local area health service has tried to sell off land at Maclean hospital. They are also attempting to erode the status of the hospital by abolishing the dual position of executive officer-director of nursing and making staff accountable to Grafton hospital, around 40 minutes drive away. The area health service is also planning to lay off permanent night security staff at the hospital, which means staff will no longer have the reassurance that they have the support of security staff in times of emergencies.

John Curtin Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.47 pm)-John Curtin, former federal member for Fremantle and one of our greatest prime ministers, was an extraordinary figure in Australian history. He and his family lived in a modest house at 24 Jarrad Street, Cottesloe, which was then located in the federal electorate of Fremantle. The home in which the Curtin family lived for many years did not receive the attention it deserved. It sadly deteriorated over time and has not been open to the public. On 22 May the federal government announced that $580,000 from the heritage component of the Jobs Fund would be allocated to restore John Curtin’s house and preserve its history under the care of the National Trust of Australia WA and Curtin University of Technology. As Senator John Faulkner said when announcing the funds: … this ordinary Australian home is, I think, part of an extraordinary Australian story. It tells us about the private life of a very public figure. After making a speech, after meeting electors, after campaign meetings, this is the place John Curtin came back to for a cuppa or a sing-along or to read the newspaper or listen to the wireless. … … … This house tells us a great deal about why. It is part of our national story. Its preservation will allow many more Australians to know and understand more about one of our greatest leaders. As the current member for Fremantle and as a proud member of the Labor Party, to which Curtin gave so much, I am pleased, as are my constituents, that this house will be preserved and recognised as an important part of our nation’s history. Budget union pressure to abolish the ABCC, the Prime Minister said: We will be adhering to our pre-election commitment. … … … I take absolutely seriously my commitment to the Australian people prior to the last election. It was given explicitly on this question … Sorry, Prime Minister. Your pre-election commitments cannot be taken seriously. In the leadup to the last election, the PM was asked time and time again whether he would change the private health insurance rebate. Again and again he and his health minister said there would be no change. Never was an election promise given more emphatically and then broken so brazenly. Standing at Lavarack Barracks, Townsville on 12 November 2007, Kevin Rudd promised to increase defence spending by at least three per cent in real terms annually to 2016.

We were joined by some 211 seniors in the electorate. A good time was had by all as we sang along, drank cups of tea and enjoyed some of the local produce of my seat of Hasluck. In addition to that, many seniors brought along items for raffle as well as a bric-a-brac stall and a cake display. Those seniors, many of whom are doing it hard themselves, in conjunction with the morning tea managed to raise over $1,500. I want to thank them for that terrific effort on behalf of the Cancer Council of Australia and I look forward to next year’s annual Biggest Morning Tea in Forrestfield. My thanks go to the Woodlupine Seniors Committee for their terrific efforts on behalf of all seniors in my electorate of Hasluck. Cowan Electorate: Flaming Evangelical Ministry Flaming Evangelical Ministry. Flaming Evangelical Ministry is dedicated to the salvation of mankind and was founded in 1997 in Freetown in Sierra Leone by Bishop Frederick Abu Koroma. It is a strong church in that country. I met Bishop Koroma and while speaking at the church I expressed my view that he should be proud of what has been achieved by the leadership and members of the church, guided as they are by their faith. The ministry sees its mission as reaching beyond the church walls. In Sierra Leone, the Flaming Evangelical Ministry is involved in community development projects. Apart from education, it also helps the poor, disabled and needy. In Australia the ministry’s objective is to advance the Christian faith and bring people to a wholesome relationship with Jesus Christ. Their first church, established in the electorate of Cowan, was established to give hope to those who need it, specifically those of African origin. In Cowan, the church is led by Reverend Moses and his Assistant Pastor Sheriff. The church is assisted by the departmental team leaders, Amie Konneh, Princess Fahnbulleh, Paul Nawah and Beatrice Paye. The deacons are Thomas Gooding, Ares Ambarie, and Kelin Sesay. The elders are Catherine Rogers, Francess Kosseh and Jessie Kosseh. The church leaders were commissioned at the ceremony. There were more than 100 people present at the church. The people who have come from Africa have had difficult lives. Death and brutality is no stranger to many of them yet the members of the Flaming Evangelical church are strong of character and are further strengthened by their faith. They reach out to younger Africans.

Powers of Intervention Debate resumed, on motion by Dr Stone: That the House: (1) notes that under section 417 of the Migration Act 1958, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship may intervene personally making decisions in relation to individuals; (2) encourages the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to urgently resolve his ambivalence about using these ministerial powers of intervention, given the consequences for individuals and families whose urgent requests for intervention remain unresolved, in some cases for nearly a year; and (3) requests that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship responds to the report he commissioned analysing the use of ministerial powers (the Elizabeth Proust Report) which has been with him since 29 January 2008. Dr STONE (Murray) (6.55 pm)-This is a matter of immigration ministerial discretion. The key intervention elements of the migration framework that were put in place in 1989 under former Senator Robert Ray included making sure that, besides the actual departmental review processes, there was a case where a minister could intervene. The view at the time was one that is still held by the coalition; that is, it is a sovereign right of the elected government to decide who meets the criteria to come to the country and remain. However, in recognition of the rigidity of the regulations criteria, the coalition in opposition supported the inclusion of a capacity for the Minister for Immigration to exercise his or her personal discretion to make a favourable decision but only after the application had been through a review process. The power is recognised as an important element in delivering a fair outcome in circumstances where the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is confronted with a very complex set of human circumstances. Since his earliest days in the ministry, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, has made a big deal about his ambivalence in using the ministerial discretion which goes with his office. In a number of speeches he has talked about not wanting to play God. For example at the national members conference of the Immigration and Refugee Review Tribunals in February 2008 he said: One of the first things that struck me when I took on this role was what extraordinary powers I had the deportation of long term residents with criminal convictions-to whether or not a new born baby can be allowed to live with his mother in community detention.

199,As Minister. The Range Of Powers From Determining The Character Of A Person,"such as Dr Haneef-toYet ministerial intervention offers no guarantee of fairness. This is quite an extraordinary statement: an unelected bureaucrat would be fairer than a minister elected by the people and accountable to the people. That is what the minister appeared to be saying. He goes on to say: Maybe it is because I am new to the portfolio but my inclination is to support independent, transparent and appealable decision making in the resolution of immigration matters. He goes on to say: And if we are to limit the ministerial propensity to intervene, it is essential that there be public confidence in the legal system’s ability to provide just and speedy outcomes in migration and refugee cases. Quite clearly the minister is saying he has a better scheme in mind for cases which have been rejected by the tribunals, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal, and perhaps he is developing a long-term argument about there being a better way to deal with these cases. He asked Ms Elizabeth Proust to undertake a review, which she did, but that has now been languishing with the minister for 18 months without any response whatsoever. Despite all this posturing and the endless words about a new regime, when it comes to exercising ministerial intervention, it has come to the coalition’s attention that Minister Evans has in fact used his interventionary powers a staggering 1,000 times in the 18 months since he took office. When I say ‘used his interventionary powers’, that means he has overturned decisions of the tribunals or the courts over 1,000 times in 18 months. In the 18 months from September 2007 to March 2009, Minister Evans exercised his discretion 647 times under section 417 of the act and 347 times under section 351 of the act. In total therefore the minister who ‘doesn’t want to play God,’ he says, ‘who doubts that he can deliver a fair outcome compared to others’ has overturned the decisions of the MRT and RRT over 1,000 times. Over 1,000 people who were found not to be refugees or who were to have their visas cancelled have had these decisions, made by the tribunals or by the courts, overturned by Minister Evans. Let us compare this rate of intervention with others. Minister Ruddock intervened in 1,916 cases out of 27,000 between 1996-97 and 2003. Before that we had Labor ministers intervene much less. We call on this minister to tell us what is going on, what does he want to do and is he establishing an alternative system? If so, let us know so that it can be transparent and fair. We just do not know the how and why of his behaviour. This is the most extraordinary rate of interventions since any minister has been sworn in. (Time expired) Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (7.00 pm)-I find this an extraordinary proposition being promoted by the shadow minister for immigration tonight. It is quite an absurd motion that she has put forward. It is predicated on a number of falsehoods and completely disregards the facts. One could argue perhaps that this is not inconsistent with her past form in that it also offers no policy direction for the future and provides no clue as to the shadow minister’s own views about how ministerial intervention powers are and should be used. At least she was accurate in the part where she quoted from the Hon. Chris Evans’ speech to members of the Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal when he talked about his concerns regarding the use of section 417 ministerial intervention powers. He indicates that this is something that struck him very much when he first became the minister, because of the extraordinary powers that he had. He raises a number of concerns about how much the minister’s involvement had become commonplace in individual cases and that there MAIN COMMITTEE had been a substantial expansion in requests over the preceding decade. For example, he cited that in 2006-07 over 4,000 requests for ministerial interventions were received by the department, and he contrasted that with earlier years: in a two-year period Minister Gerry Hand handled only 81 applications for the exercise of discretion. Senator Nick Bolkus, during his three years as minister, handled 311 and Philip Ruddock intervened on 2,513 occasions from 1996 to October 2003. The minister raised a couple of concerns. One was that it has become almost part and parcel of the immigration system-thanks to the previous government-that there is an expectation now that, as a matter of substance and form, there is an additional avenue for any individual to pursue their application for a visa and that is to make an individual complaint to the minister, which is quite a departure from what had previously existed. His other concern, which he clearly raised, was that there is no other minister with similar powers of intervention. Indeed, I am sure we would all agree with him. Let us say the minister for social security had this power. IfI were not happy with a Centrelink payment, the minister could intervene and grant a Centrelink payment-or, indeed, the Treasurer. IfI did not like my Australian Taxation Office result, should the Treasurer have such extraordinary powers? These powers are part of a process to deal with exceptional circumstances such as in the nation’s security. The minister himself says that he appreciates that it is appropriate in circumstances for the minister for immigration to have those powers. It is one thing to be exercising them in terms of a national security matter-a check on the system, in my opinion; it is quite another thing when it becomes just another avenue which an individual may pursue. To know that there are regularly some 2,000-odd appeals for ministerial intervention in the system is staggering. Frankly, I think the minister has done the right thing in putting in place a process to begin to address this very system. The allegation of the shadow minister that the government has not responded to the Proust report handed down in July 2008 is absolute nonsense. Indeed, the minister has, on a number of occasions, indicated what steps have been taken with respect to the six recommendations made by the report.The shadow minister may like to examine the minister’s media release of 9 July 2008 where it talks about the ministerial intervention powers under review and the steps he has taken since he commissioned the report to restore the integrity and transparency in the system of ministerial intervention after concerns were raised about the process. She may find that extremely instructive to her in her role as shadow minister. It is absurd to suggest that the minister has taken no action on the Proust report and it is absurd to suggest that the minister has been unclear. (Time expired) of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in relation to individual immigration cases. This issue is very important because the exercising of ministerial discretion and intervention in the cases of individuals whose circumstances fall outside the letter of the law allows a minister to take a humane and compassionate approach in such cases. It is the reality, and a necessary reality at that, that it is up to the government to decide who comes to this country; it is not up to the unelected courts. That is why we have laws that allow the immigration minister to take action and allow a person to be granted a visa, even when the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal has already decided otherwise. As the member for Cowan, I see a lot of success stories that have arisen from the successful migration of those who have embraced the values and the institutions of our society. I see MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Private Members Business
200,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (7.05 Pm),"This motion is about the exercising of the discretionwhole communities, such as the Vietnamese in Cowan, who greatly appreciate the freedoms and the opportunities that Australia allows them. Also in Cowan, the great heritage of Italian migration is evident across the electorate in the businesses, the history and even the resulting road signs that commemorate that heritage. The Italians and the Vietnamese are examples of the success of our immigration system, yet it is the case that such success was achieved under a system of immigration whose integrity was maintained through the policies of the former coalition government. While I am concerned that the same systemic integrity is now being eroded by the Rudd government, this matter is about individual cases that fall outside the anticipations of law. This matter is about the ordinary men, women and children whose cases do not fit the template and guidelines that exist. It is a good opportunity to raise one of these cases. It may just be a name on a form residing within the bureaucracy; it may just be a name and another case on a letter in the minister’s office. But this is a big issue for that person, their family and their friends. I speak on behalf of John Gagliardo, one such case where a man and his family and a lot of friends are in need of ministerial intervention and the granting of residency. John Gagliardo is a citizen of the United States. He first visited Australia in 1982 as a tourist. He returned in 1984, was employed on a mine site and chose not to leave Australia when his visa expired. Of course I do not condone that action, but the case of John Gagliardo is a case where one man, although doing the wrong thing almost 25 years ago, has nevertheless added great value to this country since then. John Gagliardo worked through till his 70s, when he retired to Fremantle. He paid taxes but did not claim through Medicare or other benefits. Since his retirement, he has lived from his savings and from the proceeds of a United States pension. John has been a giver to this country and never a taker; economically, he has added value to Australia and never been a burden. Beyond the economics of his case, there has been a social side to John Gagliardo’s life. His younger sister Leona and her husband Edward are my constituents. Leona has told me how much John is part of not only her life but also the lives of her children and grandchildren. I have seen the family photos and heard the accounts and strong endorsements from John’s friends about the part he plays in their lives. In 2006, after a doctor’s visit and being unable to provide a Medicare card, John Gagliardo came to the attention of the department of immigration. His application to stay was first rejected by the department and then rejected by the MRT. There is just one final chance for John, and that is the intervention of the minister. So here is a good example of where the minister can do the right thing and exercise his power for an individual, his family and a great many friends. In looking at the guidelines for the exercising of ministerial powers, I clearly see the strong compassionate circumstances of damaging a close-knit Australian family. I also see grounds to allow John Gagliardo to stay based upon the time he spent in Australia and, by all reports, adding great value with his presence. Finally, I see that to repatriate him, after 25 years, to the United States, a country he rejected in favour of Australia, would not be compassionate based upon the harm and hardship it would cause to him. I reiterate that the exercising of these powers by the minister is important, and, in my view, he should do so in the case of John Gagliardo. The minister has acted a great many times in the last 18 months-over a thousand times-and, although the manner in which ministerial intervention occurred in certain cases under the former Labor government is questionable, this is a great example of where it should MAIN COMMITTEE be exercised for the right sort of person who has always had the right sort of values but has made just one mistake. is important to make clear the government’s position on section 417 ministerial intervention powers. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has said openly that he believes section 417, and other ministerial powers like it, give him too much power. He argues that you would not expect a minister for social security to make decisions on an individual’s pension or a Treasurer to make a decision on your tax return and nor would the public accept such interventions as appropriate. That is an entirely legitimate political view of the whole issue of ministerial intervention and immigration. The member for Murray charges the minister with ambivalence in relation to his powers of ministerial intervention. However, it should be pointed out that on 26 February this year the minister stated: Let us be clear on this. There is no question that as long as those powers in the act are available to the minister I will exercise them in accordance with my responsibilities. In that regard the figures speak for themselves. In 2008 the minister finalised 2,241 ministerial intervention cases. That exceeds the number finalised in 2007, which was 1,840, and in 2006, which was 2,113. These statistics show that the minister has been getting on with making decisions while ministerial intervention powers remain available, and, in parallel, pursuing appropriate reforms. It is just a political discussion, Member for Murray; I do not know why you are so agitated about a minister having open views about exercising his discretion. The member for Murray in her motion seeks to request the minister to respond to the Proust report. The short answer to this is that the minister has responded to it by taking appropriate action, and this work is ongoing. This may be an unfamiliar approach for those opposite, who over 3½ years ignored the Senate select committee, as Ms Proust observed: It is surprising that so little use has been made of the report … By way of contrast, aspects of some of the recommendations in the Proust report had already been acted on by the time the report was released. For example, the minister noted in his media release, as the member for Hasluck said, that he had already taken steps to delegate some of the powers that he was able to delegate to the department in line with recommendation 3 in the Proust report. Other recommendations have been fully implemented since the report was released. For example, recommendation 1 of the Proust report, ‘that the department commence immediately the practice of providing a recommendation on each file going to the minister for a decision’, was fully implemented some time ago. Aspects of recommendation 2, which relates to improving transparency and confidence in current arrangements, have also been implemented. The minister has also acted upon recommendation 5, which recommends that almost all discretions currently exercised personally by the minister be delegated either to the department or to the Refugee Review Tribunal for appropriate review and oversight. The Rudd Labor government expects to introduce legislation to bring in complementary protection later this year. Ms Proust noted that a system of complementary protection: … has the advantage of transparency, efficiency, accountability and, for the applicant, gives more certainty and reduces the time involved in the processing.

Instead we heard from the member for Murray, as soon as parliament rose after the budget was announced, that the sky would fall in if we allowed people who faced the risk of torture or death to apply for a visa and have any decision to refuse the visa reviewed. However, we should not be surprised at the opposition’s actions on this at that time. We have seen the opposition playing politics with the tragic events that claimed the lives of five people in April near Ashmore Reef. The member for Murray has continuously made claims in relation to the government’s change in policy on asylum seekers and made claims that are patently not correct about Labor cutting resources for border protection. In fact, the figures on government expenditure show a slight increase, and they are published on my website. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, the member for Murray endorsed the reforms announced in our first report in December. She also criticised the abolition of the temporary protection visas but could not say whether she would reintroduce them. She supported the closure of the Nauru and Manus Island detention centres, yet her colleagues have left open the possibility of reopening the Pacific solution. As opposition spokesman, the only policy she has announced in 18 months is that she will hold an inquiry. I can only endorse the paeans of praise made by the member for Cowan and the member for Murray about Greek, Italian, Vietnamese and other immigrants in Australia. But you cannot condemn the minister for being ambivalent and then question him for making all these interventions. (Time expired) expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Foot-and-Mouth Disease Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Bruce Scott: That the House: (1) notes that the report of the Beale review of Australia’s quarantine and biosecurity arrangements, One Biosecurity: a working partnership, includes recommendation 59 relating to the importation, subject to strict conditions, of the live foot and mouth virus for use in research; (2) recognises that the risks associated with such importation far outweigh the possible benefits of research; and (3) calls on the: (a) Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to unequivocally and indefinitely reject recommendation 59 of the ‘Beale Report’; and (b) Government to indefinitely and wholly prohibit the introduction of any live culture sample of foot and mouth disease for research or any other purpose. mouth disease were to ever enter our shores. I know there are some reports that it was perhaps in Australia in the very early 1800s, at a time when there was limited scientific evidence and limited records kept, but we must look at the fact that we have been free of this disease for more than 130 years.

203,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (7.16 Pm),"Australia would be devastated if foot-andworld-class reputation as producers of clean, green and high-quality pork, beef, veal, lamb, venison and dairy products, but this could all be destroyed if Australia were to experience an outbreak of this devastating and highly contagious disease. The most severe foot-and-mouth disease outbreak on record happened in 2001 in England. It caused a devastating loss of more than A$19 billion to the British economy and to the farmers. Some five million sheep, 764,000 cattle and 435,000 pigs and goats-a total of more than six million animals-were destroyed because of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. On top of the economic loss, it is estimated that the cost to the British government for the clean-up and for compensation for slaughtered animals was A$6 billion. But no compensation can ever replace the genetic potential of the animals that are lost forever, genetics that have been bred up over years and years. Should an outbreak happen in Australia, the genetics would be lost because the only control method is the total destruction of all affected animals. The devastating aspect of this disease is that, because it is so highly contagious, any animal that comes in contact with infected animals or is believed to have come into contact with infected animals must sadly be destroyed. If Australia were to experience an outbreak, we may find it difficult to contain due to our large feral pig, camel and goat populations. Imagine trying to clean up coastal areas where we have large populations of feral pigs-or feral goats, as is the case further west-during a wet season when you have to deal with the disruption to roads and the flooding that goes on. There is the potential for those feral animals to transport the disease over wide distances. It would be difficult to control and would add to the complexity. Imagine the loss of the genetic potential of our superior gene stock in Australia. This year in May we had Beef 2009 in Rockhampton-one of the major events for the beef industry. People and breeders from many countries around the world came to Rockhampton to Beef 2009 to look at the superior genetics that we have in our beef herds in Australia-another major export earner for Australia. Of course, if there were a foot-and-mouth outbreak these superior ones would be caught up as well. It does not discriminate; there would be total destruction of all the animals in the infected area. Just before Christmas last year, when the minister released the Beale report entitled One Biosecurity: a working partnership, I can assure you that word spread as fast as the potential that this disease has to spread that the report recommended the importation of a positive controlled sample of the virus for research purposes and that the Rudd government-and this is from the minister-had given its in-principle agreement to the recommendation. Farmers and their representative bodies, such as AgForce, the Cattle Council of Australia and the Australian Beef Association, were understandably up in arms about the possibility of this disease entering our shores. One can certainly not accuse them of overreacting. The 2007 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in England-which came after the 2001 outbreak-was shown to have come from a secure animal health laboratory where the virus was held. After the 2001 outbreak in England the British beef processors were unable to resume trading for five years. Imagine how those affected UK farmers must have felt when in 2007 they were hit with this disease again. Imagine being part of an industry that was probably still repairing the damage done by the devastating 2001 outbreak only to cop it again because of a breach in what was a so-called secure MAIN COMMITTEE animal health laboratory. It was the only known location in the United Kingdom where that particular strain was held. A report into the outbreak concluded that the virus had leaked out from drainage at the facility, which contaminated the surrounding soil and then was spread to a nearby farm on the wheels of cars. How easily it can spread-an accidental outbreak occurring from a so-called high-security animal health laboratory! That gives members here an idea of how devastatingly contagious this disease is. In a somewhat fortunate turn for the British farmers, because it was caught reasonably quickly, it was able to be contained to a number of farms. Nonetheless, it was devastating for the affected farmers. According to the President of Britain’s National Farmers Union, Peter Kendall: The effects of the outbreak were crippling for livestock farmers-milk had to be poured away, herds that had taken generations to breed had to be slaughtered, high quality livestock couldn’t be exported or sold for breeding and instead had to go to slaughter, and animals couldn’t be moved to fresh grazing and had to be left where they were. They had to be left where they were if they were anywhere within the containment area, or they were destroyed. I still have visions in my mind of the fires when these animals were being destroyed. They were being burnt in situ, where they were, because that is one of the control measures. I would hate to ever see that sort of thing on our shores. In accordance with the EU requirements, a total ban on the export of UK animal and meat products from susceptible species was imposed and it was only in December 2007 that the EU export restrictions were lifted. The World Organisation for Animal Health did not reinstate the country’s foot-and-mouth disease-free status until February last year. That outbreak cost the farming industry in the UK some £100 million and insurmountable losses. Imagine if that had happened here in Australia. Imagine if our farmers were locked out of the global trade for even a year. Regional and rural communities would be economically gutted. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry estimates that a worse-case Australian foot-and-mouth disease infection would cost between $8 billion and $13 billion of gross domestic product. They are government figures; they are the department’s figures. The emotional toll on farmers who have long been battling the drought could not be calculated if they were to then have their animals destroyed as a result of an outbreak of foot-andmouth disease. That is why the unequivocal and indefinite rejection of recommendation 59 of the Beale report is so important to the peace of mind of Australia’s livestock producers. I acknowledge that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said that the Rudd government would only allow the importation of a live virus of foot-and-mouth disease if an outbreak in Australia had already occurred. I have got to say that is after the horse has bolted, and that comment also concerned me. I note that the government intends to replace the 100-year-old Quarantine Act of 1908 with new legislation. I call on Minister Burke to use this opportunity when drafting our new quarantine legislation to make explicit and indefinite prohibition on the importation of foot-andmouth virus for research purposes or, indeed, any other purpose, regardless of whether or not there has been an outbreak. We do not need to bring a live sample into this country. The Australian government scientists are already involved in offshore research in countries which have foot-and-mouth. We do not need to bring it onto our shores. Our billion dollar agricultural industry cannot afford the risk. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE spent some of my youth out in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa, in shearing shedsMr Bruce Scott-That long ago! The issue of the report on biosecurity is an important one. It is a report of some good work and it needs the full attention of the parliament and the government. To put the words importer risk analysis and the national interest into some context for the member’s motion, you really cannot have the full national interest of what the cost is to the government and to the country from losing costs and benefits. I think the panel would be quite happy to look at that approach but, of course, it is not consistent with the broader implications. I think the panel that wrote the report noted that the approach would not be consistent with Australia’s obligation under the SPS Agreement with the World Trade Organisation. You start to get into those trade restriction requirements and issues of non-tariff barriers et cetera. Australia has an important and strong interest in having a less restrictive agriculture trade environment in the world-and we lead some of those fights. The Cairns Group, others and trade ministers have fought those battles and we have a managing role to keep together our trade in the world for not only agriculture but lots of other things that we produce. We are an exporting country; our wealth comes from exports. So we have to really approach these things in a pretty sophisticated manner. I saw the words of the panel in the report on dealing with that full national interest issue and it is an important one. With the problems with the quarantine system, we looked at border protection since 1901. Keeping things out, stopping everything and zero tolerance have really been our thinking up until now, but that has changed over the last 20 years. People still think that, and our legislation reflects that. There is a need to look at things in a much broader way. We do have to come to grips with risk analysis. We need to look at where things come from in the world and at the risks and then make some analysis. That is the important issue. All of the problems with the quarantine system, which has been around a long time, have led the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to seek an independent review to provide Australia with a more rigorous system to minimise the risk of pests and diseases entering our country. With globalisation and climate change the threats are enormously increased. We need to take them seriously and deal with them. With the present swine flu we think even more so about the increased international movement of people and goods, particularly from the areas that present higher biosecurity risks, and about the complications in identifying the risks at borders. In my own state of Tasmania we have had fights about salmon and other things. We are an island on the periphery of this big island. We have fewer bugs and other things than many other areas. Our communities have a very high awareness of the value of biosecurity in securing access to quality-conscious, high-value and niche markets, especially overseas. We have done very well as a state in that area and hope to do well in the future. Being free of certain pathogens and other things in the biosecurity area gives us that opportunity. We need very tight security across the country to ensure that foreign pathogens do not enter unexpectedly. We must be prepared. I believe we can be.

205,Mr Adams,"A long time ago. It was a great experience and I remember it well.Beale report, an independent review on quarantine and biosecurity arrangements. The government’s preliminary response is to accept the recommendations of the review in principle. Minister Burke felt that the report was an important step in this government’s commitment to improve Australia’s biosecurity scheme. It provides a comprehensive blueprint for meeting the biosecurity challenges of the future. While we agreed in principle, further detailed considerations will be critical to implementing the new scheme. The honourable member for Maranoa raised recommendation 59. There will always be concerns about the implications of importing the foot-and-mouth virus or any other pathogen. However, he may have misinterpreted what the minister for agriculture said. He has already stated that the government would only consider importing live foot-and-mouth virus samples if there was an actual outbreak in Australia and it was advised that importing samples would contribute to the eradication of the disease. He was pretty specific. The report went further to say that, should an import permit application for foot-and-mouth disease virus be proposed, there would be extensive consultation with industry and other stakeholders before lodgement of a formal request. So, although the government’s response may take a while, the in-principle agreement to recommendation 59 should not be interpreted as automatic entry for, or agreement to, the importation of any disease agent, including the foot-and-mouth disease virus. Currently, there is no such application before government and the government does not intend to support any application at this stage. If we had to deal with an actual outbreak of footand-mouth then we might need to allow the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong to take undertake diagnostic research and be prepared for dealing with the crisis. We know that this has proved valuable in work that was done during the highly pathogenic avian influenza and, in 2008, in the case of the equine influenza outbreak. The Geelong laboratory was able to quickly confirm and identify the virus by using reference strains held in secure storage. The laboratory’s access to virus agents enabled a faster and more effective response than would otherwise have been the case and the rapidity of the response was critically important to Australia’s success in the eradication of the disease. I understand the member’s concern and I would be one of the first to stand up for the strictest biosecurity regime, but we are still getting dangerous pathogens here, despite all. I do not see that we are going to get rid of those by thinking-(Time expired) porting my colleague, the member for Maranoa, on what is a very important issue. I acknowledge the comments from the member for Lyons as well. There is probably agreement that foot-and-mouth disease poses probably one of the greatest threats if it came through to livestock production in Australia. I believe the recommendation in the Beale report to allow live virus into the country, even though it says ‘after an outbreak has occurred’, sends a mixed message and we need to make sure that we are unequivocal in the stand we take. Agriculture and livestock, even in this economic downturn, is the one thing that did not reduce in the balance of payments. Indeed, carrying Australia to a large degree at the moment are our agricultural exports. We need to protect these at all costs. In 2006-07 Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries contributed $38.5 billion to the national economy and employed more than 270,000 people in rural and regional areas. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry estimates that a worse-case Australian foot-and-mouth disease infection would cost up to $13 billion. Almost all of our animal exports would cease immediMAIN COMMITTEE",200,Private Members Business
206,Mr Coulton (Parkes) (7.36 Pm),"I am very pleased to be standing here tonight supately and there would be a huge drop in demand for animal products on the domestic market. The tourist industry has suffered dramatically in every country where a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak has occurred. It goes without saying that we would see widespread losses in employment and Australia’s rural economy would be devastated. WhatI would like to focus briefly on tonight is that Australia is uniquely at risk. If footand-mouth disease came to Australia, we would not be able to control it. In the United Kingdom and other countries where foot-and-mouth disease has been in the past, they are relatively intensive, tightly managed agricultural units. The biggest threat that we have is if it got into the wild pig population. We are at risk. It would only take a seaman at Kooragang Island in Newcastle Harbour to throw the remains of his sandwich overboard with a bit of salami or something that he has brought with him from Brazil or wherever he has come from, and it could be picked up by the wild pigs. Just in my own area, north-west New South Wales, and from my own personal experience, I know that several neighbours and I, employing a helicopter, have shot up to 500 pigs in one morning. That is without having any obvious signs; you never see them. The other thing about wild pigs is that they will travel 20 to 30 kilometres in one night in search of food, so they would spread this rapidly. There is no part of Australia, except maybe in the driest of deserts, where they are not a problem. I see the member for Solomon and the member for Flynn here, and I am sure they are very well aware of this and that, even in the tropical paradises that they come from, wild pigs would be a huge problem. Mr Adams interjectingturn them into a delicious treat of some sort. But I digress. In the United Kingdom there is a commercial vaccine production company that has the full nine strains of foot-and-mouth disease on file. They can have up to half a million cattle-equivalent doses for each of the nine strains, and if an outbreak were to occur we would have access to that within a matter of hours. While I understand the words the minister has said-that this would only be imported if an outbreak occurred-I think that is a slightly wavering message, and I would urge that they reword point No. 59 in the bill report so that there can be no mixed messages on the point that the live virus of foot-and-mouth disease should not be imported into Australia. culture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke, has clearly stated that there is only one case in which the government would consider importing live foot-and-mouth virus samples, and that is if there were an actual outbreak in Australia and the government were advised that importing samples would contribute to the eradication of the disease. It is no secret that the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong already holds a limited number of exotic viruses that it has used for a number of years under strict conditions for diagnostic research and disease preparedness. The Australian Animal Health Laboratory is the only facility in Australia which has the appropriate biocontainment capacity for handling the virus. Professor Alan Bell, chief of CSIRO Livestock Industries, has recently advised that the laboratory has no plans to seek permission to import live foot-and-mouth virus for research purposes. It should be noted, however, that the government has been advised that it may be useful to have imported pure strains to produce test antigens depending on the size of the response required. Some have suggested that the government could rely on the overseas laboratory in MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Private Members Business

208,Mr Trevor (Flynn) (7.41 Pm),"Firstly, for the record, I say that the Minister for AgriThailand to carry out all necessary work related to FMD. However, that laboratory does not possess every possible known strain of FMD. Therefore, with respect, it is an act of gross vandalism by the opposition to suggest that the government rely on the work done by a foreign government to respond to an FMD outbreak in Australia. This motion-specifically clause 3-states quite clearly that we should not do all we possibly can to respond in the most effective way to an FMD outbreak. Again, with respect, the coalition’s record on quarantine and biosecurity is terrible. Let us take some examples. Firstly, there was the equine influenza outbreak. Despite many warnings from the horse-racing sector and veterinarians, the Howard government presided over a quarantine system which was dysfunctional, leading to the equine influenza outbreak in August 2007. Indeed, in the past 10 years alone, on the coalition’s watch we saw white spot disease in prawns in Darwin in 2000; black sigatoka in bananas in 2001; fire ants in 2001; small hive beetle affecting bees in 2002; sugar cane smut in 2006; equine influenza; and citrus canker disease in 2004 in my electorate of Flynn, in Emerald. Citrus canker, an exotic bacterial disease of citrus and other related plants, was detected in the Emerald district in June 2004. As the member for Maranoa will recall, it had a devastating impact on the Emerald community, which he once served. A pest quarantine area was established in July 2004 to prevent further spread and facilitate eradication of the disease. During 2004 and 2005 all high-risk host plants of citrus canker were removed from the pest quarantine area. Australia produces close to 700,000 tonnes of citrus each year. Citrus production is valued at $420 million annually. Major markets for Australian citrus include Hong Kong, Malaysia, the United States, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Taiwan, Canada and Korea. Citrus canker was declared eradicated from Queensland by the national management group on 23 January this year. All other states and territories have agreed to remove all citrus canker related movement and market access restrictions. As with the system that eradicated citrus canker, the Rudd Labor government recognises the importance of a rigorous system to minimise the risk of pests and disease, particularly as globalisation and climate change increase these threats. The government is now working towards implementing the reforms outlined in the Beale report, which are aimed at building a better system which fosters partnerships, improves governance structures and targets risks. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (7.46 pm)-I am extremely concerned at the Rudd Labor government’s decision to allow foot-and-mouth disease virus to be imported into Australia in any circumstances. We need to draw a very firm line on this issue. There should be no equivocation on foot-and-mouth disease. As soon as the Beale report was released, the government immediately announced its in-principle support for all of the 84 recommendations, which included recommendation 59, to import foot-and-mouth disease virus. This was announced without industry consultation and effectively places Australia’s foot-and-mouth-free status at unnecessary risk. A decision to allow the import of foot-and-mouth disease virus for experimental purposes, even after an outbreak, will overturn years of government objection to its import. Australia’s livestock industries have always vigorously resisted attempts by scientists to allow the virus into the Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong. Foot-and-mouth disease is widespread across the world. According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, 51 countries reported incidences of infection between 2007 and 2008. MAIN COMMITTEE I discussed this issue with Senator Chris Back, a qualified veterinarian who has very serious concerns with this decision, some of which I will mention. Australian agriculture, especially but not exclusively the animal industries, would be devastated should foot-and-mouth disease become established in Australia; others could tell us the very immediate impact of that on GDP. If FMD got into Northern Australia, the most likely route of infection, it is probable we would never get rid of it from the feral camel population and the several million-and increasing-feral buffaloes, as well as rangeland cattle and feral pigs-you name it. We are an island continent. Our strongest protection against diseases such as FMD is to preserve our disease-free status as long as we can. Prevention is the most effective risk treatment measure in this case. There is no basis for us introducing the live FMD virus. The Pirbright laboratory in the UK was regarded universally as a benchmark laboratory, but it was from this very laboratory that the virus escaped in 2007, with the resultant devastation of Britain’s agriculture. The facility at Geelong is probably one of the best facilities of its type in the world, but this is no reason to allow a live virus into Australia. If we get the disease into Australia through biosecurity failure or other means, that is still no reason for us to bring the virus into the country. Australia already pays at least one overseas laboratory, if not two, to undertake diagnosis of serotypes et cetera and to produce quantities of vaccine in volumes far greater and quicker than any lab in Australia could. CSIRO scientists already work with overseas colleagues on FMD and other highly infectious diseases. Senator Back also said he could not believe there is or would be a scientifically valid reason for bringing the virus onto the Australian mainland. If there ever was a need to work with the virus on ‘Australian territory’, such work could be conducted on the Cocos Islands, where the federal government already owns assets. From a risk management viewpoint, the only sensible course of action is prevention and I really cannot think of any reason why we would voluntarily introduce the FMD virus. We just need to look at the devastation the disease has caused in other countries, in Brazil and in the United Kingdom where six million animals were culled, causing financial losses of more than A$19 billion. It cost the UK government the approximate equivalent of A$6.1 billion in compensation for slaughtered animals and payments for disposal and clean-up costs. And Western Australia produces a wide range of meat products. We have sheep, cattle, right through to pigs, export and domestic productions. These industries provide major employment and regional economic benefits. Australia is foot and mouth disease free. It certainly needs to stay that way. A Productivity Commission report in 2002 indicated that a major outbreak could cost Australia over $9 billion in lost export earnings-and you can imagine what it would be now. That was 2002. The beef industry would be the most affected and there are several major abattoirs and butchering operations in my electorate as well as the state herd, which totalled 2.3 million head in 200708. They are very important industries. I support the motion by the member for Maranoa and I, too, call on the Labor government to recognise that because of the risks associated with such importation there needs to be unequivocal recognition of this issue. It is too important and the government must reject recommendation 59 of the Beale report. motion to the House and I am happy to add my contribution to the points he has raised. I would like to reiterate what the speakers on this side of the House have already said and that MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Private Members Business
209,Mr Hale (Solomon) (7.51 Pm),"I acknowledge the member for Maranoa for putting thisis that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has clearly stated that there is only one case in which the government would consider importing live foot and mouth virus samples and that is only if there was an actual outbreak in Australia and if the government was advised that importing samples would contribute to the eradication of the disease. RecentlyI had the privilege of hosting the Prime Minister’s country task force in my electorate of Solomon. We had the pleasure of meeting with many primary producing industry groups. One of the groups we met with was the NT Cattlemen’s Association. NTCA Executive Director, Luke Bowen, does a fantastic job in representing the industry and I know the industry speaks very highly of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the work that he has done. They say that he is possibly the best ag minister they have ever hadand that includes the member for Wide Bay. I am passionate about this issue because members of the NT Cattlemen’s Association successfully manage in excess of 62,000 square kilometres or 9.6 per cent of the Australian landscape. The pastoral industry generates over $300 million in direct benefits and flow-on benefits worth more than $800 million to the local NT economy. That is about 75 per cent of the NT’s gross value of agricultural production. Last year over 330,000 cattle were exported live through the Port of Darwin, a figure I know the NT Livestock Exporters Association is very proud of. The significance of the cattle industry to the Territory is not something new to the proactive Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In fact, I know the minister thoroughly enjoyed a very rewarding experience at a cattle station up in the Territory recently and only last week he was in the Kimberley opening new export yards and promoting Indigenous Australians in primary industry. The Beale review is an independent review of Australia’s quarantine and biodiversity arrangements. The report is an important step in our government’s commitment to improve Australia’s biodiversity system. It provides a comprehensive blueprint for meeting the biodiversity challenges of the future and in principle we have to accept the recommendations of the review. The chief of the CSIRO Livestock Industries, Professor Alan Bell, has advised that there are no plans to seek permission to import live foot and mouth disease virus for research purposes and that only after an extensive consultation process with industry and other stakeholders would they lodge a formal request should an import permit application for foot and mouth disease virus be required. In opposition, Labor expressed grave concerns about Australia’s quarantine and biodiversity arrangements. As an example, despite the many warnings from the horse racing sector and veterinarians, the previous government were in control of a quarantine system which was dysfunctional. It led to the equine influenza outbreak back in 2007. The then agriculture minister, the member for Wide Bay, ignored written warnings from the Australian Racing Board not to downgrade post-arrival equine quarantine inspections in 2004. He even wrote to the Australian Racing Board declaring that the outbreak could not occur under the current AQIS post-arrival protocols. Unfortunately for Australia’s racing industry and all the others affected, we did have the outbreak. History will tell us that he was wrong. And, fair dinkum, now we have this private member’s motion effectively wanting this government to state on record that if we were in the unfortunate position of an actual outbreak of MAIN COMMITTEE foot and mouth disease in Australia, the member for Maranoa wants us to do nothing-just like the member for Wide Bay did nothing in 2004. The Rudd government recognises the importance of the rigorous system to minimise the risk of pests and disease, particularly as globalisation and climate change increase the threats. This government takes biosecurity seriously. This government listens to experts and industry, and this government takes decisive action. I have a lot of respect for the honourable member. In his first speech in 1990 he said: This Government has the responsibility to put in place legislation which not only deals with today’s issues but also has a beneficial effect on our children’s future. Today’s children are tomorrow’s adults. Their future rests with today’s decision-makers. Surely this is a responsible thing to do to guarantee the future of our children. As a government, we do all that is possible to make sure that we can respond to threats to Australia’s biosecurity in the most effective way. Water Safety Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Neumann: That the House: (1) notes the Federal Government’s ‘Saving Lives in the Water’ measure announced in the 2008-09 Budget and the priorities identified in the Australian Water Safety Strategy 2008-2011; (2) calls on the Federal Government to: (a) create and implement an annual National Drowning and Prevention, Awareness and Memorial Day; (b) provide assistance to schools and other education facilities so they are fully resourced to provide Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and First Aid training, and better able to educate students on water safety; (c) establish a national code for pool compliance, legislating that all pool owners be trained, certified and up to date in CPR as part of their pool compliance; (d) devise and support programs to teach water safety to children and toddlers; and (e) implement a national rural and regional swimming program to better equip parents, carers and children in isolated communities. age one little boy or little girl drowned every week. Drowning is the No. 1 preventable killer of toddlers in Australia. For parents, the really scary thing is that it can happen so quietly and so quickly: one moment they are playing, and the next moment they are at the bottom of the pool. Every day the lives of young Australians are being put at risk with so many private swimming pools lacking basic safety requirements and posing potential deathtraps to toddlers. Behind the drowning statistics are the sad stories of young lives cut tragically short and grieving families left to mourn their loss. I have seen how devastating the loss of a child can be through one family in my constituency: Katherine and Andrew Plint, who lived in Laidley, and lost their daughter Hannah almost two years ago. On4 October 2007, at nearly three years of age, Katherine and Andrew’s daughter Hannah climbed onto a chair in the backyard of their family home, unlocked the gate to the family pool and fell into the pool. Tragically, Hannah died within minutes of dragging MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Private Members Business
210,Mr Neumann (Blair) (7.56 Pm),"It is a really terrifying thought, but last year on averthe plastic chair to the pool gate. Hannah died in a non-compliant, unapproved, above-ground pool that her parents had purchased with their home in October 2006. Hannah’s parents loved their daughter and would have done anything to ensure her safety. They thought the pool was compliant. It was only following her death that they discovered that their backyard pool was built illegally, no application had been submitted to the council to build the pool and no compliance checks were ever undertaken. This tragic incident impacted enormously on their family and the wider community. With the grief of Hannah’s passing, the Plints turned to helping those in need. They established Hannah’s Foundation-drowning prevention, awareness and support. It is a registered charity. Commissioner Bob Atkinson, the Commissioner of the Queensland Police Service, is the patron. The Plints have struggled and strained and advocated for pool legislation reform following their daughter’s coronial inquest. They have urged the state government and the federal government to overhaul a 20-year-old law. One death by drowning is one death too many. A national drowning and prevention awareness memorial day would be appropriate to raise community awareness about the risks of drowning and to remember the young lives lost. The Plints have asked me to thank the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, for her message of support and her condolences on their memorial day on 4 October, which I had the privilege of attending in Laidley. In view of the wonderful advocacy of the Plints, it would be appropriate in the circumstances if 4 October could be set aside each year as the memorial day. Whilst it is important to teach our children to swim, it is crucial we equip our schools to provide CPR and first aid. This will save lives. Shockingly, in Queensland alone, reports show that up to 100,000 private swimming pools are failing basic safety requirements. Each of these pools is a potential death trap. We need to change the laws. Currently, in Queensland alone, there are approximately 11 different confusing sets of pool laws. An expert panel has recommended this be simplified to ensure we comply with the latest Australian standards. If we can do the Building the Education Revolution nationally and deal with the states and territories, we can ensure, along with the national curriculum, that we have a national approach to reform in this regard. I commend Andrew and Katherine for their wonderful advocacy. Ken Chandler, who is also a constituent of mine, is the Executive Director of the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia. He advocates that pools should be safety audited every two years. Ken has a long history of involvement in sporting organisations, particularly in the area of swimming, where he helps young people in the Ipswich and West Moreton areas to learn about how to protect themselves and about water safety. One death is just too many for young people. Those of us who are parents in this place love our children. If we can help people like the Plints, we need to do everything we can to ensure a national approach to this issue. State reform has failed and council reform has failed. A national approach is required and a national day is appropriate under the circumstances. I put this motion before the House to ensure there are no parents having to go through what the Plints went through-the pain, the agony, the depression and the recrimination. In all these circumstances, I commend the motion to the House. this issue on water safety and acknowledge his thoughtful and constructive comments. There are many practical and common sense proposals contained in there. The motion refers to the MAIN COMMITTEE",206,Private Members Business
211,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (8.02 Pm),"First, let me congratulate the member for raisingAustralian water safety strategy for 2008-11. I note that the key target of the strategy is to halve the number of drowning deaths by 50 per cent by 2020. It is a challenging target and, when you consider the complex issues which contribute to our annual drowning toll, it will require a true partnership between individuals, community groups, the business sector and governments at all levels to achieve. In 2007-08, the national drowning toll was 261, which represented a small decrease on the previous year. I attended the launch of the national drowning report in this place last year and the trends that were revealed are a guide to the approach being taken by the Australian Water Safety Council in the development of its strategy. Those trends are quite clear. Men are three times more likely to drown than women, with young men overrepresenting those statistics and often with alcohol involved in the tragedy. Toddlers aged zero to five are also overrepresented in the toll, with 27 children drowning in that year-a constant reminder for parents about vigilance and the pool maintenance and other controls referred to by the previous speaker. With an ageing population, we need to develop better strategies to ensure that older people are safe when they enjoy boating, swimming or fishing activities. Most drowning deaths are preventable, as can be seen by the success of the surf-lifesaving movement throughout Australia. In Victoria alone, there are about 55 surf-lifesaving clubs which provide patrols in the peak summer months. Last year, those clubs saved an estimated 1,000 lives in Victoria. I know from personal experience that surf-lifesaving clubs can play a critical role in preventing drowning deaths. In fact, three of my young children are involved in the Lakes Entrance Surf Life Saving Club nippers program, where they are taught surf skills and first aid. Providing these volunteer organisations with quality rescue equipment and facilities with which to teach first aid and treat patients are all critical elements of the effort to reduce the national drowning toll. Many large corporations already make significant donations to such volunteer activity, and I believe governments at all levels can always do better in this regard. The club members themselves are often highly motivated and take a great deal of pride in their efforts to educate young people about surf safety, rescue techniques and first aid. But they could do with more help from government bodies. To the best of my knowledge, no-one has ever drowned at a patrolled Victorian beach whilst swimming between the flags. It is with that in mind that I support the general thrust of the motion before the House. There is no question that most drownings are preventable. Yes, they are always tragic and, yes, they often occur as a result of misfortune or accidents, but with better prevention measures, better planning and preparation and increased vigilance drownings are almost always preventable. Time prevents me from expanding upon each point raised by the member for Blair but I would like to make a few general observations. Any strategy that is undertaken to implement a national rural and regional swimming program to better equip parents, carers and children in isolated communities must consider the socioeconomic factors. In many of our rural and regional communities the cost of attending swimming lessons-assuming there is a suitable facility nearby-often prevents participation by low-income earners and their families, particularly amongst the Indigenous community. A strategy that makes it more affordable, particularly for pre school-age children, to attend a recognised training course is a vital step towards making young children safer around water. MAIN COMMITTEE I also take up the point in relation to providing assistance to schools and other education facilities so they are fully resourced to provide CPR and first aid training, and they are also better able to educate students on water safety measures. This is a positive initiative put forward in the motion and it reflects a policy position that I actually helped to develop myself for the Victorian Nationals in the lead up to the 2006 Victorian state election. Increasing the awareness of basic first aid will save lives and it is important that these skills are regularly upgraded, particularly as new treatment methods are developed. There are often changes to the treatment of various ailments as new information comes to hand and those of us who learned CPR as recently as just five years ago may not be aware that the preferred system of breaths and compressions has also changed in recent times. More generally, there needs to be increased education in the community about the changing nature of conditions on Australian beaches and other waterways. Those of us who are familiar with the beach environment know that conditions change quickly from hour to hour but many tourists or people from various ethnic and cultural groups may have little understanding of the dangers which exist on our beaches. There have been many tragic drownings in Victoria in recent years where multiple members of the same family group have been victims as they have got into difficulties and those seeking to assist have also perished. We are seeing circumstances where a group have got into difficulty in the surf and the others have gone in to try and achieve a rescue situation and more than two or three members of the same family have passed away. Of course, the ongoing drought has meant that conditions in our rivers, lakes and dams have also changed considerably and may pose a drowning risk to those who assume their favourite watering hole in unchanged from summer to summer. I support the general thrust of the motion before the House and see great merit in improving education, awareness and assistance for antidrowning activities across our nation. Ms HALL (Shortland) (8.07 pm)-I acknowledge the contribution to the debate by both previous speakers, particularly the member for Blair for bringing this ever-so-important motion to the parliament tonight, and I do not think there would be a member in this House that did not support the sentiments that are expressed in this motion. Each and every year, particularly in the summer months, we hear of the drowning of young children in backyard pools. We hear about people who are swept out into the ocean when swimming where they should not be swimming. Time and time again we reflect on how this can be prevented. The new Australian Water Safety Strategy was launched October last year and it was aimed at reducing drowning by 50 per cent. It was interesting to note the figures from the Royal Life Saving Association in their National Drowning Report 2007 which showed that 277 Australians died during 2006-07. That is a lot of Australians that have lost their lives and all of these deaths are preventable. There are some drastic steps that are needed to reduce the number of drowning fatalities and aquatic related injuries. That is the one aspect that this motion does not pick up on: for every child that drowns there are a number of other children that suffer and who are affected for the rest of their lives because they almost drowned. The Shortland electorate is a coastal electorate. It is an electorate where the lifesaving movement is very strong. There are a number of excellent surf lifesaving clubs within the electorate: Redhead, Belmont Swansea, Caves Beach, Catherine Hill Bay and The Lakes. Each of these surf lifesaving clubs actually patrol those beaches and make them safe for the MAIN COMMITTEE people that live in our area or who visit there on weekends or during the holiday period. It is also an area that attracts a lot of visitors. There are very long stretches of surf and not all of the beaches are patrolled. You only have to walk along the beach to see that quite often there are nearly as many people swimming outside the flags as inside the flags. Yet the surf lifesaving clubs in my area-and I know in other regions as well-manage to pretty much keep that whole area safe and prevent people from drowning and losing their lives. SoI think that one aspect of this motion that really needs to be noted here in this parliament tonight is the fine work that is done by surf lifesaving clubs, in the Shortland electorate and throughout Australia, in patrolling the beaches and preventing drownings, as well as visiting schools, providing education to students and teaching them about water safety. As has been previously identified, there are three key areas: children under five, which are those affected by the backyard pool drownings; men and alcohol-and I would say it is not only men and alcohol; people who are in that risk-taking age who do not take the proper care; and older people, 55-plus, and I must say I am in that category and, as a person that loves the surf and loves swimming, I will be a little bit more mindful of that now. Another thing that I think is really important is emphasising water safety and making sure that every child learns to swim. From a very early age, children can be taught water safety. They need to be taken to the pool, they need to be taught to swim and they need to be taught survival techniques so that, if they fall in the pool, at least they can get themselves to the edge. Learning to swim can be quite expensive. I think it is really important that access to swimming lessons be made available to all children, because it will save our community a lot of money in the future. I commend the motion to the House. cated to the elimination of all deaths in Australia by drowning. As a father I feel very strongly about this, as do all members of the parliament who are parents or responsible adults. SoI would like to commend the member for Blair for raising this important issue and allowing us to focus on this current situation. As a parent I feel very strongly about it. It was only in the last 12 months that we allowed our 10-year-old to go swimming at a friend’s pool party, and that was only after being completely confident about the adult supervision from other parents. She attended swimming lessons with our school over the last two weeks. She went for her level 8 achievement and, I found out this evening, she passed that. My six-year-old daughter also undertook swimming lessons and passed level 5, so I am very proud, but there is no way in the foreseeable future that my six-year-old will be going anywhere near the water without me or my wife. The fact that I consider both my daughters to be very good swimmers does not ever allow me to fully relax or not be there when they are swimming. Children, of course, are much more vulnerable to drowning than adults. An unexpected mouthful of water or being out of their depth can cause them to panic, and their skills are not so ingrained as to be automatic when under pressure. The point is that when children are swimming adults can never fully relax. I note that in this motion there are a number of suggestions for the federal government about first aid and safety training laws and swimming lessons as well as better awareness. I absolutely support the concept of an awareness day to focus Australians on this tragic and enduring problem. YetI believe that in Western Australia the state laws and the by-laws of the local government are effective. The pool and spa fencing requirements are up to date and reMAIN COMMITTEE",207,Private Members Business
212,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (8.12 Pm),"There is absolutely no doubt that we are all dediflect an appropriate safety standard. The way I see it, national standards would not be any better than state prescribed standards and local government checks and enforcement. I worry that trying to impose a federal legislative enforcement regime will be more difficult not more effective. There is no doubt that fencing rules are required, but I cannot see that pool owner training and certification including resuscitation will be possible to achieve. The point I come back to is that of parental or carer responsibility. That is the bottom line of all preventative action. Parents ensure their child’s safety and that is the key. It comes down to knowing where your child is at all times. That may be harsh but it must be recalled that drowning of children can and does occur in places that are not pools or spas. The family bathtub is an example of where supervision of young children is critical and no amount of regulation can make up for that. Similarly, there is the modern common suburb feature of a lake or pond in close proximity to houses. In the rural areas dams and water tanks are common. These are risks to children that cannot be remedied by fencing or the regulating of owners. There is no doubt that I do favour the current arrangements of fencing and inspections in Western Australia, but children can get to bodies of water, either in or near to the home, and they can climb fences in many cases. Children have done so in the past and it has resulted in some drownings. The one and only sure thing to prevent a child drowning is effective adult supervision. It would be wrong of me not to mention the point raised in the motion regarding CPR and first-aid training. In Western Australia secondary school students are required to conduct 20 hours of volunteer work; I would suggest that CPR and first-aid courses could count towards such a requirement. In general terms, I support grants to effective organisations that have profile and expertise in these areas-the Red Cross, Surf Life Saving Australia and the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia. I particularly advocate for the Royal Life Saving Society’s Keep Watch program. As a Keep Watch ambassador myself I would say that the four Keep Watch strategies are very effective at protecting children. Those four strategies are to supervise your child, to provide barriers to water locations, to familiarise your child with water and to learn resuscitation. Ultimately, it comes down to parental responsibility, though. As I said at the start of my contribution, there is no doubt that we all support better water safety. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak on the subject and applaud the member for Blair for raising it. I believe that the regulations and controls in place at state and local government levels are appropriate. I would, however, support making it easier for CPR and first-aid courses to be undertaken and, of course, any profile that can be given to the issue, with an important emphasis on the responsibility of parents and carers to do their job and keep watch over their children. this important issue to the attention of the parliament tonight. Water safety is a critical community issue across the country. You would not know it from the weather outside today; however, we enjoy a popular beach and water sport culture and we, as a government, have an obligation to promote water safety and commit to minimising the number of drowning deaths that we have in this country. Disturbingly, despite much of the hard work and positive results achieved over the past 10 years-a testament to all those who contributed to that: the various water safety agencies, community groups, individuals and government-over the last 12 months that appears to have been eroded with an increase in the number of drowning deaths. MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Private Members Business
213,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (8.17 Pm),"I start by thanking the member for Blair for bringingRecently drowning deaths have increased and the record indicates that in 2007 alone there were approximately 270 deaths across Australia in swimming pools and rivers and at beaches. New South Wales recorded the highest number of deaths. Males are three times more likely to drown than women. These statistics tell only a small part of the problem. Every fatality causes untold grief to the family and friends of loved ones. The trauma is not only isolated to the immediate victims and their families; there is the collateral damage and the effect on many of our emergency services, and community groups, volunteers et cetera every time they attend such shocking incidents. It is a fight that we can never totally win, but there are many things that we can and must do. We start by saying that the government wholly supports the Australian Water Safety Strategy 2008-2011 and the Australian Water Safety Council’s aspirational goal to reduce the current number of Australian drowning deaths by 50 per cent by 2020. Some would say that this is an ambitious undertaking; however, I strongly believe that it is achievable. Certainly, through collaborative effort, coordination and goodwill amongst various agencies, I think this is something that we as a society can achieve. To reverse the upward trend we must take urgent steps to build upon the knowledge that we have gained from previous water safety campaigns. In order to achieve a significant reduction in the number of deaths, the Australian Water Safety Council has identified three key drivers which will form the basis of the strategy. They include taking a life stages perspective, targeting high-risk locations and meeting key drowning challenges, particularly for those at-risk groups, such as Indigenous and other culturally and linguistically diverse communities across Australia. As the member for Blair indicated in his motion, in order to prevent drowning deaths, we must allocate resources towards the major causes of drowning. The general community has a responsibility to contribute to the overall goal. That is something that we can all work towards. The Australian Water Safety Strategy seeks to do this by building awareness of the dangers of aquatic environments and by arming the community with the lifesaving skills necessary to prevent and to rescue. I note that in order to make a positive difference all parties with an interest and a stake in water safety must pull together to reduce drownings in our community. I offer my full support for the suggestion by my colleague the member for Blair of a national drowning day to promote water safety as well as to commemorate those that we have lost tragically through drowning deaths. In the short time. I have left to speak tonight I would like to quickly add that I am currently speaking with Royal Lifesaving Australia regarding a program for members of this House to gain their bronze medallion. The initiative would allow members to develop the level of knowledge, judgement, technical and physical ability required to carry out a safe water rescue. Equally important, they can demonstrate in their electorates their commitment to water safety by reducing the death toll. This is something that we parliamentarians can be part of. Royal Lifesaving Australia is very enthusiastic about delivering the training here in the parliamentary pool, and I would encourage all members to participate in this program. Finally, I would like to congratulate all those involved in this landmark strategy. I think the member for Blair has done well by raising this matter tonight. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE school, Lachlan Vernon, who is 12, and his sister, Josephine, who is 14, in early May heard a man scream, ‘Does anyone know CPR?’ These two young students rushed down to a pool at about 3.30 pm to find that a young boy, eight years old, had been pulled from the pool by this man, but he did not know CPR. Lachlan and Josephine commenced CPR, as they had been taught at school, and put him in the recovery position, saving this little eight-year-old boy’s life. This is the story of two Gold Coast heroes from All Saints Anglican School. It is the story of an eight-year-old little boy who will live to grow up to play sport and hopefully one day get married and have kids of his own. There have been 424 drownings of children aged zero to five since 1997-98-that is, in the last 10 years. And that is 424 too many. Campaigns such as Laurie Lawrence’s Kids Alive program have been instrumental in reducing the number of drowning fatalities and educating children and parents on pool and water safety. Since its inception, the Kids Alive show has been seen in 545 country towns and 44 remote communities and has been watched by over 225,000 children in Australia. It is also sad to note that there are something like 6½ thousand near drownings each year. I support any creation of a national drowning and prevention awareness and memorial day. I support anything that will bring attention to these dreadful and horrifying statistics and encourage people to familiarise themselves with prevention techniques. I have a four-year-old son and a two-year-old son and another child on the way. The horror of losing a child in a drowning would be simply unimaginable, and I support anything that will empower parents, educate them, and encourage them to know what to do should the unthinkable happen. Assisting schools in teaching their students CPR by introducing first aid as part of a school’s curriculum is an outstanding idea and will certainly ensure that tens of thousands of young adults who would normally not know how to perform what is a simple action will be able to do it correctly. It is interesting that most adults actually believe they know how to do CPR, yet testing by industry has shown that only about 50 per cent of them, when push comes to shove, actually do. Proper education, combined with vigilance and great parenting, saves lives. Establishing a national code for pool compliance, including the need for all pool owners to be trained and certified in CPR, also makes a great deal of sense. As Laurie Lawrence says: ‘Fence the pool; shut the gate; teach your kids to swim-it’s great; supervise-watch your mate; and learn how to resuscitate.’ It is somewhat catchy, it is five simple steps and it makes an enormous amount of sense. Likewise, a national program of water safety would certainly ensure that not only the same message was learnt by everyone but also the right message is taught. As well intentioned and well meaning as all these actions are-and they certainly enjoy my whole-hearted support-nothing will ever replace the vigilance of parents. Nothing will replace the supervision by parents to ensure that fences are properly constructed, the gates closed and, indeed, that self-locking mechanisms close by themselves. Only on SaturdayI went round and checked all the locking mechanisms on our gates around the pool to make sure that they would close automatically within a second after I walked through them. Nothing will replace supervision by parents, and nothing should. But, if appropriate and sensible measures can be put in place to assist parents and to ensure that others in the community MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Private Members Business
214,Mr Robert (Fadden) (8.22 Pm),"Two young heroes in the Gold Coast from All Saintsknow what to do in the time of an emergency, that certainly makes sense. Then, if the unthinkable happens, if the tragedy does occur where a child is found at the bottom of a pool, then we can be assured that young heroes like Lachlan and Josephine Vernon from All Saints Anglican School will have been trained and taught to know what to do. I certainly commend the motion to the House. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (8.27 pm)-I am pleased to support this motion which recognises the importance of reducing water drowning deaths in Australia. I commend the member for Blair for moving it. The importance of drowning prevention and education programs cannot be overestimated. Our earliest records put the Australian rate of drowning by death as high as 8.76 deaths per 100,000 people in 1920. In today’s terms this rate would equate to approximately 1,800 drowning deaths per annum. A program of life-saving water safety drowning prevention and community action has resulted in a rate of less than two deaths per 100,000 population, or approximately 270 drowning deaths, in 2008. While we can congratulate the many people who worked so hard to bring about that reduction, every death is one too many. We must always remember that, the better we do in this area, the less visible will be the repercussions of a lack of action. We all know of the surf-lifesaving associations in Australia-some of our great volunteer organisations that patrol our many beaches. Perhaps we are less aware of the work of the Royal Life Saving Society Australia, which works very hard to train community people and people working in the aquatic industry about safety. I am pleased to inform the House that an incredibly important piece of water safety infrastructure is about to be built in my electorate of Parramatta. Last month it was my pleasure to turn the first sod for the new $6.5 million Royal Life Saving Society New South Wales aquatic training facility to be built at the Hills Sports High School at Seven Hills. The Australian government has contributed $3 million to this project in partnership with the Royal Life Saving Society New South Wales. The National Aquatic Safety Training Academy will be the first of its kind not only in New South Wales but in Australia. The academy will be a benchmark facility for the delivery of the highest quality vocational education and training in Australia, and I cannot imagine a more important area for this facility to be built. The new facility will enable the Royal Life Saving Society to continue to deliver high-quality water safety education programs. It will provide both recreation and vocational education and training programs to all members of the community, including students, teachers and parents, workers in emergency services and members of the aquatic and recreational industries. The academy will also provide the society’s mobile Indigenous training unit with a central base to carry out Indigenous-specific initiatives adapted to meet the various needs of the Indigenous and culturally linguistically diverse communities in Western Sydney. Again, this is a great location in Seven Hills, next door to Blacktown, which has the largest urban population of Indigenous people in the country. It is also the centre of a growing, culturally diverse community where the children of migrants are less likely tohas expired. The debate is adjourned and resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Private Members Business
215,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Je Moylan),"Order! The time allotted for this debateDebate resumed from 1 June. That grievances be noted. Area Consultative Committees the way they have been treated by this government. I talk about the area consultative committees, a network of regionally based economic and employment agencies spread right across this vast continent, supported and guided by local members of each of those communities providing their business expertise, their insights, their connections with the training and education community and their understanding of the economic and employment circumstances of their region. They have brought all of that knowledge and all of that volunteer insight, horsepower and talent to the job of making sure that Australian government policies landed as well as they could in those regions and that those regions were able to optimise the benefit of Australian government policy. What we have seen, and the scandal that is unfolding, is the shameless neglect and offensive ignorance that this minister for regional development, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, is showing towards these good people. I do not say ‘good people’ purely because of some political affiliation. In fact, I would imagine that most were not affiliated with the former government. They were selected on merit and for their capacity to contribute to these area consultative committees and to provide that on-the-ground, regionally engaged insight into the policy development and decision making of the Australian government. They did that voluntarily and they have done that for many, many years. Right across Australia, and in no case worse than in the state of Victoria, those good people and the organisations that have delivered so much for regional communities are being treated shamefully. I am not just using ‘regional’ in the sense of those outside metropolitan areas. These regional area consultative committees were regions within the metropolises of Australia, bringing that guidance and that expertise to their communities, and they are just being allowed to wither on the vine. They have not had so much as a thankyou letter from the minister-not so much as the basic courtesy of advising these organisations and the volunteer board members that bring energy and insight to their task. The minister has completely ignored them. The department which he oversees refuses to give clarity to those area consultative committees about their future. They are just told nothing. They are just being treated like mushrooms-kept in the dark and fed some kind of political excrement from this minister-while all of their energies over more than a decade have just gone unappreciated, unacknowledged and completely ignored. To add insult to injury, what is happening today? In the local area consultative committee that includes the electorate of Dunkley a letter was received. It was not a letter of thanks from the minister, not a letter of explanation from this government about what the future of the area consultative committees would be and not an inquiry about how these good people could continue to contribute to the communities-none of that. It was just a sterile, insensitive and ignorant bureaucratic letter from the minister’s department. It did not inquire about how or MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Private Members Business
216,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Je Moylan),The question is:,215,Grievance Debate
217,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (8.30 Pm),"TonightI grieve not for the people involved but forwhere the minister could contact them to convey his appreciation on behalf of the nation. There was nothing like that at all. It was just a statement talking about ‘likely cessation’-this is the language of this minister. Are they going to survive or are they not? Area consultative committees are being done over by this Rudd Labor government, and the good people in the communities that they have supported deserve better than just being treated with contempt, shamelessly ignored and treated as throwaway instruments of the Labor government. They get a letter about the ‘likely cessation of funding for your area consultative committee’. They are not told that they are going to be wound up or run through some Regional Development Australia outfit-just that they are going to be starved of resources. It is a matter of, ‘If you want to keep going, keep going, but you are not going to get any money from this Rudd government,’ so there is not even the courtesy of being upfront about the future of these area consultative committees. The letter goes on. It does not say thank you. There is not even the basic courtesy of thanks. It does not do that. It asks for more information to assist with the ‘finalisation of your operational funding contract’. There is still no word about their future-just that their funding contracts are going to be killed. This is atrophy of a community organisation that has added so much to so many regions across Australia. They are looking for financial positions and statements about staffing levels. These are the same staff that the minister is so disinterested in that they have not been advised, invited or even guided to participate in whatever their new arrangement will be under this Rudd Labor government. So distant is the area consultative committee from the Rudd government, Mr Albanese and his department have not even done the courtesy of engaging the staff about their future prospects, but they want to know about the finances. They want to show some kind of interest as to whether there are any entitlements outstanding so they can be dealt with, so that every element of area consultative committees can be swept under the carpet while some new regime comes in run by state government departments nice and close, nice and tight so that they do not possibly do anything that might be offensive to the Labor political interest. They want them nice and tightly under the control of the government, losing the very independence, insight and pragmatic analysis that these people brought to the task of making sure that Commonwealth policies worked for their regions, worked for their communities and supported economic and employment prospects. The letter goes on to ask about where funds might come from to wrap them up without ever saying they are going to be wrapped up. It goes on to talk about whether there will be any surplus funds, ‘Please tell us where they are because we want to know what you are going to do with them.’ Not, ‘Gee, we think we have killed your organisation and we are now no longer interested in area consultative committees.’ None of those things-just a bureaucratic, insensitive letter from a general manager of a department branch without even the courtesy of a thankyou from the minister involved. I am here tonight aggrieved for those people for not having the recognition that they deserve. I am not just talking about South East Development. I say on behalf of a grateful nation and this parliament, to all those people who volunteered their time in area consultative committees right across this country over the last dozen or so years, ‘Thank you.’ Thank you for your contribution, thank you for your insights, thank you for your dedication and thank you for putting up with being comprehensively stuffed around by this Rudd government without MAIN COMMITTEE the even the courtesy of being advised about their future. I say, ‘Thank you.’ I say that because that is what Minister Albanese should be doing. If he cannot bring himself to do that, get one of the minions, one of the parliamentary secretaries, to do it. Get somebody to just say ‘thank you’ to these people. He won’t but I will tonight. Thank you to the South East Development organisation for all you have done for the region of the south-east of Melbourne since your first meeting in November 1994. Thank you to each and every one of the 36 board members who, over a 15-year period, have provided such selfless service on a volunteer basis and added so much to ensuring that economic and employment opportunities in our region were secured and supported as best they could be from prevailing federal government policies. I say a particular thankyou to the longest serving member, Charles Wilkins, the chairman, a man who has come via the TAFE sector with many insights into skill development, training and what the business community needs in our region. Thank you as the longest serving member and chairman at the time the rug was pulled out from underneath your organisation. Thank you to Sandra George, who is currently the deputy chair, for her 13½ years of service. Thank you to the staff who toiled away under the fog and ambiguity of not knowing what was going to happen to them but kept working and stayed focused on the interests of their region. To the only two executive officers South East Development has had since 17 November 1994: Richard Percy, thank you for your 12 years of service; Anita Buczkowsky, thank you for your 3½ years of service. Thank you to the office managers, Iwona Malinowski and Gayle Baulch for their service. Thank you to all those involved in attracting more than $5½ million of funding to the region from federal, state and sponsorship sources and for those that have supported the collaborative efforts of South East Development to get a further $8 million in partnership funding to get projects off the ground. Those $13.6 million of initiatives include the Regional Skills Audit; the Regional Home Based Business Project; regional business clusters; Careers Teacher Industry Focus; tourism projects for Casey and Cardinia; the Peninsula Job TeamNew Apprenticeship Expo; the bits to build your business project; the Non-English-Speaking Background Home Based and Micro-Business Project; the Mature Age Employment Project; the Youth in Small Business video; the Heavy Road Transport Project; the Community Heritage Project; the Indigenous Cultural Awareness Project; the Peninsula Hospitality Project; the Synchrotron Project for the major projects they have helped get off the ground; the Business Incubator in Hastings; the Equine Industry Project-very important to our region; and the Wine Industry Project, promoting manufacturing to young people to have them realise it is not a dirty old industry, it is high-tech and needs to be world-class every day. That was pursued under the MTEC project. There is the Maximising Maturity in Manufacturing project; the business retention program; the agricultural audit in Casey and Cardinia; the Frankston tourism and marketing strategy; the digital land register that they oversaw; and particularly the very projects that you see around our region, such as the Frankston Visitor Information Centre in my electorate of Dunkley, the Phillip Island Visitor Information Centre, the Radio Port Phillip communications transmission tower replacement, the Southern Peninsula Performing Arts Centre, the Mornington Basketball Stadium and the Gembrook Community Arts Theatre. These are just some of the projects that we have in our community because of South East Development and the area consultative committees. They deserve the thanks of our nation. They deserve a little more courtesy than the minister has displayed. They deserve a whole lot MAIN COMMITTEE more respect than these contemptuous letters that are sent out. They deserve a whole lot more credit than the nonsense that went on in Senate estimates, where Senator Conroy tried to fit them up with some grievance over Regional Partnerships. They deserve better. (Time expired) Broadband Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (8.40 pm)-I want to speak on behalf of my constituents, who are aggrieved and concerned about their current access to broadband in Tasmania. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as of 30 June 2008 the proportion of Tasmanian households that had access to broadband at home was around 39 per cent. That compared to a national average of 52 per cent, so Tasmanians have been way behind the eight ball for a long time. We all know that the Liberal Party, whilst it was in government, had the view that the free market should reign; building nation-building infrastructure such as broadband was clearly not on their agenda. In fact, they spent almost 12 years in government, I think, coming up with 18 different plans for broadband, none of which were implemented. It has really taken a new government, the Rudd government, with the vision to see the full potential of investing in this communication infrastructure. Since the announcement of the National Broadband Network and the process that has been undertaken by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, of course, we have had lots of criticism, but in the National Broadband Network my home state of Tasmania is actually to lead the nation. The Rudd government’s announcement about embarking on this nation-building project, which will see Tasmania in particular progress through the 21st century, has been very well received in Tasmania. We all know that the eyes not just of the nation but of the world are on Tasmania in relation to this broadband project that has been announced. It will revolutionise our day-to-day lives. The NBN will be the largest nation-building infrastructure project in Australia’s history when it is complete. It is a long-term investment in communication infrastructure that will ensure that all Australians remain competitive with other leading countries. It will also be the biggest reform in telecommunications in the past two decades. Building this network, we know, is important for the economy. It is also important for small business and for government service delivery, and it will change the way we access things like health services and education. This has required real vision and leadership. After almost 12 years of inaction, we are pretty much in the technological dark age. In fact, we have one of the slowest and most expensive broadband networks across all developed countries. Australia is at the bottom of the OECD table when it comes to speed, when it comes to price and when you consider the number of people using it-or, in this case, not using the internet, particularly in my home state of Tasmania, as I said. When you look at our network compared to those of countries like Korea, Iceland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Canada and the UK, you see they are all leading the way when it comes to the number of households accessing broadband. I think that the Rudd government’s announcement in relation to the National Broadband Network is a great step forward, and it will certainly be a great step forward for my home state of Tasmania. Information technology has increased massively on a global scale, and it has revolutionised the way people communicate and interact. I was reading an interesting statistic today: internet traffic has increased by 9,000 per cent in the last seven years. It certainly shows how vital this piece of communication is to all Australians and, as I said, particularly in my home state of Tasmania. MAIN COMMITTEE I was talking recently to both the federal minister for communications and the state government on what this Broadband Network will actually mean for Tasmania. We will really start to roll out this Broadband Network in the next few months, and Tasmanian homes, schools and workplaces in urban and regional towns will be connected with optic fibre-that is, fibre to the premises-delivering speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. That is, as we know, much faster than is currently used by most people. In fact, it is estimated that around 200,000 premises, or around 80 per cent of Tasmanians, are likely to get fibre to the premises, with others receiving wireless in towns that are much smaller, because of the topography of Tasmania. We are also delivering the technology to all of our hospitals and to 90 per cent of our schools. That will particularly benefit rural and remote areas of Tasmania. It will mean that they will be able to do things like telehealth-that is, they will be able to have specialists and diagnostic services available in real time online. It will also be really important for rural and regional students, who will be able to have online live classrooms. They will be able to get feedback from peers-students-and also from teachers in relation to their educational needs. So it will be a very big deal in Tasmania. Everybody I have spoken to in Tasmania, including the industry and the education and health services, is extremely excited about this project. My understanding is that we will start building this network in the next few months. Not only will it have huge benefits for health, education and other services because of its speed, but it will also have the impact of supporting local jobs in Tasmania. I understand that the broadband network is expected to support around 25,000 jobs each and every year of the rollout, and that rollout is expected to take seven to eight years across the country. It is a really big infrastructure project in Tasmania, and I am really pleased that Tasmania is going to be first cab off the rank. We will be having all sorts of discussions with local communities, small businesses and health and education services about where to start this network and about how it will be rolled out. I congratulate the current state government on its submission and also the government business enterprise Aurora for its assistance with that submission, but Tasmania had already invested some time ago because of the vision of the late former Premier Jim Bacon, whom I worked for. Around 10 years ago Tasmania started its gas rollout. The former Premier was smart enough at the time to put fibre in the trenches when they were laying the gas, so Tasmania has a backbone of fibre network connecting Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Burnieand it actually goes just past Burnie. We will be able to connect and start getting people on board much faster than anywhere else in the country, which is why Tasmania has been chosen as one of the first sites in the country. It will be really significant for our state. Apart from Tasmania being the first cab off the rank, this broadband network will obviously go nationwide. It will reach Australians far and wide, and we want to ensure that the National Broadband Network is accessible by everyone. I think we have committed to access for around 90 per cent of all Australians, and for those who cannot access fibre optic to the premises there will be faster broadband through wireless networks and new satellite technologies. We have taken the lead, we have taken the hard decisions and we are moving forward with this. We have announced that we will establish a national broadband network company, which will be responsible for the planning, construction and operation of this new, fast National Broadband Network, and that the Australian taxpayers, through the government, will actually be the majority shareholder of this company. We are obviously expecting and anticiMAIN COMMITTEE pating some significant private sector investment, as this project will help boost Australia in terms of bringing us into the 21st century, improving our technologies and improving the services that are available to us through fibre optics. This project will help the local economy, and it is also about supporting jobs in this global financial crisis. This investment goes hand in hand with nation building. Up until recently, communications infrastructure has not been seen as infrastructure. It has not been seen as something real and tangible. I am proud to be part of a government that has recognised its importance to the future economy of Australia and also to the advancement of things like education, health and other things for which this technology will be used. It will improve the quality of our day-today lives, it will change the way governments deliver services and it will certainly deliver benefits for the people of my electorate of Franklin. This government is about fixing the wrongs of the past in delivering a competitive telecommunications sector and investing in Australia’s future beyond this global recession. The delivery of this high-speed broadband will open up a new window of opportunity, a technological advancement that will afford opportunities in many areas. Under the Rudd government, we hope every person and business in Australia, no matter where they are located, will have access to this affordable, fast broadband and to the nation-building infrastructure investment that will support and stimulate jobs in the short term while making a long-term investment in Australia’s future. I am sure that the people of my electorate of Franklin, the people of Tasmania and, ultimately, people around the country will come to appreciate what that will mean as this broadband network is rolled out and as they start to see its benefits. It is very hard to explain to people just how important its benefits will be, because people just think there will be faster internet downloads. But it is so much more than that, and it is so much more exciting than that. I hope that all Australians get to see the opportunities that this network will provide as it starts rolling out around the country, starting in a few months time in my home state of Tasmania. Building the Education Revolution Program with the government’s Building the Education Revolution, which appears by the day to be running into more and more horror stories of maladministration and profiteering. The government is attempting to shovel more than $14 billion into the construction sector at such a rate as to cause widespread distortions and cost blow-outs across Australia. It is difficult to believe that the program is focused on educational outcomes rather than base political outcomes. I raised just such a case in question time in parliament two weeks ago, highlighting the cost blow-outs occurring across Australia in this sector. This was the debacle of the Cleve Area School in my electorate. I quote from parts of the public letter from the school council: In March this year, our school applied for the $2 million National School Pride grant that we qualified for. We were led to believe that we could afford a structure similar to the Hewitt Primary School (built in 2005 for $1.8 million) after investigating the construction costs, factoring in a post-Olympic reduction in material costs and even allowing for the imposition of the grossly inequitable country loading. We also believed that by using a standard design, the building should have remained affordable. According to your article on the National School Pride program in March edition of Education news …“standardising buildings leads to efficiencies and standardisation of the building industry…using standardised building means that the delivery process is optimised”. MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Grievance Debate
218,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (8.50 Pm),"I would like to speak about the great concerns I haveOur delight in being successful in our Round1 Application turned to disappointment when in April we were informed that we could not afford the 8-room Hewitt Model, which would now cost $3.3 million to supply in Cleve. We were told that we would get the 6 or 7 room Woodside model that did not meet all our requirements, but would have been an acceptable result. Early last weekThis was three weeks agohowever, this also suddenly became “unaffordable”, and our allocation was a 4-room structure, half the size of our original plans. As if this was not frustrating enough, within the next working day, that was also out of our reach (at a cost of over half a million dollars a classroom), and we had only hours to commit to a cheaper, smaller and less appealing structure. We reiterate that this was just hours to decide on a building that would stand in our school for years to come, as a representation of your government’s investment in the advancement of education for the students of Cleve. We negotiated an extra two days to make a decision, allowing for staff and Governing Council to meet, discuss our options and try to make an informed decision that supported our initial education goals and requirements. They go on to articulate how disappointed and bewildered they were and how they ended up settling for: … the only structure that fell within our price range, a collection of transportable classrooms with decking. I am pleased to report that following on from my raising this issue in the House, the South Australian education department, DECS, have reopened their negotiations with the school and are attempting to come to a much better value agreement with a local builder, and I thank the Minister for Education for any influence she may have had in that area. But this is systemic. It is a recurring theme running through this whole program-rip-offs; inflexible guidelines; state governments top, bottom and middle slicing the payments at every opportunity. Schools in South Australia and Australian taxpayers are being ripped off. I have had a great deal of contact with people on this and similar issues. Disturbingly, while schools are prepared to come and tell me about the blatant ripping off of the taxpayers in this exercise, there is a great reluctance to go on the record publicly because they are afraid of retaliation from both state and federal governments. What an indictment! They are too scared to speak out about the systemic ripping off of the system. What does this tell us about the respective governments? One school principal-and I point out that South Australian principals are prohibited from speaking out on the issue-told me that the building they had selected was going to cost $1.4 million. When the school showed the plans to a local builder, he said he could not possibly charge more than $800,000. That is not quite double, but it is getting there. Other schools are being offered structures called COLAs, covered outdoor learning areas. Basically they are haysheds-that is, a roof with legs. In one instance, they are costing more to build with the program preferred builder than a similar structure quoted by a local builder-the same size, with walls, with a concrete floor and fitted out with interior structures for considerably less money. Roofs are cheap. The money is in the walls and the floor. Just what is going on? Mr Gary Thornley from Reed Construction Data, who is quoted as the industry bible on building costs, said in last Saturday’s Australian: … an average school hall should cost no more than $1000 per square metre to build. MAIN COMMITTEE … … … … schools with more than 400 students can apply for $3m in funding to build a multipurpose hall … Mr Thornley is quoted as saying schools should be able to build halls for about half that figure, and that figure is generous. That underlines my assertion. We are seeing a 100 per cent blow-out in costs. Even if we believe the package is well guided and will have significant positive effects on educational outcomes-and that is a brave assumption-we are likely to get less than $7 billion worth of value. Another principal has told me that their school was sent a list by DECS of long-term maintenance issues and told to use the School Pride funding for that purpose. This is clearly a case of cost shifting by the state government and is against the guidelines. But, once again, the school leadership believe that if they go public they will be penalised. Further to that, in South Australia we have seen a reduction in the school maintenance budget of about $10 million. Is the minister simply unaware of this cost shifting by the state administration to the federal sphere or is she actually supportive of the effective propping up of the state governments? It is not delivering value for money for the taxpayer. You would think there would be enormous support for the government on this issue. After all, they are giving away money, albeit borrowed money. You would imagine they would receive enormous support. In fact, it is generating a lot of anger. That is because schools were rightfully expecting to get $300,000 worth of improvements for $300,000. They did not expect to only get a $150,000 structure. They were expecting to get $3 million worth of goods for $3 million, not $1½ million worth. That is not an unreasonable expectation. It is a tragedy, because government largesse of this type will probably never happen again-for many reasons, but chiefly because we will be paying off this lot and the accumulated interest for as many years to come as we can see. In this environment governments will find it extremely difficult to maintain their contributions to schools, let alone shower them with gifts. Given that this big spend in schools may be ill targeted, given the school halls, nice as they are, may not improve educational outcomes and given all the money is borrowed and will have to be paid back by kids currently at school, we now find that instead of getting $14 billion worth of school buildings we may get as little as $7 billion worth. It is a disgrace. The government has taken great delight in saying that the opposition voted against this package but now we welcome the funding in our communities on an individual basis. The schools funding was presented as just one part of the $42 million stimulus package. Individual parts were not presented for approval; it was a big bundle. It was the biggest ever and we were told to take it or leave it. We chose to leave it, and it is a decision I am proud of. It was a brave decision. We knew the government would portray us as being against spending in schools but we also knew it was an irresponsible and poorly designed package. Nothing has changed my mind. The $14 billion cash splash is stupid policy. It is a poorly targeted stimulus: much of it has been saved; some has been sent to dead people; some sent to people living overseas; and a great proportion was spent on imports, thus sending it out of the country at the first opportunity. We could have converted large slabs of our electricity generation to low-emission generation, built a string of major desalination plants around Australia to fix our water crisis or built ourselves a major road or port facility to generate new growth for when we come out of the MAIN COMMITTEE recession. Instead, we gave away cash, and we have the debt to prove it. The $14 billion for schools is too much too fast in too narrow a sector of the economy and was always going to cause distortions. That is exactly what is happening today. In 10 years time we will look around and say: ‘Why did we put that thing there? Why did we build it like that? Is that all we got for the money?’ The government asserts that we welcome the funding locally-you bet we do. It is my job to make sure that my electorate gets its fair share of the action because it certainly will get its fair share of the debt. IfI were to stand up and say, ‘Don’t give us the money; we can’t afford it,’ would that help? No, of course not. The money would be spent elsewhere and we would still get our share of the bill. Of course I welcome our share. I will actively campaign for it. That is my job. I urge the minister to get on top of this program and implement some valuefor-money clauses that will stop the blatant ripping off of the people of Australia and ensure that the money spent will improve educational prospects, not just the electoral prospects of the government. National Rugby League rugby league. Many of the recent revelations regarding the behaviour of individuals associated with the game have been shocking and such conduct must be condemned. There can be no excuses for bad behaviour, especially when it involves criminality, indecency, disrespect or violence. Personally, I have been deeply disturbed by those incidents that have evidenced a lack of respect for women. These incidents have been met with a swift reaction from the community and in the main an equally swift response from the administrators of the game. For many fans these incidents may have eroded their passion for the game. Some may have stopped attending games and others may have sought to discourage their children from playing or supporting the code. I am not one of those people. In fact, these incidents have had the opposite effect upon me and have made me even more passionate about the game that was once a boyhood obsession. The recent wave of bad press that rugby league has been receiving made me even more determined to head down to CUA Stadium at Penrith last Saturday night with my wife, my three daughters and my son to watch the mighty Panthers take on the Sea Eagles and throw our support behind the game’s women in league celebrations. In celebrating the role of women in league, the night was an opportunity to recognise the efforts of the Panthers Women in League group which was established in 2006 by an enthusiastic group of female panther supporters who saw the opportunity to make a difference in our community. Diane Langmack, Anne McLaren, Jill Hoff, Jenny Matthews and Chris Rhind have committed themselves to this cause for the last few years and have to date raised over $85,000. Throwing their support behind the women in league celebrations, the Penrith players, dubbed the ‘Pink Panthers’, donned pink jerseys and encouraged their supporters to wear pink to celebrate the role of women in league. Equal to the task, a number of the Manly players dyed their beards pink. The pink jerseys-and in Jarrod Sammut’s case his pink bootshave been signed by the players and are being auctioned online this week. The team also grew beards and had these shaved off on Sunday to raise even more funds. All proceeds from the event will go to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, the Nepean cancer unit and the Cure the Future Foundation. MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Grievance Debate
219,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (9.00 Pm),"This year has been a testing time for the game ofWith over 15,000 fans in attendance, many wearing pink, the events of Saturday evening have confirmed my belief that the game of rugby league is an overwhelmingly positive force in our community. Scandals make good headlines and the stuff that good journalistic careers can be made of. It seems that those consuming news are rarely interested in the good news stories-or at least this is what those who decide what makes the news believe. I am a proud supporter of my local NRL team, the Penrith Panthers. The Panthers are a source of pride for our city. I am also proud to call myself a supporter of the game of rugby league. I remember as a young schoolboy, watching the young rising star Greg Alexander playing for Patrician Brothers’ College, Fairfield-which would one day become my school-lead his team to victory in the Commonwealth Bank Cup final, the pinnacle of schoolboy football. I did not know that Greg Alexander would go on to captain the Panthers and represent New South Wales and Australia and, frankly, at the time Greg was already a hero to me as were players like Peter Sterling, Paul Langmack, Mick Cronin and Steve Rogers, role models that a young boy in his formative years could look up to. I played the game for 13 years from the age of four and refereed the game for about eight years. Rugby league taught me many things and augmented many of the values that I had been taught at home and at school, like discipline, respect for others including those in authority, sportsmanship, the importance of looking after your physical health and it taught me about mateship and teamwork. The lessons that football taught me both on and off the field have shaped the person I am today in a very positive sense. Rugby league’s roots are unashamedly working class, and it is no surprise that the places where it has been the dominant code have been areas like Western Sydney or the outer suburbs of Brisbane. While society has changed, rugby league has provided a pathway to greater social mobility for many kids from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Most importantly, rugby league has provided many young people with the role models needed to develop a sense of purpose and aspirations for a better life. Far from being the source of our community’s problems, I believe that rugby league can be and in many cases already is emerging as a part of the solution to many of our society’s problems. This is particularly important in communities such as Western Sydney where many boys are being brought up in single-parent families without male role models. The last census showed that across the 150 electorates represented in federal parliament, six Western Sydney electorates, including my electorate of Lindsay, are in the top 25 electorates containing one-parent families. In these communities there is an even greater need for strong male role models, inspiring young boys to develop a sense of respect, especially for women, and to work hard and realise their full potential in life. This need is being met by many outstanding individuals involved in rugby league, whose voices and contributions I fear have been drowned out in the static of the latest rugby league scandals. Last FridayI was honoured to speak at the official launch of the Panthers Bytes Bus. The bus is run by the Penrith Panthers community development foundation, Panthers on the Prowl, and is funded by the Commonwealth with support from corporate sponsors. It is full of notebook computers with wireless internet access and big-screen TVs and is decked out with images of Panthers players. It travels to schools in Western Sydney to teach children about the benefits of a healthy, nutritious lifestyle. The bus is just one of a number of community based programs run by Panthers on the Prowl. They also facilitate adult literacy courses to help and MAIN COMMITTEE encourage parents to read with their children, run breakfast clubs at some of our most disadvantaged schools, and run special classes held at the Panthers on the Prowl classroom at CUA Stadium, approved by the New South Wales Department of education to target children at risk. The key to the success of Panthers on the Prowl is the involvement of the players themselves. Many of the players assist as trained teachers’ aides. They are important role models to children and adults and their influence can often and has often helped to break the cycle of destructive and antisocial behaviour. Programs such as these are changing the lives of young people in my community every day. In my view, you do not hear enough about these outstanding contributions, nor do you hear much about Panthers CEO Glenn Matthews participating in the St Vincent de Paul Society’s CEOs Winter Sleep Out. Nor do we hear enough about the great leadership, on and off the field, demonstrated by Panthers captain, Petero Civoniceva, or the positive contributions of players and former players like Tony Puletua, Preston Campbell, Luke Priddis and Nigel Vagana. From its humble working-class roots, many aspects of the game have changed massively. With the game becoming more professional, the stakes are higher. The players are paid well. Their faces are on billboards and television and their every action is met with scrutiny that very few other individuals or occupations face. They are also judged by some very strict standards, as they should be. However, I cannot help but think that sometimes these are standards which many of the people commentating on the behaviour of the players would themselves struggle to observe. Indeed, I am certain that the weekend and nocturnal activities of many individuals occupying positions of even greater responsibility in society but facing less scrutiny would not always meet the standards that we expect of league players. I know there are players who fail to live by these standards and their punishments and their attempts at rehabilitation are played out very publicly, and so they should be. But there are many more who not only live up to these standards, but would put the rest of us to shame in their dedication to their work, their families and their communities. My fear is that these days many clubs are afraid to trumpet the good news stories because these stories inevitably make their team more of a target for ridicule if a player from their club ends up letting their club down. TonightI hope I have been able to shine a light on some of those positive stories. I just hope that the extraordinary scrutiny and constant adverse publicity directed towards rugby league players does not smother the many great contributions of those players who are outstanding male role models for our young people. Regardless of whether it be in politics, law, sport, rugby league or any other facet of life, generalisations are always very dangerous. In the end, we must work to ensure that adverse generalisations cast upon some of our rugby league players do not impede or restrict those other good players out there from coming forward, making a great contribution and being the role models that we hope they will be. Queensland and New South Wales Floods the House the injustice of the Rudd government’s decision to deny Coffs Coast and Clarence Valley residents affected by the March 31 floods one-off Centrelink cash payments. On 31 March more than 400 millimetres of rain fell in 24 hours. In some areas 600 millimetres fell. In one three-hour period 250 millimetres fell in many areas. The Coffs Coast region and the Clarence Valley were declared a national disaster area. Since then the Rudd government has MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Grievance Debate
220,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (9.09 Pm),"Two weeks ago I brought to the attention ofon numerous occasions rejected requests for one-off cash payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child, as were provided to flood victims in North Queensland in February and as were later provided to those affected by the flood event on the North Coast in May of this year. Since 31 March the Prime Minister’s office and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs have continued to invent new excuses on why Coffs Coast flood victims do not deserve to be treated the same as flood victims of the New South Wales Northern Rivers and Queensland. Firstly, it was because they believed the damage was primarily to public infrastructure. When such advice was shown to be misinformed, a new excuse-that there were only four local government areas affected on 31 March, as compared with 24 council areas affected in May-was put forward. This is simply hollow rhetoric to the thousands of people who were impacted by the March event. I believe the Prime Minister has also misled the parliament on this matter. On 25 May he told the parliament that those affected by the May floods would receive assistance which included one-off cash payments. The Prime Minister then told the House that he ‘authorised this assistance for people affected by the earlier floods in New South Wales in late March’. Less than 24 hours later the Prime Minister’s office told me that the same one-off cash assistance would not be provided to Coffs Coast residents impacted by the March 31 event. The hollowmen had obviously had their say in the Prime Minister’s speech the previous day but, when it came to actually providing the support, the Prime Minister’s office reneged on the commitment. It is obviously beyond comprehension that this government would turn its back on ordinary Australians in their hour of greatest need. It is morally reprehensible that they could offer such lame, mindless excuses which ignore the cold hard reality that the March 31 flood had a devastating impact on so many people. Today, almost 11 weeks after the event, our local community is angry-in fact they are outraged by the Rudd government’s complete disregard for treating all Australians equally. The general feeling is that assistance was not provided to Coffs Coast residents because it is not a seat held by the Labor Party. I will shortly be tabling a petition in the House of more than 6,000 signatures. The petition calls on the government to provide the same assistance to the March flood victims as was provided to those of the May event in northern New South Wales and South-East Queensland. The petition was organised through our local newspaper the Coffs Coast Advocate, and I trust that the government will acknowledge the support it has received and realise that it is not too late to help a lot of people still in genuine need. There are still many people in my electorate who have either lost everything they own or have no idea what the future holds. Many of them are elderly and many of them are from low-income households. The Coffs Coast Advocate reported last week that 89-year-old Athol Hardie, an ex-serviceman, has lost everything. He has no home and all his possessions are gone. I would like to take this opportunity to detail to the House some of the correspondence I have received from local residents and representatives from organisations which have been affected by the floods. It really puts a human face on the issues and clearly highlights the toll that the March floods had on local residents. It also shows that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is either inept or incompetent. I will start with a letter received late last week from Judy Harrison from Bellingen Neighbourhood Centre. Recently Judy wrote to the Prime Minister and she forwarded me a copy. I quote the following lines: MAIN COMMITTEE I am very concerned about the decision of your government to not pay emergency one off grants to residents of the Urunga Township affected by the March 31st 2009 storm. This town has a small population with a high number of retirees. In my role as Neighbour Aid coordinator I have first hand knowledge of the trauma suffered by the elderly victims of this storm. Of my 28 Uranga clients 17 received major damage to their residence, 8 lost all belongings and 7 are still not able to return home. One of these victims is an 87 year old Changi vet. Since March 31st this man has resided in 4 different locations and is still three months away from having his little unit liveable. He, like all my other affected clients, is finding it very gruelling, financially and emotionally, to survive. It is very difficult for these victims to understand that if they were residing in another area of Australia affected by flood they would receive this Federal Government support yet as residents of this little town they don’t. I certainly can’t explain it to them because I do not understand it either. Here is an extract from another letter I received from a constituent who I will not name. This is what she had to say: I was disgusted that I had used my vote in 2007 to help elect a government that was so out of touch with the community when I read that Jenny Macklin had determined that the March 31 storm event, predominantly affected infrastructure rather than personal property. Try and explain that to my 15 year old daughter and 17 year old son, who lost everything they have ever owned when their bedrooms were completely lost to the flood water. Please explain why my 17 year old is sleeping on the floor of his younger brothers room in his HSC year and why my 15 year old daughter is sleeping on the floor between her 6 yr old brothers bed and the babies cot when she is trying to complete year 11, if their loss was not personal. Please explain that to my 6 year old son, whom we had to hold down to prise his bike out of his hands to throw on the rubbish truck. And this is what the Sawtell Chamber of Commerce had to say in their letter to the Prime Minister: Perhaps you need to come and look at the aged living in mildewed walls, bare floors, warped kitchens and bathroom cupboards and doors and very little furniture, waiting for insurance companies who cannot get their act together. They have to buy meals-$1000 would have gone a long way to helping them. It is time all Australians were treated equally when their area is declared a natural disaster! And, if any members are still in any doubt as to the impact of this major event, here is another tragic letter from a constituent, Brian Glover, who lives at Urunga. He writes: We had been renting the house and although the flood rendered it uninhabitable, we found it impossible to find somewhere else to live. As a result, we had to live for five (5) weeks in the flood infested house. Having lost just about everything, including the refrigerator, we had to sleep on a mattress on the concrete floor. It was five horrendous weeks before we were able to secure somewhere else to live. Then a fortnight later after moving in, on 20 May, my partner Maureen Nederlof died suddenly at home while 000 was instructing me, until the ambulance arrived, what to do when she had collapsed. She said she had no history of heart trouble. I feel that the strain on her resulting from the flood took its toll. Her age was 68, my age 72. This clearly shows the level of stress that the March flood has created in so many families. Although it is almost 11 weeks since the Coffs Coast and parts of the Clarence Valley experienced the deluge, there are still many people who are struggling to rebuild their lives and make ends meet. The Rudd government has clearly made a mistake in failing to treat all Australians equally. However, despite the injustices, despite the double standards and despite the anger which local residents are feeling, the government still has the opportunity to do the right MAIN COMMITTEE thing. I have today written to the Prime Minister again asking him to review the decision not to provide one-off cash payments. If the government was being true to itself and fair to the residents of the Coffs Coast and Clarence Valley it would acknowledge its mistake and immediately provide flood victims with the required support of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. Attacks on Indian Students Indian students in Sydney and Melbourne. Thankfully, I do not have to refer to anything that occurred in my electorate of Moreton in Brisbane. Irrespective of whether these attacks are racially motivated, I am appalled by the violence. Any kind of violence and intolerance is an affront to most good-hearted Australians. Indian students like all of us are entitled to live without fear of violence or intimidation. I understand that many Indian students are very angry and that they have protested the violence a number of times in Sydney and in Melbourne. There is no room whatsoever in Australian society for violence and victimisation against anyone. Obviously, Indian students are anxious to have these issues resolved; however, I support the Prime Minister’s call for students to leave these matters in the hands of the professionals, the police. Retaliation is never the answer. I would also urge international students, or any victim of such violence, to find constructive ways to respond and to cooperate fully with the police. I would point out that they should never underestimate the unrelenting thoroughness of the police. It does not take place in 40 minutes with a couple of as, but the police seem to always get their man or woman. That is the best way to ensure that those found responsible for the attacks will be dealt with by the courts. Racial disputes, if left unresolved, have the potential to cause ongoing hurt in our communities. We can learn this by looking at some of the experiences in Australia’s history. Over the last 200 years, we have been scarred by some racial and religious violence, but, thankfully, not on the scale we see in many other parts of the world. We turn our minds back to conflicts like the Myall Creek massacre of Indigenous Australians in 1838 and the Lambing Flat riots against the Chinese miners on the goldfields in 1861. IfI look a bit closer at the electorate of Moreton, in Brisbane in 1888-the year of the centenary celebrations-the windows of nearly every Chinese business in Brisbane were smashed during a four-hour race riot that spread out from the valley. Ironically, the valley is now seen as a bit of a tourist destination for people wanting to visit Chinatown-although I do point out that the real Chinatown is in my electorate, in the suburbs of Sunnybank, Robertson and Macgregor. Also closer to home, following the September 11 attacks, the Kuraby mosque in my electorate was fire bombed by a crazy person-or, I should say, a confused person; sorry. This was despite the best efforts of the local Islamic community to promote tolerance and to build understanding throughout the community. But I can tell you that, since then, we have been striving even harder for harmony. We have been working especially hard to encourage young people on the south side. The Rudd government is committed to a harmonious, multicultural Australia. It was the Australian Labor Party in 1975 under the leadership of Gough Whitlam that abolished the White Australia policy and opened up Australia to a new era of multiculturalism. I say a ‘new era’ policy wise, because there already was practical multiculturalism. Despite some of the blemishes in our past-for example, the ones that I referred to earlier-today, when it comes MAIN COMMITTEE",225,Grievance Debate
221,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (9.18 Pm),"I rise tonight to respond to the violent attacks onto multiculturalism, most countries look to Australia as a glowing example of success. In a meeting with the UNHCR representatives earlier this year, they made the point that European countries need to look to us as a guide as to how to get it right. Why do we get it right? We put resources towards making sure that people are integrated into our community-supported, integrated and accepted. Most Australians are fair, decent, welcoming people who extend the hand of friendship to others, no matter the colour of their skin or where they come from-or even the football team that they support. And our immigration and settlement programs have ensured for the most part that new Australians receive appropriate support and the best opportunity to make a new life in Australia. But we can always do better. That is why I welcome the initiatives of this government to set up a task force on crimes against international students and a separate international student security task force. I have spoken often before in this chamber about the rich cultural and ethnic diversity that we experience on Brisbane’s south side. It is amazing how Queensland has changed from being the state that had the lowest percentage of people from overseas and now we are the state that is taking the highest percentage of people from overseas. We have changed from the closed-minded redneck past to being a much more welcoming state with a vision for the future. I represent an electorate where one in three residents was born overseas. I am sure there might be other MPs that have similar electorates; however, mine is completely diverse, rather than just one particular group. For the most part, irrespective of where they come from, we all settle in and get on well together, because mine is a vibrant, strong and healthy multicultural community. We have a significant representation of people who have come from Muslim communities of Zimbabwe in South Africa-people who have come to Australia as business migrants, particularly-and a significant Chinese community, to the extent that I have my business cards done in Mandarin. I even have a Mandarin name-Bai Ge. It is not quite as well known in the Chinese community as Lu Kewen or Kevin Rudd, but I am doing my bit to make sure that I am known-because, apparently, in Mandarin, ‘Graham Perrett’ does not read well. In my electorate there is also a very significant African community, particularly from the troubled region of the Sudan. They live particularly in the suburb of Moorooka, where I live. There are also significant Indian and Korean communities, to name others. I particularly wanted to mention the Indian community because the president of my Lions Club, the proud Lions Club of MacGregor, is an Indian gentleman by the name of Surendra-although no-one ever calls him that; everyone just calls him Sam-Prasad. I think the incoming president of the MacGregor Lions is also Indian-Vaska Desha. I would also mention another significant Indian community leader, Dr Ashim Majumdar, who is President of the Federation of Indian Communities of Queensland, which is the umbrella organisation looking after many of the Indian groups. Even though I had taught a little bit of Indian history when I was a schoolteacher, until I went to the Indian Bazaar last year I had no understanding of how many different Indian communities, Indian foods, Indian religions et cetera there were. I guess it would be like saying that all Australians are the same: no, there is actually a Queensland contingent, a New South Wales contingent et cetera-even Victorians! MAIN COMMITTEE When these reports of trouble from down south in Sydney and Melbourne came I spoke with the local police and the Indian community leaders to see what we needed to do in Moreton. Thankfully, the police, the Indian community leaders and the universities that I made contact with reported next to zero complaints or violence targeted against Indian students in Brisbane. This is very encouraging news. However, the price of racial harmony is eternal vigilance and that is why I and the Queensland government are stepping up our efforts to ensure any simmering issues in the community are dealt with constructively and positively. Australia is home to more than 150,000 people born in India. My wife is not one of them, but her grandparents certainly are from India. Eleven thousand people of Indian descent live in my state of Queensland and many, obviously, in my electorate of Moreton-especially the many who have fled the oppression and intolerance of Fiji and found a safe haven on the south side. Indian-born people make a great contribution to this country and especially to my electorate. Many are professional and highly skilled people: doctors, teachers, computer programmers and engineers. There are many teachers that I have met over the years. Australia is also home to around 90,000 Indian students, who last year contributed around $2 billion to the Australian economy. That is a hell of a lot of coal trains. Apart from our shared obsession with cricket, India and Australia have another thing in common, and that is a diverse multicultural community. Indian people bring a rich and diverse culture to Australia and we are all the richer for it. I am perhaps a little bit chubbier because of my love of curries. I particularly want to recognise the efforts of the Indian Senior Citizens Association and the Indian Cultural Association in my electorate. These groups play a crucial part in promoting Indian culture on Brisbane’s south side. I was particularly pleased to be involved in the Indian Bazaar at Mount Gravatt last year and I look forward to doing so again this year. It is truly a tremendous celebration of Indian culture. I thank all Indian-born Australians for the many and varied contributions they make to our society and to my community. 192B, the time for the grievance debate has expired.

(a) The only direct funding to organisations within the Moncrieff electorate is to the Multicultural Families Organisation Inc (MFOI). The MFOI received a two year grant from the Settlement Grants Program on 29 May 2007, which included some payments over the period requested. This was for the “Orientation to Australia, Developing Communities and Integration services to Humanitarian and eligible Family stream entrants on the Gold Coast” project. The MFOI received an additional grant on 30 May 2008 for the “Integration Inclusion and Participation services to Humanitarian and Family stream entrants in Gold Coast SSD” project. (b) The initial grant in 2007 was for $170 000 per year for 2007-08 and 2008-09. During the period requested, the sum of the initial grant provided to MFOI was $170 000. The sum of the additional grant provided to MFOI in 2008 was $38 500. (c) The 2007 project focussed on services to Humanitarian entrants as well as family stream migrant women. The project included orientation to education, employment, life skills, volunteering, youth and community leadership development.

Computers in Schools Program (Question No. 696) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 12 May 2009: How many of the schools successful in securing funding under each round of the National Computers in Schools Program have (a) had the computers delivered, and (b) commenced using the computers in the classroom. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: 2701 schools have had their applications finalised for Rounds One, Two and 2.1 of the National Secondary School Computer Fund. This will deliver almost 295,000 new computers to bring these schools to a computer to student ratio of 1:2. To date, over 58,000 computers have been delivered and installed in over 690 schools. This includes 461 schools from Round 1and 232 schools from Round2 National Action Plan on Literacy and Numeracy (Question No. 697) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 12 May 2009: In respect of the National Action Plan on Literacy and Numeracy: (1) Which literacy and numeracy programs delivered until 2008 have been evaluated under the Plan.

(3) Which programs have been be redirected into the Plan for 2009. (4) What guidelines have been provided to Federal, State and Territory officials responsible for literacy and numeracy programs to facilitate the Plan. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The National Action Plan on Literacy and Numeracy will not evaluate programs prior to 2008. Evaluation of previous activities will be undertaken as part of the operation of those activities. (2) (a) (b), (c) and (d) There has not been a public consultation process on the National Action Plan. The major elements of the National Action Plan have been progressed through individual negotiations on the National Partnership for Literacy and Numeracy (NP) and the Literacy and Numeracy Pilots in Low SES communities (the Pilots). (e) (f) and (g) The Pilots were agreed to by McEETYA in June 2008, and progressed via negotiation with state, territory and non government education authorities as funding agreements. The NP was agreed to by COAG in November 2008 and is being progressed via negotiation with state and territory education departments. In addition, a Pilots forum was held in October 2008, involving state, territory and non government education authorities, school principals and academic partners, on the pilot guidelines and to agree an approach to capturing pilot outcomes. (h) To date, the outcome of negotiation on the Pilots is the establishment of thirty funding agreements with state, territory and non government education authorities for the conduct of the literacy and numeracy pilots across Australia. The outcome of negotiation on the NP is that state and territory implementation plans for the NP are expected be finalised by October 2009. (3) Funding for An Even Start: National Tuition Program, Summer Schools for Teachers Program and the Rewarding Schools for Improving Literacy and Numeracy Outcomes Program has been redirected into the National Action Plan for Literacy and Numeracy. (4) The guidelines for the operation of the NP are set out in the National Partnership Agreement for Literacy and Numeracy. A copy of The guidelines for the Pilots can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office. Building the Education Revolution Program (Question No. 699) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 12 May 2009: In respect of the Building the Education Revolution Program, and the Government’s announcement on 3 February 2009 that its $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan is to support up to 90,000 Australian jobs over the next two years: (a) from 2008-10, how many of those jobs will be (i) created, and (ii) supported, as a result of the program; and (b) does her department have specific performance indicators or expectations for these jobs; if so, what are the details. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Nation Building and Jobs Plan is made up of a number of elements of which Building the Education Revolution is one. The Government’s estimates of the impacts of stimulus measures assume that a stimulus of 1 per cent of GDP can be expected to increase GDP growth by between ½ and 1 percentage point. This is based on the assumption of a fiscal multiplier of between 0.5 and 1 (that is, each additional dollar of fiscal stimulus results in additional GDP of between fifty cents and one dollar). Estimates of the number of jobs supported by stimulus measures are derived using an employment elasticity of 0.75 (that is, each 1 percentage point increase in GDP growth is associated, on average, with a 0.75 percentage point increase in employment). The Budget provided estimates of the combined impacts of the Government’s stimulus packages. The stimulus packages are expected to raise GDP by 2¾ per cent in 2009-10 and 1½ per cent in 2010-11, supporting up to 210,000 jobs. The Building the Education Revolution program builds on the Government’s commitment to deliver a world-class education to all Australian schools. The funding provided will help to stimulate national and local economies through the scale and pace of construction work undertaken. The Commonwealth has in place with each state and territory education authority a Bilateral Agreement on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. This agreement includes a requirement for reporting and performance benchmarks. At the commencement of a project, state and territory education authorities are required to submit details of the estimated numbers of jobs to be supported by the project. This includes the numbers of Indigenous and non-Indigenous apprentices/trainees and other workers. The first monthly reporting is due to be submitted by education authorities to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations by 15 June 2009. The key performance indicator for the Building the Education Revolution is the number of new or refurbished facilities, including libraries and multipurpose halls in primary schools and science and language laboratories in secondary schools. The Commonwealth will measure this key performance indicator by measuring: (i) funding application rounds undertaken; (ii) construction milestones met and milestone payments made; (iii) completion of projects on time; (iv) amount of funding spent; and (v) number of jobs supported through Building the Education Revolution projects. Building the Education Revolution Program (Question No. 700) Mr Pyne asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 12 May 2009: In respect of the Government’s Building the Education Revolution Program and guidelines, and the application by Sunrise Christian Schools (SCS) for separate funding for each of its campuses under the initiative-(1) Is she aware that the SCS has sought special consideration in relation to its application under the Program. (2) Did her office receive a phone call from SCS regarding the guidelines for 2009; if so, (a) what advice was given to the school, particularly in respect of the guidelines, and (b) was there further communication between her department and SCS. (3) If there was further communication: (a) on what date/s did it occur; (b) what further advice was given by her department to the SCS; (c) is she aware that the SCS has five distinct schools that operate under the one administrative umbrella; and (d) will she consider the SCS’s case; if not, why not. (4) Why are multi-campus schools collectively treated as a single school under the guidelines for the Program, when previous program guidelines (Investing in Our Schools, for example) treated each campus as a single school. (5) How many (a) multi-campus schools, and (b) campuses, exist in Australia. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: For the purpose of funding under the Building the Education Revolution (BER), schools with multiple campuses will be treated as a single school. For non-government schools, this is defined by whether the school is recognised separately under the Schools Assistance Act 2008 (i.e. with a separate Socio Economic Status (SES) score and entitlement to General Recurrent Grants). Sunrise Christian School (covering the five campuses) has a single SES score and receives only one payment in relation to the General Recurrent Grants and is, therefore, classified as a single school for the purposes of BER. The notional allocation of funding for the school has been based on the combined full time equivalent (FTE) enrolments for all its campuses. On3 April 2009, I wrote to Sunrise Christian School advising them of the BER Guidelines as they relate to multi-purpose schools. I am advised that my Department wrote to the school in a similar fashion on 23 March 2009. The treatment of multi-campus schools under the BER is consistent with other Federal Government funding programs, such as the National Secondary School Computer Fund and Local Schools Working Together program. According to my Department’s records, there are 274 multi-campus schools in Australia. Quarry Park (Question No. 705) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 12 May 2009: (1) Is he aware that the New South Wales (NSW) Government is planning to sell, for development, a parcel of bushland in Amourin Street in North Manly, Sydney, which has for many years formed part of Quarry Park. (2) Is he aware that this park, including the bushland that the NSW Government is proposing to sell, is listed with the NSW Heritage Council. (3) Has the Government had any discussions with the NSW Government about the presence of rare or threatened species on this site. (4) What steps can and will he take to ensure that this sale is not contrary to any Commonwealth law, regulation or policy. (5) Are there any instances of the Commonwealth purchasing land for environmental purposes; if so, what are the details. (6) Will the Government consider obtaining this land for permanent inclusion in the park. (1) & (2) I was not previously aware of the details of the proposal in question. (3) Officers from my Department have confirmed with the New South Wales Crown Lands Department that the threatened species Acacia terminalis subsp terminalis occurs on the North Manly site. (4) The New South Wales Crown Lands Department also indicated that the land will be withdrawn from sale and reserved under the Crown Lands Act 1989 (NSW) for an appropriate conservation purpose and ongoing management of the site will be assigned to Warringah Council. (5) The Australian Government can assist private conservation organisations and state conservation agencies to purchase priority land for conservation, by providing up to two-thirds of the land purchase price. To take advantage of this initiative, a buyer who is interested in purchasing the land to manage it for conservation as part of the National Reserve System would need to come forward. Provided the prospective purchaser has one-third of the money to support the purchase, they would be able to seek funding to purchase the land under the Australian Government’s Caring for our Country initiative. (6) In reference to the parcel of land at 13A Amourin Street, North Manly, an initial assessment of the conservation values of this parcel of land against national priorities reveals that while there may be local or regional values on the parcel, other parcels of land may have a higher priority for inclusion in the NRS.
