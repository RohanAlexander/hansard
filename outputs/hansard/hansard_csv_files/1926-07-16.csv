0,"I House Of Representatives. Friday, 16 July, 1986. Groom) Took The Chair At 11 A.m., And Read Prayers. Ister Been Notified Of The Decision Of The Graziers Of Australia To Permit The Meat Council To Pass Out Of Existence At The End Of July Because Of The Refusal Of Some Of The States To Pass Legislation Which Would' Enable Tho Council To Func","tion ? As the Meat Council is the only medium by which the opinion of the meat interests can be expressed in a national way, and. as it has negotiated important contracts with the Imperial Government, will the right honourable gentleman take steps, before effect is given to the decision considering the matter, and I hope to be of the graziers, to continue, if possible, the operations of this great organization % regard to the present position of the Australian Meat Council has reached me, but the facts are not as stated by the honourable inember. The decision to disband the council is not due to the failure of some of the States to pass enabling legislation. Such legislation was passed iu Queensland and Kew South WaleB and. the Victorian Government was ready to submit it to Parliament. actually been raised by levy; but by a recent poll the graziers of New South Wales pronounced overwhelmingly against the continuance of the council, and, as there were indications of a similar opinion in Queensland, the council came to the conclusion that, it had no alternative but to wind up its affairs. Representatives of the meat industry have interviewed me on several occasions, and sections of them have represented that the Government should take some action to organize the industry, I told them, as I have told all sections of producers, that the Government will not take steps to organize them, but will give every assistance if they will organize themselves. I agree with the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) that it is very desirable that an effort should be made to form an organization to take the place of that which will shortly go out of existence. Defence say whether it is a fact that recruiting for the boys' training, ship Tingira will cease at the end of this month; if so, will th© boys who join before that date receive a complete twelve months'' training 1 for the training ship Tingira will cease at the end of this month, but every boy will undergo a full course of training before he passes on to the next station.

In view of the high cost of housing at Canberra, will the Prime Minister statehow he proposes to carry out his promise to public servants that they will not be penalized financially by their transfer to Canberra? 2. What is the reason for delaying the longexpected announcement on this subject? terms suggested by the honourable member has been made by me, but, as has been announced by me on previous occasions, steps are being taken with a view to protecting public servants from financial los* in certain specific respects. For' instance, the Government has formulated a scheme for the purchase of the Melbourne homes of officers who will be transferred to Canberra in 1927, and the Public Service Board has been requested to take into consideration the question of a cost of living allowance for those officers. Regarding the question of the prices at which homes will be available at Canberra for rent or purchase, the Public Service Board, to whom the matter was referred by the Government, has appointed a committee which is at present inquiring as to the differences, if any, which exist between the costs of construction of houses in Melbourne andCanberra respectively. Upon receipt of the committee's report, the matter will be. considered by the Public Service Board. notice1. How many officers of the Commonwealth Public Service in each State have surrendered their life assurance policies since the passing of the Superannuation Act? 2. Has the Government yet come to a decision as to compensation to those officers for losses they sustained through having to surrender their policies owing to the fact that they could not continue paying the premiums as well as the deductions for superannuation each fortnight? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The departments have no knowledge of the number of officers who have surrendered their life assurance policies since the passing of the Superannuation Act, as these surrenders are purely at the discretion of the officers. A return recently furnished by the Commonwealth. Public Service Clerical Association discloses that 425 officers who surrendered their policies are dissatisfied with the value received. 2. I have now received a report from the President of the Superannuation Pund Management Board in which it is stated that the 425 'officers referred to have received the full surrender value of their policies which are reported by the Board's Actuary to be fair and reasonable. It must not be forgotten that, during the life of the policies before surrender, the officers were covered by the terms of those policies. No hardship to the officers has heen disclosed and the question of oompensation does not therefore arise.",15,Wireless Broadcasting

The facts are that they were not submitted to the judge. The Minister quoted the fourth charge set out in the schedule, containing the following words by the honourable member for Y a r r a: Page 3253-Fo r several years the administration of tbe taxation office has been unsatisfactory to the people. It has been carried on in defiance of the law under which the taxes are raised; in fact, the Commissioner and his officers and the Treasurer, who is the ministerial head of the Department, are annually breaking the law of the country. The Attorney-General said that that of charge was submitted to Judge Edwards, and the honourable member for Yarra challenged hi m to prove it . I propose to show that it was not submitted.

The judge then observedSupposing that to be so, how does it affect my position as Commissioner? I am not going to answer questions outside the scope of my commission. In spite of that the Attorney-General stated last night that these extracts went before the judge; but the judge said that he was limited by the terms of his commission, and that he could not answer anything contained in the extracts unless it was also in tbe questions. The judge went on to sayI do not think that I will need to answer that question because I would say that it would be answered in Parliament.

We were told that the tariff was to be definitely protective but the Treasurer is actually budgeting to secure more revenue from the tariff this year than last. When the honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr Scullin) said last night that a proper tariff should produce less revenue each year, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) and others sitting in the Corner laughed.

The Treasurer, when a private member, criticized the tariff policy of the then Government, because he said that the revenue was increasing year by year.« What is the position to-day? In 1922 the Customs receipts were £17,000,000, but to-day they are £27,000,000. The indictment that the Treasurer made of the budget of 1922 must stand to-day as a greater indictment of his own budget. His views of 1922 were similar to those expressed by the honourable member for Yarra last night. He said that the Treasurer had covered up under an item'of new works from loan, a sum to assist the passages of migrants. saidWe find that notwithstanding the assurance of the Treasurer's well-meaning words, he has taken £250,000 out of loan for the relief of unemployment in the States. I shall never vote again for handing over any money to the States in this way. Yet this year in an item for new works he has inserted an amount for the payment of passages of migrants to relieve unemployment abroad. The same principle is involved. The amount voted for this purpose in 1925-26 was £262,000, and the estimate for this year is £348,000. Yet the Treasurer said in 1922 that he would never vote again for such a thing. He is now not only voting for it, but sponsoring the budget providing for it. The Treasurer, when sitting in the Corner in 1922, saidThe effect of the policy of the Government, criticism of the budget last night, atas expressed in the whole of their financial tempts to criticize the budget in the same acts, is to be seen in a perusal of the census way as they did in 1922. What are the figures for the last ten years. Although our members of the Nationalist party now dopopulation during the decade has increased by ing, who, in 1922, came under tbe lash 900,000, the actual number of producers has declined, and important country towns have either lost population or are stagnant. I wonder whether the Treasurer was in but what are they saying to-day?

In 1922 the criticism, he saidTreasurer also stated:In Victoria there has beenan increase of 120,000 in the electors of Melbourne, and only cutting containing a report of the speech of 4.000 in the rest of the State. To-day the position is greatly aggravated. Men are leaving the country to-day in greater numbers than before. also responsible. sole responsibility rested on the States, the Treasurer, in 1922, would not have kept repeating the charge that he made against the Pederal Government. The honourable member for Gwydir quoted figures to show the decline amongst the land-holders. He showed that in New South Wales the number of land-holders in 1915-16 was 93,983, and in 1921-22, 72,059; in Victoria the number of land-holders in 1912 was 66,811, and in 1919, 72,679. In 1915-16 there were 213,081 land-holders in Australia, and at the end of 1922 only 200,655. Those figures show a decline from year to year. The honourable memThe Treasurer in 1922 ber gave other figures relating to the decline in the holders of the Crown leases. Those figures were taken from the official Year-Book, and, therefore^ must be accurate. They stand to-day in worse form as an indictment of this Government, in the same way as the Treasurer's speech of 1922 was an indictment of the Government of the day. A t that time the Treasurer saidIn Canada 60 per cent, of the population are in the country. In Australia 50 per cent, are in the cities, owing to the policy of first looking to secondary instead of to primary industries. To-day the position is even worse. Tbe population of Sydney borders on 1,100,000.

There is something very sinister about the proposal of the Government to abolish the ""per capita payments to the States, and to hand over to them, entirely, the field of land taxation. Tbe Treasurer has always shown a remarkable and unwarranted sympathy with the great land monopolists. I have never represented any but a country constituency, and I know that the opinion is general amongst the sons of farmers, that the opportunities for obtaining land were greatly increased when the Pederal land tax was imposed by a Labour Government in 1910. I am reminded of a statement made by the Treasurer during the recent election campaign. When he was accused of undue sympathy with the squatters, he said that no previous government had collected land taxation from them in respect of Crown leases. The honourable gentleman must have known that he was making a misstatement, and that in the first three years of the operation of the tax, it returned to the Treasury £690,000. the only Government that had collected crease of the rate of pension, there would land tax from Sir Sidney Kidman. That still remain a further increase of nearly is absolutely true. what the Treasurer said, because I had occasion to refute his statements in my mental effect of the Government's electorate. He definitely said that the legislation on country interests, and Labour Government had never collected I any taxation' upon Crown leaseholds, ment whereas, in the years between 1914 and from sources that cannot be regarded a3 1917, £690,000 was collected. When the politically opposed to the Treasurer, and Labour party went out of office there was the parties with which he is associated. a remarkable falling off in the receipts On the 19th February of this year the confrom that impost. This Government is ference of the Victorian Farmers Union discredited by its record in regard to the was held at Ballarat.

This Government knows that it is discredited, but as a precaution against the time when it will inevitably be put out of office, it proposes to give sanctuary to its wealthy friends, the wealthy landholders behind the ramparts of the Legislative Councils. When the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) was drawing attention to the increase in Commonwealth expenditure, the Treasurer said that it was due to increased payments for old-age and invalid pensions. The inference was that the pensions were wholly responsible for the increase, and therefore it will be well to set out the facts. The pension payments increased from £5,424,000 in 1922-23, to £8,252,000 in 1925-26. The total increase of £2,800,000 included many new pensions. As against that increase, the total expenditure by this Government has increased by £6,600,000, namely, from £45,758,000 in 1922-23, to £52,384,000 last year.

The Federal Ministry is accused of incapacity and of responsibility for the continued exodus from the land, and to prove that that charge does not emanate only from the Labour Opposition, I shall quote a few extracts from the minority report of the delegates to the Farmers ConferenceI t must be generally acknowledged that all is uot well with the movement. The enthusiasm with which members once attended meetings of the branches is not in evidence to-day. The decline in numerical strength of the Victorian Farmers Union is serious, and few realize the extent of the drift. Reasonsf o r this are furnished, and I ask honourable members to compare them w it h the criticism of the Government from this side of the chamberThe number of branches and members has fallen practically 50 per cent, from their highest points . . . curiously and as a remarkable paradox, while our Country party parliamentary representatives now occupy the highest Ministerial positions in the history of the movement, the enthusiasm, membership, and finance are at their lowest ebb.

I could utter no stronger indictment of tbe Government than that of their own "" break-away"" party, which says that their membership has decreased, their financial position has weakened, and their enthusiasm has waned, because those who were supposed to represent them in the Composite Government have not done what was expected of them. That is the minority report of the body that the honourable member for Wimmera calls the ""Very Funny Union."" One of the matters referred to in that report was the ""failure of the Government to establish a system of rural credits for tbe benefit of the primary producers.""

Before a farmer can obtain money at a reasonable rate from the rural credits branch he must enlist the services Qf the private banks. visited my electorate he told the people that the Government had arranged to provide cheap money for the farmers; but I pointed out that, so far as I was aware, the cheap money had been obtained by the private banks. The Treasurer remarked that the reason why £15,000,000 of notes had been made available to those banks was the unsatisfactory position overseas ""in regard to wheat and wool. In his budget statement, however, he admitted that the money was provided for the private banks at Bank of England rates. know of no farmer who has obtained money at such a favorable rate as that at which those notes were made available to the private banks. The Treasurer did not deny that they had been made available ; be evaded that point, and stated that only £2,800,000 of the notes had been taken. But that made the position worse. If the private banks had lifted the whole £15,000,000 of notes, they would have had to pay 4-J per cent, on thema rate of interest at which no producer was able to obtain money; but merely on their right to the notes, if they needed them, the private banks were able to issue credits and rake off high rates of interest. They issued credits against that right, although they were paying no interesta common form of banking practice. T)r. EABLE PAGE -This was a temporary right, for six or nine months only. Treasurer now admits much more than he did previously; but he tried to camouflage the position by saying that the banks did not l if t the whole of the notes; but I did not say they did. I adhere to my accusation that, while the primary producers could not obtain money at the low rate at which it was offered to the private banks, tbe latter, according to their own records, could issue credits against their right to l if t the notes to such an extent that they could have given credits to the amount of £60,000,000.

When the Treasurer The credit that belonged to the people, through the Commonwealth Bank, was made available to the private financial institutions. The Treasurer was guilty of the offence that he accused his predecessor, the present Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) of committing. The Commonwealth Bank should have been used as a great instrument to prevent one of the many things that the Treasurer used to deplore-the drift from the country to the cities. Evidently the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, judging by their complacent smiles, are satisfied with their I repeat that I political marriage, and are prepared to share one another's joys and sorrows. They have taken one another "" for better or for worse""; but, while the present alliance is better for them, it is worse for the great bulk of the people. The things that are done under this composite government pass my comprehension. The six charges that the present Treasurer laid against the Treasurer of 1922 ( Mr Bruce), have since been laid against him. I cannot remember a budget being so scathingly criticized by a supporter of the Government responsible for it , as this budget was criticized by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). He said that he would not hesitate to break away from the Government if it persisted withsome of its financial proposals.

The House accepted the proposal that the tax should be repealed 1923, but decided that an attempt should be made to collect the arrears owing prior to that year. The honourable member for Yarra has claimed that, in bringing matter before the public he rendered a public service, Taxation in collecting the arrears. rendered a service, but it was to the Government more than to the public, for it gave the Government an opportunity, to clarify the situation. missions that have investigated this matter, and the High Court decision that was delivered three or four weeks ago, have placed the position beyond and unravelled the very tangled Dr. Earle Page. that have The difficulties in regard to the matter began as soon as the Labour Government of federation, and for of 1914 imposed this tax without promembers viding any practical and equitable means for collecting it . Since that time, three The royal commissions have endeavoured to fix an equitable basis for it , and each for has suggested something different. Two cases' have been argued before the High Court, one in South Australia and one recently in Queensland, and the learned judges have also differed in their suggestions; and the Taxation Department has employed every conceivable means to overand lay its ghost for the come the difficulties, but the complexities For my purpose, I shall rely on of the position have so far defied solution. In all the circumstances, one would which have thought that honourable members The honorgenerally would agree that the Government acted wisely in suggesting the repeal of the tax. The reason given by the honourable member for Yarra for rethe charges he made in verting, at this late day,' to the findings adminiof the commission that investigated his but, as the Attorney-General charges in 1924, is that this is the first evening, opportunity that he has had to do so; It but I point out that,-in the 1925 session, after the report of the commission was published, the matter could have been debated on the motion for the adoption of member's charges, and the the Address-in-Reply, the motion for supI ply, or on the budget itself, though I adfrom mit that the discussion of the budget was not concluded that year. If the honourable member thought that any good purpose could be served by re-introducing The Government's proposal to the matter, he could have done it early this year on the Address-in-Reply motion, or during the debate we had on last State year's budget, or on one of the supply policies, and, secondly, motions, but he has neglected to do it until now. His excuse for introducing it now is that the Government proposes from to repeal the land tax. Prior to the debate on the 1924 budget, honourable members opposite had levelled a number of general charges of corruption and maladministrathis tion against the department, but on the 7th of August of that year the honorand stimulated the able member for Yarra made the misDepartment to greater efforts take of making a specific charge, and He certainly the Government, immediately seized the opportunity so afforded it of having an impartial investigation made into the whole matter. When its decision to apThe two royal compoint a royal commission of inquiry was announced, the chagrin and anger that honourable members opposite displayed was astonishing, notwithstanding that they had got exactly what they dedispute, manded. The honourable member for skein. Yarra, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey), in particular, complained that the scope of the reference was not broad enough, so the Government obligingly widened it to the broadest possible l i m it ; but even that did not satisfy the Opposition, for the honourable member for Yarra and his deputy leader, made further charges, and attempted to discredit the commission before it began its work. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as a matter of fact, said that the Labour party would absolutely ignore the reference of the matter to the judge, but the honourable member for Yarra did not pursue that course. Since the findings have been published, however, no opportunity has been lost to t r y to misrepresent them. This morning, the honorablo member for Hume read portions of the extracts from the reference that was made to the commission, but, so that there shall not be any misunderstanding on the matter, I propose to read the oomplete reference.

Seeing that the only persons' liable to pay land tax are those who hold land of an unimproved value of £5,000, I feel some difficulty in drawing a line between the big pastoralist on the one band and tbe struggling farmer and small land-holder on the other hand. A person who holds land of an unimproved value of £5,000 has, I should think, considerably more land than the average land-holder-; there are about 17,000 taxpayers, and although I do not know the number of .land-holders in Australia, I should imagine that the payers of land tax are in a very considerable minority. However this may be, there is no warrant for any suggestion that any discrimination is made by the Government between large and small taxpayers. The Government has on no occasion in terfered in any way in respect to the enforcement or otherwise of land tax in the case of any particular person. Some comment was made before me upon the fact that certain small taxpayers were prosecuted for not sending in returns, while otheTS who owed larger amounts were not similarly treated. During the regime of the present Government, between I k n o w t h a t honourable members the dates 9th February, 1923, and 30th June, 1924, the total number of persons prosecuted for not sending in returns was very small, there being not more than thirteen or fourteen such prosecutions in the whole of Australia. In three or four of such cases the land-owner was found, upon perusal of his return, not to from a few pounds up to nearly £500. During the same period various persons were sued for non-payment of the tax imposed upon them. was about 130, the amounts due varying from a few shillings to some thousands of pounds, and in some cases being the accumulation of several years. The r o y a l commissioner is I can see nothing in these figures, or in any facts put before me, to warrant any suggestion that discrimination was made between large and small taxpayers, and I emphasize the fact that the Government in no way interfered with the Commissioner of Taxation in respect of any of these matters. The honourable member for Y a r r a r a n away from his charge against the T a x a t i o n Commissioner, and said, "" I blame t h e H o w can a treasurer disc r i m in a t e between large and small t a x payers except t h r o u g h the T a x a t i o n D e p a r t m e n t ? The judge says t h a t the commissioner d i d not discriminate, a n d , in f a c t , n o one else could . The judge p r o ceeds to discuss the No r t h e r n T e r r it o r y prosecutionsIn Seeing that the tax is on a basis quite different from the Federal land tax and is imposed by an Aet giving different powers, that the total amounts involved are so small, and that the officer in question quite rightly followed an existing practice and did so without consulting his superior officers, I see no reason for using this evidence to support the allegation The big pastoralists that the Government differentiated between large and small taxpayers. The Government gave no instructions or directions of any kind in reference to the matter. Another matter which was commented upon in this connection was the fact that in. many cases the Commissioner of Taxation and his deputies granted extensions of time to taxpayers to send in returns and to make payments of tax. I deal more fully with this matter later on. So far as the present question is concerned I need only say that the Government in no way interfered in connection with the granting of such extensions. Mr Scullin put before me a list of 24 taxpayers, mostly Crown lessees, who between them owed about £1,125,250 of tax. I have already pointed out that this amount is due only if the commissioner's valuations are correct; the lessees claim that a very much lower valuation is the correct one, and until tliat question is settled-the report of the royal commission inquiring into this matter is not yet madeI am unable to say how much, if any, of this money is really due. The royal commissioner said, "" I am unable to say how much, if any, of this money is really due."" He was referring to the mythical sum which honourable members opposite say is owed by Crown lessees. The commissioner then saidI hlave already stated that I see no reason whatever for suggesting that the Govern nent £10.000 and more . . £5,000 and more, but less than £10,000 £1,000 and more, but less than £5,000 £100 and more, but less than £1,000 Less than £100 Total Although £1,675,000 is represented as Crown leasehold tax, the basis of valuation which was suggested by MrD u f f y , the secretary of the TradesH a l l , Melbourne, and Mr Warren Ker r has reduced it to such an extent that it seems likely that the total amount of tax outstanding w ill be £300,000, or £400,000 at the outside. For instance, the other day the court decided in Mr Jowett's case that, although his tax had been originally assessed at £85,000, and reduced to £.17,000 by the application of the new basis, .no Crown leasehold tax was payable at all on certain of his properties. The royal commissioner further statedI t is, therefore, clear that the amounts of land tax outstanding are not owing exclusively by large taxpayers. The facts are as above stated, and prove that more than three-fourths of the debtors are persons who owe less than £100 each. The next reference to the royal commissioner was(3) Whether there are any big land-owners who are defying the department, or uot sendDr. Earle Page. is, or has been, administering the act in favour of large debtors as against small debtors, or in favour of small debtors as against large debtors. Crown lessees and other taxpayersunder the act are treated alike without discrimination. The question whether a past Government was right or wrong in suspending hhe tax on Crown leaseholds is, to my mind, a matter of politics, as to which it is beyond my functions to offer any criticism'. For the same reason I offer no criticism on the question whether the Government was right or wrong in further delaying the collection of this tax by appointing a royal commission to inquire into the proper basis of assessment thereof. Still dealing with the second reference, the royal commissioner saidThe position is that the debtors to the Commissioner of Taxation at 30th June, 1924, numbered 4,746, of whom 3,767 each owe less than £100. The following is a summary of such indebtedness:Number Crown ot Persons. Freehold Tax. Leasehold Tax.

Yet the honourable member for Y a r r a says that there was no reference to the royal commissioner respecting Crown leaseholds.

103,Dr. Earlepage,"I shall read the'Certain big land-owners have not sent in returns. This matter is dealt with in my answer to question (7). I take it that this question, in view of the latter part of it, refers only to returns in respect of freehold. Certain 'big land-owners are not-paying their taxes. In my answer to question (4) I deal more fully with tliis matter, so far as freeholders are concerned. The persons who are not paying their taxes are mainly tlile Crown lessees. I have already explained that many of these lessees claim that, on a proper valuation, no taxes are .payable by them; and, in any case, the question of their liability aud tlie extent of their liability (if any) are held in abeyance pending the report of the royal commission aippointed on the 12th day of July, 1924. I do not deal further with the question qf Crown lessees who. are not paying thleir taxes, because tlie latter part of this question seems to restrict the question to non-payment by freeholders. In any event, Crown lessees are not paying tax because they have not been asked to paythis same concession being extended to all such lessees, whether large or small, until such time as a satisfactory 'basis of assessment is arrived at. That is a conclusive answer to the charge made by the honourable member for Y a r r a . The next reference to the royal commissioner was(4) Whetheri t is a fact that about £800,000 of land tax is due mainly upon freehold properties; and, if so, who owes that money T The honourable member for Y a r r a in his speech dealt largely with freeholds. The royal commissioner examined the facts, and saidI t must be noted that thlese amounts are stated as outstanding on tlie 30th June, 1924. I have inquired-mor e for my information on other questions raised by this commission-int o the reason for the non-collection of this amount. The reasons are various and may be summarized . as follow:(1) Taxes overdue and for whicli no extension of time was granted. Note a large portion of this amount has been paid since 30th June, 1924 .. (2) Taxes for Wliich extension of time for payment or permission to pay by instalments was granted (3) Taxes outstanding because of applications for relief from tax 145,126 (4) Taxes assessed in original and amended assessments not due and payable at 30th June, 1924 (5) Taxes allowed to remain unpaid because amendment of the assessment would cancel tble outstanding debt Total tax on freehold, &c. ..£382,670 In 1915, when the Labour party was in office, there was a bigger sum than that outstanding in respect of land tax. Yet nobody complained about any g r a ft or corruption in connection with arrears. Honourable members knew that for certain reasons it was impossible to collect that money in the time specified. It was accepted as right and proper that taxes which could be collected only under difficult conditions were, to some extent, necessarily in arrears. The next reference to the royal commissioner was(5) Why £189,000 of land tax remained uncollected at tlie end of last financial year, and who owes the money; the names of and amounts owed by the several taxpaj'ers to be stated in the case of any taxpayer who owes more than £20? The royal commissioner's reply was The true amount of land tax uncollected at the end of the. last financial year was £140,000. These figures, nf course, do not include the tax on Crown leaseholds-ther e was no such tax for tbbt year. TJhe amount of £189,000 stated in the budget was incorrectly arrived at, because it was made up of figures supplied on 1st July, 1924, at which date the various branch offices of the Department of Taxation bad not had placed before them the fact that eertain persons had paid their tax on or before the 30th June, 1924, at some branch office other than tlilat to which it ought properly to have been paid. Although the amount of £140,060 is stated as outstanding on 30th June, 1924, the fact is that a considerable portion of it was not payable by that date. The amount stated as unpaid is divided into the following headings:(1) Taxes overdue and for which no extension of time was granted. Note the bulk of this amount has since been paid .. .. £54,037 (2) Taxes for which extension of time for payment or permission to pay iby instalments was granted 24,179 (3) Taxes outstanding because of .. £122,895 applications for relief from tax . . 23,386 (4) Taxes assessed in original and amended assessments not due .. .. 51,548 and payable at 30th| June, 1924 34,321 (5) Taxes allowed to remain unpaid because amendment of the assessment would cancel the outstanding debt 4,137 Total tax for 1923-24 out.. 58J201 standing at 30th June, 1924 £140,060 The royal commissioner furthe r commented :.. 4,900 In view of the foregoing facts, I have some diffidence in submitting the names ofand amounts owed by the several taxpayers who owed more than £20, but as I am specially asked so to do, I append sueh list in appendix B to this my report.

How could I have discriminated when Mr Justice Edwards said that the Commissioner of Taxation had always acted without discrimination.1 In the whole' of the proceedings relating to the non-collection of this tax, there is only one point that is questionable, and that was the suspension of collections in 1918. In this regard the honourable member for Yarra said, on the 20th of August, 1.924, .addressing himself to the then Speaker( Mr Watt), who was Treasurer in 1918You directed him to suspend the taxation of Crown leaseholds, because tliere was some diffiister was looking after his own pals. When culty over the matter of assessment. For your attitude on that occasion I have no quarrel with you. That suspension was the cause of all the trouble about unpaid taxes. If the then Treasurer had obtained parliamentary sanction for his suspension of collections, no difficulty would have-been experienced subsequently in justifying it. That is the only recorded occasion in which the Treasurer interfered in any way with the collection of the tax, and the honourable member for Yarra condoned that action. Mr Justice Edwards stated, in half a dozen places in his report, that this Government has not interfered with the collection of the tax, and that instructions were given to tbe Commissioner of Taxation for the garnering of arrears as soon as the repeal act of 1923 was passed. The only respect in which there bad been the slightest illegality was the failure of the Government in 1918 to obtain parliamentary sanction of the suspension of collections, and that illegality was quite accidental, because the budget of the following year showed that the Government proposed to act in accordance with the recommendation of the royal commission. vernment collected £690,000 in the first But any irregularity in the action of the three years on the valuations of the then Treasurer was condoned by the honourable member for Yarra.

The first collection from Sir Sidney Kidman was; made by this Government in accordance; with instructions given by Parliament in August, 1923. The royal commission on taxation, of which Mr Warren Kerr, a prominent Melbourne business man, and Mr Duffy, secretary of the Melbourne Trades Hall, were '[members, reported that the arrears of taxation on Crown leaseholds in the years in which Labour was in office were-1914-15 , £58,000; 1915-16, £157,000. In those years a Labour Government bad complete control of the collection, but it found, as subsequent Governments have found, that it is impossible to arrive at a definite basis upon which this impost can be applied. owners.",32,Moloney W H Y Did The

It is furnished by a study of the conditions in Western Australia and Queensland. 267,000,000 acres were held on Crown lease,' and in Queensland 317,000,000 acres; and the valuations in Western Australia were £1,800, and in Queensland £77,000. was no difficulty in collecting the tax in Western Australia was that in most cases the local valuers recognized, as the people in South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland averred, that there was no freehold value in the leasehold land. It is worthwhile to examine the valuation of Crown leaseholds, in order better to understand the difficulties associated therewith, and the justification for the statement of this Government in 1923 that Parliament, in asking the department to collect this tax, had given it an almost impossible task. The royal commission's report sets out, at page 15, the four bases of valuation employed up to that timeAssessment made on different bases -Assess ments in respect of lessees' estates in Crown lands seem to have heen made upon(a) the basis of one or other of the methods of valuation set out in the . statement which constitutes Appendix2 of tliis report; (6) the basis of taxpayers' own valuation; (c) the basis at first laid down by the department (paragraph 14); and {d) the basis prescribed under G.O. 816 which apparently first took definite shape in IQ17.

P a r t l y on deAsI said at that time, the Government had no intention of allowing to remain on the statute-book an act which could not What is the explanabe operated,, and we sought from Parliament a direction as to what we should do. In another part of the report, the royal commission on taxation pointed out that In Western Australia the Government immediately attempted to translate into action the instructions given by Parliament for the collection of arrears of land taxation. It says, on page 1 1 The reason why there That on the l l t h December, 1923, following on the decision of Parliament that the tax on Crown leases assessed for past years should be collected, all deputy commissioners were instructed to demand outstanding tax due on Crown leases as soon as their value had been arrived at in accordance with the instruction of 29th October, 1923. That shows conclusively that, following the passage of the act in August, 1923, the Government took definite action to collect arrears of taxation. U p to this time four different bases of valuation had been employed, and the royal commission, comprising men who could not be said to have any bias in favour of the Government or the pastoralists, after taking a lot of evidence, and carefully considering the matter, laid down a certain basis for the valuation of the freehold equities in leasehold lands. The Government adopted that basis for future valuation, but as soon as it was applied the department found that the enormous sums of money supposed to be owing to the Government, according to departmental valuations, began to disappear. For instance, one valuation of £85,000 was reduced to £17,000, and another of £150,000 was whittled down to £40,000. The effect of the application of a system of valuation suggested by a quite disinterested body was to cut the departmental assessments to pieces, and when it was tested before the H i g h Courti n Queensland recently the court declared even that unsatisfactory and excessive. According to a basis which the court laid down as just and equitable, there was practically no. freehold value in certain leasehold lands, whose tax had been originally assessed at £40,000, and subsequently reduced to £9,000. The Labour party in this Parliament has tried to make this land tax a stalking horse for abuse of the Government. It has suggested corruption by saying that we are giving away something to our wealthy friends. The fact is that, at the time when this tax was repealed the Labour Government of Queensland, acting w it h a thorough knowledge of the cattle industry, decided to re-assess all the cattle lands, which comprised the greater part of the Crown leases in that State, retrospectively to 1921, when the slump in the meat trade began. garded the leasehold rents it was receiving as excessive, and a burden on the meat industry, which would help to force it deeper into tbe bog of despair. ment thought that the rents it was receiving from the Crown lessees were in excess of the real value of the land, and reduced the rents in some cases by 50 per cent., there could be no freehold equity remaining for purposes of Commonwealth taxation when the higher rents were being paid. Indeed, when the suspension of the collection of this tax was first discussed in this House, Mr Ryan declared that if there was any excess of value in Crown leaseholds above the rent paid to the State Government, it belonged to the State, and the lessee should pay a higher rent. wealth Government into this sphere was, he said, an interference with State policy. And that has been the effect of the Commonwealth taxation of Crown leaseholds. The honourable member for Y a r r a takes exception to tbe Government's proposal to repeal the Federal land tax, and he and the honourable member for Hume declare that the State Parliament may not desire to re-impose the tax. Houses would prevent its re-imposition I am sure that the criticism by the become the function of the CommonW a t t ) , and the honourable member for wealth Parliament to determine the land, Yarra( Mr Scullin), have been completely income, or any other taxation policy of answered by the Treasurer.

The honourable member for Yarra, referring to certain figures that appeared in the memorandum issued in connection with the speech on the States GrantsB ill , objected to the average over three years being put down at £2,111,000, and pointed out that in 1922-23 and 1923-24, the amount collected was less than that. He did noli quote the assessment figures of 1922-23, which, after the reduction of 20 per cent, in the rates had been made, was £2,143,000.

In 1924-25, and in 1925-26, the total collection reached well over £2,500,000, which, it is true, includes some Crown leasehold collections, but the increases, compared with 1923-24, were not wholly due to such collections. It will be found that the estimates made by the Government are absolutely correct.

I venture to predict that at no very distant date, it will be necessary for him to join the supporters of the present Government.

He w ill be in the same position as Senator Ogden, who declared that "" as soon as a man began to think for himself, he found that there was noscope for him in tbe Labour party."" kindliness of the honourable member's criticism of my speech, I do not appreciate his suggestion that I am ever likely to change my political views. declaration before .from Labour men, who have subsequently"" changed over. Having regard to the attitude of _the Australian Labour party, and the fact that the honourable member bas bad the courage to think for himself in regard to tbe referendum proposals, it is possible that he w ill not be consulted as to whether or not he shall leave the Labour party. platform of the Labour party in that matter. that body to decide. I mean my remarks to be most complimentary, because I have never listened to a member of Parliament who has given closer attention to every subject on which he speaks. I shall look forward with pleasure to giving the honourable member a welcome to the Nationalist party. I also compliment the Treasurer upon the budget speech. The complaint has often been heard that the Treasurer's statements are brought down too late in the year. To-day, however, the criticism is offered that the budget has been introduced too soon, and that some of the particulars usually furnished have not been supplied. It is impossible to in clude all the facts and figures if the budget is to be presented at the beginning of J u l y ; but it is f a r better to have an Carly budget with a few figures omitted than a late one that would. cause inconvenience to all concerned. I notice that the absence of certain figures has not curtailed discussion to any serious extent, Whenever he takes part and that thei'e is no danger of the country suffering through lack of criticism of the budget. I regret the remarks of the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), who alluded to the exodus from rural life in New South Wales. He referred to figures quoted by the honourable member for Gwydir( MrA b b o t t ); but surely he does not intend to place all the blame on the shoulders of the Pederal Government for the fact that people are leaving the land in New South Wales. There, the people are blessed with a Labour Government, that recently passed a Rural Accommodation Act. That measure could have no other tendency than to drive men off the land. That Labour Government has also passed a Workmen's I have heard that Compensation Act. A t least 500 persons in my electorate alone have been forced as the result of it to leave the land and go to cities like Melbourne and Sydney to find employment. If the progress in country districts is not as great as we should like it to be, we should realize that in five of the States Labour Governments are in power. Thed r if t to the cities cannot be attributed to adhering to the the Federal Government. The tendenoy in New South Wales, where a 44-hour week has been introduced, is in the direction of high wages and short hours of labour. Short hours, of course, mean less work, apart from a ""go-slow"" policy. Conditions of life are f a r more attractive in the cities than they are in the country, and, if shorter hours of labour are observed in secondary than in r u r a l industries, the temptation to leave the land will remain. I wish to be f a i r ; but it must be admitted that whether a Nationalist or a Labour Government is in power, the attractions of the cities, including the better educational facilities they offer, naturally tempt country people to leave the rura l districts. A number of folk live in the cities, and at the same time carry on occupations in the country, because railways and motor cars have'revolutionized transport and provided conveniences of which our forefathers never dreamt. The problem of de-centralization has to be met throughout the civilized world. People",35,Moloney W H Y Did The

The day must come, however, when the cities Avill be overcrowded. Then the tendency will he for the people to drift back to the land. I was induced to make these remarks because I believe that the drift to the cities should not be attributed to the present Government. One of the burning questions of to-day is the proposed withdrawal of the per capita payments to the States. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) said that if any honourable member was prepared to speak favourably of the budget his photograph should be taken and hung in this chamber as a curiosity. I am prepared to take that risk, because I feel that the budget is one of which the Treasurer and the .Government may well be proud. I do not think that the States will lose by the withdrawal of the per capita payments; in fact, I believe that the proposal will prove a blessing in disguise. South ""Wales, for instance, at least £150,000 per annum will be put into the pockets of the taxpayers. 1 am here to speak for tbe people of that State, and not for the New South Wales Parliament. No doubt the State Parliaments find it convenient to have large sums of money handed over to them as the States' share of the Customs revenue-mone y that they have not had the responsibility of collecting. It is so much "" easy money"" to which they can look every year; and consequently the electors do not feel aggrieved with the State Governments, since tbe money has not been collected from them by means of direct taxation. this the temptation is for the State Governments to become extravaganta failing that more or less has beset every' Government. bave to impose direct taxation, the people will want to know the reason for it. But if they receive a share of the Customs revenue careless financing will be encouraged. Balaclava traced the history of federation, spoke of the ""Braddon blot,"" touched on the referendum of 1910, and outlined the conditions obtaining to-day; but he did not put forward any practical suggestion as to what should be done in future. I can understand the opposition from the State Parliaments to the withdrawal of the per capita payments ; but if we consider the mat! ter in the interests of the individual elector we shall be prepared to Support the Treasurer in his proposal.' I compliment the Treasurer upon having agreed to postpone definite action in this matter for twelve months'. It would have been hard on the States bad he said in the middle of Tune that the per capita payment would be totally abolished' from the 1st July. The State Governments are all'busy preparing their budgets at present, and they would have been placed in a serious difficulty by such a summary pronouncement. But I assure the Treasurer that I shall solidly support terminating the per capita payments at' the beginning of the next financial year. I regret that it is not possible for the' Government to entirely vacate tbe field of income taxation, but it has made a In New good step in that direction, and I trust that the present Treasurer will Still be in office when such taxation will be .entirely discontinued by the Commonwealth. I listened with a good deal of interest to the free trade members from Western Australia discussing the tariff some weeks ago and I was also inter-; ested in their remarks last night on the budget. I wonder what would be the' position of Western Australia if pre-federation conditions were reverted to? In my opinion the Government is treating the States magnificently in respect of its new financial proposals in lieu of the per capita payments I except Western' Australia and Tasmania from that geneBut with so much of ral remark; but special provision is being ""easy money"" to spend, made to assist them. .' The remarks that honourable members; opposite, have made so far in this debate have contained very little. criticism of If the State Governments the budget. They have confined their attention to ancient history in regard to' the collection of land tax. I submit that there are very few items of expenditure in the financial statement now The honourable member for before the committee that tbey would 1 think of reducing if they were in office.; I do not think that they would suggest n decrease in tlic war pensions. that point I congratulate the Minister for Defence on his successful administration. A few years ago, when I Was a member of the New South ""Wales Parliament, I was frequently interviewed by persons who claimed an increase in their war pensions, and I always advised them to interview the Pederal representative for their division; but I am glad to say that since the present Minister has been in charge complaints of that nature have, to a large extent, disappeared. most liberal interpretation that could possibly be given to the act, and I think all honourable members will admit that, in consequence, their correspondence in relation to war pensions has decreased considerably. Nor do I not think honourable members opposite would suggest a reduction in the old-age and invalid pensions. The expenditure under that head last year showed an increase of £472,000 on the expenditure of the previous, year. honourable members opposite suggest that the Government acted wrongly in increasing the pension? old to be gulled by that story. The late Sir Austin Chapman, who previously represented Eden-Monaro, always displayed a keen interest in the old-age and invalid pensions, and had a good deal to do with their introduction in Australia; and I have yet to learn that he was ever a member of the Labour Government. efforts that the pension was increased from 10s. to 12s. 6d. a week. I believe the Labour party was responsible for increasing the amount from 12s. 6d. to 15s., an action by the way that was taken on the eve of an election; but every other increase has been granted by a national government. The Labour party unsuccessfully tried to gain some kudos for endeavouring to obtain a 5s. increase on one occasion when the Government proposed an increase of 2s. 6d., and lionorable members opposite made pensions a side issue at the last election; niture made out of boxes bearing but their actions in that connection did not in any way mislead the public or injure the Government. On The sum of £217,000 was granted last year in bounties to the wine industry, witli excellent results. I suggest that honourable members opposite would not think of discontinuing such payments, which' are beneficial to the whole community. This particular bounty illustrates the value of a properly-managed subsidy to an industry. I have been requested by certain banking interests to bring under the notice of the Treasurer the desirableness of printing our Australian notes on The Minister has given the stronger paper. The paper on which the notes are at present printed is altogether too flimsy for the purpose, and comparatively new notes are often paid into various banks in such a dilapidated and mutilated condition that they cannot again be issued. In the old days when each bank issued its own notes the paper was much stronger and in every way more suitable. I do not suggest that there is any serious remissness in this matter, but I hope that the TreaDo surer will inquire into it in the interests of all concerned, and see that stronger and better paper is used. Two or three matters affecting the administration of the Postmaster General's Department merit mention. The present Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson) is, in my opinion, an able and earnest Minister who thoroughly understands his work; but I am afraid be is a little too sensitive, for he resents even the mildest criticism of his administration. It is the undoubted duty of honourable members to bring under his notice complaints which are made to It was largely due to his them from time to time. I regret that more suitable buildings are not provided for post offices in country towns. It is possible for the merest stranger to guess which is the post office in almost any country town in my State, for he has only to walk up to the most dilapidated looking building in the place. Even new post offices may invariably be recognized by their poor, makeshift furnishings, which are anything but creditable to the Commonwealth.

I shall support the construction of the line, and I hope that it will not prove the financial sink that some people expect it to be. Honourable, members opposite will agree that the Government's defence policy, so far as this bill is concerned, is not extravagant. greater expenditure in thatdirection. The Government is to be congratulated on having provided for a sinking fund. Although the provision has been ridiculed by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) the principle is a good one. That £28,000,000 is to be expended in other directions does not alter the fact that the war debt has been reduced by £28,000,000. War expenditure is not reproductive, whereas the money expended in other directions will be expended largely on reproductive works. The various State Governments, which have done little, if anything, towards the establishment of sinking funds would do well to follow the example set by the Commonwealth in that connection. I listened attentively to the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Justice Lukin, of the Supreme Court Watt), but even he admitted that the States were likely to receive a good return from the expenditure which they will incur. The position of the Commonwealth is different from that of the States. east-west railway and the north-south railway, when constructed, will not. always mean a financial loss to the Commonwealth. But until the revenue derived from them, at least, equals the expenditure incurred, the provision of a sinking fund is wise. There are some who regret that New South Wales has not come into line with the other States and agreed to one central borrowing authority.' I do not altogether hold that view, because I am not at all confident that the scheme will be a success. As I understand that the Treasurer desires to report progress, I shall continue my remarks at a later date. Progress reported. BILL. Bill returned from the Senate without amendment.

Scullin, Esq., M.H.R, DKAR SIB , I am writing to you on behalf of the members of the above branch to bring before the House this letter in reply to the statements made by Mr Seabrook in regard to the wnterside workers. He says in one part of his speech that strikes have taken place on ships nt Hobart which called to take away f r u it . I might state that complimenting the waterside workers on the a little trouble did occur over the agents here refusing to employ our members to take ships' lines, which we have always claimed as our work, and the agents were given ample notice that if they did not do so our members would not work overtime at such vessels. ignored the notification and two vessels that came in became involved. Overtime was not done on tbe day of their arrival. they (the agents) agreed to employ our members for such work, and there has been no friction since. Mr Seabrook also stated in the House that the waterside workers are a closed union. That is right up to a certain extent, because the Hobart branch is overdone now with membership. We may be a little short handed now and again in the busy season on account of the glut of shipping, but that being so, there are plenty of outside unemployed labour that obtain that which we cannot do, and we do not object to them working. Again, it was stated that members are brought from the mainland to assist in loading ships. I might say that members come from the mainland at their own expense, and are not sent for. Not more than 30 members came from the mainland this season. (That is from the Federation.) The rest, numbering about 50, came from the branches in Tasmania. They have a perfect right under our constitution to transfer from or to any branch of the Waterside Workers Federation. Mr Seabrook says that men in Hobart who are willing to work are prevented from doing so by being excluded from the unions. As I stated before, the union is overcrowded now, and there is not enough work for the members who are in it at present. As for working 48 hpurs at a stretch, that is far-fetched, of course. The majority have to work long hours when the work is there to make up for the lean time throughout the remainder of the year. I suppose it is newB to Mr Seabrook that our wages are based on a 30-hour week by the late president of the Arbitration Court, Mr Justice Higgins, and I can say this with authority, there are very few members of this branch, with all the long hours worked in the busy time, who earn over the basic wage, but there are a great many of them who do not earn over £ 3 per Week all the year round.

Of course, we were fortunate this trip in having all union After that men, which has not been the case on the last two or three trips previously, owing, of course, to the fact that there were so many Home boats in loading f r u it , whicli absorbed the union la/bour. Yours faithfully , J. W. EVANS, Hobart manager. Those two letters speak for themselves. I said at the time that the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) were a slander on those workers. The waterside workers of Hobart asked me to bring the matter before the House, because they feel that their honour is at stake. They are amongst those who do the hard work of the community. It may soil their hands and their clothing, but tbeir honour is as bright and untarnished as that of men who perform less arduous tasks. I suggest to the honourable member that he would do well to withdraw the slander on this hard-working body of men in Hobart. several' occasions I have referred to the desirability of extending the period of the wine bounty beyond the 31st of August of next year. The position of the industry is acute. The growers of Doradilla grapes, who include many returned soldiers, send their grapes to the distilleries, and do not get their final returns until the spirit is bought by the",42,Seabrook M P Wine Bounty Pneumonic Influenza
134,Mr Parsons (Angas) [4.3],"O nwine-makers. Because of the uncertainty as to the Government's intention, the sale of the spirit is held up. The price to be paid for the grapes of the next vintage will be governed by the continuance or cessation of tbe wine bounty. In fact, the sale of a large part, if not the whole, of the crop is at stake. The growers are concerned as to their future, and are looking for an indication of the policy of the Government, as they should now be preparing their plans for the next crop. The wine-makers, too, are in an indefinite position. If the bounty is to be extended beyond the 31st of August, 1927, I am assured that every pound of grapes produced w ill be purchased at prices satisfactory to the growers. The industry is in a parlous condition. Money has to be expended now and plans made for the future, but the wine to be made from the grapes of the next vintage w ill not be exportable unti l after the present period of tbe bounty has expired. Having regard to the fact that the industry has yielded to the Commonwealth over £2,000,000 in the form of excise duty on for t if y in g union had the power of selecting the men for spirits, I hope that the extension of the bounty will receive the early and sympathetic consideration of the Government. I abide by the statements I made in this House regarding the waterside workers in Hobart, and I shall endeavour to prove that what I said was correct. I said that the union is a close corporation. That is true. I also said that great numbers of men were brought from other parts of Tasmania and the mainland, because Hobart men, who were outside the union, were not allowed to earn money on the wharfs. from the secretary of the Stevedore's Union in Hobart, which show that 78 men were brought to Hobart from different parts of Australia, including 39 from the mainland. The latter were the T if f r a ff of Victoria, and they introduced go-slow tactics to Tasmania. They were extremists of a rather bad type, and were responsible for the strikes and other disputes that occurred while oversea ships were being loaded with f r u it . The shipping agents had trouble with the union in regard to the taking of the lines from the overseas ships, and, as a result, some vessels had to depart without f r u it that was waiting for them on the wharfs. Those men would not work overtime, and they stopped work on a Saturday morning at 10 o'clock. The letter I have received statesNot satisfied with demanding that their members should be employed to take ships' lines, the Hobart union actually served notice upon all of the agents of overseas steamship companies in Hobart that their members must be employed to receive and stack fruit. The union wrote to us, and other shipping agents, as follows :I wish to draw your attention to the employment of other than members of this branch for stacking fruit in sheds on the wharfs of Hobart. I have been instructed by the executive of the federation that all work on wharfs belongs to members of the waterside workers of Australia, and, to save trouble, I would suggest that members of this branch be employed in the future for work of this character. Following the experience we had had with ships lines, this letter could only be interpreted as a threat, but, as it happened, tliis demand on the part of the union was not persisted in. The men who are engaged for the receiving and stacking of fruit are men who can be relied upon to keep record, and, in most instances, they have had semi-clerical experience. Chaos would result if wharf labourers had to be employed, especially if the the job. E.M.S. NALDERA AND T.S.S. ESPERANCE BAY. These steamers were loading at Hobart on llth, 12th, and 13th March. As you know, mail steamers invariably load right through, in order to mamtaln their time-table. However, at this time, the shipping agents in Hobart had not given way to the union on the question of ships' lines. By way of retaliation the union declined to work any overtime on the Thursday night, but the agents were able to persuade them to work on the Friday night. In consequence of this action on the part of the union, the Haidera short-shipped 1,749 cases of apples, while, in the case of the That is a fact. I have figures Esperance Bay, the short shipment was more serious, being 6,300 cases. This is the kind of thing that Tasmania has had to p u t up with, owing to the presence of a certain number of men imported from the the mainland. The waterside workers carry thermometers in their pockets. A ship's cold store is supposed to be at a temperature of 34 degrees on arrival. If it drops to 32 degrees, the men cease work, notwithstanding that if the doors were lef t open for a few minutes the temperature would rise rapidly. Other workmen engaged in ordinary cool stores on shore work at much lower temperatures and without raising trouble. Let me now give honourable members some",43,Huddabt Parkeb Limited
135,Mr Seabrook ( F R A N K L I N ) [4.5],"information as to the comparative rates of loading. This letter states1 cannot give you specificfigures,toutit can safely 'he stated that in most of the steamers which loaded at Hobart this season there was a falling-off of anything from 20 to 35 per cent, in the number of cases loaded per hour as compared with a few years ago. In fact, only four orfiveyears ago, double the quantity pci hour was loaded. I have been informed that eighteen men working on each hold load only 700 cases an hour. The thing is monstrous. And yet the honourable member for Yarra talks about these "" hard-working "" men! Twice the required number of men are engaged loading the ships. Whilst a vessel is taking in one lift.of fruit, there are two more trucks waiting, with the men sitting or smoking on the handles. I have seen them doing this. I was born near the wharfs. I am not afraid to state my views on this subject. The position is better in the northern ond of the island, where the influence of the Waterside Workers Union is not so apparent. At Bcaconsfield the men load twice as much fruit per hour as the "" hard-working"" unionists do in Hobart. The men are paid to work from S a.m. till 5 p.m. At 12 o'clock they knock off for diurier, and they are supposed to start again at 1 o'clock. Actually they go on board at 8 o'clock, but it is half-past 8 before the first sling of fruit, is lifted, and they knock off at ten minutes to 12 for dinner. I can understand why the honourable member for Yarra should read the letter which he has received from the Waterside Workers Union. He wished to put their side of the case before the House; but I stand by what I have said. Now as to the wages. The men are paid 2s. l i d . an hour from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Do honourable memhers realize thut this class of unskilled labour is more highly paid than skilled labour is in many parts of Australia? a truck and put cases of fruit into a sling. On week days, from 7 p.m. to midnight, the rate of pay is 3B. 9d. an hour; from midnight to 7 a.m. it is 4s. 6d.; on ordinary holidays it is 5s. an hour; and on extraordinary holidays, such as Eight Hours' Day and Christmas Day, it is 6s. 6d. an hour. The new log coming bofore the Arbitration Court asks up to 8s. 10£d. an hour. It is impossible to provide cheap freights while this sort of thing goes on. I Bay deliberately that some of these men are not earning 5s. a day, and yet they want to be paid up to 8s. lOd. an hour. Some of them do not do a quarter of a day's work. I retract nothing of what I have said. member advocate 5s. as the standard rate of wage for unskilled labour? emphatically that the great hulk of these men are not earning it. I would not mind if they got £1 a day if they gave £1 worth of work. This kind of thing is the curse of Australia. We are not getting anything like the return we should for the money that is being paid. I have nothing to retract. Trade and Customs) [4.17] -Replying to the remarks of the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons), I should like to say that, owing to the many representations which he has made, I have given the subject of wine bounties careful consideration, and in view of new points that have arisen since the passing of the act I have referred .the matter formally to the Tariff Board for report. I direct the attention of the Minister for Health to the advisability of taking steps to prevent the introduction of pneumonic influenza, a very dangerous epidemic, from New Zealand. I suggest that representation be made to the Government of Now Zealand to require all ships carrying passengers to have a medical officer on board. This, of course, would materially assist the Quarantine Department on the arrival of vessels at Australian ports. ister for Health) [4.19j -Fo r some time 1 have been interested in the question Any man can wheel raised by the honorahle member. I agree that it is advisable that medical officers should beappointed on all ships carrying passengers on voyages extending over more than two or three days. The subject has been unofficially discussed with the New Zealand Government, and I hope to be in a position, one day next week, to inform the honourable member of the outcme.
