Whether he issued instructions that thc practice of working ""broken shifts"" in the Mail Branch of the C.P.O. was to be discontinued? 2. Is he aware that thc practice of working .""broken shifts"" still continues and is a source of much dissatisfaction to the omcers affected thereby ? 3. Will extra pay be allowed to ofiicers of the G.P.O-, Sydney, for overtime worked to keep pace with the extra rush and volume of business during the Christmas and New Year season ? honourable member's questions are as follow1. When in SydneyI received a deputation of omcers on the subject of "" broken shifts,"" and instructed the Deputy Postmaster-General thut the practice was to be discontinued as far as possible. I may add that that officer pointed out that in no post office was it possible, in connection with the mail branch, to so arrange work that there would be no broken time. 2. Yes, to a certain extent; but it is reported 3 December, 1007. to be impracticable in view of the very irregular character of the work in the Mail Branch to altogether do away with broken time. 3. Extra pay for overtime in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act and Regulations will be allowed.

This manufacturer, whose word can be relied likely to pay £ 1 6 7s. 2d. for six pots, which cost abroad only four guineas, if he could have obtained them in Australia.

The goods mentioned by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie have been included in this item for a special purpose They were formerly included in another item, but representations have been made from very large centres in the eastern parts of Australia that the goods are being made here.

If the Committee decides against me, I cannot help it, but I shall certainly have a division. sorry to have to speak a second time, but since the Treasurer has asked why crucibles should be free, I think it necessary to mention that plumbago crucibles are not made in the Commonwealth. The necessary plumbago is not to be obtained here. tralia. .make plumbago crucibles there? manufacture of clay crucibles has been carried on on Kargaroo Island for the last five years, but the industry does not appear to increase very rapidly. which only three men are employed? statement.

Clav crucibles may be used four or five times, but those made of plumbago can be used from thirty .to fifty, and in some cases a hundred times. The English crucibles that we import are used there in public departments like the Mint, and also in many of the States of Europe. wishing the local industry success, I feel that there is ample justification for the request that these articles should be on the free list resent the attitude adopted by the Treasurer, who nearly always insinuates that the stand taken up by an honourable member in regard to any item is due either to his having a personal interest in it, or to the influence of some one who is affected by it . advocate the placing of crucibles on the free list; it is rather to the contrary. the position of honourable members in manv cases; but the Treasurer insists upon making such assertions in matters relating to Western Australia.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE T h a t is not an insinuation; it is a fact. the Treasurer is incapable of giving impartial consideration to arguments that are advanced in reference to any of these items. The As a matter of fact, although he has said that Australian-made crucibles are used in the eastern States, and that Western Australia alone asks for the imported article, I have just had handed to me a letter from the Victorian Chamber of Mines Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not pay much attention to its representations. the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures waited on the Treasurer, he would take it into the Ministerial room so that he might obtain a f u l l and clear explanation of what was wanted, and then, like a gramophone, would repeat in the House what was said. The Victorian Chamber of Mines ought ;to be just as competent to express an opinion' In the circumstances, while on' a question of this description as is any institution. It knows more about mining and the points at issue in connection with this matter than does any other institution. Its members find it to their interests to secure the best appliances. In a letter from the Chamber, it is stated thatOn account of crucibles being of bulky nature and freight charged by measurement, they cost from 30 to 40 per cent, to import, which in itself is a substantial protection. They also state thatLocal crucibles vary in quality on account of It is not to my interest to the clay being unsuitable, and, being unreliable, they are little used.

If that be so, how shall we benefit Australia by imposing this duty? Will the desire to give employment to three men in the making of an inferior class of crucible be sufficient to justify us in placing a heavy impost on scientific institutions that are doing much to encourage research, and to improve mining propositions that may be of immense benefit to the people of Australia ? . was not my intention to speak to this question until the Treasurer urged that we ought, in this case,, to give Australia a show. If we desire to do so we certainly ought not to include in this item crucibles made of plumbago, or partly of plumbago, and high-grade assay crucibles. If we do, instead of helping Australia, we shall blight it.

Within the last few months an ornamental church window was imported for the Church of England, in Adelaide, at a cost of ^260, and the duty thereon amounted to no less than £ 9 0 . Surely, in the interests of art, the Minister is not going tq impose a tax on an ornamental church window, which really contributes to the beautifying of a city, to the tune of ^90 ? That, in my opinion, is merely protection run mad. Anything which improves public churches, is a matter in which the community is largely interested. We ought to encourage the use of the highest forms of art, and the only way in which to achieve that object is by having a moderate duty, or no duty. I think that if we omit the word "" heraldic"" it will cover the case of ornamental church windows. It may also be necessary to strike out the words "" or engraved,"" and to insert the word ""plain"" before the words ""panes, prisms, and all glass framed with metal,"" because, otherwise, ornamental church windows might fall under the latter words.

The Treasurer has suggested that we might afterwards exempt windows for churches and public institutions, as being works of art, imported under departmental by-laws.

I suppose that we all desire to see our churches beautified,, but a slight increase in the cost of stained-glass windows, due to a duty for the protection of the local industry, would not prevent people interested in church decoration from purchasing beautiful windows. withdraw the amendment, but I wish it to be understood that I do so because of a They are works of promise given by the Treasurer that, without binding himself in any way, he would favourably consider the inclusion of these articles in a list similar to the exemption list in the Tariff of 1902. I should like the Treasurer to] declare what his policy is going to be on this item. If he is prepared to exempt the article referred to by the honourable member for Angas, it would be better that the whole of the articles included in this item should two are interbe admitted free. The honourable gentleman's decision on the question'may affect my vote upon the whole item.

230,Mr Watson (South Sydney) [3.19],"to point out that if the honourable member for Angas withdraws his amendment he will not accomplish the purpose he desires. The best way would be to take these articles out of this item and subsequently include them in the list of exemptions. It is quite true, as the honourable member for South Sydney has said, that there_are a number of people engaged in the stained-glass industry in the Commonwealth; but I never yet heard of any artist in Australia asking for protective duties with the object of keeping out works of art. stained-glass window industry are asking fbr a duty. I had a protest only a short time ago from a manufacturer in Sydney against their free admission. between a manufacturer and an artist. If the person referred to was an artist, he must be an exception to the general rule. Artists the world over are only too glad to add to their knowledge by the study of works of art produced in all parts of the world. ' ber define what a work of art is? take me the whole afternoon; but I have no doubt that the works of art mentioned in this item should be included in the free list. I remind the Committee that stainedglass windows must be considered as in a . different category from paintings or sculpture. A great painting, or a fine piece of sculpture, imported, cannot be produced in Australia; but I will undertake to find in Victoria, New South Wales, or South Australia, artists who will produce any kind of stainedrglass window honourable members are willing to pay for. Mr 'HUTCHISON I challenge the honourable member to point to any stainedglass window in Australia at the present time a replica of which cannot be made in the Commonwealth. It must not be forgotten that in the stained-glass window industry the artists are not the only persons employed. The industrv gives a great deal of employment to ordinary workmen. I am astonished at the Treasurer giving in this matter a promise which would have the effect of destroying a flourishing in-dustrv giving considerable employment,' and which would also prevent the development in the Commonwealth of the higher class of art in this line. I hope the honourable member for Hindmarsh will permit me to tell him that he is entirely wrong when he speaks in the way he has done about stained-glass windows. Some of the greatest antists in England are employed to-day upon ecclesiastical glass work for which we have no parallel in this country. in this line done here. Mf. BRUCE SMITH -That may be so. Very fine oil and water-colour painting and very fine sculptors' work are done here. There is also very fine literature produced in Australia. I saw a magazine the other day, in which if. was roundly asserted that no magazines from abroad should be allowedinto Australia, because all the magazine work required in the Commonwealth could be produced here. that the honourable member does not think so, but the statement, appearing in the magazine to which I have referred, discloses the same spirit as that just displayed by the honourable member, and which is very often found in people who are not sufficiently informed artistically to discriminate in these matters. I can inform the honourable member that the best stained glass ecclesiastical window work is looked upon in Great Britain, and on the Continent, as involving as high a knowledge of art as does oil or water-colour painting. ber cannot point to a stained glass window in Australia which could not be duplicated here.' Mr ""BRUCE SMITH -The honourable member is talking about replicas, but he must know that we could get a first-rate Australian artist to make a replica of the ""The Bent Tree"" to-morrow, and while ""The Bent Tree"" cost about ^5,600, the copy of the picture would not be worth ^5.

They have also, to cut away portions of the glass, and to sell those portions at a ridiculously small price. .There is some reason therefore why their raw material should be admitted free. But the proposal of the honourable member for Yarra appears to go beyond what is asked by the Victorian bevellers and glass-workers. They say that they desire polished and patent plate up to 12 superficial feet to be admitted free. They further requesi that a duty shall be levied upon all glass in furniture. WhilstI am prepared to exempt their raw material from duty up to a reasonable size, I think that their other request is not a desirable one to grant.

What they spoke of was the omission of the items under 12 superficial feet, and I concluded that it was their raw material up to that measurement which they wanted made free. If the honourable member for Yarra can say that it is up to 25 superficial feet that they want their raw material made free, I shall accept his statement. typewritten document which has been distributed amongst honourable members, the glass-cutters distinctly request that the duty on glass up to 25 superficial feet be removed. 1 have also a letter from the secretary to the union, in which he informs me that the members of the union 1 representing the workers in the trade ask for practically the same thing as I have proposed.

I should have been prepared to agree to a concession, provided flint glassware had been maintained upon the higher standard, with fixed measurement duties. But as all the duties are absorbed under this heading now, I think it would be a great mistake to make a further reduction. [4.35] I do not know what this splenetic outburst from the honourable member for Bendigo means. We have been voting for the honourable member's recommendation. Why is he bolting away from his own recomendation in this fashion? Why must the protectionists be designated "" so-called protectionists ""a most insulting term to apply to anyman, I think. honourable member, anyhow. ply to the honourable member who made use of the phrase just now, as much as to any member of this Committee, because he has departed frequently from his own recommendations, and has repeatedly ignored them. Sir' JOHN QUICK -No. the honourable member will find out that what I say is true if he looks through the record of his own votes: The honourable member overlooks the fact that four-fifths of these goods come from foreign countries. Sir Commission recomended a duty of 25 per cent., and the honourable member's party now propose to reduce it to 20 per cent. pointed out that four-fifths of the importathose high duties in order to reach tions would come in under the 25 per cent, vote, and that only a very small proportion would come in under the 20 per cent, duty-which , by the way, is not carried yet. flint glassware now. so. Again the reply is that the bulk of these goods come from foreign countriesI mean the cheaper sorts. says that the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended 25 per cent. They did not. They recommended a measurement duty, as the honourable member will I strongly object to any further resee if he turns to their report. ber for Bendigo is to blame for allowing the item to be altered. ing to the report, that the honourable member for Laanecoorie is quite right. I want to add that any man or set of men who would deliberately propose duties on glassware amounting to over 200 per cent, must have been beside themselves. Such recommendations are only worthy to be scouted, not to be followed. « honourable member for Bendigo has referred to the elaborate report of the A section of the Tariff Commission on glassware. TheB section on account of lack of time did not furnish anything in the nature of a report. Nevertheless, our recommendations are based on a fair analysis of the evidence. I make bold to say that the recommendations of the A section are not based on the evidence as a whole. Emphasis has been laid on a certain portion of it, and other phases of the evidence, equally important in my opinion, have been altogether ignored. There is no doubt about tlie high duties proposed by the A section in this respect. Added to the high cost of importing these goods into Australia, those duties would,' in my opinion, exceed evert the necessities of prohibition. I hold in my hand documents which show that in the case of typical instances in glassware the cost of importation is as high as 165 per cent. With the duties as proposed the JOHN QUICK -My section of the total would be 355 ner cent. Surely that is protection absolutely run mad. If the honourable member for Bendigo is not a prohibitionist, I take it that he must come down very considerably from that level of moderation which he claims he always had before him in framing his recommendations.

I have taken the trouble to verify the facts contained in the papers that have been supplied to honourable members by entries in the cost book. I find that the facts are identical in every respect. There can be no question that a gross and unnecessaryduty is being added to the high charges of importation, which will make the carrying on of this industry only possible at enormous disadvantage. If there is any vitality in the Australian glassware industry at all, it ought to be able to carry on without any duty, the cost of importation being so high. There is another cost which has not been included in these amounts. I allude to breakages, which, I believe, run up to about 10 per cent. That percentage has to be added on to the 355 per cent, to find the total charges under the existing scheme of the Government. I am satisfied that these duties are so unnecessarily high that reasonable protectionists cannot in dorse them. I feel sure that they can be reduced with considerable advantage to the community as a whole, and without any disadvantage to the glassware industry in Australia if it is being conducted on anything like a commercial basis. trouble that has occurred over this matter has arisen from the transfer of the articles formerly under item 252-whic h provided for a measurement duty to item 253, which provides for an ad valorem duty. The honourable member for Bendigo did not object to the transfer, though he was in the Chamber at the time. Sir member thought that the Committee would dustry. be reasonable, and not reduce the duty. That was my opinion also, or I should for myself, and while I desire that the have objected to the transfer. honourable member for Bendigo did not tection, a rate of 25 per cent, on foreign object. Now, he tells us that he himself importations and 26 per cent, on British would have objectecTto the transfer except importations will be sufficient. that he thought that the proposed duty of 35 per cent, was going to be carried. The shown that those rates will not be suffiTreasurer's real reason ""for the transfer of cient. the articles from one item to another was that he was absolutely ashamed of the item posed, what would be the position of the as it stood.

As the honourable member for Perth has shown, the charges connected with the importation of glassware are peculiarly heavy, giving the local manufacturers a protection of 165 per cent. I obtained it from official documents. protection to be only 80 per cent., or half of what it really is, the additional 25 per cent, which the Committee has allowed gives the local manufacturer a very fair protection. I intend to vote for a duty of 20 per cent, against British importations, because I do not think that the Treasurer should go back on his avowed policy of preference to Great Britain: So far as the honourable member for Bendigo is concerned, as he did not object to the removal of the measurement duties, he has only got himself to blame for the position in which he finds himself. The Committee has voted the 25 per cent, ad valorem duty recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. glass-making industry shall flourish here, As a matter of fact, the I think that, in addition to the natural proThat is a subject",42,Paiks

Let them deal with us, instead of our attempting to 'judge one another on the floor of this chamber. for Oxley has only asked for a fair thing for our State. and square treatment for Queensland as I and other Queensland members have given to the other States in regard to their manufacturing industries. I ask the Treasurer, in all seriousness, to see if something cannot be done to protect this i ndustry. Messrs. J. and W. Wilson claim to be the sole Australian manufacturers of accurate scientific glassware. factory and warehouse is situated in Wharf-street, Brisbane. them, but as the instruments which they advertise are made in Brisbane,, which after all is in the Commonwealth, those honourable members who are so strong on protection for industries in other States which have more numerous representation than Queensland has should accord this industry the same fair, square treatment as other States are getting. I ask the Treasurer to give this matter consideration, not on account of the honourable member for Oxley, who does not care a snap of tlie lingers personally, but in the i nterests of Queensland and of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Oxley has .been good enough to suggest that I have chattered a good deal on this Tarift. I have spoken very little upon it . My constituency is vitally interested in it in many ways, but in the interests of the despatch of business I have kept silent on many occasions in the face of great provocation. When I asked the honourable member for Oxley a civil question as to what articles included in item 255 were made by the Brisbane firm mentioned, he replied in a fashion' which I am sorry to say he has apparently acquired from those with whom he is sitting. member the number of the item. member a question with regard to the and 20 per cent.; and now it is proposed articles in the item, but he resented it , and was somewhat rude.

I have now been handed a copy of the catalogue issued by this firm. From a cursory glance, I should say that the manufactures The honourable member of this firm do not come under the item we are discussing at all. The honourable He wants the same fair member for Oxley has anticipated the discussion on a subsequent item. under this item, and partly under the next. catalogue any article that is included 'in item 255. There are only three articles included in that item, one of which I know Their from personal knowledge is not manufactured in the Commonwealth. When the I do not know honourable"" member asserted that all the articles in item 255 .were manufactured in the Commonwealth, he made an assertion that is not borne out by the catalogue itself. I hope the Treasurer will decide not to place a duty on apparatus used purely for scientific purposes. If the Minister refuses to impose a duty he will be doing only what has been the consistent policy of the protectionist party for many years past. Of course, we desire to see these articles manufactured here, if possuble; but if they are not manufactured here-and even if they are-w e decline to make them subject to taxation. I plead with the Treasurer to do justice to Queensland, irrespective of any feeling he may have in regard to the honourable member for Oxley. In a great fiscal battle of this kind, we ought not to feel sore if we do not get all the assistance we think we ought to have. I ought to feel a little sore. feel sore myself.

I do not think that any one wants the people of this country to pay 215 per cent, on bottles. I want as much as any one can do to secure effective protection, because I believe in the establishment of Australian industries throughout the length and breadth of Australia. But I do not wish to penalize the primary producer or consumer to such an extent as is now proposed.

He will surely recognise that I believe in the Australians making their own bottles, but a protection of 215 per cent, is altogether too high.

I do not expect to be able to make any impression upon the honourable member for Lang, who consistently adheres to his election pledges, for I know that if lie yielded to my appeal he would break faith with his constituents. I am directing my appeal more particularly to those protectionists who may be inclined to think that this industry is not likely to expand, and is so small as to be unworthy of consideration. It may be said that it cannot be compared with any of the great manufacturing industries of Australia; but I think we should all recognise that it is very necessary that we should have bottle works, and that those engaged in them should receive reasonable remuneration. Surely when I , as a Labour man, am prepared to concede that every investor has a right to secure a fair return on his capital, the representatives of the wealthier classes will be ready to admit the reasonableness of my claim that we should so protect the industry as to enable fair wages to be paid. I do not ask that the manufacturers should be assisted to amass large fortunes I merely say that they should be so protected that they will be able to compete to some extent against foreign bottlemakers. It is true that the manufacture of some classes of bottles is scarcely worth protecting; but we ought to be prepared to assist those engaged in making bottles that are in general use. The honourable member for Grampians, who has dealt with this question from the stand-point of the users of bottles, was quite justified in the position that he took up, and although he is an interested party, I am sure he would honestly state what he believed to be a fair duty. But we have no more right tb doubt the evidence of the manufacturer than we have to disbelieve his statements; and I appeal to the Committee to grant to the industry the fair protection of more than 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, duties. protection of n o per cent.? being told of the natural protection which some of our industries enjoy, but investigation shows that it does not count formuch. Unfortunately, many people in>the Australia are ever ready to belittle ourown productions. I do not believe that: this practice obtains so largely in Victoria' as in some of the other States; but it is a remarkable thing that even the meritsof our great artists are not recognised until they leave Australia. And so with many of our manufactures; if the people would! give them a fair deal high duties would' not be necessary. It is true, as has been said, that certain counties in England, as well as some continental countries, confine their attention to the production of a particular class of bottle, and since they thusspecialize they will always be able"" to land their manufactures here at a price considerably below the cost of the labour involved in producing them in Australia. I appeal to protectionists not to be led away by the statements of opponents of this proposal, but to grant substantial protection to this industry. industry needs encouragement, surely amoderate duty ought to be sufficient. Copies of invoices placed in my hands show that it enjoys a natural protection of 123 per cent, which ought to be sufficient to keep employed the 2,500 hands who according to the honourable member for r Melbourne Ports, are now engaged in it. I think that the duty proposed in the first Federal Tariff was only 20 per cent., and that in anticipation'of its imposition there was a bit of a flush in the bottle-making industry prior to Federation. I was asked at the time, in Adelaide, to become a shareholder in a company which it was said would carry on operations in New South. Wales, and make large profits under a duty of 20 per cent, or 25 per cent; Some capital was invested in the enterprise, and if it is thriving I fail to see why we should increase the duty. On the other hand, if it is not, it is about time-seein g that it has enjoved the protection of a duty of 20 per cent., in addition to the natural protection of 123 per cent -that westopped listening to the appeals of mendicant industries. I merely mention this matter because the honourable member for Bendigo assumed that the Committee knew, absolutely nothing about, this question, and that the possibilities of the industry werebeing ignored by those who appealed for*",59,Pairs

I should be very sorry to have these issues -decided by appeals to a matter of prejudice, but 1 wish to place before the Committee an illustration of the operation -of this duty which has been brought under my notice. I have here an invoice of 100 gross of bottles valued at £ 9 5 , on which the old duty would have amounted to £ 2 0 18s'.; whereas the new duty was ,£68 ios. Surely we are not going to stimulate an existing industry to that extent at the cost of the aerated water manufacturer who has to import his bottles. I have many other instances of the unequal operation of these duties. It has been pointed out to me that while the duty amounts to 5d. per case in respect of magnums of champagne, it amounts to .3s. 4d. per case of half-pint bottles of champagne used chiefly by invalids. It has also been pointed out to me that it amounts to 5s. per case of imported bottled spirits. ' I could, if I wished, give other instances from a synopsis of invoices, and I should like to remind the Victorian protectionists to whom the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has appealed, that even the Victorian Commission in 1894 condemned a tax upon bottles. diluvian days. member ,who wishes to go back to the antediluvian days, when he desires that we -should revert to the 40 per cent, duties im5 drams capacity the imports from Japan posed before 1894. mission recommended a duty of is. per cubic foot. bottles, which was a duty at per cubic foot,, the Commission saidThis duty, of course, is exactly equal to an addition to a duty on the goods contained in the bottles. _ It is paid by the consumer of. the goods, and is really a second duty on the contents. I do not need to read the whole of the report, but they wound up by sayingWe are not in a position to make a recommendation in regard to all bottles, but we regard the duties on bottles containing liquids as a troublesome tax which falls on the various contents in an irregular manner, and we recommend their total abolition. That ought to be good enough, although it is described as antediluvian by some Victorian extreme protectionists. To show how the present duty operates, I can give instances from specific imports. I have had my attention called to this fact, that while the f.o.b. cost of bottles for wine packed in mats and straw envelopes amounts to ios., when they are cleared here after payment of the duty and charges, the total has gone up to £ 1 5s., a pretty stiff protection, representing from 125 to 130 per cent. Take other instances. Black wines, pints, packed in mats and straw envelopes f.o.b., cost per gross, 8s. 3d. j cost when cleared, 25s. In the case of Apollinaris, half-pints, f.o.b., costs 7s.; the cost after clearance is 18s. 3d. I do not wish to labour this matter; but these are facts which do not require an appeal tq prejudice in support of the proposal made for a reduction of the duty. that honourable members, in trying to induce the Committee to carry a particular duty, make a practice of over-stating their case in regard to importations. The honourable member for Bendigo drew a graphic picture from the evidence submitted to the Tariff Commission of the importation of Japanese bottles, and the ridiculous rates of wages paid to bottle-makers in Japan. The inference sought to be drawn was that, as a result of the importation of these Japanese bottles, the local industry was being ruined. It is just as well to get down to the actual facts, and in the statistics prepared by the Government Statistician, T find that of small bottles of not more, than for last year represented the enormous",60,Pairs

Japan? question of wages, and if that question is raised, surely a duty of from 100 to 120 per cent., which is what my proposal would amount to, should be sufficient for the local industry? Under the old Tariff, bottles up to 5 drams capacity were free. The duty on wine and beer bottles was only 10 per cent., and on all other bottles, 20 per cent. I have proposed duties of 30 and 25 per cent., and when it is remembered that that would mean an increase to the full extent of the duty in the case of bottles up to 5 drams capacity, an increase of 20 and 15 per cent, on wine and beer bottles, and an increase of 10 and 5 per cent, on all other bottles, I feel justified in considering that I am making an extravagantly liberal proposal. But, with a view to avoiding the monstrous proposition of fixed duties on these articles, I am prepared to adhere to it. I understand that the Government have agreed to adopt measurement duties. With the object of moving subsequently that the duty on imports from Great Britain should be 25 per cent., I move That after the figure ""2s.,"" paragraph A, the words "" and on and after 4th December, 1907, ad val. (General Tariff), 30 per cent.,"" be inserted. I think there is something in the contention that there should be some small duty on bottles imported containing liquids; but that is a question, which might be dealt with when we are discussing the duty to be imposed on the contents. The total amount paid in duty on bottles last year was £1,086, and the total importations, 329,000 dozen. I trust the Committee will agree to duties of 30 and 25 per cent, on this line, plus the natural protection of from 80 to 120 pet cent., which can be proved beyond doubt from actual invoices. tion to the duty. the duty up to 150 per cent, on some of these lines. Honourable members talk of starving this industry with the fact staring them in the face that the protection on some lines amounts to 150 per cent. I shall occupy no more of the time of the I do not think that Committee in dealing with the matter. I trust' that the common sense of honourable members will prevent them from imposing any higher duties than those I have mentioned. notice from the reports of the Tariff Commission that this plea that Japan is a serious competitor in this industry was raised by very many of the witnesses. The figures quoted by the honourable member for Grey are sufficient to show that the plea was not raised bona -fide. There are one or two columns from which the honourable member did not quote, and in order to put the facts completely before honourable members, I should like to refer to them. The figures will be found in, the Trade and Customs returns for 1906, at pages 54 and 55. These returns show that of wine and beer bottles, out of a total importation amounting in .value to £10,321, all we got from Japan was £ 1 4 worth. As the honourable member for Grey has already shown, of small bottles of not more than 5 drams capacity, £3,812 worth were imported altogether, and of that amount only £ 2 8 worth came from Japan; whilst of bottles of from 5 to 9 drams capacity, in connection with which the figures are given in dozens, out of 'a total importation of 352,000, only 34 dozen came from Japan. In the circumstances, and Mr Bishop, who gave this evidence about the warehouses being filled with Japanese bottles,, must have been misinformed, or they wilfully misled the Comabout the effect of the duty upon the ""Victorian industry from the time Federation was established up to 1906. His evidence on the subject will be found in answer to questions 76998-9.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [8.49] I wish to say something in reply to the return read by the honourable member for Grey about importations from Japan. According to the figures read by him, the importations for 1906 were very small. I have not had the returns for that year brought under my notice, but Mr Cornelius Bishop laid before the Tariff Commission figures showing the importations from Japan in the years 1903 and 1904. They are given on page 252 of the Minutes of Evidence, vol. 5, question 88279, as follows88279. * 9°3> 4,568 dozen empty wine and n 1 cover the importation to which you refer? -A t page 49 of the records which you have Mr P.OYNTON I suppose that is the Sir JOHN QUICK In that evidence The",62,Pairs

576,Mr Watso N (South Sydney) [8.52].,"closely related, because the effectiveness of the duty on empty bottles would depend very largely on what is charged on full bottles. The schedule which I suggest with regard to full bottles is as follows :-Bottles up to 5 drams capacity, whether empty or full, free. contain ? Bottles of over 5 drams, and not exceeding 10 ozs., fluid capacity, per dozen (general Tariff), i | d . ; (United Kingdom), id. the old Tariff. viously, if full.

That would reduce the number of items very materially. empty bottles 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, respectively, and we will agree. rather low as against the foreigner. listening to both sides, and the reports that have been quoted, I have concluded that this industry is like many others-if the makers have good management they dd not ask for a large increase of duty. When I find an industry, according to its own reports, doing well in some parts of Australia, and badly in others, with the same standard of duty, I am forced to the conclusion''that the fault lies in the latter case in the absence of .good administration. In a large measure the argument urged to-night is an admission that those who have charge of this industry have in many cases failed in their administrative power. A sum of £100,000 is invested in the bottle-making industry of Australia, of which ,£60,000 is invested in Victoria. The Melbourne bottle industry has a branch in New South Wales. That shows that they are ener;getic and look after their business well. If we could get behind all the evidence -quoted, and .into which the Tariff Commission did not inquire, it'Would be found, not -only iri the bottle industry, but in many -other industries, that want of.proper business management had caused the failure. We are asked to vote duties to make up for mistakes of management. I refuse to do so. The reason the industries do welf in the Old Country is that they have the best business ability at the head of affairs, and run them well. . I really think that the weak spot in many of our industries is that they do not pay enough money, and so do not secure the best ability at the top. I am glad that the specific duty has been knocked on the head. Theduty according to measurement was tried in Victoria a few years ago, and proved a failure. The first Barton Administration introduced it and then dropped it. TheTreasurer apparently is going to do the same. I am prepared to vote for duties of 30 and 25 per cent., unless the Treasurer can show that 5 per cent, is not enough difference between the German or Japanmade bottles, as against the British articleI f there is one industry that wants protection it is the bottle industry. Honourable members say that it is established. It is established in different States, but an industry that has to close down a good part of its business for half the year cannot be said to be doing well. We should encourage it so that it may have work enough to keep it going the whole year round. The honourable member for Nepean mentioned the wages that werebeing paid, but it does not matter what wages are paid if men are only drawingthem for half the year, because they have^ to keep their wives and families for the whole year. It has been proved that it was not possible under the old duties for a number of the bottle factories to keep going except for a portion of the year. Only the other day I met a young man who originally came from the Old Country, and who was engaged in the bottle industry.. As soon as the first Tariff was adopted he found himself out of employment, and had to work at a different trade, but since the new duties in this Tariff were imposed he and a good many others have found employment. That shows that these new duties have already been effective. I am going to vote for the highest duty that I can get Every bottle manufacturer in Australia tells us that the business has not beer a success of late years under the old Tariff' in competition with Germany and Japan.

I would also point out that the manufacture of glue was established, both in New South Wales and South Australia, without any protective duty whatever. Before Federation was accomplished, the price of this article in Victoria ranged from £ 4 0 to £ 5 0 per ton, whilst its price in New South Wales was only £ 3 4 per ton. Mr John Robert Firth, a cardboard box manufacturer, of Sydney, in giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, read the following statementGlue is manufactured in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, from raw materials obtainable entirely in the Commonwealth. Glue making is generally only adopted in larger works, tanneries, & c , and, although such work employed large numbers of hands, vet in glue making alone there cannot be from more than fifteen to twenty hands employed throughout the Commonwealth. Glue making was firmly established in South Australia and New South Wales before the imposition of any Tariff. Cost of importing is high, owing to bulk, and the ""natural protection,"" therefore, amounts to about 20 per cent. Duty handicaps the following trades :-Cardboard box makers, bookbinders, and furniture manufacturers, glue being one of their raw materials. The Barton Government imposed a duty of 2d. per lb., equal to 60 per cent., whereupon prices rose enormously; but when the House of Representatives reduced the duty to 20 per cent., the price of Colonial glue fell from ^,'45 to £34 , and of imported glue to ^58 to £ 3 8 per ton. When the duty of 2d. per lb. was imposed a combine was formed, and the price fixed at £45, about j£-3 per ton advance on previous Sydney price. The House of Representatives reduced the duty from the 20th February, 1901. Next day the combine collapsed, and the prict fell as above-mentioned. might be revived. Glue should, therefore, be placed on the. free list. I should be glad indeed to move that it be it will confer a fair measure of protection, placed upon the free list, but I know that upon that article. in a Committee composed as this is of a strong protectionist majority, I would opposed to the imposition of fixed duties, have no chance of carrying such a proposal. upon items of this description because they With regard to the Glue Combine, it is will mean the collection of a higher rateonly fair to add that another witness, Mr upon the cheap article and of a lower rate Markwald, denied its existence.

This line is only used for manufacturing purposes, and it should! be free. It will thus be seen that although glueforms but a small portion of the manufactures connected with our tanneries, it is a minor article which is used in very many established industries, and consequently any increase in its price must handicap those industries. I therefore suggest that the duty should be reduced to 25 per cent, under the General Tariff and 20 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom.

It is equal to a duty of between 40 and 50 per cent, ad valorem. What were the imports under the old duty of 20 per cent., which in my opinion was too high ? I think that in proposing Kingdom£ 1 3 , 4 0 0 worth, and from other countries ,£15.400 worth. figures represent importations of gelatine principally.

We can export glue, and a h i g h ' duty on an article which is I worth only £ 3 8 per ton is altogether out of the question. The Minister is seeking to impose the same duty on. an article worth from £ 1 1 2 to £ 1 4 0 a ton. The Minister has got an increased duty on gelatine, and I urge him to impose the old duty on glue, Some or, if he likes, to fix the rate in the general Tariff at 25 per cent.

That also was the opinion of the Customs expert.. at the same price? ferent-values. I think that a mistake has been made in resorting to a fixed duty of 2d. per lb. Mr Long told us that a fixed duty of 2d. per lb. would be equivalent to 1:00' per cent, on glue sold in Italy at £ 1 9 per ton. I think that an ad valorem duty of 35 and 30 per cent, on glue and gelatine would be sufficient. If the Committee decides upon a duty of 2d. per lb., an alteration should be made in the duty on printers' roller composition, because gelatine is the raw material from which that composition is made. The old duty on printers' roller composition was 20 per cent. Even an expert cannot determine the quality of roller composition without an actual trial. It is impossible to look at that material and say forthwith whether it is of good or inferior quality. It has to be used, perhaps, for a period extending over some weeks to test its value. If the Minister agrees to accept a fixed duty at .so much per lb., I will ask him to make the duty on roller composition, in accord -with it, 4d. per pound. 'Tlie honourable member for Bendigo is quite right in the description which he gives of the products under discussion. Glue and gelatine are derived from the same substances, and they represent simply different istages of one manufacture. But I feel in' a difficulty about this matter, because there is one sort of gelatine that is imported and used very largely, and which cannot, be made in this country. I have reason to believe that it will be used more largely in the future than it is now. I allude"" to that which is imported for photographic purposes, to form the emulsion placed upon photographic plates and films. That material is made by only one manufacturer in Great Britain, and his product is not the best. The best quality is made on the Continent of Europe, and it is only made there in the depth of winter. In fact, the temperature has to be below freezing point before the manufacture can be carried on. Would the Minister prefer that this gelatine should be placed on the exemption list or be dealt with now? guished ? ferentiate between the higher class of gelatine and medium classes. Indeed, the medium class of gelatine is used for domestic purposes, whilst the higher class is only used in the circumstances which I have described. If the Minister would prefer that the matter should be dealt with when we are considering the exemptions, I will bring it up later on. unfortunate that the Minister will not accept a fair and reasonable compromise when it is suggested to him. The proposal of the honourable member, for Bendigo is far preferable to that of the Minister, and I should be prepared to support it as against 'the Treasurer's proposal. There ought to be a differentiation, because, notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, glue and gelatine are different compounds altogether, although they are both made from the same basic materials. The labour cost in a ton of gelatine of £ 8 0 value would be from £^15 to £ 1 8 , according to the evidence of Mr Meister, question 94592. The gelatine imported in 1903 was of an invoice value of £ * S per ton. X In 1.904 the value was £ 1 0 8 per ton-se e Mr Meister's evidence, question 94610. There is consequently an immense difference between the value of this article and that of common glue. Gelatine can be manufactured locally for from £ 7 5 to £ 9 0 per ton; and from £ 1 2 5 to £130 for thick and thin sheets respectively-se e question 94613. Taking these values, it appears that the proposed duty of 40 per cent, is equal to from £ 4 3 4s. to . £ 5 2 per ton, and that no duty is required to enable this article to be manufactured at much lower ra.tes in Australia than in Europe. The former duty of 2d. per lb., or £ 1 8 13s. 4d. per ton, was equal to only 14 to 17 per cent. I shall not propose an amendment, but will support the duties suggested by the honourable member for Bendigo, namely, 30 and 25 per cent. I will ask the Treasurer to agree to duties of 30 and 25 per cent., which will meet all the requirements.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [10.48] -I have taken great interest in this question for a very long time. ' I asked Mr Summers, the well-known sculptor, to investigate the matter, and I have a report from him showing that there are quarries in the neighbourhood of Bathurst, Molong, and Orange where white marble is to be obtained. feet, however, when the ground was opened, the marble was not pure white, being stained with iron or some other colouring matter; but as the work has proceeded it has been found that magnificent marble is obtainable. As a matter of fact, I have some photographs and samples of the marble in my office at the present moment, and there are deposits of white as well as of coloured marble awaiting development here. think that marble in the rough ought to be free. To me it appears a quixotic idea to impose a duty on rough marble. to be obtained ini Australia. General not know that there is twenty times the work provided on ithe marble after it is quarried than is provided in the quarrying of it? In big centres like Melbourne and Sydney it is easy to obtain' marble from the quarries, but in the more distant parts of the Commonwealth the cost of conveyance would be greater than that of the marble itself. duty of ro per cent, can have any protective incidence, and it should be our desire to afford our sculptors an opportunity to obtain their raw material at as reasonable a rate as possible. This the honourable member for Wide Bay has said is perfectly true, and this marble ought to be on the free list. There is a local white marble, whicli is useful for a number of purposes; but local sculptors of undoubted standing themselves say that it is altogether useless for the finer work of statuary. The local marble is not nearly so white as the imported marble, and, not being of so fine a grain, has a dark, rough appearance when finished. It is, moreover, full of small Hint-Like particles, which interfere considerably with its working. It is, however, quite possible that at a lower depth a better marble may be found. sculptors, and I think the honourable member must have seen the wrong people. marble ought to be the best judges of whether it is good, bad, or indifferent; arid my information is that the local stone is not to be compared with the imported white marble at present.

I have done my best on behalf of the Australian workmen who are engaged in this industry. I feel convinced that it would be in its best interests if the proposals I read were adopted.

He writes as followsW ill you please, when dealing with the duties protection, but if we have suitable marble on stone, use your influence and cast your vote in the interest of working masons by voting for a low duty on rough slabs and blocks of marble, so as to enable us to compete with the underpaid Italian workmen? Rough blocks of marble we would like to see on the free list, also slabs and scantlings. I may tell you that slabs and scantlings sawn on edges are of no advantage to us, as the sawn edges are liable to get chipped and broken, and we have to work -the edges again.

As regards wrought arid wrought ornamental, D and E, the duty of 30 and 35 per cent, does not matter so much. It is the raw material that we want to get in free. The duty on the cases in which marble and granite headstones and monuments are packed is a hard tax, as the cases are of no use to us, and are generally, left in the cemetery after the headstone is unpacked. In conclusion, I may state that there is no white marble in the Commonwealth suitable for monumental work, or, at any rate, there is none on the market. There is a dovecoloured marble in New South Wales;.but it is the white marble that we want, and until there is a local white marble on the market we would like to get our raw material as cheap as possible, so as to compete with the cheap That confirms the representations of the honourable member for Yarra.

He, of course, is only interested in our marbles as a sculptor. He is not concerned in any quarries. Any duty which would render it more difficult for him to obtain his raw material would certainly be against his own interests, and therefore I placed great reliance on the statement which he made to myself and others.

As to the statement that there is no white marble in Australia, I have to say that white marble has been obtained in New South Wales. The Treasurer has taken an interest in the industry in his own State for many years past, and has arranged for several exhibitions of the marbles obtained there. On one occasion, Dr. Macarthy, of Sydney, fooled the public with what be called a marble man.

I may remark that the statue of Queen Victoria standing in Queen's Hall is generally supposed to be carved from one piece of marble. But when I was in EuropeI was told that the headpiece was simply let in, and that the statue was a fraud to that extent. When it was being shifted from one end of Queen's Hall to the other, I determined to get up and have a look at it, in order to verify that statement. An attempt was made to prevent me, but I was determined, and I found that the statement was true. With regard to what the honourable member for Laanecoorie has said. I think he is aware that when I was a member of the State Parliament I obtained justice for Mr Summers, who had been wronged for fourteen years in consequence of infamous treatment by the State Government. He was robbed' for some years of the money which he should have received for the four statues which stand in front of the Exhibition Building, and has not been paid even interest on it. Indeed, he was barely saved from the claw of the great Lansell, of Bendigo. this country as every Australian does, I should be glad to learn of the discovery of a real white marble here. Attempts to find such marble have been made in every country in the world. Mr Summers making a statue of Australian marble; at any rate, he has not honoured me with an invitation to see it. A much greater sculptor in our communitythe man who for the first time in the history world there. The face is as high as the of the English Academy won the prize for both painting and sculpture, and who modelled the monument above the Age newspaper-does not use Australian marble. How many statues are made in Australia? God knows that the sculptors have a hard time here. I have stood as a model to sculptors in London who I knew had scarcely bread to eat. Bates, whose head I lent to the National Gallery, and who has left perhaps the greatest name in England of late years, although he died prematurely, is one of. these. Australia, is not kind to its artists. Anvone Who knows anything about them knows how hard it is for them to make ends meet. If white marble is wanted for statues, the only place where it can be got is Carrara, in Italy. The nearest approach to such marble that I have seen in Australia Mr Moloney. has been cream coloured. I ask the Committee to allow real white marble to be imported free of duty. By all means, let us tax other marble. -The honourable member for Melbourne says that he has stood as a model for the sculptors in the Old Country; but I hope that if ever an appreciative country does me the honour to raise a statue to my memory it will be made of Australian marble. We have in South Australia and in Gippsland white marble which is quite as good as is necessary. In South Australia there is a statue of my national poet, Burns, executed in Australian white marble ; and another of one of the greatest men who ever set foot on this country, John McDouall Stuart, also made of Australian marble. If statues like that can be made of Australian marble, the local stone should be good enough for any one who wishes 10 have a monument erected to his memory. It is white enough for the whitest man who ever lived on Australian soil. posedThat the amendment be amended by inserting the word "" W h it e "" before the word ""Marble.""Angaston marble is fit for all the purposes for which marble is required here, and I am very surprised to hear Victorian protectionists advocating the importation of I liave not heard of tombstones free The Angaston marble is very valuable, and the South Australian Government is proposing to build a railway to the locality where it' is found There are some of the .finest marble quarries in the gallery, and slabs of very fine stone, 18 to 20 feet long, can be cut The deposit of marble starts at Second Valley, runs through Macclesfield and Angaston, and crosses the Broken Hill railway line at Paratoo.

In imposing this duty the Treasurer is placing a tax on the raw material of another manufacture with which we shall have to deal under another item. It is quite possible to make carbonic acid gas out of chips of marble, and under this Tariff it is proposed to levy a duty of 2d. per lb. on carbonic acid gas. It is absolutelyridiculousthat a duty should be proposed on marble dust and chips, which are the raw material for the manufacture of another commodity. Probablv the honourable member for Corangamite can enlighten the Committee about this duty more than either the Treasurer or the honourable member for Bendigo has done. a m I think that the Committee will act wisely if they keep marble dust and chips off the free list. The monumental mason has to import the marble at a high price, and he ought to be given a chance to make all the profit he can out of the chips which he breaks off. There is a considerable use for the chips. For instance, they are used' in making pavements, and also in covering graves. In my opinion the Treasurer has done right in imposing a duty, because it will give a chance to the local marble workers to make a little profit. -The extreme levity which has been introduced by certain lionorable members is not creditable to them. This is a grave question, and I am surprised that a doctor, wbo has so much to do with committing persons to their last resting places should find fault us for an hour and a half. with the duty. Had he any sympathy with the relatives of those persons be would not hesitate to protect the material which covers their last home. . If the honourable member for Parramatta had any sympathy with bereaved persons he would not attempt to dispute the item. These chips are practically part and parcel of an article on which a duty has been imposed to-night. The dust is used for the purpose of putting a polish on tombstones. There is a lack of sympathy shown by honourable members on the Opposition side on this very grave question. ought to have a quorum to listen to these that. I said that the honourable member remarks.

We have now had two late sittings in succession; and I want to say plainly to the Treasurer that if he does not control tbe business within more reasonable hours we shall either have to have longer sittings when we are about it, or do more business before 11 o'clock at night.

I , for one, shall decline to sit these long hours,' and if he insists upon such sittings, the Minister must take the responsibility of what occurs. That is all that I have to say. I decline to be kept here for fourteen hours at a stretch when we could get through the business in much less time and with great advantage to all concerned. To-day, the Minister kept us for four hours ' which might have been saved to the conduct of public business. Time and again he has sat in his chair for a couple of hours at a stretch when there has only been a question of a paltry 5 per cent, dividing honourable members. It is unfair to keep the House sitting for fourteen or fifteen hours at a stretch in this way,, and I tell the Treasurer again that I do not intend to put up with it.
