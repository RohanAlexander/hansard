The bill we are looking at today is the unaccustomed statesmanship, an opportunity same as the bill which was introduced in this for the Prime Minister to stand up now and place last year.

They started to lose must be the most greedy campaign ever run business and they found out that the reason by the wharfies themselves. Yet the shadow they had been losing business was that the minister fails to condemn it. New Zealanders were able to supply the product to these island nations at a lower price. The reason for that was that stevedoring Let us look at Australia's crane rate. The costs in New Zealand were based on the fact fi ve port average figure for Australia is 18 that cement was loaded at 400 pallets per shift lifts an hour. In Sydney, where the industrial but in Sydney they were loaded at the rate of action is, they are below the national average. 230 pallets per shift. It is a very simple, If we compare Australia with anywhere in the practical example, the end result of which was world, we are well and truly below a reasonthat we were not competitive. So the Australable average international figure. New Zeaian business lost everything to the New land, for example, runs at something like 25 Zealand business and we lost the jobs and the lifts an hour; in Australia it is 18. Places like export income that we otherwise would have Mozambique-would you believe?-or had.

The level of industrial disputes on quote early in this dispute from a bloke who the Australian waterfront is, according to runs the stock feed business in the Riverinaofficial figures, approximately 10 times the Jack Schmidt. His business supplies stock feed national average. Someone said to me at the to the dairy industry in Japan.

This is the way in which they run doring costs. What that means in practice is the waterfront, and not just for terms and that all those businesses-farming businesses, conditions. These guys take industrial action agricultural businesses and small businesses at the drop of a hat.

Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1049 Wednesday, 11 March 1998 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 November 1997, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time. for Customs and Consumer Affairs( Mr Truss) for the way in which he has provided information to the opposition in respect of the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997. Even though it is non-controversial-and, despite the title, at first blush is nothing that tests one's intellect-it is always good to know that the government is prepared to provide the opposition with the opportunity to get a full briefing on the issues surrounding it. Of course, that also goes to the fact that there is an amendment to be moved by the government today that picks up one of the concerns that I did have, which I will remark on in a moment. The fact that the government's people were providing information to us fairly late last night is something which we certainly appreciate on our side of the House. The Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997 has three major issues within it. The first, of course, is to implement the government's decision to allow an extension of the patent term to a total of 25 years for patents relating to pharmaceutical substances. The second is to provide for the introduction of a new regime for regulation of the patent attorney profession and to deregulate professional practice in trademarks and designs. The third is to make some minor changes to the patent regime of a technical nature, making it easier for applicants to transact business before the office. I might say that we have absolutely no objections to any of these-nor, indeed, to the issue that has subsequently been raised by the government as an amendment to their own legislation, in respect of the regulations specifying qualifications necessary for the registration of patent attorneys. These will include provisions to ensure existing practitioners, both patent attorneys and lawyers, will have the right to seek registration as trademark attorneys. The wording, of course, was a little inexact and, as a consequence, those amendments have been moved. On that issue, the concern I did have was that potentially, where an industry had been regulated somewhat and qualifications were expected for people to actually have a role as a patent attorney, that might have been in some way watered down. I think that has now been overcome here. The bill and the changes that have been moved by the government make it clear that these were issues that were of concern to the government, as well. We do not want to see watered down in any way in that profession-where a fair degree of technical expertise is required in determining whether a patent should be awarded to a product-the technical expertise that gives people the ability to dictate whether a patent should be awarded. I think the government is aware that that is .the case. I know from time to time that people ask, 'When we are talking about pharmaceutical products in particular, what is the point of actually having the patents there-and the rights of people in terms of registration of those trademarks and so on-when government provides R&D concessions and government gives support, and the industry is large enough and",137,Questions Without Notice 1m Pty Ltd Has Been In Operation For A Additional Responses Considerable Period Of Time Pre Dating Sena
399,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr G.b. Nehl) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,,139,Representatnes Main Committee
400,Mr Martin (Cunningham) (10.00 A.m.),"At the outset, I again commend the Minister1050 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 profitable enough to be looking after its own ways?' I think that is not really appropriate in this circumstance and I am pleased that the government, as I said, has picked up the recommendations, largely in response to the Industry Commission report No. 51, on the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, this does reflect much of the work that Labor was doing in its later years in government. I also want to say this, though. Whilst we are talking about pharmaceuticals and the way in which generic products subsequently are developed by pharmaceuticals producers, and whilst we are talking about the fact that on many occasions you do have a brand name substance that, in a generic form, is often manufactured by the same company or a similar company and then put on the market at a marginally cheaper price, there is still some confusion in the community about how this comes about. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, that you probably would have recently received, as I have, quite a number of representations by the elderly in our respective communities that they were concerned that a number of products that were just to give them quality of life increased in price as a result of the government's decision on pharmaceutical benefits. I am talking about the sorts of pharmaceutical drugs that are required for reflux, ulcers, keeping blood pressure under control and stemming perhaps the potential for heart attacks, and so on. All of these products have increased from a range of a dollar up to $4.10. I think it is rather mean spirited of the minister to simply dismiss this out of hand and say, 'Well, in some cases, this only represents an increase of the price of a packet of cigarettes.' That actually dismisses out of hand concerns that many of the elderly, and particularly those on fixed incomes, for example, pensioners, have about their quality of life. These drugs that we are talking about are not really there because people want to take them; they are there because they have to take them. They are there because people do have problems; they want to control their blood pressure. They are there because people want to take some of the stress out of their life. They are there because of lifestyle issues. As I have said, and as I have remarked to pensioner organisations in my own constituency, it is rather sad when governments-always with one eye fixed on the bottom line in a budget sense-tum to perhaps the least defensible to try and work out ways in which they can claw back some of those funds. Whilst this Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997 in itself is not controversial, and the opposition will not be delaying its passage in any substantial way, it is important to note, when we start to talk about the cash flows necessary to finance development of new drugs and when we start to talk about new patents that are generated in the industry for new drugs, that the benefits that subsequently flow from that are in fact passed on to people in the broader community. I have remarked also to many of my constituents, when this issue has been raised, that what they should be doing is seeking the advice of their own medical practitioners as to which may be the best drugs to treat the conditions that they have. I simply repeat that again today. Many constituents will say to you, 'Look, I am on Zantac because I need it for quality of life.' Others will say, 'Well, there's another product that's there that probably is just as good,' and they save SOc. But, if they do not go to a doctor and they do not get a referral, or at least some recommendations about which of those generic products are better for them, they would never· know that they in fact can save some money in respect of that. I just simply say to those people again: be careful and always check with medical practitioners about those. Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1051 The whole issue about R&D funding, and about whether or not it is important for the patenting arrangement to be in place for a longer period of time, does raise, I guess, some issues about -he way in which newly developed products and generic products can come onto the market. With patents being in place for an extended period, as we are talking about here, it means that those pharmaceutical companies-I confess that they invest multimillions of dollars in developing those particular products-will have an additional lifeline extended to them, where they will be protected to some extent from some competition. Notwithstanding that, of course, the fact that generic products are now coming onto the market and that they also must go through fairly rigorous testing by pharmaceutical companies-and, indeed, the national health organisations to give them the tick of approval-is an important ekment of this as well. I am not going to delay the consideration of this legislation through the Main Committee this morning. It is, as I say, legislation which is welcome. The opposition has no difficulties with it at all. Once again, I would like to thank the officers from the minister's personal staff and those from the department, or the Australian Customs Service, who have provided background information to me and my staff to provide us with a full and frank understanding of the issues before us. Thank you. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (10.10 a.m.)-I was at an installation of our new bishop at St Thomas Church in Mulgoa. David Lloyd is the new reverend for all the parishioners out that way. At his installation we had Bishop King from Parramatta come and visit us. A comment he made struck me as very relevant to what is happening here in relation to the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997 today. He said that 60 per cent of children in year 3 today will have careers in areas that their parents have not even thought of. Miss JACKIE KELLY-It is a pretty phenomenal thought. I think a lot of people do worry about the loss of employment in areas like agriculture and manufacturing, but there are always new careers being created. We are creating one today in the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997, which amends the Copyright Act 1968, the Designs Act 1906, the Patents Act 1990 and the Trade Marks Act 1995. It actually creates a new employment option for people who wish to go on to further studies as a trademark attorney. We are taking away a number of smaller or other responsibilities within the patent attorney field and giving them to a new group of people who will be registered as trademark attorneys. This collection of bills basically establishes the regulation of two professions. The first profession is that of patent attorney and the second is that of trademark attorneys. Both of those have quite distinct roles in this intellectual property area. For quite some time, patent attorneys have had a monopoly in this area. It has cost something like $7,000 just to look into getting a patent registered, which has often negated a lot of people taking any action that could possibly have benefited them in the end. I do remember distinctly one case from my career in the RAAF. A lot of our RAAF engineers at Richmond had spent time and significant effort and cost developing a product which would make low altitude parachute extractions from our C130 Hercules far easier, safer and accurate. They contracted out to a commercial contractor to have this widget built.",139,Representatnes Main Committee
401,Mr Slipper,That is amazing.,141,Representatives Main Committee
402,Mr Slipper,"A what?1052 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 Miss JACKIE KELLY-It was some sort of contraption. I am not a patent attorney, but it was quite a novel thing. The next time that those engineers saw that new design or invention was in the commercial magazines with this company now producing them for worldwide distribution to Hercules for LApEs. The Commonwealth on that occasion missed out quite substantially because there were no resources for me at that stage to spend $7,000 registering these poor engineers' designs. I suppose they really could not have gone on into commercial production with it, but they were very upset that their intellectual property had been used in that way with no recompense for the time, effort and cost that government had gone to. That is something that this government is moving towards in this fast growing area. If you look at a number of our outsourcing contracts at the moment, government is a huge repository of intellectual property, and that is a resourceMiss JACKIE KELLY-Very much so, Peter. There are you and I. There is the scope for creating wealth in this country from the intellectual property held by government, and sought by government to be expanded upon, as we become more efficient in the information industries. There is the type of software programming that we are going to and the type of designs that we seek. An example would be the Australian Taxation Office. Government has spent an enormous amount of money in developing the electronic lodgement forms where an average or a not so the ability to set up a small business on electronic lodgments because this service is provided by government and a considerable amount of small businesses have gone ahead in leaps and bounds because of government's funding of that technology or pursuit of that type of source. We have seen something similar recently with the new jobsearch network, where a computer network has been established right across Australia where all jobs can be logged. I am quite confident that, as that sort of technology takes off, there will be all sorts of industries and enterprises created on that network. It is a very valuable source of wealth creation for this nation, something this government is aware of. It looks towards the future when it considers any of its outsourcing or any of its new internal developments. I think it is important for us to recognise intellectual property and not to make the high jump bar so high that your average designer or your small to medium enterprise cannot really access this sort of economic protection. The main reason for having patents, copyright or this sort of protection today is that we are seeking protection of economic investment and creative effort. It does take an enormous amount of money today to develop some of these systems. In pharmaceuticals, for instance, the ethics standards that we have to observe today in order to test substances are extraordinarily high. So they should be, but there is an associated cost with that. In order to get any of your experiments to pass ethics boards, there is a tremendous cost that was not there in the past. Today we are not just doing basic discoveries; we are extending that beyond the microscope and beyond imaging technology and really getting right down to some very high-tech research which comes at enormous cost for the machines involved and the type of electron microscopy that is used. The cost of research today has gone exponentially from simply a few ground pieces of glass looking through a microscope. It has become an enormous investment in order to pursue or further the research that is available and, at some stage, you wish to recoup that investment over time.",141,Representatives Main Committee
403,Mr Slipper,There is a lot of intellect in this government.,142,Representatives Main Committee
404,Average Or A Brilliant Accountant,"as in the case of the member for Fisher( Mr Slipper)-hasWednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1053 This bill also takes it that further step in allowing those who invest in the research on pharmaceutical substances and in the creation of new pharmaceutical substances to extend their patents for an extra five years. This should result in some great economic benefits and create a forum within Australia which attracts investment in innovators in this area to Australia. That is the. type of protection that corporations are looking for before they invest heavily in any region. This bill certainly gives them that protection. It is not without cost. It certainly will cost the government by the year 2001 and 2003. There are some costs to government in that a number of products which would be available on the generic list at that time will no longer be available. But we have felt that it is a worthwhile cost for government to bear in order to promote this type of technology in the future because that is where the jobs of those people in year 3 today are coming from. Those jobs for our children are coming in different and varied areas that we probably have not even understood yet. Trademark attorneys will now be able to go to university. The course will be a lot shorter than perhaps it was when the member for Fisher and I went through law at university. To become a trademark attorney or a patent attorney requires an enormous effort in research and study, and an investment in time. A lot of the simpler tasks with regard to design and trademarks can now be done by a trademark attorney. In fact, it can be done by employees, in some circumstances. So, again, it is getting the costs of this type of economic protection right down. It is a very complex area for patents and, certainly, the standards required with patents are maintained so that you will have sufficient protection in that very fuzzy area of preparing patent submissions and patent amendments. Overall, it is a non-contentious bill. It recognises the very fast evolving way of the world today with respect to intellectual property and the continued growth in this area as a wealth generator for the country. I commend the bill to the House. agreement for the major provisions of the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997. Indeed, the Member for Cunningham ( Mr Martin), who preceded me in the debate on this side, and the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) have touched on many of those. The bill, of course, makes a number of relatively minor changes to legislation such as the Copyright Act, the Patents Act, the Trade Marks Act and the Designs Act, which are principally concerned with creation of the profession of trademark attorneys and the regulation of patent attorneys. While those changes are important to the people involved, they probably do not have much application beyond those immediate professional interests. There are two other principal areas which I would like to speak more broadly about. The first relates to the springboarding activity where companies-for example, Fauldings, which is in my electorate in South Australia-are able to take a drug or compound which was previously subject to a patent and, when that patent expires, produce a generic version of that drug, often at a substantially cheaper price than was available during the protected period for t-e drug. Of course, companies can undertake that work once the patent has expired but, if they have to wait that long, it is much more difficult for them to get the product to market in a timely way. Therefore, it is indeed appropriate that we should allow them to begin preparations, if you like, for that eventual marketing of the drug prior to the actual expiry of the patent-",142,Representatives Main Committee
405,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (10.21 P.m.),"I think there is broad bipartisan1054 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 although, of course, they will be constrained to wait until the patent expires before commencing any commercially related activities. I believe it will be a useful addition and in some ways it goes to counterbalance the additional time which we are going to grant in the other provision, which I would like to speak about, relating to the additional five-year period on drug patents. AlthoughI do not think it is a deliberate trade-off, the reality is that the provision on springboarding, and the way in which that allows generic drugs to be worked on prior to the actual expiry of the patent, will partially offset the additional costs which will flow to the Commonwealth-for example, in the PBS-from extending the principal patent period on a drug by an additional five years. Both of those provisions have substantial merit and I certainly support them. Indeed, the five-year extension is a significant change: we are granting an exclusive licence period to a company or individual to have the sole rights to commercially exploit a particular drug, usually one which has substantial advantages to the patient and to the community in general. To grant anyone an exclusive licence, and particularly to extend that licence by an extra five years, is a significant step by the parliament and by the laws of any country. Therefore, I think that it is important that we understand just why that should happen. Patents have been around for a very long time. They feature in the original US constitution where the framers of the US constitution understood that patents would be necessary to extend the inventiveness of the population, and to ensure that it was possible for a commercial capture of the value of any innovation. They foresaw that that would stimulate innovation, would stimulate invention, and would ensure that people would invest the time, the money, the hard work and research that is necessary to be inventive. Invention, it has often been said-and I think it is quite right-is very much 99 per cent perspiration and only one per cent inspiration, and for that 99 per cent of perspiration inventors are entitled to be appropriately rewarded. If we look at this whole question of patents, particularly of pharmaceutical drugs-which this bill principally focuses on-there are a number of issues, though, which are alive in the community at the moment. One of those is certainly genetic engineering and the patenting of gene technology and the pharmaceuticals which will undoubtedly flow from that. We have seen dramatic changes in the information technology environment in recent years. In the last two decades computers have brought wholesale change to our lives, they have revolutionised many parts of the workplace and, indeed, they are doing so in the communications mediums as we sit here. But the reality is that that revolution is nothing compared with the revolution which biotechnology, genetic engineering and molecular biology will bring to the next century. If we thought we lived through an era of rapid change in IT, we have not seen anything until we get to biotechnology in the next century. It is therefore very important that we should have our legal and ethIcal framework appropriately set in advance of those revolutions taking place, although they are under way at this very time. There are those-and principally a few of them reside in the other chamber-who are very much opposed to the notion that we should patent anything to do with the human genome. They say that for anyone to have control or a patent over genes or gene related sequences of DNA would be inherently wrong, that it would be unethical and improper. There is a certain fundamental attractiveness to that notion. It is a very simplistic and naive notion but it does have some fundamental positives about it and I can see why people would be attracted to that view. After all, we are unique living organisms, we have a unique DNA Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1055 and why should we allow that to be patented? 'Why should we allow life to be patented?' they say. But the reality which lies behind that initial interpretation is quite different, and it is very important that we should look at that and have such views analysed closely on the record. The reality is that for an invention to be patentable under the laws of Australia and, indeed, under the laws of most Western countries-all of which are very much integrated and closely tied together-an invention must contain novel and inventive steps. You cannot have an invention without a leap of spirit, without a leap of intellect to ensure that there is something worth patenting at the end of that process. If one simply has a gene sequence, if one simply knows the sequence of amino acids or nucleotides which constitute the gene, one does not have an inventive step, one does not have a patentable thing, and that is a reality which many of those who argue on the other side of this debate have chosen to ignore. You cannot simply patent information which is readily available to anyone who wants to look, and although it is a tedious process chemically to sequence an area of DNA, the reality is that any competent laboratory technician can sequence a given length of DNA and tell you the code which makes up that sequence. There is no inventive step in that, so one cannot simply go to the Patent Office and say, 'I have a sequence here; I wish to patent it.' They will very politely and kindly show you the door and ask you to come back when you have made an inventive leap, when you understand what that gene sequence does, when you understand how it does it and when you understand what the beneficial effect of that will be for humankind. In order to have a patent it is essential that you have that inventive jump of faith as well. And of course once the patent has been gained, once you have identified not only the sequence but the way in which that sequence can be used, what that sequence does, what its functions are and how it can be applied for the benefit of humankind---once you understand that-then you are in a position to seek a patent for that material or for that sequence of DNA. But the reality is that that patent will not give you ownership of that DNA. It will not give you ownership of the processes of life; it will not give you a title, if you like, over nature itself. Some, for example, have complained of the company Chiron, who obtained a patent over the hepatitis C virus, but of course that patent does not give that company any rights over the ownership of the virus. It simply gives them an exclusive licence to profit from the commercial technology which they have described and which is part of their undertaking. Indeed, I understand that that patent is now before the courts and will be the subject of further scrutiny because it may well have been too broad in the first place. But even if we allow that as a worse case decision-and that is something which further argument would have to be had on-it does not give the company Chiron any ownership rights to exclude others from undertaking public interest research into that virus. Many, many laboratories are now investigating hepatitis C, notwithstanding the existence of those patent rights, challenged though they are. The reality is that the number of scientific papers published on that virus is very substantial and has not been much altered by the existence of the patent. Anyone who stopped work on that virus because of the patent is wrongly informed about our patent laws. Another argument is that one should not grant a patent because something occurs in nature. Because our DNA is a naturally occurring thing, one should not permit something occurring 1056 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 in nature to be patented. But the reality is that many other natural things are patented and we have permitted that for a great length of time. If one looks at other innovations, like the extraction of Taxol from the yew tree, this was a very major step in cancer treatment. Taxol is a very promising molecule in the treatment of some types of cancer, and it is a naturally occurring substance. It is extracted from the yew tree. Unfortunately, there are not too many of those trees and they were at risk by the discovery that their bark contains TaxoI. Fortunately, an artificial synthesis has been undertaken and the tree has therefore been spared the fate of being sacrificed in the interests of medical science. The reality is that Taxol is a naturally occurring substance. A great deal of research and effort and money had to be expended in discovering the effectiveness of that molecule, in discovering a way of extracting that molecule, in discovering the way in which that molecule works to effect a cancer treatment, and then in bringing that product out of that development phase and to market. As the member for Lindsay said, a lot of money has to be invested in this process, something of the order of $US300 million to $US400 million, and something like eight to 12 years of work to bring a drug to market. Just because Taxol occurs in nature, should we therefore forbid its patenting? I think not. We did not, and we should not have forbidden it because if we had, why would anyone else go to the trouble of spending $US300 miIIion or $US400 million and take eight to 12 years of their lives to discover a treatment of cancer which they then could not patent? They would not invest the money, they would not invest the time, and humankind would have been denied the benefits which that drug will bring. It is important to remember they were only able to patent that drug because they identified it, they identified its nature and they identified the useful functionality which that drug has available to it. Patents are absolutely essential in that context when we look at those incredible periods of time and money which are involved. Patents protect people who take that inventive step and who invest their lives and resources in discovery. Ultimately, those discoveries are made known to us. Indeed, it is far better that people should undertake to patent those drugs and gain a monopoly over their use for 20 or 25 years, depending on whether this bilI is passed, than it is that they should take the alternative step, because the alternative step to profiting from a drug like that would be to keep it secret. That is the mechanism that Coca-Cola used at the tum of the century. Coca-Cola had a secret formula, a bit like Kentucky Fried Chicken, and they wanted to keep that formula secret because they felt it was better than patenting it. If no-one knew what it was then they could retain the formula for generations rather than for simply the 20 years which the patent mechanism provided. If you seek a patent, within 18 months of that patent being granted the Patent Office people wiII publish the full details of your patent. They will tell the world exactly what you have discovered, how you discovered it, what the best mechanism is to produce that drug, and all of the information that you are required to table at the Patent Office to ensure that you get your patent. Therefore, rather than having the formula kept secret-as is the case with Coca-Cola and Kentucky Fried Chicken-the world is able to profit after 20 or 25 years from the full knowledge being in the public domain of all of the relevant details of that drug. Everyone is Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1057 then free to use it and after the 20or 25-year period has elapsed, as other provisions of this bill say, we can then have generic versions of that drug at a much, much lower cost. In the interim, however, the full knowledge is in the public domain and other researchers are still able to work on those drugs. Notwithstanding that they are unable to use them for commercial gain,· they are able to undertake medical and scientific research and publish papers in scientific journals. They can profit from the intellectual knowledge which is contained within the patent, even if they cannot profit from the commercial knowledge of it. After the period has elapsed, anyone can do as they wish with the knowledge which is now in the public domain. I think that those who would argue against this are aware of these things but choose instead to focus on a very narrow and, dare I say it, politically attractive notion which they then attempt to sell publicly, but which I believe is actually counterproductive to the public interest in the long term, as the alternative of keeping those inventions secret-which is the only alternative which would be available to people-would be much worse. If Australia were to exclude genes and gene technology from patentability, by some illconceived act-one which it would be fairly difficult to enforce because of the problems which flow around the definitions-and were we to overcome those problems and pass legislation like that, we would isolate ourselves in Western society. The United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, the other major patenting nations, all accept that these technologies can be patented. Australian researchers would then be forced to lodge patents, not in Australia, because it would be unavailable to them, but rather in the United States, or in Europe or in Japan, to gain international protection for their products. Australia would then be in the position of either having to honour those patents internationally or being in breach of our international undertakings. I do not think Australian researchers, Australian pharmaceutical companies, would be willing to invest their time and effort, only to be forced then to go overseas to see those inventions protected and in order to gain some commercial short-term benefit from their work and their life's effort. The reality is that, even if it were not for the very strong arguments which I believe exist in favour of allowing patents for these things, Australia would still be forced into the position by international treaties, by international law, of having to offer patent protection for these things. Otherwise people would simply take their inventions and discoveries elsewhere. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology also looked at this very issue some eight years ago now. In June 1990, prior to my membership of the committee, it was given a reference by the then minister to examine many of the issues associated with gene technology. The committee looked at this very issue of patentability of genes and associated material. It took evidence right around Australia; it had extensive public hearings and heard from a wide variety of experts on the subject. The committee's conclusion was very strongly in favour of permitting patents on this material, for very much the kind of reasons which I have enunciated today. I will not take the time of the committee by going into any detail of those findings, but they are on the record for anyone to peruse. They are just as relevant now as they were back in 1990 and we would be wise to heed the advice of our own committee at the time. The committee certainly understood the value which flows from patents; it understood the moral and commercial imperative of allowing patents and of ensuring that inventors can profit from their discoveries, that they can profit from the effort and time and money which they invest 1058 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 in those things. The committee understood that, ultimately, although the inventors are the shortterm winners, we the public are the long-term victors in this battle, because after 20 or 25 years all of that material is in the public domain. All of the options then exist for generic drugs. The public, in the meantime, very much from day one, have the full intellectual benefit of the knowledge which those people have gained-which they can'then freely make available for medical research use, because they know they have the protection of the patent system for a limited period. It is worth remembering that it is because of the eight to 12 years that it takes to bring a patent to fruition, to bring a drug on line, that we are considering extending the time. If you have already invested 12 years in that process, you then have very little time left to enjoy your patent. The period available to you at the moment is only 20 years, but we assume it will be extended to 25 years. To block patents on genes or gene technologies, although it is fundamentally and naively attractive at first blush, would be of long-term detriment to Australia. It would certainly be of detriment to the public in the long run. I would strongly counsel the parliament and the public against taking that view. by an additional five years is a significant one for the Howard government. It was the first indication that the coalition is not prepared to follow in the footsteps of former governments and continue with a failed minimalist approach when it comes to the protection of Australian intellectual property. In this instance the government has elected to look beyond the short-term revenue implications for these measures to the long-term benefits of investing in technology development, and it should be commended for so doing. The financial impact statement suggests that the measures in the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997 will add to the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by around $6 million in the financial year 2001-02, and up to $160 million by the year 2005-06. Few would dispute that this is a significant cost to the revenue. However industry experts predict that the long-term increase in sales of pharmaceutical products will far outweigh these figures, and the taxation benefits alone would probably go some way towards offsetting those costs to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The bill seeks to bring about change to three substantial areas of the principal act, including the deregulation of the professional practice in trademarks and designs and the introduction of a new regime for regulation of the patent attorney profession. FeedbackI have received suggests that the domestic pharmaceutical industry will benefit from these changes. It has been pointed out to me that the standard of patent attorneys in Australia is often low, with few able to keep up with technological advances. Also, junior and non-profit companies have been burdened by disproportionately high patent costs under the current system, as well as by the expensive and cumbersome patent litigation regime. It is to be hoped that these amendments will bring about increased competition amongst the legal profession and therefore lower the cost of the patent process. Several minor technical changes to the patent regime are also proposed in this legislation. However, the most significant amendments are those that I mentioned in my opening remarks which will see extended by five years the standard 20-year term of a patent in the United States of America, Japan and the European Union.",143,Representatives Main Committee
406,Mr Rocher (Curtin) (10.39 A.m.),"The decision·to extend the term scheme for patentsWednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1059 After an extended period of uncertainty, the Australian pharmaceutical industry can finally look to the future with the knowledge that this government is acting to bring our intellectual property regime into line with our international competitors. Support for the research and development industry and the protection of intellectual property are inextricably linked. In a recent publication, the Industry Research and Development Board noted that research and development in each industry is characterised by a few leading edge companies which, by their choices and abilities, create the technology trajectories that others will follow. It is precisely for this reason that government support of research and development is not enough to maximise the economic and social benefits that will result from world-class medical research resources. Professor Phillip Reece, Director of Research and Development at Biota Holdings Ltd observed that the discovery of revolutionary pharmaceutical treatments comes to nothing 'without diligent patenting of new discoveries and patent legislation which guarantees an adequate return for investors'. It may come as a surprise to some.to learn that the discovery and marketing of pharmaceutical products is no guarantee of financial success for the pioneering company. In fact, the costs involved in discovering a new chemical entity, an NCE, average in the vicinity of $300 million to $400 million. As Professor Reece also noted: The only way such investments can be justified is if there is a reasonable guarantee of a return from the occasional product that makes it through development. He goes on to suggest that 'the discovery oriented pharmaceutical industry relies on protection of its intellectual property for its existence', and that 'returns from the commercialisation of NCEs are directly linked to the life of patents' . In addition to the massive financial costs involved with the discovery of pharmaceutical products, there is the long lead time between the research and development stage and commercialisation of an NCE, commonly a 10to 12-year period. Lengthy lead times are a necessary evil for Australian pharmaceutical companies to come to grips with, and they can have a devastating financial effect on them if patent protection is not in keeping with that of their rivals. The government acknowledged as much in its explanatory memorandum when it stated that its aim in putting forward these amendments was to provide an effective patent life to assist companies in earning a return on their investments. The commercialisation of a new pharmaceutical product is no guarantee of a windfall for these companies, with only four in 10 products which make it to the market stage perhaps producing a profit for the parliament company. In an edition of the Australian Financial Review in February, Professor Ronald Quinn and Mr Christer Testen were reported as saying: With odds like that, it is essential that there be an adequate period of patent protection to recoup costs and make a profit. It may be true that Australia's reliance on extractive industries has served us well in the past, but such industries simply cannot keep pace with the industry of knowledge. That is where our future must lie if we are to remain competitive in the international economy. However, Australian pharmaceutical companies have had to sit by and watch as Japan, Europe and the United States have moved to extend the effective patent life for both new and existing pharmaceuticals, while past Australian governments have failed to do the same. At the same time, those in the pharmaceutical business have had to contend with the present government, led by Treasury, in their savaging of the R&D program on the basis that it was 1060 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 not cost effective. Professor Quinn and Mr Testen noted that until Australia showed international parity with its patent laws, investment, infrastructure and expertise would go nowhere. They went on to say: We will lose out on the development of a viable research based, value added export industry. The similarities between the mineral and pharmaceutical industries, while perhaps qot obvious, are manifold. In a recent media publication, Ms Judy Webber, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, outlined the reasons for Australian success in mining and mineral processing. She noted that the combination of resource deposits, technology, personnel, and political and administrative stability were critical factors in persuading companies to invest in long-term exploration projects. It should be a source of regret to all in this place that while successive governments have been prepared to support the mining industry in a manner that has helped it become a world leader, that same level of support has not been extended to industries such as the pharmaceutical industry. In his article in the Australian Financial Review on 22 July last year, journalist Brian Toohey noted: An economy structured to participate in the fastest growing sectors of the global marketplace will do better than one which relies heavily on the supply of raw materials. The benefits to the wider community from the discovery of new pharmaceutical products cannot be overstated. As journalist Peter Roberts reported in February this year, TNA Australia, a packaging and machinery manufacturer, and IDT Australia, Australia's sole manufacturer of active ingredients for pharmaceuticals, have both gained valuable opportunities from the expanding industry. The benefits extend way beyond those suppliers. In its Scoreboard 97 publication, the !R&D Board noted that approximately 50 per cent of the direct benefits of industrial research and development spills over from the exploring firm to the rest of society. It also noted that, in the long term, the spill-over effects 'determined the future competitiveness of the nation in a world trade which is increasingly technology based.' Information published by the !R&D Board demonstrates that the level of exports of innovative Australian companies is five times that of firms which do not invest in research and development. According to the !R&D Board, 43 per cent of firms investing in R&D are export oriented business as opposed to only 10 per cent of non-innovative firms. In the years between 1990 and 1996, exports of pharmaceutical products from Australia have more than trebled from $270 million to $1 billion. However, in comparison to our international competitors, Australia remains a small market for pharmaceuticals. As one international pharmaceutical company with a base in my electorate of Curtin notes, Australia's share of the total global market of pharmaceuticals sits between 0.5 per cent and 1.3 per cent, depending on product class. Increased levels of R&D and greater protection of our intellectual property are essential ingredients if we are to increase our market share. It is fair to say that those multinationals which establish bases in Australia do so because of our proximity to Asia and because of our competent work force. However, we are not competitive with our Asian, European or American counterparts when it comes to industry incentives, efficiencies or manufacturing climate. These Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1061 issues will not be determined through the measures contained in this legislation alone, of course; but, at the same time, they cannot be ignored by the coalition. Australia's research based companies require the support of government and the financial sector to improve access to venture capital and to ensure that our universities and other centres of advanced learning are well funded, in order to prevent the brain drain phenomenon. Highly innovative industries also produce greater sales rates than do their non-R&D cousins. The value of sales per employee is markedly higher amongst R&D companies, with sales for noninnovative companies averaging around $120,000 per annum in contrast to more than $245,000 for research and development firms. Two other barometer readings of an industry's commitment to innovation are the spending on R&D per employee and the expenditure on R&D as a proportion of sales. In both reading1!, Biota Holdings Ltd, the pharmaceutical company I have already referred to, ranks in the top 10 Australian companies spending on research and development. As the IR&D Board notes: Firms with very high R&D levels per employee are designed around a strategy of a highly skilled, highly adaptable and highly paid workforce. It goes on: These high value-added companies are a timely example, in a period of national concern about jobs and wage levels. While the export figures I have quoted are not specific to the pharmaceutical industry, they are especially significant, given Australia's overreliance on imported drugs. As I outlined in a grievance debate last year, this overdependence on foreign drug treatments, combined with our ageing population, will further burden our current account balance sheet if the trend is not reversed and exports and imports of pharmaceuticals are brought closer to balance and-who knows?-maybe into surplus one day. True economic growth is only possible through genuine competitive advances. In the absence of an ongoing commitment to innovation in pharmaceutical products, our pharmaceutical industry will not continue to lift its performance and/will not remain competitive in the long term. However, inadequate patent protection and recent cuts to research and development in Australia have been shown to be a disincentive to domestic pharmaceutical companies to continue operating in Australia, and have certainly not encouraged foreign firms to establish bases here. It is true that more than $1 billion has been invested in research and development in Australia by the drug industry since 1986. But this figure, which equates to around five per cent of turnover, is still far short of the international average and needs to be improved if we are to remain competitive with our Asian and OECD competitors. In Scoreboard 97, the Industry Research and Development Board also noted that, for an innovative firm to be successful, it must ensure that it is the first to market with its new product. However, once the patent for that product has expired, generic companies are able to sell a like product with the least amount of development expenditure. Professor Reece noted: No preclinical pharmacology, toxicology, or phase 1, 2 or 3 studies are necessary, since these have been done by the originator. This is why it is absolutely critical that our domestic intellectual property laws are on a par with those of our international competitors. 1062 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 Shortly after her retirement as the chairman of CSIRO, Ms Adrienne Clarke suggested that there are some issues that are of such importance and have such long-term ramifications for Australia that we need bipartisan support in dealing with them. I suggest that the proposals we are dealing with today are of that nature. The government deserves full marks for the introduction of this legislation. However, the extension of standard patents should not be viewed as the sole solution to promoting our pharmaceutical industry abroad. Equally as important is the reinstatement of an R&D incentive that promotes increased levels of innovation, improved access to venture capital for research and development firms, and better funding to universities for pure research and, perhaps, development. In closing, I quote Mr Pat Clear, Chief Executive of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, who sums up very well the feeling of his industry about this bill. He says: (This) decision is a satisfactory outcome for our industry. The government has sent a strong message, both domestically and internationally, that it is committed to a stable, consistent and positive environment for the industry in Australia. reply-I thank the honourable members for Cunningham ( Mr Martin), Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), Bonython( Mr Martyn Evans) and Curtin( Mr Rocher) for the interest they have taken in the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997 and also for their supportive comments. The bill fulfils government commitments in three areas. The first is the extension of patent term for up to five years for pharmaceuticals. This recognises that the long-term development time, combined with the considerable regulatory process to register and market a new product, erodes the patent term available in which to gain return on their investment. The bill will provide an effective patent life which is closer to that available to innovations in other areas of innovation. These arrangements also make provision for springboarding. This allows manufacturers of generic drugs to undertake certain activities, prior to the expiry of the patent, solely for the purposes of meeting premarketing regulatory approval requirements. Springboarding will be permitted any time after the extension has been granted. The second area provides for reforms in the regulation of patent attorneys, allowing greater choice of providers of professional services in the areas of patents and trademarks. The government has been concerned to ensure that the profession continues to offer a high quality service while being subject to competitive pressures. It wishes to ensure that there are no undue barriers to competition in professional practice. Technical qualifications will not be required for registration as a trademarks attorney. In these areas of lesser specialisation, the government considers that there should be greater competition. Restrictions on practice in patents will be retained, recognising the technical and demanding nature of patent law and the potential high cost of poor quality applications. Access to the profession will be opened up by moving the education and examination functions of the Patent Attorneys Professional Standards Board to the universities. The third area of change will improve the ability of patent office officials to provide better and more cost-effective service. These amendments will enable the government to meet its",148,Representatives Main Committee

GAS PIPELINES ACCESS (COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 November 1997, on motion by Mr Truss, That the bill be now read a second time. 1997 is to provide for the application of the national legislative framework for third-party access to natural gas pipelines to areas within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. This bill, as detailed in the minister's second reading speech, essentially outlines competition in the natural gas sector. As a former resources minister, I know only too well how important the gas industry is to the overall Australian economy. It has only been over a relatively short period that we have utilised this important resource, although great strides have been made in that period, as is manifested by some of the offshore developments in Western Australia. Indeed, it was only in 1969 that my home city of Brisbane commenced commercial reticulation of natural gas from the Mooney oilfields. In the period that I was resource minister, a great deal of change occurred within the industry. As we have heard previously, in 1991 the Hawke government adopted its national strategy for the natural gas industry. This strategy was adopted under. the then minister and my former colleague Alan Griffiths, the member for Maribyrnong. This strategy started the",152,Representatives Main Committee

410,Mr Beddall (Rankin) (11.03 A.m.),"The Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Bill1064 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 national policy thrust to introduce a competitive Australian natural gas industry and was part of an overall thrust by the then government to ensure competition between energy sectors' so that decisions were made on the best possible outcomes. As we have heard during this debate in a previous time, the production of gas has remained a private sector activity whereas pipelines and distribution historically have both private and state government involvement. The Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1994 agreed ,on a range of measures to introduce free and fair trading for Australia's gas industry. As a result, the Keating government formed the gas reform task force in June 1995. An important area that the. task force looked at was the development and implementation of the vital third party access code. This was to enable fair access to the pipelines for third parties. The code was developed with a great deal of consultation with industry bodies including the Australian Gas Association, APPEA-the Australian Petroleum Producers and Exploration Association-and the Australian Pipeline Industry Association. This ultimately led to the signing of the natural gas pipeline access agreement in November of last year. It is important to note, however, that national coverage and consistency in regulatory approach is very important to achieving competition as well as reform. I can only reiterate, as former speakers have said in previous debates, that establishing and maintaining a consistent and uniform regulatory framework is crucial to ensuring that maximum benefits are received from the reform process. This bill before the Main Committee will go a long way to achieving this. In particular, the bill extends access to areas where legislation of the states and territories could not operate without the Commonwealth's assistance. In particular, this refers to the external territories and the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline. I was minister for resources when this gas pipeline was sold and saw, for the first time, that competition in this industry could lead to competitive pressures in the Sydney gas market and the creation of jobs as well as import substitution from products that were produced from gas from the Moomba field. This pipeline is a major gas pipeline and is integral to the development of an integrated eastern state pipeline network. I would like to place on record just how important the gas industry is to the Australian economy. The Australian gas industry has annual sales of around $5 billion, both domestic and international covering liquefied natural gas-that is LNG-and appliances for distribution. The distribution alone contributes $1.7 billion in value added GDP to the Australian economy on an annual basis. Also, LNG exports are Australia's largest energy export behind coal and ctude oil. Many members including the member for Bendigo( Mr Reid) have had the opportunity to visit the North West Shelf which is an extraordinary world-class operation and one that does Australian industry proud although we would all like to see Australian industry participation at a higher rate in those projects. As an employer, the gas industry employs around 5,800 people in pipeline and gas utility operations and supports indirect employment in thousands of commercial enterprises who use gas as their main energy source. Increasingly, we are seeing the importance of gas, particularly in power generation, but also for smaller energy uses. The gas industry is also a substantial investor in gas production, distribution, transmission and exports. The projected capital investment is as much as $37,000 million over the next six years. Gas can also playa significant role in improving Australia's greenhouse environmental performance. It is a cleaner form of fossil fuel and one that is in abundance in Australia and Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1065 is being extracted in ever-increasing amounts. Environmental considerations support economic substitution of gas for other fossil fuels. I would like to tum to the amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974. Amendments will enable Commonwealth bodies to perform regulatory functions under the national access agreements. The agreements to the Trade Practices Act will also remove any uncertainty surrounding the applicatipn of the competition principles agreement. The ACCC will also provide greater flexibility to authorise conduct which could be seen as anti-competitive behaviour in other circumstances. There is, however, some concern in the industry as a result of the economic crisis now facing our Asian neighbours. As recently as yesterday in the Financial Review in an article by Ian Howarth, who probably knows this industry better than any other journalist, it was reported that the expansion of the North West Shelf gas project in Western Australia could be delayed for up to six months as a result of uncertainties over the impact from a shaky Asian market on LNG demand. But, with energy shortages occurring in sections of Asia, sales are expected to double over the next decade. In particular, we hope that the Korean economy can recover quickly. Korea is probably the largest potential market for Australian LNG, and the Koreans see LNG as a source of energy for themselves in the future and would underwrite most of the expansion that is being contemplated in the North West Shelf. During its economic boom, Korea has suffered considerable energy shortages and gas turbine power stations are quite rightly seen as an efficient and quick way to remedy the shortfall. The bill we are discussing supports the industry and is not being opposed by the opposition. The shadow minister, the member for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith), will make it clear when he speaks on this debate that Labor supports this very important industry. As Labor did in government, we recognise that this bill provides the structure for the continuation of a competitive natural gas industry. Labor has committed itself to supporting the above goals and further downstream processing in Australia. We have seen that the primary natural gas supply as a percentage of total energy supply in Australia has risen to currently about 18 per cent. Natural gas is expected to be Australia's fastest growing energy source. By the year 2030, it is forecast to account for more than 28 per cent of Australia's primary energy needs. As someone who has watched with great interest the development of this industry over many years, I fully support all measures which ensure that the gas industry continues to grow and to prosper. Over those years, I have had the pleasure of meeting with many gas industry representatives and workers in the field. It is clear that support at the government level, particularly the Commonwealth government level, is needed to ensure that a unified direction in policy is achieved. The reform of the gas industry is crucial, as have been the reforms that have taken place around Australia in the last decade in the electricity industry and in the many other areas where' competitive pressures are now applying and producing outcomes for consumers, as well as providing opportunities for industry development. These measures are good measures and the opposition supports them. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (11.12 a.m)-The Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Bill 1997 delivers on an election promise by the government to introduce competition reforms that would establish a national market of free and fair trade in gas. We are now delivering on that promise, as we delivered on the promise to sell one-third of Telstra. We did not sell 1066 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 a half, we did not sell the whole thing, we sold a third. We have also delivered on our promise , to give $1 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. We promised to cut the deficit and to take any further tax reform or any action with regard to Medicare to the people for election. This contrasts sharply with Bob Carr in my state. He has failed to deliver on a number ·of promises regarding the M4, the Warragamba Dam, the Nepean Hospital and air conditioning in school buildings in my area. He has also failed to do anything to address his budget deficit. When it comes to credibility, this government is very high in those stakes. It is of key interest to me that we are now making some progress towards a natiOl'lal .infrastructure for gas pipelines. It is something that I felt was not dealt with sufficiently at the Constitutional Convention. It was precluded from the debate. But I have always. found it very frustrating in this House that, in this day and age, we are limited by section 51 of the constitution from generally legislating on transport matters and national infrastructure matters. It is appropriate that the Commonwealth playa leading role in train systems, road systems, aircraft systems, pipeline systems and transport systems right across this nation. Yet it is very difficult to do this without the compliance of the states, due to the way that our constitution is written . . The powers that the states gave us in 1901 were such that we .are unable to just legislate . to bring this into being. We are relying on South Australia to implement its bill and then having the other states implement a similar bill by legislating for the South Australian bill to take effect in those states, although I understand Western Australia is actually going to have a separate bill which is essentially the same as the South Australian bill. The reguhltion of this act and this area will come under the realms of the Commonwealth competition policy, ACCC and the Commonwealth regulatory bodies. It is a very cumbersome way of delivery. It is not as easy as one would think to deliver on a promise-it often isn't-but we have achieved it in this instance with cooperation from the states. It is something that maybe future changes to section 51 of our constitution will give us the power to do unilaterally. There are a number of gas basins in Australia. There is the Carnarvon basin, off Dampier; the Browse basin, off Broome; the Bonaparte basin, west of Darwin; and the Amadeus basin, near Alice Springs. There are about three different basins in Bass Strait and a number of basins right across south-west Queensland, western New South Wales and north-eastern South Australia. Those last mentioned basins are around Moomba and are part of the very essential Moomba pipeline that links all the supply centres with the demand centres. Given that our supplies are largely offshore or in the centre of Australia, it is imperative that we have some mechanism for transporting that product to the demand centres, the largest of which is Melbourne, and then Perth and then Sydney. Currently existing pipelines run from Dampier to Perth and south to Bunbury, and from Dampier to Mount Newman and out to Kalgoorlie. A pipeline also currently exists from the Amadeus basin to Darwin; there is one proposed from the Cooper basin to Mount Isa; and there is already one in existence from that basin, the Moomba pipeline, which extends to Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. It is also proposed to put in a pipeline from Papua New Guinea, coming down through Townsville to Gladstone, and also one from the Gippsland basin in the Bass Strait to Sydney. ' We are making leaps and bounds in this area to get natural gas to our centres of demand, and there are some very good environmental reasons for that. The amount of carbon dioxide Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1067 . from natural gas is quite low relative to the amount from other fossil fuels. The level of particulates, which are the solid matter that is released into the atmosphere, is also low in natural gases. The lead that is required as an octane enhancer in petrol and diesel vehicles is not required in natural gas vehicles. In addition, a lot of aromatic and other nitrous oxide emissions are reduced. Estimates by the Australian Institute of Petroleum indicate that, by converting half of Australia's road vehicles to natural gas, savings of two percent would be made on the total Australian emission of greenhouse gases. That would have a significant impact, especially in a. city like Sydney where 95 per cent of the smog and pollution in our air comes from road traffic. I always encourage the constituents in my electorate to look at using bicycles, if they can, or a train, or finding some other method of getting around rather than in vehicles that use fossil fuels. But if we are using fossil fuels, then natural gas is the leader to which we all should be moving. Primary natural gas supply as a percentage of total energy supply in Australia has risen from six per cent in 1973 to 17 per cent in 1994 and to 18 per cent today. The industrial sector accounts for 40 per cent of the total primary demand for natural gas, so it is also being used in industry. After coal and oil, natural gas is the third most important energy source for Australia. It contributes $5.8 billion to our GDP. That is looking at natural gas as a return from electricity and also from the gas reform. So, it is quite a significant economic mover in today's energy industries. It is significant that we have actually managed to get general consensus right across the states and right across Australia for some common use of pipelines so that the monopolies are forced to look at competition, so that suppliers and end users can organise for different modes of transport between each other, and we get some sort of legally enforceable rights for users, suppliers and retailers so that they can negotiate haulage on fair and reasonable terms. It really opens up the whole aspect of delivery of gas to competition, which is something that has not been done. We need to move in this direction to keep prices down because natural gas in the city is distinctly cheaper than other fossil fuels as it has an exemption from fuel excise tariffs. That is the one thing that gives it a clear competitive advantage and provides an economic incentive for people to convert to gas, depending on how much mileage they do and if they have figured things out. It is incredibly important to keep the cost of natural gas competitive against other fossil fuels and to encourage Australians to use it. One way of doing that is by encouraging competition in the area of supply, which this bill goes on to do. It is also indicative of where the Commonwealth government needs to go on a number of national networks. I have mentioned a few. Obviously, the airport is one as it is close to my home. We are always looking to improve the air quality in my area. Given the unfortunate geographic circumstances where there is a pooling of poor air quality· around the Bringelly basin, one way we can do that is to get emissions from fossil fuels down to a level that will make the air quality in our region similar to that which exists in the rest of Sydney, or perhaps . even down to a level that exists in smaller cities in Australia. It is a major challenge and I keep moving to get Sydney to change the direction in which it is going to ,take some sort of state or local government attitude on this. Certainly, this legislation will go a long way to assisting the promotion of gas as a future option. I hope to see the use of gas in Australia expanded over the next 10 to 15 years. 1068 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 This is a non-contentious bill. The opposition has broughtit to this chamber because it sees the light, I suppose, and sees that this in where we should be going. I commend the bill to the House. Access (Commonwealth) Bill 1997. It is timely that I begin by congratulating the state government of Western Australia on the most successful privatisation in that state's historythe sale of the Dampier to Bunbury natural gas pipeline, the DBNGP, which was announced on Tuesday, 3 March by the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Richard Court. This sale is great news for Western Australia and potentially brings a lot of other development to our state. It will of course have benefits for the rest of the country. I will elaborate on this a bit later, but I want to say that I welcome this legislation which is proposed to provide for the application of the national legislative framework for third party access to natural gas pipelines. Australia is one of the countries of the developed world which are promoting competition in the energy sector. A national legislative framework-'-Or gas reform-has become necessary for many reasons and not the least because the Australian natural gas industry has had considerable regulation at all levels of production, transmission and distribution. This legislation is designed to provide for the minor variation, revocation and substitution of authorisations for restrictive trade practices. Restrictive trade practices are not conducive to the development of this great natural resource which is plentiful in Australia and, of course, as has been said by the previous speaker, the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) particularly in Western Australia. Western Australia is taking over in energy supply as the gas energy from the Bass Strait area gradually winds down. The North West Shelf is the new frontier for plentiful energy supply in Australia. This is an industry which needs the support of the federal government by way of this legislation, to enable private companies to fully maximise the potential of this resource. Natural gas is Australia's fastest growing energy source. It currentl'y supplies about 18 per cent of Australia's primary energy demand, and that is expected to rise by another 10 per cent to 28 per cent by 2101. At present over 2.8 million Australian households use natural gas for energy, so gas prices do have a significant impact on the real incomes of Australian households and the competitiveness of the Australian gas industry. Investment proposals to improve the competitiveness of the industry are awaiting completion of industry reforms, which include this legislation. Investment is proposed for liquefied natural gas plants, pipelines, power stations and gas storage facilities. As I have said, the most plentiful natural gas resources are found in the north-west of Western Australia. Adequate pipelines and access to pipelines will be needed at some point down the track -o carry gas from our state to other states. The member for Lindsay referred to the gas reserves in the Carnarvon basin in Western Australia, offshore from the Port Hedland-Karratha region. These are the largest, at about 54 per cent of reserves; the Browse and Bonaparte gas field regions, which are also in north-west Western Australia, offshore from Broome, hold around 10 to 20 per cent of reserves respectively. These figures are approximate but Western Australia does have over 80 per cent of the reserves, so my state clearly has a significant contribution to make to the natural gas industry in Australia. The proposed pipeline from Western Australia to other states will only be viable when the natural gas supplies in other states are nearing economic depletion. It is important to note,",153,Representatives Main Committee
411,Mr Randall (Swan) (11.25 A.m.),"I am very happy to speak: today on the Gas PipelinesWednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1069 though, that other pipelines within the eastern states, particularly the proposed Chevron natural gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea to Queensland, are likely to delay the requirement for a pipeline from Western Australia to the eastern states in the immediate fllture. If we are looking at states providing energy to other states, and pipelines providing gas to states other than that of origin, natural gas is a resource which needs to be managed with a certain degree of uniformity. For example, uniformity in construction of pipelines is important for the efficient carriage of gases from one area to another, or from one state to another. The need for uniformity is demonstrated by the lack of uniformity in the rail lines that originally were designed for Australia. We do not want to go down that route again. The economics of the more remote gas fields is also said to be more likely to improve with the increased pipeline network and with improved access to pipelines. The opposition, of course, are all for an interstate trade on a free and fair basis and they see that as a key to the future development of an efficient competitive industry. I am pleased that-as has been said by members opposite already-they do -upport this legislation because it is quite sensible in the development of this industry in Australia. They will not disagree with the legislation which will open this access to pipelines on nondiscriminating commercial terms and ensure optimum interstate gas competition. As we know, the reforms to the gas industry were central to the recommendations in the Hilmer report on the national competition policy review. The reforms to the gas industry are expected to bring a full and wide-ranging range of benefits. These include: increased competition between alternative fuels and the consumer price competition; lower unit gas supply costs; more effective gas pricing to end users as cost subsidies are phased out; lower greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants, generally, and gains in microeconomic activity which will see higher investment, higher production and higher employment. Australia is already participating in gas industry reforms to a large degree in terms of governments relieving themselves of the provision of this product. In the past, governments have supported anti-competitive arrangements to facilitate development of the industry through allowing monopoly of the industry. However now the Commonwealth government has sold the Moomba to Sydney pipeline, and the South Australian government has sold the Moomba to Adelaide pipeline-and, incidentally, there are new owners, as I said for the Dampier to Bunbury pipeline and these same owners also own the Moomba to Adelaide pipeline-and the Queensland government has sold the WallumbiIIa pipeline. My point there is that the sale of pipelines is nothing new, but there needs to be this legislative framework so that there is uniformity. Distribution of gas in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are all carried out by private companies. Until recently, only Western Australia and Victoria were served gas by government utilities. As I mentioned, though, Epic Energy will now provide gas through the Dampier to Bunbury pipeline in Western Australia. Under the privatisation of gas pipeline, Western Australian gas consumers will enjoy lower gas tariffs. In 1998, under the transitional access regime, tariffs will fall 20 per cent from $1.19 to $1.00 in the year 2000, and from the year 2000, the national access code will be adopted in Western Australia. The national access code will provide people, or firms, with a right to 1070 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 negotiate access to gas pipeline services on reasonable terms and conditions approved by an independent regulator with a right to binding arbitration to resolve disputes. Customers will be able to buy gas directly from a gas producer of their choice and purchase gas transportation separately from a gas pipeline company, or through a gas retailer. The aim is to encourage competition between gas producers and retailers which should result in a better service provision and cheaper prices to consumers. This legislation is central to the success of the code through removing barriers and restrictions, constructing new infrastructure to increase links between major producers and markets, and removing anti-competitive regulation which will set the stage for a nationally competitive market for gas. The environmental aspect has already been touched on, but the environmental benefits of gas are well known. As we have said, there is a reduction in carbon dioxide and many other gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. It has already been said that lead is not required for natural gas vehicles as an octane enhancer. Coal produces around 50 per cent more emissions of carbon dioxide than does natural gas per unit of energy. In the context of air quality and greenhouse gas emissions there are obvious benefits in substituting coal with natural gas where possible. At present, around 60 per cent of natural gas consumption is by the manufacturing sector which is closely linked to the 15 per cent or so used in the mining sector, so the domestic or residential sector uses around 20 per cent. Increased access to pipelines means development can happen more cheaply along pipelines where there is already access to existing energy sources. By that I mean literally tapping into the gas pipeline which goes past, which is cheaper than transporting those forms of energy. This can be seen in the Dampier to Kalgoorlie pipeline, where towns along the way which used to operate with old diesel generating facilities to produce energy, electricity, et cetera, are now able to tap into this environmentally superior and cheaper form of energy. This is the case for all those towns that are on the route from Dampier to Kalgoorlie, many of them potential mining towns or mining towns in situ. ' The potential is tremendous. As has been said, it means this cheaper form of energy is able to be used for mineral deposits, and they may be given the impetus to spring up even more because this alternative energy source is there. This existing infrastructure will encourage further development of sites and the industry spin-offs that these sites would attract. Employment-wise, this is also potentially a good thing. Although a lot of the land in Western Australia is currently subject to native title claims and the problems that caused in putting in the pipes, and the uncertainty is thwarting development in the resources industry, hopefully this situation will be cleared up, one way or another. I would like to come back to the Dampier to Bunbury natural gas pipeline in Western Australia which has been sold, as I said earlier, to Epic Energy Australia for over $2.4 billion. There are reports that the price paid was some $300 million more than was expected, which is a great bonus for the investment made by the state government, and the people of Western Australia in particular, in this project. Of that amount, $104 million is state government stamp duty. The proceeds of the sale will be used to repay the debt associated with the Dampier to Bunbury pipeline and the costs involved in the sale. There have already been a lot of speculative statements about how the government will spend the surplus. The state opposition leader in Western Australia, never one to miss the opportunity to cast gloom on triumph for the people of Western Australia, is harping about the surpluses not being used for pork-barrelling. He reminds me of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, trying Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1071 to cast gloom on the day thousands of Australian mums and dads were involved in a privatisation. But they got huge returns on their investment in Telstra shares, Mr Deputy Speaker, didn't they, including, I believe, Mr Bob Brown? It has been put to me recently that his family have invested in Telstra shares. That is a new one to come out of the woodwork, isn't it? and this Liberal coalition government are not the only privatisers. We know that the great privatisers were the former Keating Labor government: Australian Airlines, the Commonwealth Bank-we could go through a whole range. We know that this is not opposed. It is well known that the state government has some major capital works projects in mind. Whatever the outcome of the budget, I am certain Western Australians will see their dividends and that they will get a fair return on their investment on this gas pipeline. The state government gas utility in Western Australia, called Alinta Gas, managed the construction of the pipeline. The good news for Alinta Gas employees, who were involved in the operation and maintenance of that pipeline, is that under the sale conditions they are assured of employment with the new owners, and this is guaranteed for two years. Epic Energy Australia is an Australian based company, owned by four Australian based shareholding companies and two US based shareholding companies. In total, one-third of Epic Energy Australia is owned by the Australian shareholders. Their Australian operations will be housed in the headquarters to be established in Perth. Importantly, Epic Energy has guaranteed to spend another $874 million in the next 10 years to double the capacity of the pipeline, and I have already outlined the benefits which will come from the increased access to an existing pipeline, such as possible future development sites and so on. I am pleased to see the progress of the reform of the gas industry and to see it going in a similar way to Telstra, which once had a monopoly on telecommunications in both the provision and the servicing of products. Reform of the gas industry is going to see some competitive players come in and it will enable the opening up of developments around Australia-which, in terms of industry exports and employment, will be welcomed. One of the reasons I was keen to speak on the Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Bill 1997 was that there is a certain romance in living in my state of Western Australia with pipelines. As a boy, I was brought up in a town which would not have been a town unless there had been a pipeline going through it, and that was the town of Merredin. A visionary called C.Y. O'Connor had, many years before, planned the water pipeline to run from the hills of Perth all the way to Kalgoorlie, over 400 miles away. He was told that it was a stupid project and would never happen and that they would never get the water to Kalgoorlie. His critics were so vehement in their attacks on him that, unfortunately, C.Y. O'Connor killed himself before the completion of the project. Without the provision of the water pipeline from Perth to Kalgoorlie, there would be no Kalgoorlie as we know it today. There would not be the towns that benefit through the wheat belt, nor the large network of towns that have benefited from the fresh water pipeline in Western Australia. Pipelines are nothing new but they are a marvellous infrastructure that brings development and expansion to country and outlying areas. As a result, the expansion of the gas pipeline network in Australia is certainly welcomed, and the privatisation and the",158,Representatives Main Committee

413,Mr Randall,"The member for Charlton. We do know that was a successful privatisation,1072 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 competition that are brought with it are certainly welcomed as well. I commend the bill to the House. ( Mr Randall) on a very interesting speech on the merits of the Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Bill 1997 and also on his own personal stories about the romance Western Australians had with pipelines-and particularly, as he mentioned, in Kalgoorlie-in the opening up of Western Australia. I rise today to support the Bill. As we all know, natural gas is now our third most important energy resource after oil and coal. Eighteen per cent of Australia's energy usage is now natural gas. This represents a three-fold increase over the past quarter of a century. Natural gas was all but ignored in the country until the early 1970s,but that situation changed quickly. For example, most of the Northern Territory's electricity is generated by gas turbines, these days. There are two principal reasons for the growing use of gas in Australia. Firstly, there have been enormous technological advances that make it easier and safer not only to discover but also, most importantly, to transport and to use natural gas. As we know, gas is now powering a growing number of cars and other vehicles, through the use of LPG. Secondly, there is a growing concern for environmental issues. Natural gas pollutes significantly less than does oil or coal. Basically, the burning of gas releases less carbon dioxide than does the burning of any other fossil fuel: about 20 per cent less, in the case of a natural 'gas vehicle. If we were able to convert all our cars to gas, in Australia alone we would knock off about two per cent from our greenhouse gas emissions. The supply of natural gas in Australia does not lend itself easily to competition. Our biggest reserves are in northern Western Australia, particularly offshore, and there'is no pipeline connecting these fields to consumers in the east. The bulk of our pipelines connect state fields to the capitals of their states. The Moomba-Sydney and Moomba-Brisbane pipelines are the only interstate natural gas pipelines currently operating in Australia, and our natural gas industry has thus evolved as a series of separate state-supplied entities, although clearly there have been a number of major privatisations. As was mentioned by the member for Swan, the pipeline that has been built from Dampier down to Bunbury-which will be a major economic boost for that route and for that region of Western Australia-has recently been privatised, with over $2.4 billion coming back to the taxpayer in Western Australia. The general trend to promote competition in the energy sector through much of the developed world commenced in the 1980s. I will give credit where credit is due: the Labor federal government introduced a national strategy for the natural gas industry in 1991, stating its position on natural gas pipelines. I would also like to note that, in the early part of the 1980s, there was another member called Anthony-in another parliament-who had a large degree of responsibility for the opening up of the North West Shelf. Congratulations to him, if he ever reads this speech. The strategy indicates that the industry perceives 'interstate trade ona free and fair basis as the key to future development of an efficient and competitive industry' and stated that 'open access to pipelines on non-discriminating commercial terms is essential for optimal interstate gas competition'. This is particularly important as we go through national competition reform. What is owing now is a $16 million carrot to the states to ensure that there is adequate competition and access----:in this case, to gas pipelines-in a whole regime of areas, whether",161,Representatives Main Commitiee
414,Mr Anthony (Richmond) (11.45 A.m.),"I certainly congratulate the Member for SwanWednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1073 it be electricity, rail or commerce. The bill is another step stemming from the initial strategy. Other parts of the strategy include state and federal privatisation of pipelines across the nation. The production of gas has always remained a private sector activity, whereas pipelines and distribution historically have had both private and state government involvement. The next step along the deregulation line is to encourage trade in natural gas, particularly across state borders. This development will take place in spite of concerns of some of the states with regard to the supply. This will be a good thing, because one of the problems that was faced recently in Queensland was that there were a number of disruptions to their electricity generators, of which I was a recipient in northern New South Wales. Having free access to both gas and, ultimately, electricity will mean that this can move throughout states and be far more efficient when there are peak loads or problems in particular regions . . Let us look at the pipeline access agreement. The Council of Australian Governments met in February1994 and agreed to the removal of legislative barriers to free trade in natural gas. The key elements of the agreement included: the removal of legislative and regulatory barriers to gas trade; the promotion of market access through a cohesive national regulatory framework; the decoupling of gas transmission and distribution or retailing activities; the development of a national pipeline grid; the removal of cross-subsidies; and the implementation of gas franchise arrangements for local distribution. The natural gas pipeline access agreement was signed by COAG on 7 November 1997'. The implementation of reforms to the gas industry should bring a range of benefits. These are quite logical, including: greater security of supply through a competitive system; increased competition between alternative fuels and, particularly, consumer price competition; lower unit gas supply costs; more cost-effective gas pricing to end users as cross-subsidies are phased out; lower greenhouse gas emissions, which I have mentioned before, and pollutants generally; and gains in microeconomic activity, through investment, higher production and enhanced employment opportunities. Certainly, those gas pipelines, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, have provided great benefits to the major metropolitan areas, as is now happening in Western Australia. The principal effect of the bill is to provide for the application of a national legislative framework for third party access to natural gas pipelines to areas within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. This is where we play our key role in this bill. The bill is eminently sensible. I was particularly pleased to see that the member for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith), who is the shadow minister for resources and energy, has for once, and I have noticed a few times, put party politics aside. He is in the chamber now, and I am glad to see that he is boning up on his speech and has agreed to support the government's legislation. . . We do need to pass legislation like this quickly so that, in the words of the Financial Review: ... the new marketplace ... is a dramatic improvement, with big price reductions for consumers, large and small, starting to flow through the system. Let us look at the future of gas. The future developments in the natural gas industry are likely to centre around the partial substitution of natural gas for liquid petroleum, increased residential reticulation and the possible development of natural gas fired power stations. 1074 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998i Gas is also big news for countries to our north in Asia, who will increasingly use gas as they double their electricity production over the next 12 years. The region's reserves are estimated to be 10 trillion cubic metres. We are seeing now a strategy in place among many of our neighbours to the north where coal is still the principle generator of electricity, followed by nuclear power. But gas is having a dramatic increase as both coal and, to a lesser extent, nuclear power start to peter out as we move into the next century. Australia, not to be outdone by our competitors, will continue to grow in this area. The Australian Gas Association estimates that gas will meet between a quarter and one-third of Australia's energy needs by the year 2030. It is quite extraordinary that there is a major shift from coal power and petroleum products to the use of gas. This will involve $6 billion of new infrastructure investment and over 11,000 kilometres of new pipeline. Imagine if we had 11,000 kilometres of new highways. It is a major investment. This is in addition to the estimated $30 billion of investment over the next decade on offshore projects, most particularly in the North West Shelf of Australia coupled with the continuing exploration programs in Bass Strait. Certainly, the North West Shelf is not only of strategic importance to Australia, but has an enormous economic boost to the region, to our national GDP and ultimately sending gas to Asia which will improve their efficiencies and, most importantly, their natural environment. In conclusion, this bill is an important and necessary step in the government's efforts to provide consumers, both domestic and business, with cheaper and cleaner energy jis we move into the 21st century. I certainly urge members on both sides of the House to support this bill. It will be good for the Australian gas industry, good for consumers-whether they be residential or industry-and most importantly, good for the environment as we use a cleaner energy source. I was on my feet in the chamber itself when I was due to speak here. . I indicate formally on behalf of the opposition that we support the Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Bill 1997. I will come to the reasons subsequently. The committee would be aware that amendments have been circulated. I have had the opportunity of an oral briefing on these amendments from the office of the Minister for Resources, Senator Parer. I put one minor caveat on them when I express our support-that is, I am not sure that the detailed industry and state consultation which occurred in the crafting of the access arrangements have taken place in respect of those amendments, which on their face seem minor. I cannot see any calise for concern as there is none expressed by any of the relevant industry groups which have been involved in the long-time crafting of these arrangements, in the consultation of the COAG agreement and in the bill itself. Nor do I see any difficulty if the various states and the territory which are affected and running complementary legislation have none. What is the thrust of this bill? The thrust of this bill is to introduce competition into our gas markets to prevent the abuse of market power or monopoly power. This is a process which we on this side support. We support it in the first instance because we started this process with the 1991 natural gas industry strategy when Alan Griffiths was minister. It was the subject of a range of important COAG decisions in 1994 and 1995 when we were in office. To its credit, the government has continued that process, culminating with a COAG decision in November 1997 which set the scene for this legislation to be introduced and complementary legislation to be introduced in the various states and one territory.",162,Representatives Main Committee
415,Mr Stephen Smith (Perth) (11.53 A.m.),"I apologise for disturbing the Speaker's list.Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1075 i The notion of competition in this area is not competition for competition's sake. What is the importance? What is sought to be achieved here is competition to ensure that the cost of"" our energy, particularly the cost of our gas, is regionally and internationally competitive. Why is that important? That is important because that gives industry the best chance of being; internationally and regionally competitive, particularly in areas of downstream processing. If you look at any resource or downstream processing project that has been successful in Australia, or is currently being proposed, there is a rule of thumb: a third of the cost of the project will go to manpower; a third of the cost of the project will go to infrastructure and other; and a third of the cost of the project will go to energy. If you can drive energy down, you have a greater chance of downstream processing and resource development projects occurring in Australia. Why is that important? Firstly, we want to tum this country of ours into a great downstream prooessing and value adding country. The great challenge for our minerals and petroleum resource industries, and for policy makers, is to ensure that the great tradition we have had in Australia of being a bulk commodity exporter turns to being a great downstream processor and adder of value. That means you need to tum iron ore into hot briquettes and/or steel, to tum nickel ore into nickel concentrate, to tum bauxite into alumina and aluminium, and down the road you go. Energy is a very important part of that process. How is the, competition introduced? The competition is introduced here by ensuring that producers of gas have fair and reasonable access on commercial terms to ,the pipeliners or the transmitters of gas. There are three parts of the gas cycle: wellhead production, transmission and distribution. There is a goodly proportion of competition at the production end, particularly offshore, largely because the granting of petroleum exploration and production licences is the' subject of competitive bidding. It has been, across the states, since our inception as a nation, invariably the case, replicated differently in the states and territories, of monopolies, public or private, over the transmission of gas. In my state of Western Australia, that monopoly transmission occurs in the form of the Dampier to Bunbury natural gas pipeline, which, as the member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) alluded to, has recently been privatised by the state government of Western Australia at what is regarded in the marketplace as a high premium asset disposal price of $2.4 billion. ,' There is a need to introduce competition into the transmission of gas so that the transmitters of gas-if they are in a market advantage or a monopoly position-are effectively compelled under these arrangements to let a range of producers have access to the pipeline at fair and transparent rates. It is interesting to note, Mr Oeputy Speaker, that when you actually address the international and regional competitiveness of our gas arrangements and you dissect the levels of competition in the wellhead production area, the transmission area and the distribution area, historically, one of the great hidden areas of mark-up here has been in the distribution and retail areas. I· think the next step of the competition) process needs to ensure that we have got plenty of competition on the distribution or the retail end. Alinta in Western Australia used to be the monopoly transmitter and the monopoly distributor. It now ceases to have that monopoly transmitter role, it no longer being the owner of the pipeline, but it still continues to have effectively a monopoly distribution and retail position. The bill reflects all those things. There are a range of technical matters which go to the COAG agreement which are best dealt with under the following heading. I will give one 1076 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 example. In this area, the principles are easy to discern but the devil is in the detail. Under the access arrangement, it is open to the states to have a state regulator in this area if they so choose and it is open to the state regulator to determine the reference tariffs on a particular pipeline, having regard to a range of areas .. One of the items that the state regulator can have regard to in the setting of the reference tariff is the disposal price of any pipeline. I raise that matter of detail in the context that in Western Australia, the Minister for Resources Development and Energy, Colin Barnett, has been implacably and violently opposed to the construction of a second pipeline in Western Australia. Most of the industry and community response to that, and the state opposition's and my response to that, has been that if the market sustains a second pipeline in Western Australia so be it. But Mr Barnett has been implacably opposed to th-t and he is doing everything he can to prevent or avoid it occurring. Why is that relevant in this context? The whole notion of this legislation is to make the cost of energy competitive. In the access agreement it is open to the state regulator to have as one of his or her reference points the disposal price of an asset. So while Mr Barnett on the one hand preens himself with an unexpected $2.4 billion disposal price, the good community of Western Australia, and industry, particularly in the south-west, need to be aware that the higher the disposal price the higher the danger that the tariff price will remain high. One needs to pay very careful attention to the detail here because one does not want to pass this legislation and discover that, via the back door, a range of non-competitive public policy approaches at .the state level, or attempts at non-competitive approaches at the company level, defeat the object of the exercise. The ACCC is the regulator in this area and I just hang one thing out for consideration. I note on the forward list of bills to be considered by the parliament during this session or this year the gas industry regulation levy bill. That bill seeks to impose, as the name suggests, a levy on the industry for the payment of the cost of the regulator. There are two points to be made on that. First, I am absolutely sure that the industry have not been subject to the same degree of consultation on the levy bill as they have with this bill, and I think it is incumbent on the government to make sure that that does occur. The second point is that, whilst industry will no doubt pay, and want to pay, an assiduous interest in the levy bill arrangements, it is of course in their own interests that the regulator in this area be properly and adequately resourced. Whilst there will be a need in this House, and in the parliament generally, to pay particular attention to the detail of that levy bill, in the end the regulator will need to be adequately resourced and I am sure that is a factor that the industry is aware of. The opposition supports this bill if only because we started the process and we would like to see it finished. With the very modest caveat that I drew in respect of the amendments, we also support the amendments. so it is important that the Commonwealth promote and develop the operation of a national market and allow open competition of this form of energy. The Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Bill 1997 will lead to more competitively priced gas. The winners will be the domestic and industrial consumers as well as the environment. Gas reform will not only promote the further development of energy infrastructure in this country, but also see the",164,Representatives Main Committee
416,Mr Marek (Capricornia) (12.03 P.m.),"Australia has abundant reserves of natural gasWednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMIITEE 1077 development of a number of new projects for downstream processing of resources, especially in areas which have'not had access to natural gas such as Far North Queensland. The industrial revolution has caused the world a number of significant problems that most of us cannot even contemplate. However, we cannot just tum away from what has been the established norm. We cannot throw out a system, overnight, that has been our established way of life. We have a responsibility to get a better balance and to gradually phase out and change our methods of generating energy. This legislation helps Australia to achieve some of those objectives. Natural gas is an environmentally friendly fuel. Over time, it will help to significantly reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions and, of course, to meet world standards. While the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) and the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) achieved a magnificent result for this country in Kyoto, we must continually look towards better options to provide this nation's energy requirements, and we must continue to develop and implement alternative, renewable energy resources. Natural gas power plants are not only cleaner; they are smaller, cheaper and more' flexible to run and can be located closer to the consumer. This, along with open competition, will provide the consumer with a cheaper form of energy all round, and that means that industrial consumers will be able to manufacture the same product more cost effecti vely, which will result in more jobs and increased economic activity in the industrial sector. The legislation will encourage competition between producers as well as between other fuel providers. The days of coal and oil as the only forms of energy are gone. That is not to say that they do not have an important role to play in today's society-far from it-but we do have to be realistic. We have to address our environmental concerns, and I believe this government is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We have to encourage other forms of competition, and most of all we must be seen to be acting in the best interests of the consumer. It is absolutely imperative that the people out there in today's society, in the greater Australian community, know that the government is putting forward the best programs and working on the best projects to give them the best results. Energy demands will double in the next 30 years, and the recent problems experienced by the electricity industry in Queensland and in Auckland, New Zealand, where consumers have been left stranded, should not be allowed to happen. With alternative providers of electricity generation, there will be the opportunity to switch to another provider so that the consumer will not be so drastically affected as we have seen recently. Uniformity is essential to implementing a national approach to access to gas pipelines. This Commonwealth legislation is critical to providing this. It will provide greater predictability in interpretation and decision making. In line with the development of the new pipeline, I think it is also imperative, if we are going to go down the road of putting all this new infrastructure in place, that we look at the ability to build other things as well. We are about to build this large pipeline, so why not also look at water infrastructure? We have a great opportunity here: the people are going to be out there putting this pipeline down, so why not put down an additional pipeline so that we can transfer water from the northern parts of the country to the more desolate areas? It would be a great initiative for federation funding or for work for the dole programs. 1078 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 Once again, I must say that the legislation is good. The gas pipeline will be a great initiative for Australia but, while we are doing that, let us have a look at spending a few extra dollars and possibly bringing some water down for the Central Queensland regions as well. thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Bill 1997. The bill is essentially for the establishment of the national third party gas pipeline access regime agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments on 7 November 1997. The regime agreed to by COAG will pave the way for the development of an integrated natural gas market, with gas freely traded across state and territory boundaries through an interconnected pipeline grid. There will be competition between producers of gas and between retailers across a pipeline network where owners wiII be permitted a fair return and incentives to grow the market for gas. The regime will replicate the outcomes of a competitive market in the monopoly pipeline business by establishing a transparent, industry-specific third party access framework, thereby facilitating increased competition in the production and retail ends of the natural gas sector. Increased competition in the gas sector will lead to considerable economic and environmental benefits for all Australians. By making gas carriage arrangements transparent and gas markets contestable, competition will encourage lower delivered gas prices and enhance demand for this energy source, as well as increase activity in exploration and development and pipeline construction to service this demand. To facilitate the national coverage of the regime, this bill will allow the use of national bodies, ensure the regime applies to offshore waters and to relevant external territories, and clear the way for the states to apply the regime to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline. The agreement to use the ACCC as. the regulator for transmission pipelines in all jurisdictions that are likely to be covered by the interconnected eastern pipeline network has been a victory for common sense. With all jurisdictions other than Western Australia using the ACCC, there is the potential for a strong level of consistency in the interpretation of the gas access code, which will facilitate the development of a national market without artificial barriers. The national regime reflects a fine balance of interests across all nine jurisdictions, gas producers, pipeliners and gas users. It enjoys broad based support from all these competing interests. As such, it is a fine example of what can be achieved when diverse interests are brought together in a process of genuine consultation to achieve, in the interests of all Australians, outcomes laid down by this government.

Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997 and it provides for amendments to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 in order to rectify a number of problems identified in the original implementation of that act. Very briefly, a key element of the amending bill is the provision to automate the annual permit renewal process of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act. This will simplify the compliance obligations for each company or organisation requiring a permit but maintain the annual reporting cycle required to fulfil Australia's obligations under the chemical weapons convention. The amending bill refines the secrecy provisions of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act, streamlines some of the administrative procedures and provides for applications, notices or reports to be made by way of electronic lodgement. The amending bill also clarifies some outstanding issues to be implemented through regulation, including a more precise definition of the terms 'production', 'processing' and 'consumption'.

420,Mr Brereton (Kingsford,"Smith) (12.13 p.m.)-This bill is entitled the Chemical1080 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 The amendments are uncontroversial and Labor supports the bill, consistent with our strong record of support for international efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction-nuclear, chemical and biological weapons-and ballistic missiles capable of delivering such weapons. Australia's leading role in the negotiation of the chemical weapons convention was one of the foreign policy highlights of the former Labor government The convention, which entered into force on 29 April last year, is the first comprehensively verifiable multilateral treaty which bans an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. It prohibits all aspects of chemical weapon development-production, acquisition, possession, transfer and use-and provides for the destruction of existing stockpiles and production facilities. It sets fundamental benchmarks in the field of verification, through its provision for declarations and on-site inspections. Australia has given strong support to the chemical weapons convention b!!cause this treaty directly affects our national security. The convention holds the promise of achieving the abolition for all time of a class of weapon which has killed tens of thousands of people in this century. The chemical weapons convention also represents the best means of preventing the spread of chemical weapons to our region and other parts of the world where Australia has a significant interest in the maintenance of peace and security. The chemical weapons convention is only one part of international efforts to address the problems of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Under Labor, Australia made significant contributions to these efforts, negotiating the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty; convening the Australia Group on chemical weapons; working hard to secure the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and to strengthen the International Atomic Agency safeguards; making significant contributions to the negotiation of the comprehensive test ban treaty and, of course, establishing the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. This is a record of which Labor is justifiably proud and it is a tradition that we are determined to continue, both in the national interest and to advance the common good. We will do so on returning to office. This is a field of diplomatic activity which enjoys broadly bipartisan support, and the grave dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction have been highlighted by the recent crises over UN inspections in Iraq. For my part, I readily acknowledge the Howard government's contribution to the conclusion of the comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations and the government's general support for non-proliferation objectives. Regrettably, the government's work in relation to the CTBT-the comprehensive test ban treaty-has not been matched by any serious effort to promote the report of the Canberra Commission as a framework for forwarding thinking on disarmament and non-proliferation. This failure has involved, I must say, a significant lost opportunity for Australia to push the envelope in advancing disarmament an.i non-proliferation. Without the efforts of the middle powers, including Australia, in applying intellectual and diplomatic resources to move the agenda forward, discussions and negotiations in the United Nations all too often get bogged down in ritual confrontation between the nuclear weapon states, on the one hand, and the nonaligned movement, on the other. That said, I take this opportunity to welcome the government's recent commitment to continuing Australia's work on the negotiation of averification protocol to the biological weapons convention. This is an important foreign policy objective and a major contribution Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1081 to international security: as honourable members should be aware, biological weapons can be as devastating as nuclear weapons. In recent weeks we have heard much about Iraq's biological weapons program. The principal agent developed and produced by Iraq, indeed loaded into ballistic missile warheads, was anthrax. This is a comparatively cheap, low technology weapon of mass destruction. It does not require any large infrastructure or any great investment. Nor is it a new weapon. On the contrary, it is technology more than half a century old; the United Kingdom first developed anthrax as a possible biological weapon during the Second World War. But the potential effect of anthrax is still diabolical. As has been pointed out in recent weeks, one single ounce of anthrax in the air conditioning system of a sports stadium could infect tens of thousands of people, with very high rates of fatalities. Iraq possessed, at one time, weaponised anthrax sufficient, in theory, to kill the entire population of the world several times over. Beyond this lie very real new dangers arising from rapid advances that are taking place in the field of biotechnology, in particular genetic manipulation of disease organisms. These developments, by-products of legitimate scientific inquiry, present frightening new possibilities for biological weapons, such as genetically engineered plague, resistant to known antibiotics. Biological agents have been called the poor man's atomic bomb. They have also been recently identified as the weapon of the 21st century and they pose a threat equal to that of nuclear weapons. This is an issue that the international community must address through prevention rather than cure. For more than a quarter of a century, in the form of the biological weapons convention, there has been an emphatic international prohibition on the development, production and stockpiling of biological weapons. Despite this prohibition, at least two states continue to engage in the development of such weapons: Iraq and, less well-known but equally significantly, the former Soviet Union. We have also seen some evidence of terrorist interest in the use of biological weapons in Japan and the United States. All this underlines the necessity for intensifying current negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and for putting in place a stringent verification regime which will ensure that the world is free from the threat of biological weapons . . I note in this regard that the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) has said that the government hopes that negotiations on a verification protocol to the biological weapons convention would be completed by the end of this year. If the track record of the Conference on Disarmament is any guide, this may prove to be somewhat optimistic, but I certainly share his desire for the earliest possible conclusion of negotiations on a protocol that will provide an effective verification regime comparable to that established by the chemical weapons convention. I look forward to the day when this parliament will give consideration to legislation implementing Australia's obligations arising from such a protocol as another vital step in making the world safe from these horrific weapons. . were identified with the principal act, especially during initial implementation, and so amendments have been made to the principal act to both rectify those problems and refine the administration. Small businesses in. my electorate constantly complain to me about the regulation of their businesses. They are bedevilled by regulation, and I am pleased to see that this bill does address some of the regulatory problems that arise.",169,Representatives Main Committee
421,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (12.23 P.m.),"This bill has come about because problems1082 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 . The problems that have been identified include: a potential for non-compliance with permit· provisions of the act where activities of a company fluctuate around permit thresholds; permit renewal provisions provide for unnecessarily complex compliance and administration requirements; inconsistency and inflexibility in the operation of certain procedures in the act. for gathering information required for declarations undyr the convention, and an unnecessary requirement for all notifiers to provide reports, so that reports may not be required from certain classes of notifiers and, hence, there is potential for non-compliance with permit transfer i provisions. Basically, the bill addresses the problems by improving the operation of the .act based on the experience that has already been gleaned from its operation to date, and simplifying administration surrounding the act so as to ultimately and more effectively improve, Australia's obligations under the convention. In recent times-probably for 15 or so years-it is fair to say that arguably many , conventions have been signed without proper consideration. I say that of the period preceding, 30 May 1996. There was an inordinate rush, in my view, to sign international treaties, frequently without the slightest idea of the effect of those treaties both on Australian political life arid on Australian legal and common law life as a result of the implications at law of the signing of those treaties. Obviously the Commonwealth has a power under section 51 of the constitution to sign treaties. The executive has done that for many years-since we have become a federation, indeed-but there have been a great plethora of those treaties in more recent times. To its great credit, the government established the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on 30 May 1996, the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) having announced to the parliament that this would occur, along with announcements in relation to more consultation at COAG level and also the establishment of a Treaties Council, involving the Prime Minister( Mr Howard), the premiers, and the chief ministers of the territories, which would meet at least once a year. There needs to be care in relation to treaties. We have in recent times heard criticism of the MAl, and we have the example of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which created great controversy in the period when it was signed. The impact on Australian political and legal life from the signing of these treaties was never envisaged by our founding fathers. But its impact has been clearly enunciated in the High Court decision of Teoh and the Minister for Immigration. Essentially, the legal principle is stated as this: Although a Convention ratified by Australia does not become part of Australian law unless its provisions have been validly incorporated into municipal law by statute, the ratification was an adequate foundation for a legitimate expectation, absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary, that administrative decision-makers would act conformably with the Convention. It is not necessarily that a person seeking to set up such a legitimate expectation be aware of the Convention or personally entertain the expectation. The judges went on to say: But the fact that the convention has not yet incorporated into Australian law does not mean that its , ratification holds no significance for Australian law ... This is important in relation to interpretationWhere a statute or subordinate legislation is ambiguous, the court should favour that construction which accords with Australia's obligation under a treaty . . . That, of course, is an established principle of international law. So there is a significant legal outcome and a significant political outcome, because our domestic situation can be undermined by the existence of the supervision, or the purview perhaps is the best way to put it, of an Wednesday; 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1083 outside body, such as a United Nations committee, which can look at whether Australia is performing to its expectations, given its interpretation of the treaty. That is a reason we had a case like Teoh, which drew on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and, very recently, the decision fn Lam and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, a single judge decision. Both cases related to illegal immigrants who were trafficking in hard drugs, such as heroin. In the recent case of Lam, there was almost 1Y2 kilograms of heroin, with an estimated street value of $3 million, and Mr Justice Sackville drew on the convention, and also Teoh' s case, to permit this illegal immigrant to stay in the country. Those sorts of impacts must be very carefully considered when we think about international conventions. I should say that the chemical weapons convention, from which the principal act and the legislation derived, was ratified by Australia in May 1994. It is the first comprehensively multilateral treaty that bans an entire class of weapons. It prohibits all aspects of weapons development, including production, acquisition, possessing, transfer and use, et cetera, and also provides for the destruction of any existing stocks and so forth. The Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer), in his press release of 30 April 1997, said: Australia has taken a close interest in the CWC because this treaty directly affects our national security. The Convention promises the abolition for all time of a weapon of mass destruction which has killed tens of thousands of people this century, including many Australians who were the victims of these weapons in World War I. The CWCaiso represents the best means of preventing the spread of chemical weapons to our region. He went on to talk about the speed at which the convention has gained support. I am pleased to say that, in my view, the minister's department has acted at all times with due probity in relation to this particular matter. I also say that it is a source of great comfort both to service and to former service personnel in my own electorate. Many families with people in the services and also ex-service people that have suffered in the past from chemical weapons accept that this sort of convention is important in regulating what are diabolical weapons that really have no place in any civilised world. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also referred to a recent initiative in a press release of 2 March 1998 in relation to biological weapons. I commend him also in relation to that. The initiative aimed at fast-tracking negotiations on a verification system for a biological weapons convention, and various other matters. There is certainly a determination on the part of the government to be an innovator in this area. It has in the past encouraged countries-in particular, I understand, the United States-ultimately to become a party to this. The nature of treaties frequently means that a country such as Australia, with an impeccable human rights record and a long history of determined commitment to democracy, seems at times to be bearing unnecessary burdens, it could be said. And some people do say that, because Australia is such a good citizen and, of course, we do not produce weapons of the type that this convention seeks to eliminate. It is a pity in some ways: all who tend to sign these things could arguably be said to be good citizens, while those who do not sign are not. Iraq is one well-known offender that has neither signed nor ratified the convention. Under the cease-fire arrangements at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq was required to become a state party to the biological weapons convention-which it did. However, as the negotiations for this particular convention had not at that stage been completed and the convention obviously had not been finalised, no provision for Iraqi adherence to the convention was included. Cease-fire arrangements themselves did require Iraq to get rid of its chemical 1084 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 weapons stocks and production equipment-hence the follow-up to that with UNSCOM, and the very near outbreak of war in that area again, as a result of the recalcitrance of this international outlaw in Iraq. Of course, there are a few others around that deserve similar condemnation, and one suspects North Korea might be one of them. However, turning to the provisions of the bill itself, the effect of item 4, for example, is to enable the electronic lodgement of permit applications. Another provision provides for automatic renewal of permits up to a maximum of four times, making one permit valid for five years and so on, and that has been very well received in terms of trying to streamline the process for businesses who are in the business of making chemicals-not for the purposes of war of course; they are frequently for innocent purposes. We have a very large herbicide and insecticide industry for our farming and primary productions areas and, obviously, there are compliance factors to consider there. The minister said that the convention is a complex document; there are a lot of technical issues involved. It is true to say that the primary organisation to deal with this-the international organisation-was the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons, OPCW. It came into being with the treaty itself and, of course, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we have another section to deal with that. The ultimate outcome of all of this is that we have an important convention here in place. We are trying to streamline the principal act to make it more user-friendly in the Australian context, but at the same time adhering to our international obligations under what is a very serious and significant treaty, one that, I think, all Australians would be proud to support the government on. (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997, seeks, as has been indicated by other speakers, to improve the administration of the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Act which implements Australia's obligations under the chemical weapons convention. As the shadow minister for foreign affairs indicated, the opposition fully supports those steps. I would say-this wanoted, I think, in the minister's second reading speech-that something like 100 Australian companies and organisations may be directly affected by the routine requirements of the legislation and, as the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith) indicated, the primary intention of the legislation is to iron out bugs and issues that arise from the implementation of the obligations with respect to those companies. I did arrange, over recent days, for a member of my staff to ring a number of chemical companies just to check what their reaction to the particular legislation was. I would not claim that the survey was done with any great degree of scientific precision, but it did concern me that a number of companies were contacted at relatively senior levels and the level of knowledge and information with respec( to the legislation is particularly poor. The companies that were contacted include Wesfarmers in WA, Allbright and Wilson, Orica, which of course is the new name for ICI, and Du Pont. Each of those companies, as I understand it, is heavily involved in the chemical industry. One would have expected a higher degree of awareness of this legislation and its implications. That did not seem to me to be the finding of my staff member. It would seem to me that, on that basis, there is a significant educational job still in front of the government in relation to this matter. Certainly-and it is probably not fair to refer particular comments to particular companiesthere was some awareness on the part of at least one of them, of the benefits of the electronic",171,Representatives Main Committee

Others 'vaguely remembered' -these are my staff member's quotes-some information being circulated about the bill but could not remember any problems or issues with it; and others said that they had been involved with the original bill but were not sure whether anything had been circulated since, and so on. I am not, as I indicated a moment ago, claiming that my officer's telephone around was, in any sense, a properly conducted survey. But it was sufficiently alarming to want to inform the parliament and suggest that the appropriate officials might have a close look at whether the level of communication to the chemical industry is in fact what it ought to be. As the member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Brereton) indicated, Australia does have a proud record in relation to playing outside its league-well above its league; well above its weightin terms of the international community and efforts with respect to disarmament issues. This chemical weapons convention is an important part of that. He referred to Australia's role in relation to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the lead that the former government took with the Canberra Commission. We are all aware of the role that.Australia has played with respect to UNSCOM. It is worth noting, that an· Australian, Dr Gee,"" was appointed deputy director of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Other speakers have not referred to the role played by the former foreign minister in the International Court of Justice with respect to testing the legality of nuclear weapons of mass destruction. I think it is very important to take occasions like this as an opportunity to not rest on our laurels. Australia does have the capacity to play well above its weight because of its reputation in this area and those opportunities ought to be vigorously pursued. It is important, in the context of nuclear weaponry, for Australia to continue to exercise its leverage on the nuclear powers, particularly the United States and Russia, with respect to realistically building the START III process-the strategic arms reduction talks. It is important for Australia to be considering what role it might play in matters relating to the production and stockpiling of fissile material, with the prospect of a role where some sort of international agreement can be produced with relation to the way in which fissile material-plutonium and highly enriched uranium-has significant limitations put on its production or stockpile. That is the next important issue that needs to be taken in taking forward the arms control process with respect to nuclear weapons. Other speakers have spoken about the horror of biological weapons and the need for beefing up the biological weapons convention and perhaps building on some of the achievements with respect to the chemical weapons convention in that area. As I understand it, there is no developed verification regime with respect to the biological weapons convention. There is no effective secretariat. In fact, there may be no secretariat at all operating with respect to the international convention on biological weapons and those vital tasks to build on the achievements that have been made with the chemical weapons area into an area which is equally, if not more, frightening. As the member for Kingsford-Smith indicated, the advances in biology are such that the capacity of those weapons in terms of the horror they can generate are magnified and need to be taken into consideration. We are not only talking here about nation states having access to these sorts of weapons. The capacity of terrorist organisations and even criminal organisations to obtain access to these technologies is very frightening. One only has to remember the experience with the Aum Shinri Kyo sect in Japan that launched an attack on 1086 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 the Tokyo subway using sarin gas-a chemical weapon. I understand that sect had some experience with biological agents as well. One only has to note those sorts of circumstances to understand the importance of a country like Australia actively taking forward a role with relation to weapons of mass destruction. I would argue it is not only in relation to weapons of mass destruction that Australia ought to be playing a role. The world is faced with a rising tide of small arms. Whilst those small arms in themselves, and in individual circumstances, do not do the damage of weapons of mass destruction, nonetheless they arta massive problem. Australia, through the approach it has taken on the issue of landmines, has shown a way in which somewhat smaller scale weapons than th03e of mass destruction can be addressed effectively in the international community. I would suggest that, in relation to small arms, there are important steps that need to be taken. It is not just rogue operators that are the difficulty. Nation states, particularly the larger ones of Russia and the United States, do have particular problems in relation to the supply and availability of the huge tide of small arms that are available. In 1997, I am advised that something like $3 billion in small arms and light weapons were shipped across international boundaries. These weapons are relatively affordable. They do not require complex technology. An AK47, for example, has only got something like 16 moving parts as compared to a jet fighter with something like 60,000 small components. We are not talking about high levels of technical sophistication being required here. I understand there are something like 300 companies in the world that manufacture small arms for the international market so we are talking about a huge problem. If one looks at the effect of the flood of small arms, in a country like Albania when last year there was a breakdown in internal security something like 800,000 small arms were knocked off from weapons depots. We look in horror at the moment at press reports of the possibility of a further break-out of fighting and war in the Balkans. One would suggest that the availability of small arms from Albania may have no small part in those circumstances as they evolve. One is aware of the huge volume of arms that were supplied to the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan in the fight there against the former Soviet Union and subsequently in the civil war. Something like $6 billion to $9 billion worth of military materiel was apparently supplied. It is widely seen that those small arms are now popping up all over the world in countries like Bosnia, Algeria and Sri Lanka. We are not talking here just about unsophisticated small arms; we are talking about things like Stinger surface to air missiles. The breakdown of the military in the former Soviet Union where the military is regarded as almost at starvation level has created a circumstance where large stockpiles of materiel can in fact come onto the market. There is an important set of problems here that Australia ought to be at the forefront of bringing forward for discussion in the international community. The former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, established a panel of government experts on small arms in 1992. There needs to be some transparency in relation to small arms trade. In 1993, the United Nations established a register of conventional arms which sought to establish a register of seven types of major weapon systems and apparently an increasing number of governments have been participating in that. There have been suggestions about regional registries of national production and stockpiling and requirements to prenotify for the transfer of small arms across international boundaries. The Organisation of American States apparently has indicated a view on that, as has ASEAN in our own region. That type of transparency does create the possibility of building further. Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1087 For example, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and former President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias Sanchez, has recently proposed a system whereby small arms are not available by international convention to governments that fail human rights standards, that do not respect international arms embargoes and that do not participate in UN arms registers. I think that these are matters the Australian government could well consider and take forward in terms of the credibility this country has in this area. Australia needs to be at the forefront of improving customs arrangements throughout the world to limit the transfer of small arms. We also need to address the very tough question of the production of objectionable types of small arms. As I have indicated, Australia has played its role, along with countries like Canada and Britain, in the very important area of landmines. I think there is a whole range of areas-assault rifles and various types of automatic and semi-automatic weaponry-that the international community does need to address in order to take forward and take seriously, within the international citizenship, some obligations for doing something, not only with respect to weapons of mass destruction as this legislation does, but with respect to the problems that are created for the world by this huge volume of trade in relation to small arms. me make a couple of comments on three items raised by those opposite. The first item relates to the BWC protocol, the biological weapons convention protocol. The government supports what those opposite and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Brereton) had to say previously on this and we look forward, in due course, to having a look at the detail of that. On the second item, the comprehensive test ban treaty, I disagree with the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith that this government has done nothing. There are substantial initiatives going on in the CTBT office in Vienna and, having been there quite recently, I can attest to that. I feel sure that we will see further progress, albeit with some difficulty in some areas, in the coming months and years. On the third item of antipersonnellandmines, can I say to the honourable member opposite that the issues of the transfer of landmines and the cut-off for fissile material are both now being pursued through the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Just after I left Geneva, quite recently, those issues were raised by our ambassador at the opening of the CD session and were reiterated a few weeks later by the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer). I can assure the opposition that all of these issues are being taken very seriously and are being pursued by the present government. The legislation we have before us is unexceptional, and I do not intend to go into the detail of the amendments to the 1994 legislation other than to say that the chemical weapons convention had a 20-year gestation period. It did not come easily: there was the signature in 1993; the ratification by Australia in 1994, as the sixth nation to do so; and, domestically, the development of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. From that act, some amendments were required to the customs regulations in terms of import and export arrangements. Then, of course, there was the coming into force of the chemical weapons convention, the CWC, in April 1997. So it took almost three years from our ratification to the coming into force, and the rules under the convention were that it be 180 days after the ratification by 65 members. So it took a long time-as, indeed, some of these conventions do. The development of the 1994 legislati9n and the amendment in this legislation to that principal act have led to the formation of the CWC office in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and I understand we have got one or two officials here. I take the opportunity to",174,Representatives Main Committee
423,Mr Taylor (Groom) (12.49 P.m.),"BeforeI address the specifics of this legislation, let1088 MAIN eOMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 March 1998 acknowledge what they have done in relation to the administration of this. I had my office and the Parliamentary Library. pull out from the home page some of the very substantial information that is provided to the industry and I give the ewe office credit for the. substantial efforts that they have gone to. Although, as previous speakers have said, Australia has no weapons or facilities which have to be destroyed under this convention, there is substantial work to be done in relation to industry. It is interesting that the ewe office surveyed about 3,000 companies of which about 100 declared activities. At the moment, as I understand it, about 20 hold permits under the 1994 legislation, and, therefore, under the 1998 legislation as undoubtedly it will be. In the process there were five trial inspections. The point to make about that for Australian industry is that there was no disruption to production and no undue problems for the management in some of those companies. I make the point that we should give full credit to the DFAT officials who have the task of implementing the 1994 legislation and for the further improvements to that legislation as the result of the amendments in this bill. I want to take the opportunity in the very short time available to me to pay tribute to one or two other people. In the political processes, it is very difficult at times to give credit where credit is due when it happens to be on the other side of the House, but I am going to take this opportunity this afternoon to acknowledge the efforts of the previous minister for foreign affairs, now the member for Holt( Mr Gareth Evans). If Senator Evans, as he was at time, is to be remembered for one thing in terms of his efforts as foreign minister, it is the effort that he put into the chemical weapons convention. He did a lot of good work in terms of nuclear non-proliferation and the NPT extension, et cetera, and I think we should pay tribute to him today for the effort that went into it. I know.it seems to be a day for singling out people in DFAT, but there are one or two now senior officials in that department who were very heavily involved in the ewe, and I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge them. Kym Jones and John Dauth, both of whom are now deputy secretaries, played a very large part in it. Paul O'Sullivan, who is now the deputy to Andrew Peacock in Washington, was very heavily involved as the ambassador in Geneva in the conference on disarmament-and of course eD played the leading role in the development of the ewe. Finally, I want to acknowledge the part played by Richard Butler. Richard Butler was heavily involved in the early days, and it is ironic that we now see him heavily involved in UNSeOM and all that goes with the problems in Iraq. One comment that my colleague the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith) made was that we are dealing in this legislation with an inhumane weapon, but his word was a 'diabolical' weapon, and I think there is no other word for it. These ew and BW agents are diabolical weapons. We should not back away from that, and we should do everything to rid the world of those particular scourges. I referred back to the comments by the then Senator Evans, and I turned up the Hansard in 1994 dealing with the then 1993 prohibition bill, which was translated into the 1994 act. It is worth finishing my contribution to this debate by quoting a short extract from the end of his speech. He states: Some questions have been asked about the likely efficacy of the verification process in the bill. I simply want to say that that was obviously the crucial and difficult issue that made the negotiations so long and difficult. I genuinely believe that we now have in the convention a workable regime-not only the best that could be negotiated, but a genuinely good regime that will be workable in practice and one which will ensure that we succeed in our objective ultimately of removing altogether from this planet the Wednesday, 11 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1089 possession as well as the use of this particularly horrific brand of weapon of mass destruction. It had to be a good regime because no-one had been in any doubt about the p-culiarly horrifying character of this weapon and, particularly in the light of the awful experience in the Iran-Iraq war in recent times, building on our earlier historical experience, the awful evidence of just how terrible a weapon it is. How ironic those comments are in the light of what has happened in recent months in terms of Iraq and the extent to which Saddam Hussein has poked his tongue at the rest of the world in terms of the potential threat of that country. I only hope, as indeed everybody in this country and everybody around the world should hope, that Secretary-General Annan's approach is accepted, not just as a matter of rhetoric but as a matter of fact that the UNSCOM inspections will be allowed to go ahead unimpeded. My understanding is that the initial inspections have proceeded reasonably well, but at the same time we should maintain the diplomatic pressure on Saddam-not the people of Iraq, but on Saddam himself-and we should continue to do this until such time as we are able to rid the world of both CW and BW agents. I would like to finish my contribution at that point, and I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.01 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: I Flood Mitigation Program The priority urban flood mitigation projects that received funding in 1996-97 are: (Question No. 2149) South Grafton Mr Lee asked the Minister for Transport Fairy Creek, Wollongong and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 August 1997: Darling Mills Creek, Parramatta (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1971, Gosford (Hansard, 25 August 1997, page 6794), did the Government reduce federal assistance for flood Smith's Creek, Campbelltown mitigation after the 1996 election.
