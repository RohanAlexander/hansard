Telstra, unfortunately, has made a decision to close this centre. It is a devastating decision. With the support of the workers, their unions, their families and the local community I am seeking to reverse that decision. We want to convince Telstra to stay in Footscray and to continue to provide local jobs to our region. Those jobs are so scarce and so valued. Each and every job in Footscray matters. The statistics tell us that in Gellibrand we have 11.8 per cent unemployment, nearly twice the national average of 7.4 per cent, and over 28 per cent of our young people unemployed. These shameful percentages are not just abstract figures. These figures represent 7,273 people and their families who are desperately seeking work and hoping to build better lives. They are our neighbours, our families and our friends. We cannot afford to lose any more jobs and add some more families to this long list. In pleading with Telstra to reconsider its decision, I am arguing for those 100 jobs to stay in Footscray. In addition to the jobs that go directly from Telstra, I am concerned about the wider impact on our region as a whole. Telstra needs to understand that its decision to take 100 jobs out of Footscray has an impact on every local sandwich shop, milk bar and supermarket currently used by those employees. I have written today to Telstra asking them to take account of the high unemployment in our region and urging them to reconsider their decision. I have also reminded them of Footscray's advantages. We are so close to the CBD, yet costs are still reasonable, space generous and access comfortable. Remember that, when I write to Telstra, I am not writing to any old business. It is not a family business or a multinational or even a chain store. Telstra is different. It should be different because it plays a vital role in our community. We are all its customers; we are all still its owners. Due to this, we expect Telstra to be aware about our region and to understand why we want it to stay in Footscray. Telstra needs to have a community view, not just a business view about the decisions it makes. We simply cannot afford to lose these jobs from Footscray. I urge Telstra to look at our region, its needs and its advantages, and to review its decision-please stay in Footscray.

I was delighted that this was the case as I thought it particularly apt in the International Year of Older Persons that the focus of the forum be on the housing needs of these special people in our community. The electorate of McPherson has long been a haven for retirees with many people attracted to the coastal strip and the hinterland suburbs because of the area's relaxed lifestyle and warm climate. In my electorate, one in every five persons is aged over 65 and this presents a real challenge to developers, government planners and service providers. These organisations need to ensure that this very large percentage of the population is well catered for with the design and construction of suitable housing and service facilities. In my view, one of the most serious issues facing housing planners, particularly in respect of older Australians, is loneliness. This very serious problem was highlighted recently on the Gold Coast with regard to elderly persons living in high-rise apartments. The Gold Coast Housing Network's assessment report mentioned that a significant proportion of the population aged over 55 years of age has moved to the coast and has no extended family living locally, hence the increase in loneliness. The Gold Coast City Council's health plan identified many concerns for the elderly and included a lack of public housing, afford ability of all types of housing, the design and adaptability of buildings, the inflexibility of housing policies for mixed uses, and the problems of homelessness. These pertinent points were discussed at the forum in detail and I understand recommendations will be made to relevant authorities on the outcomes. I was also honoured to present the Universal Design Awards in various design categories and I would like to again congratulate Lifecycle Homes and Brent Fletcher on their two awards, including the supreme award, Lyn Easton and Cecilia Folkes on their encouragement awards, and all the other participants. In closing, I would like once again to congratulate Tracey Douglas and the Gold Coast Housing Network for recognising the need to draw together information on housing and for focusing on developing a more integrated approach to housing; and the Gold Coast City Council, particularly for its special regard for the aged. Veterans: Malayan Emergency deplorable situation, which I know a number of members of this House are aware of, confronting a group of returned Australian servicemen. The group to which I refer are former naval personnel who served during the Malayan Emergency from 1955 to 1960. These veterans have suffered a form of discrimination which brings no credit to previous governments and serves as an embarrassment to this government. For more than 40 years these veterans have been denied medals as well as other benefits for their services. Their brothers in arms in the Army and Air Force qualified for the following after being in the combat zone for one day: the General Service Medal with Malaya clasp; the return from active service badge; full repatriation benefits, including service pension at",150,Representatives Main Committee
384,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.45 A.m.),"I rise today to draw attention again to the4926 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 age 60; and listing of casualties on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial. Naval veterans, however, even if they were involved in bombardments or other actions, never qualified for these benefits. These old sailors, from admirals to seamen gunners, are now passing around the hat to raise funds so they might take their case to the Federal Court. Apart from the gross injustice of their predicament, how humiliating that experience must be for them. The Labor Party may have been remiss in the past, but anyone who consults the policies we took to the last election on this issue will know we are at least not afraid of admitting our mistakes, and rectifying them. This government can claim no such thing. Indeed, it appears to be paralysed by a fear of admitting the error of its previous ways to this group of veterans. It appears to have adopted an attitude of apathy, even contempt, and perhaps rudeness, in its dealings with them. It is surprising that the Prime Minister himself appears to have let these veterans down. On5 September 1997, retired Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Peek wrote to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister paid the admiral the courtesy of a response on 22 February 1998, but the ViceAdmiral obviously felt that he had not got a proper response and so he wrote back to the Prime Minister a fortnight later in a letter dated 9 March 1998. To this day he has not got a response. I would like to tell you what the Prime Minister's reply was but, as of last week, over a year later, the Prime Minister was yet to reply. It appears now that Major General Dunn has hinted at a Senate estimates hearing that the government may review the issue of naval veterans' medals and entitlements during the Malayan Emergency. Vice-Admiral Peek arid his former shipmates want to know if the inquiry has actually begun. It should take submissions from interested parties, be public and open, and include at least one service veteran on the board of inquiry. It is time this government took action. It is not good enough to point to the failures of previous governments; it is time to stop delaying. The longer we wait, the more veterans go to their graves unappreciated, resentful of their country and disbelieving of its ingratitude. We all sent them there and, as a country, we owe them. We should act, and act now. Rebuilding the Inland been entitled 'Rebuilding the inland' was held in Julia Creek last Friday afternoon, and it was attended by 60 to 70 local residents. A number of issues were raised, one being the issue of the local kindergarten. That may seem a small thing, but kindergartens have a series of rules, some of which kindergartens in the outback cannot possibly comply with. As a result, the continued existence of the kindergarten is placed in real jeopardy. To quote but one small example, there must be a toilet upstairs and downstairs. This sounds reasonable except when one realises that upstairs is 18 inches above downstairs at Julia Creek. These rules may be reasonable rules in a city, but most unreasonable in a small country town. The second issue raised was the issue of Telecom services. It was asserted at the meeting that services being proposed for inland Australia were very substandard. The meeting drew attention to the fact that Toorak, the only research station in north Queensland, off the coast, had 22 employees some seven or eight years ago whereas today it has only two employees and is about to be virtually closed down.",151,Representatives Main Committee

This, plus other railway cutbacks, most certainly cost this small town some 60-odd jobs. The issue of roads was raised at very great length and the Deputy Mayor, John Stevens, said that if we were allocated the maintenance of the roads in the Julia Creek area alone, we would go from a work force of 23 to 47, and that would be an extra 24 jobs in the town of Julia Creek. However, the Flinders Highway was completed nearly 30 years ago and the beef road scheme north from Julia Creek was completed nearly 30 years ago. As everyone in this House would know, roads last for only 30 years-they have to be rebuilt every 30 years-so all of those roads need reconstruction. There is absolutely no money for that road reconstruction. If we allocated 2c a litre of the current taxation regime of 36c a litre to roads and to shires of that type and specifically designated that money for that area so that people in that community could employ people to repair and rebuild that road system, then this would mean some 30 jobs in Julia Creek. So if Toorak was simply re-established as it was there for some 30 years, and the road system was given a fair go-and these areas were given a fair go-then that would be 60 jobs in itself. (Time expired) Insurance Industry: Inquiry by Cyclone Vance. We had the usual statements in the House. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the local member visited the area. Those who were most slow to visit the area were the insurance assessors. Now we add the name of Exmouth to Wollongong, Katherine, Townsville and Coffs Harbour where local people, after going through a harrowing experience, realise that the insurance premiums they had paid so faithfully for so long did not cover them in their time of need. Over the past few months, monitoring the performance of insurance company reaction to disasters has occupied a considerable amount of my time. This came about after Wollongong was struck by a freak storm which devastated the northern suburbs on l,August 1998. Both the member for Cunningham and I have been extremely critical or the performance of insurance companies. Insurance companies tried and, in the main, failed to escape their legal and moral responsibilities in assessing claims for damage and then settling claims by paying up. InW ollongong, insurance companies were subject to a barrage of protest by the Illawarra community through the media, in public protests and even in their branch offices. In fact, one of the companies that has not paid up, QBE, as an act of spite, yesterday closed its W ollongong office, putting some 30 people out of a job. One by one, the stubbornness and belligerence of the insurance companies were tested by public demands, and one by one insurance companies caved in to the pressure. One of the reasons that they have caved into the pressure is that the Illawarra Mercury daily publishes a file of shame on those insurance companies not paying up, trying to shame them into doing so. Early this week, I issued a media -statement attacking the insurance companies over their performance at Exmouth. I said that the insurance companies had learnt nothing from testing the limits of public patience in their response to natural disasters. I was amazed that, after such a serious cyclone, insurance companies had still to ensure that assessors were on the ground and ready to assist victims in making their claims, assess damage and provide financial assistance to help those people get on with their lives as quickly as possible.

386,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (9.51 A.m.),"Exmouth in Western Australia was recently devastated4928 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 slow to send out notices, but they are very slow to pay up. The statements were published in the Illawarra Mercury and then I received a three-page fax from the insurance companies attempting to explain why they are reacting so slowly and asking for patience. What they were saying is that they had to assess these claims. It is time the government responded positively to the proposal put by the member for Cunningham and me that a full public inquiry be held into the insurance industry. I appreciate the Insurance Council of Australia responding to my claim so promptly, but I would be more impressed if the insurance companies concerned themselves more with promptly dealing with victims, their families and helping rebuild shattered communities. (Time expired) Democracy: Community Participation to all parliamentarians-or it certainly should be. The topic is the active interest shown by our community and its participation in the Australian democratic process. I, and many of my colleagues on both sides of the House, hbst visits to Parliament House by schools from our respective electorates. These young people tour the House, hear some of the history of parliament, watch question time, speak with their local members and, most importantly, eat lunch in one of the facilities of the House; Usually, such a visit is part of a structured program of civics. education, which forms a normal sector of their primary school education. In my day, the government was well removed from our schooling, except that it provided the free milk that we had to drink-like it or not-at morning recess. As a consequence, many people who went through their early schooling during the 1960s or earlier do not have much of a handle on what government does, except that it interferes in people's lives and charges them exorbitant taxes. Of course, we know that nothing could be further from the truth! But how do we get our message across and why should we bother? I will take the second point first: why should we bother? If we do not bother, it might be easier to govern as we please, rather dIan as directed by the people. One could say that it might even have been to the benefit of successive governments to keep the bulk of the people ignorant about, and uninterested in, politics. As I said earlier, shameful things can happen when nobody is watching, but what is the use of creating windows and opening them up if there is no-one outside wanting to look in? There are two reasons why it is worth bothering to try opening up the mystique of government: firstly, many hands make light work and the burden of responsibility could be considerably lessened if the general population were interested in, vigorously debated and provided some direction for, policy decisions which affect the whole country; secondly, following the belief that two heads are better than one, 18 million heads should be better than a couple of hundred. Yes, implementation of the ideas and opinions reporting system would provide some opportunities for creative logistical solutions. However, a subject would certainly have been well canvassed and considered from all angles with the enormous number of conversations on the topic that 18 million people could engender. I move on to the earlier part of my question: how do we get the message across to the general public? In the interests of good government, it is up to all members to saturate their electorates with opportunities for people to learn about their system of government and the democratic process. We have some insight into people's lack of information about such important matters as the Constitution when we examine the arguments based in ignorance that fill the letters to the editor pages, bars, taxis and dinner tables of this country.

I would like to see ordinary people well informed on relevant topics debating what might be best for Australia in the global or universal context and then putting their views forward to their MPs. It will be a grand day indeed when the budget speech or election coverage tops the ratings on TV. Perhaps this is asking too much; so how do we actively promote interest in the government in this country? I am open to ideas. There are interesting and easy-to-read brochures that we have prepared for schools, and others for adults in the community. Regular columns in the newspaper allow us an avenue to explain specific terms and actions in parliament. Occasionally, I attend careers nights at local high schools and universities to explain what is required and what it is like to be a politician. At other times, we go into schools and TAPEs to talk about the system of government and the parliamentary processes. (Time expired) accordance with standing order 275A the time for members' statements has concluded. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. Consolidation Bill 1999. This bill is a necessary piece of legislation to basically tidy up the government's ill-conceived and hastily enacted youth income support payment system-the youth allowance acts. Since its rushed introduction late last year, both the intended recipientsyoung people-and the payment delivery agency-Centrelink-have been struggling to truly understand the entitlements that are available and· the rules governing access to those entitlements, particularly in relation to payments previously available under the student assistance programs, Austudy. Although this bill will consolidate most of the previous provisions relating to youth allowance into the Social Security Act, thereby at least making the basic rules for the system easier to find, it fails to address the fundamental problems surrounding the system. Changes in the youth allowance at this time-even necessary changes-are impossible to implement effectively due to the climate of fear and the element of fatigue suffered by the major players in this legislation. Changes to the youth allowance affect two groups in particular: the young people of Australia and the staff at Centrelink. Through a succession of government policies, both of these groups have been left in no doubt that this government cannot successfully deal with these affairs. With regard to Centrelink, which is responsible for administering the provisions of the legislation, this government has slashed away at the organisation, leaving massive understaffing. This, in tum, has made Centrelink absolutely unable to cope with the demands placed upon it. The consequence of this is bungling from the agency, a crisis in staff morale and a disconnection between the offices and the community that it serves. The bungling in Centrelink is now of serious national concern. This agency, responsible for payments to over six million Australians, has been repeatedly cut to the point where it can no longer do its job effectively.

389,Debate Resumed From 30 March On Motion By Mr Mcgauran:,,155,Representatives Main Committee
390,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (9.58 A.m.),"I rise this morning to speak on the Youth Allowance4930 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 faced by Centrelink customers. Customers deserve better than to have debts hanging over their heads for no reason other than an error at Centrelink's end. Staff, on the other hand, are dedicated and professional in their commitment to their clients. I am certain it pains staff greatly to cut comers or make mistakes simply because there is not enough staff to do the job properly. The government seems arrogant and indifferent to the problems in Centrelink. Along with the unsustainable slashing of 5,000 jobs, the government diverts staff from the task of serving customers and uses them instead to promote the politics of the Liberal and the National parties. Staff and resources that should be ensuring that young people receive their proper entitlements under the youth allowance legislation have instead been applied to the politicisation of Centrelink's communication with its customers. It is a national scandal. Earlier this year, the government was found to have breaohed the privacy of 1.7 million pensioners and veterans by spending $800,000 on political propaganda about the GST during the 1998 election campaign. That information was sent via Centrelink. Apart from the obvious implications of privacy and electoral impropriety, it is a wasteful use of government resources. The government should have spent the money wasted on the tax funded GST campaign to provide adequate and timely provision of support payments for young people. Timeliness is an important issue for young people-indeed, all social security recipients-as most payments are not backdated but can only commence from the time an application is duly received and processed by Centrelink. At least something is being done about this issue through schedule 1 to this bill, which deals with fares allowance. This seeks to add provisions under which a claim for fares allowance may be treated as having been received when the person first contacts Centrelink about the claim by telephone or fax. In theory, this is good. However, it is now an accepted truth that Centrelink clients cannot speak with a real human being that knows anything about their situation. The dehumanisation of Centrelink is dangerous and degrading for both customers and staff. Current figures illustrate that over 80 per cent of callers failed to get through to Centrelink in 1998. These trends have continued in figures for the first month of this year. In human terms, around 250,000 calls a day are failing to get through to Centrelink. The fact is that calling Centrelink is now becoming the new national lottery. The 1300 numbers are not functioning because the staffing levels are not adequate and the centralisation of call services does not recognise the unique and personal nature of Centrelink inquiries. People who ring do so only when there is a problem. When people have a problem with something as important as a government benefit, each call is very serious and each one can take some time. Creating a national call centre has been a disaster. I know that assisting constituents is made that much harder without at least some level of access to the office in which the matter is being dealt with. It is impossible to understand the frustration faced by a Centrelink customer who, after five attempts at ringing the local office, finally gets through, only to be talking with a telephone operator in Sydney or perhaps in Melbourne. After the nightmare of making telephone contact with staff, the public face the next blow-out in Centrelink-appointment waiting lists. Customers on youth allowance and Newstart are facing delays of up to 14 days before being interviewed. This has resulted in people facing a two-week delay in lodging Centrelink forms. That means two weeks without financial support and two weeks before people can be registered as unemployed for the purposes of the Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4931 Job Network. And, guess what, the provisions in this bill with regard to fares allowance require that the formal claim is lodged within 14 days of the initial contact. Young people lose again. The government's plan to introduce agencies to replace Centrelink offices is a concern not only for the privacy and security of rural and regional clients but also because it represents a significant deskilling of the service. In an appalling attempt to paper over the cracks in the Centrelink budget, the Howard government's only solution is to spend $5 million in order to turn credit unions, post offices, business centres and individuals into Centrelink service providers in rural and regional Australia. This concept raises significant privacy implications. The reality is that Centrelink staff are specifically trained to deal with information regarding taxable income, investments and assets of individuals, information relating to family matters, including family breakdown and custody arrangements, health and medical history, and employment details. This information is by far more sensitive and personal than information currently accessed by the types of nongovernment organisations outlined by the government. Such information would be required by schedule 3 of the bill covering provisions on the family actual means test and schedule 4 covering definitions of homeless person and FA child. Centrelink deals with many people who require the services of trained and dedicated staff, of public servants who respect the privacy of an individual and are accountable for their actions. What these agencies will be is a drop-off point: forms can be lodged, but real, meaningful assistance will be scarce, if any. Quite frankly, Centrelink is in disarray. The service is failing dismally now and racing backwards at breakneck speed. This agency will not welcome changes to the youth allowance when it cannot cope with the current workloads. Changes to allowances, regardless of the benefits of such change, will overburden the current system. What this government should be presenting to the parliament is a package of fundamental and wholesale improvements to Centrelink; the restoration of the budget, so that over six million Australians can be properly serviced; and staffing levels returned to a point where mista-es can be avoided, customers can make contact with the department and the nation can regain its confidence in the social security system. Until this is done, Centrelink will fail to meet the basic needs of young people, and the government will be judged harshly for this. Set against the plummeting fortunes of Centrelink is the battle-weary youth of Australia. The young people of Australia have received no good news from this government. Policies that strip away youth services and the politics of finger pointing have left young people very cynical and distrusting of change. The provisions covering entitlement to youth allowance force young people under 21 or full-time students up to the age of 25 to remain dependent on their parents and to further have their entitlements assessed on the basis of their parents' income. The government's agenda has been transparent to young people: Work for the Dole, the Job Network and the common youth allowance are seen as massive failures. These programs lack any vision or tangible outcomes, and the fact that all these initiatives come at the expense of labour market programs and proven government services only serves to further frustrate those young people languishing in the mire of government incompetence. Work for the Dole has failed to deliver anything in the way of meaningful training or work readiness for Australia's young unemployed. The system could quite rightly be described as 'turn up for the dole'. While this may satisfy the Howard government and their punitive outlook on the young unemployed, it is doing nothing to enhance the job prospects of young 4932 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 job seekers. Work for the Dole must be a complement to a range of labour market programs that give all unemployed people the broad range of skills, experience and motivation that will create the shift from long-term unemployment to paid work. Unfortunately, that cannot happen because this government have scrapped effective and efficient labour market programs, leaving themselves with a one-pronged attack on the issue of the long-term unemployed. These labour market programs were not only effective but supported and endorsed by those going through those very programs. That support came not only from the fact that participants saw these programs as adding greatly to their future employment prospects but also because they treated all unemployed people fairly. The Work for the Dole scheme is a compulsory requirement for young unemployed that are reliant on youth allowance because it suits the ideology of this government. This government is not about fixing unemployment; it simply wants to be seen to be tough with young unemployed people. This is why in my electorate of Oxley we particularly suffer some of the worse youth unemployment statistics in Australia. In suburbs across my electorate, unemployment is routinely sitting at over 10 per cent of the population, while for those young unemployed people who seek to join the labour force the teenage unemployment rate is up to 30 per cent in some areas. This is clearly not acceptable. This is a tragedy and a scandal in itself. Nearly one in every three young job seekers cannot find work. While this is alarming at a statistical level, it is crippling at a human level. The great and shameful legacy of this government is their failing on youth unemployment. Young people have been abandoned by the system. Many young people have not had employment in their lives. They have moved from school to unemployment. Their days are filled with hopelessness and sometimes the reckless and antisocial behaviour that often accompanies such hopelessness. These are the young Australians that we must move heaven and earth to get into work. We must create a social safety net that encourages and supports them as they move from benefits to jobs. The youth allowance must become part of an active package of measures designed to address youth unemployment, not to beat up on young people, but rather an integral part of rewarding young people for work. The youth allowance, must-as the vision of the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, illustrated-be an enabler not a way of life. The Prime Minister's policies lack that vision. His youth allowance lacks vision and it will continue to fail the young people of our nation. The difficulties faced by our youth are compounded by the government's continued use of experimental and failing services. Of all the experiments of this government, none has failed more spectacularly than the Job Network. This shambolic amalgamation of disparate services was built on the ruins of the ground where the CES once stood. The Job Network has failed, no matter what smoke and mirrors are used by the government to pretend otherwise. Minister Kemp's great social reform has failed and it has cost all of us dearly. From day one the system started to break down and service providers experienced financial difficulty. The government has since been forced to come to the financial aid of the network several times, and is well short of finding a sustainable platform from which the network will be viable. Apart from the financial difficulties experienced within the network, the changes have meant that services that were previously freely available to all are now being denied to many. Services are overwhelmingly being run on a commercial rather than on a community or public Wednesday; 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4933 interest basis. The changes mean that most local community agencies, like Skillshare, have disappeared and regions with high unemployment, such as mine, are not being adequately serviced. The government's suggestion that the Job Network has increased outlets for support for the unemployed simply does not add up. The fact is there are 150 fewer public, community and private case management sites since the Job Network was introduced. This is a fall of nearly 20 per cent. Because this government cannot get its act together on labour market programs and the Job Network, young unemployed people are left languishing on the common youth allowance. The concept that young people who are unemployed or studying can be penalised for their parents' earnings at less than $25,000 has left young people struggling and has also had an impact on the entire family. The youth allowance will keep a lot of young people at home. It will also keep a lot of homes in hock. This government should be aware that you cannot be pro families and be anti young people. In my electorate it is average families who are battling under the increasing financial burden placed on them through changes to the away from home rates and means testing. Not all families share in the Prime Minister's white picket fence dream. The government stay at home youth allowance has failed young people and it is making things tougher and tougher for those young people who, for a variety of reasons, cannot stay at home. By applying Work for the Dole and the ill conceived and ridiculous 'read for the dole' scheme exclusively to young Australians, this government is again playing the politics of finger pointing. These policies are designed to convince Australia that youth unemployment is a result of the failings and laziness of young people. The government cannot sidestep their own failures on this crucial national issue. If the Prime Minister were serious about literacy he would put the government's money where his mouth is, but no new money is available for literacy training for the unemployed. Instead, the government's commitment to literacy training for the unemployed remains a pitiful $21 million a year. Without new resources the literacy program will be nothing but a hollow stunt. The bill also provides for the administration of student assistance payments to young people continuing their education. Access to quality education is the most important issue facing young Australians today. Education will make the difference in every young person's life yet this government has let education slide. Budget cuts and up-front university fees are reducing the availability and quality of education for young people. The government's budget cuts in education have resulted in reduced funding for public schools. At a time when public school enrolments are increasing due, in no small measure, to the government's eligibility requirements for youth allowance, this government is creating a crisis in government schools. Students at university, meantime, are faced with rising up-front government charges as well as an increase in HECS to pay for massive cuts to education funding. That any government can approach the new millennium with a reduced commitment to higher education is simply unbelievable. The daunting prospect facing many university students and their families is that they will have to meet the increased costs with less support through the youth allowance. This is exactly why there is an overall reduction in the number of Australian students at universities and TAPE colleges. Reducing access to education and training is not just stupid, it threatens the 4934 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 nation's future. Yet still the government persecutes the young people of Australia. They resent Minister Reith and his youth wages because they know the truth. Lower youth wages will not create more jobs, while skills based wages will result in competitive wages for young people in most industries. It is not just the Democrats and Senator Harradine who know the government cannot be trusted; young people know it also. Now is the time for the government to restore faith with the young people of Australia. Now is the time for the Prime Minister to provide real assistance to young people through a commitment to education and training; to redouble the fight against youth unemployment; and provide fair and reasonable financial support payments and an agency with adequate resource to deliver those payments. We need to stand up for young people and their families, not punish them and not push them down. This youth allowance legislation does nothing for the young people of Australia. Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. This legislation abolished unemployment benefits that would have been payable to 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds and inflicted a means test on parents of children 18 years and over. This bill caused considerable hardships to families in my electorate of Greenway and I intend to relate some of these hardships later in my speech. Nationally the means test applied to some 40,000 young people and some families lost up to $170 a fortnight. The Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 before the House today is intended to incorporate two disallowable instruments and one set of regulations dealing with aspects of Austudy into the Social Security Act 1991. It also addresses technical measures arising out of the implementation of the youth allowance package and is to make consequential amendments relating to the commencement of the youth allowance. This bill does contain some reasonable and beneficial measures, but other measures will result in reduced entitlements for some young unemployed people. For example, schedule 4 of the bill amends the Social Security Act to address issues identified during the implementation of the youth allowance and Austudy payment. Some of these will have a significant effect upon beneficiaries. The schedule proposed to reduce the rate paid to some disability support pensioners under the age of 21 and to increase the rate for others is an example. The effect of these changes varies, depending on the pensioner's circumstances. A single person aged between 18 and 21 who does not live at home and has a dependent child will lose $7 per fortnight, while a partnered pensioner over the age of 18 will gain about $17 per fortnight. The guardian allowance of $37 per fortnight can be paid under existing legislation to single parents in certain circumstances. This schedule seeks to provide that the guardian allowance will not be paid to a person unless they are receiving family allowance at more than the minimum rate. Under current provisions, the rate of family allowance is reduced where income exceeds $23,550 plus $624 for each additional family allowance child. A family allowance child can be a child receiving a youth allowance. The schedule seeks to amend this so that the child receiving a youth allowance is a family allowance child only if they are under 18 years of age. This does not take into account the fact that young unemployed people are now regarded as dependent children until they are aged 21 and may therefore receive a lower rate as a result",155,Representatives Main Committee
391,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (10.16 A.m.),"In March 1998, this House passed the SocialWednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4935 of the youth allowance legislation. These amendments only add to the financial problems of young unemployed people and their families already created by the common youth allowance. I will now refer once again to some of the problems encountered within my electorate and which I have drawn to this House's attention on previous occasions. They remain important however and deserve to be brought forward once again. The first relates to a single father, Arthur, and his daughter, Melissa. She sat for her Higher School Certificate in 1996 and completed her first year of a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the University of New England in 1997, but was unable to continue her studies last year due to a lack of finance. At the time Melissa spoke to me she was 19, unemployed, and had received unemployment benefits of $170 per fortnight. This young lady's income dropped to $20 per fortnight on 1 July 1998 due to the parental income assessment under the Commonwealth's Youth Allowance Scheme. She then had to rely on her father for board and lodging. The young lady had further difficulties in that she had a medical problem that at the time made her unemployable. She had applied for a disability support pension but had been assessed as being only 10 per cent incapacitated. Therefore, she was not entitled to a pension. To be entitled to a pension Melissa would have had to have been assessed at 20 per cent incapacitated and not be able to work for two years. The unreal aspect of this position is that, if you are even one per cent incapacitated, employers would not employ you. There is a further difficulty for this family. Arthur, the father, has estimated that his income has dropped by some 15 per cent due to enterprise bargaining negotiations. Many families are suffering this double effect of falling income and a reduction in social security payments. My second story relates to a mother who rang me to advise of a situation involving her son who had left school in December 1996. Since that time he has completed a life skills training course at TAFE, worked for two months in the timber industry, worked for seven months as a tyre fitter on $4.50 an hour, and had other casual work. This young man was then unemployed. At the time his mother rang me he was 18 and his mother had expected that he would qualify for unemployment benefits and so at least have sufficient money to be able to enjoy a social life. However this young man, who was already 18 months out of school, had completed a TAFE course and had worked but was then unemployed, did not qualify for unemployment benefits. The government expected this low income family to support this young man. The combined income for the family was $480 a week to support four people. Another son was an apprentice and so could only marginally contribute to the family's budget. The situation has already caused tension in the family. The mother was worried that her son would leave home, as he had done once previously, and possibly tum to a life of petty crime to obtain sufficient money to live. My third case study relates to a young man named Michael and his father who came to see me a few weeks ago. The father made it very clear to me that he was very cranky about this legislation. IfI had been a Liberal member of parliament he would have been really giving it to me. But he understood, of course, that I was not responsible for this piece of legislation. This was the situation. Michael was 20 and unemployed and he had received youth allowance of $176 for the period 27 January 1999 until 9 February 1999, approximately $88 per week. Michael was then advised by Centrelink on 10 February that his payment would 4936 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 be reduced to $119.62 per fortnight due to a change in circumstances. It seems the combined family income had increased. This was $53.92 per week. This is a totally inadequate amount for a young man who possibly would be expected to contribute to the household budget, be entitled to enjoy some sporting activity, have a social life, and at the same time travel around to seek employment. Michael then received correspondence from Centrelink dated 24 February stating: You have received youth allowance at a rate of $176 per fortnight from 1 January 1999 whereas your current entitlement was $119.62 per fortnight depending on your parent's financial year's income. The result of this was that Michael had incurred a debt of $157.63. Therefore, Michael had to repay this amount which is, in fact, in excess of his current fortnightly entitlement. Centrelink advised him that he was to repay that amount or his payments would be reduced to help recover that amount. I believe this is a totally unfair way of dealing with low income people who no doubt spend their paltry income each fortnight. If there is an overpayment, they have to beg, borrow or steal-and unfortunately steal could well come into this-to make this repayment or otherwise suffer further reductions in income. These cases give a few examples of how this government's policies are hurting low income families. Young adults who are old enough to vote, to go to war, to get married and who are looking for work, are clearly independent, and they should not be forced to rely on their low income families for support. Another problem that one of my constituents has drawn to my attention is the amount of paperwork that either the young person or the family has to fill out to claim the common youth allowance. I have brought in some photos tatted documents. There are some 40 different pages of instructions and forms to fill out. It would appear that the government is trying to establish a one-stop shop style of form. But, in doing this, the government has created a paper monster, which young people and their families have to work through. In the long run, this quite possibly could lead to incorrect information which may delay payment or may result in an incorrect payment being made. In some cases, this could mean that the person might unintentionally claim more than they are entitled to: they might incur a debt and then that debt has to be repaid. These are the problems that young people and their families are encountering. The facts are that I believe-and a constituent came to see me about this only a week or so ago-that we need to have smaller forms with fewer items to fill out. The forms should be targeted to particular groups of young unemployed people, whether on an age basis or based on their current employment situation. I would now like to follow up my own constituents' experiences on the effect of the common youth allowance by quoting from a few articles in journals and daily papers that reinforce my constitutents' experiences. In an article in Feature Outlook, there is reference to the quite substantial savings that the government has made by this legislation. The National Union of Students is quoted as stating that, by raising the age of independence to 25, the government has saved $163.5 million a year; the tightening of the Austudy actual means test has saved another $150 million a year. Some 12,800 18to 20-year-olds have lost benefits because they are now means tested on the basis of their family income and these have been assessed as being too high. The article I am referring to has been written by Penny Lake and it concludes by stating this: Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4937 The government is not addressing the real issue-lack of jobs. They are sidelining this with the youth allowance by focussing on young people and claiming in effect that with extra education, the number of jobs will miraculously increase. It dubiously assumes that a skilled and educated workforce of young people (with limited job experience) will naturally translate into a multitude of jobs appropriate to their individual level of training. The government is cleverly shifting the blame for unemployment from the policy makers and unaccountable corporate industries to the young unemployed, with possibly disastrous consequences. Youth unemployment is a question to which there are no easy answers. The youth allowance system, has, if anything, made answering it even more difficult. Further, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 25 August, reports on the findings of a Dr Dasia Black, a family psychologist and a research associate at the Australian Catholic University, as follows: We define adulthood legally as being over the age of 18 but psychologically as having economic and emotional independence from parents. She says the youth allowance has prolonged adolescence well beyond the traditional 16-18 year age span. At the same time, the cosy, intact family that is supposedly waiting to cradle these over-sized fledglings no longer exists in many cases. Black refers to the work of a British sociologist Christopher Jenks, who contrasts the 'modem world' of the 1950s-1970s with the 'postmodern' world of the 1990s. Jenks argues that the postrnodern world is characterised by a loss of hope and belief in the future, which is reflected in the way young people are treated. While in the 1950s-1970s we saw young people as our future and therefore worthy of our money and time (hence free university education), in the postmodern world we have no such belief in progress and therefore won't invest in children. Unlike previous decades when there was a clear path into adulthood-university, jobs, economic independence-young people now have to grow up knowing there might not be a job for them. Yet they are still bathed in seductive media images of material success. Black argues that forcing young adults to stay home may lead to conflict as they chafe against dependency and parental rule and values. If they resist the push to go back to the nest, they may be forced instead into poverty and become more vulnerable to crime, alcoholism, depression, stress and even suicide. To that list I might add drug addiction. The youth allowance reinforces the government's philosophy that forces families to support young people until they have achieved financial independence, whatever the financial plight of their parents may be. This ignores the fact that, in this period of employment insecurity, many families are facing reduced income, longer working hours or reduced employment prospects. This policy is therefore placing an added strain on low income families who are at the time of life when they have raised and educated their children. Some of them are now planning their retirement and others may be facing an uncertain employment future due to the economic rationalist policies of this governmentprivatisation, corporatisation and outsourcing. The fall in income for middle-aged workers has been detailed in a report by Bob Gregory, from the ANU. For the purposes of what I am saying today: the figures show that for men aged between 35 and 54 years the income fall is marginal. For those between 60 and 64 years, the weekly fall is $128. We can assume from these figures that the male's ability to support a family starts to slide from the mid-50s age group-that is, of course, provided he is still in employment. So the youth allowance legislation is continuing this government's policy of discriminating against low income people. 4938 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 It is long overdue that this government and its media mates stopped worrying about the past life of Paul Keating and started thinking about the appalling behaviour they are directing at the future of our nation-the youth. The government seems totally oblivious to the huge dividing line it is creating within our great nation. For those of us who thought that Malcolm Fraser divided the nation and that we were brought back to unity by Bob Hawke, this government, led by the ex-Fraser Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong, makes Malcolm Fraser look like a rank amateur. This government belts pensioners, youth, farmers and city dwellers, criticises every action of the ALP, and then places two former staffers of the member for Flinders into jobs for the boys. Clearly this is just the tip of the iceberg of the government's divisive behaviour. It is not good enough for our nation and it should stop now. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.34 a.m.)-This government has waged a concerted attack on young Australians and their families. This attack has been directed at every level of their lives, with cuts to education and training, moves to reduce youth wages and the introduction of this youth allowance, an action that has caused great hurt and distress for a number of families and one that continues to cause hurt. I continually wonder how members on the other side of this parliament can live with themselves, knowing that their decisions and their actions have caused so much hurt for young Australians and their families. While this legislation, the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999, does marginally improve or tidy up some aspects of the operational components of the youth allowance, it is more of the same bad medicine. It is legislation designed to entrench measures that are causing hurt to young Australians and their families, whilst at the same time the government is abrogating its responsibility to these same young Australians, putting cost cutting ahead of their welfare and their future. Young people have been targeted by this government continually. I think this is because they are seen as a less powerful group within the community: they are still coming to terms with their own self-identity and they find it harder to get out there and form those formal structures that are needed to lobby governments in the way that other groups in our community can. Because they are a less powerful group within the community, I think this government has singled them out and decided that they will target them. I do not think this is good enough. Young people are old enough to vote. Young people are old enough to defend our country. Young people, once they are 18, if they commit a crime, have the same responsibility for their actions as a person who is 21,31,41,65; they receive the same penalties and they have the same obligations. Where you have the same obligations and the same responsibilities, surely you deserve to be treated in the same way as other people. But, unfortunately, that is not the way of this government. This government does not feel that young people, people of 18, 19,20, are real people. They are not considered adults; they are not considered people who are contributing to our country in the same way as people who have reached the age of 21, 22, 31, 32. This youth allowance is hurting. It hurts young people. It is hurting their families and it is causing great problems within our community and our society. It is forcing young people to be dependent on their families. When this legislation was initially introduced there were many young people who had made life decisions, decisions that they would move away from their homes as they were now 18. Maybe sometimes situations existed within those homes that made it very hard for young Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4939 people to continue to live there. There can often be conflict within families. It can also be that moving from the family home to another area improves their opportunities for studying, for obtaining work and developing their own self-identity. Unfortunately, this government does not think that is important. It does not think that young people who are 18, 19, 20 deserve to be able to do this. The government feels that mummy and daddy should still look after them, that they need to be looked after by their families, that it is their family's responsibility. So, whilst on the one hand they are responsible for their acts if they commit a crime, on the other hand they are their parents' responsibility because they are not old enough-not mature enough-to make decisions about their future, about their studies, about where they live. I find this really abhorrent. As I mentioned, a number of people have financial commitments. The government makes the assumption, too, that parents have spare money, that they have got money sitting around that they can direct towards their children. Children! That is an inappropriate word because they are not children, they are young adults, so it is giving young adults money to survive. At the time this legislation was introduced a couple of people got in touch with the previous federal member, the Hon. Peter Morris. A case was detailed in our local newspapers of a young person who was put into a situation where the relationships within the home was so dreadful that he could not go back there. If he did not get the youth allowance, he did not eat. He was told by Centrelink, 'Sorry, you no longer qualify. It is bad luck but you have got to go and find some other way that you can survive.' This government was abrogating its responsibility, putting that person in an untenable situation. And this is more of that sort of legislation entrenching this stigmatising of young people. They find it very demoralising indeed. They feel that the government are saying, 'We do not think that you are an important person. We feel that you are unemployed because you choose to be.' And on the other hand, they say, 'We do not think that we should assist your move from a situation of unemployment to work.' As well as the attack on the income support, there has been an overall attack on young people and on the training available for those young people to access the work force. At the same time as they are increasing the requirements that are necessary for a person to obtain youth allowance, they are cutting Centrelink, and Centrelink is less able to process the applications. There are more mistakes being made. There are more young people being disadvantaged. People are being denied youth allowance when they are actually eligible for youth allowance. It all comes back to this cutting, slashing, cost saving, economic rationalist approach whereby the person is not important but what is important is that you just cut and then you blame those people that are in the least powerful position within our community. I am sorry. I do not think that is good enough. I know that the members on this side of the House feel the same way. The Work for the Dole program has been touted as the solution to all the problems. I have some real problems with the Work for the Dole'program. First of all, look at the word 'dole'. For years income assistance was called 'unemployment benefit' and there was a definite decision that you should never refer to it as 'dole' because the word 'dole' carries stigma. By having a program that says 'work for the dole' you are stigmatising the people who are receiving that right from the very beginning. From unemployment benefits we went to Newstart, giving the idea that people were on this allowance or benefit that was setting them up for a neW start, getting them ready to go out 4940 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 there and conquer the world. But, no, we are back to Work for the Dole. Here they are being given a handout now and their mutual obligation is to work for that handout. I put it to the government that they have also got a mutual obligation to young people. They have got a mutual obligation to offer them a future. They have got a mutual obligation to offer them training. They have got a mutual obligation to ensure that there are going to be real jobs for the future. The previous Labor government introduced LEAP which offered young unemployed people the chance to get on-the-job experience working three days a week while at the same time being able to obtain formal qualifications. So they were equipped with not only experience but also some tangible skills that could be translated into other areas of work, skills that were recognised and which quite often worked as a springboard into more formal education. That brings me to education. This government has cut funds for education. It has attacked universities. We have only got to see that today is a national day of action at all the universities throughout this country to see the esteem the government is held in by students. All the time there have been changes to HECS that make it harder for people that come from lower and middle income families to access education. Education is moving back towards being something that is available only to those people who have the money and the ability to access those funds you need to attend university. There have been cuts to TAFE funding, the very basic area, where people can get the most basic of training that often acts as a springboard into other areas of education. This government have constantly and continually cut funding to all areas except for private education. They are putting their money into private education at the expense of those people who really need that funding. The changes to Austudy have certainly had a detrimental effect and made it harder for young people to be able to attend university and TAFE. There is a constant undermining and eroding of the situation in relation to young people getting education, having income support, having hope for the future, and being able to plan where they would like to be when they are my age or the age of their parents. I do not know how this government can justify the actions that they have taken. With regard to the initiative about literacy and numeracy and the assessment deeming that young people have poor literacy and numeracy skills and will be forced to do literacy and numeracy programs, I would like to ask the government how they are going to do this. First, how are they going to undertake the assessments? As somebody who has actually conducted literacy assessments, I know that it needs to be done in a controlled environment. It needs to be done in the situation where you can compare the results that one person achieves against another. Once you have assessed the person's literacy levels, then you have to find a place where they can go to improve those literacy skills. In addition, you need to be able to determine why they have poor literacy or numeracy skills. Why did the education system fail them? Do they have a specific learning disability? If so, is the government going to fund some sort of remediation for those people? I put it to the government that what they are planning to do there is just another cost-cutting exercise. It is not about improving opportunities for young people with literacy and numeracy problems. It is about cutting; it is about slashing; it is about stigmatising them. It is about making it harder for those young people. Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4941 Just touching also on the changes that they have made in the area of young people with disabilities, the opportunities these young people had in the past have been reduced. All the time the government are looking at cutting the fUIlding to that area. They have entrenched a situation whereby young people with disabilities will get the lowest possible income support available. It is all a move away from creating opportunity: opportunity for people with disabilities; opportunity for people with learning disabilities and poor literacy skills, and opportunity for people who are looking at finding employment in different areas.· This government have absolutely no commitment to young people. The government's.initiative this week is the decision to cut benefits or make them really difficult to obtain for people who move from an area of low unemployment to one of high unemployment. For example, if they leave Sydney, having been told they have a job in Newcastle, an area of higher unemployment, and they get there and that job falls through, then they will not be granted any sort of financial assistance. It is called the Byron Bay initiativethe surf and sun initiative-and, once again, it is targeting young people. It is saying young people are not working because young people do not want to work. Young people move from one area to another just to be able to get away from their obligation to work. All they are about is taking hand-outs from the government and, because of that, we are going to punish them. When will the government learn that young people want a future? When will the government actually make a commitment to young people? Instead of constantly attacking young people, this government needs to become relevant to them because at the moment it lacks relevance with its backward looking, regressive policies that are always attacking and removing opportunity from young people. It is about time that it came into the 1990s and learnt about the things that are important to young people. I wonder how many people on the other side of this House even know the names of the bands out there that young people listen to-good Australian bands. I am sure some of them may have heard of silverchair or the Whitlams, but there are also the Screaming Jets, Regurgitator and Jebediah-all great Australian bands. They are all bands that young Australians hold very dear to their hearts, and bands that are very relevant to young people in our community. Ms ElIis-I don't know any of them! members of the government do not take the time to know these fine Australian bands, they do not know the issues that are important to young people. One issue is jobs. They should be helping young people move from a situation of being reliant on youth allowance to employment. They should be helping young people obtain the education and training that will facilitate that move. The government is not aware of the issues that relate to the problems that young people face in our community. This government is not about coming to terms with issues of youth suicide and drugs. Its answer to drugs is, 'Hit them and hit them hard,' rather than looking at why young people are turning to drugs; why young people are taking their own lives. It is not looking at the social impact of its decisions. It is not looking at the fact that young people in our community are grappling and searching for a future.",160,Representatives Main Committee
392,Mr Andrews,There are newer ones now; you're showing your age.,167,Representatives Main Committee
393,Ms Hall,"I suspect very few members actually know who these bands are. And just as4942 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 Young people want to have the support of government. They want a government that is there to offer them opportunity and hope for the future. This government is taking away that hope. This government is not only attacking their financial support through youth allowance; it is seeking to reduce youth wages and make young people dependent on their parents in every possible way. This government is not about equality of opportunity for young people; this government is about looking after those people that it perceives can benefit it. This attack on young Australians is an attack on every Australian family, on average Australian families, on families that are battling and struggling, on families that are just everyday Australians, and on workers out there who are looking for a future for their children. The government really stands condemned for what it has done to young people in our community, how it has removed their hope for the future, and how it has failed to offer young people opportunity and a future. This legislation really should be condemned because, while it aims to tidy up some of the mistakes made in the first legislation, it does not cure the problem. It is all about making it harder for young people to have a future, to get training, to get education and to find a job. Ms ELLIS (Canberra) (10.54 a.m.)-The Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 is a legislative housekeeping exercise. Its purpose is to incorporate two disallowable instruments and one set of regulations dealing with aspects of Austudy into the Social Security Act 1991; to address technical issues arising out of the implementation of the youth allowance package; and to make consequential amendments relating to the commencement of youth allowance. The youth allowance was introduced in July 1998. It merged all income support for young unemployed people under the age of 21 and full-time students between the ages of 16 and 24 years into one payment administered by the Department of Social Security, DSS, now called the Department of Family and Community Services. The only exceptions were Abstudy and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme. While this bill is just a legislative housekeeping exercise, the youth allowance itself has had significant ramifications for many families and many young people. Since its introduction, my electorate office has received many phone calls and letters from young people and their families who had been badly affected by the introduction of the new system. The youth allowance system has cut off financial independence, placed extra burdens on families and put up new barriers to undertaking study or finding a job for many in my electorate. Unfortunately, I am sure we all remember the unacceptable handling of those dramatic changes at the time that they came in. They were huge changes in a very small period of time, which put the Centrelink agency itself under enormous, in fact unbelievable, pressure. Rarely in this country have we seen the implementation of a policy so badly handled as a result of the timetable and the enormous extent of the changes involved in such a timetable. Phone calls to Centrelink received the engaged signal. People had to wait days for appointments to discuss the implementation and the implications of the changes that were being delivered to them. The stress that was already going to affect our young community members was exacerbated many times over by the manner in which this interesting brave new world of support for young people was implemented. I ask: how is it possible to deliver any program, let alone one like this, if you intend to cut 5,000 staff and $150 million from the budget in an environment where major policy changes are taking place and you effect that in the very agency that is expected Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4943 to deliver the goods? We all know problems at Centrelink are occurring on a daily basis and they will continue to occur not only in the area of youth allowance but across the board in all benefits provided until the government realises and accepts the truth about the crisis within Centrelink. On a more personal level, the Minister for Family and Community Services and I seem to have engaged ourselves in an ongoing debate about this very question of the ability of Centrelink to continue to deliver services to its client base. I tell the House, with no qualification at all, that I will not resile from my responsibility as a local member to ensure that I tell the government the facts, the truth, about how these decisions are affecting my community and particularly the young people in it. I look forward to the day-and I hope it is not too far away, but I tend to be a bit cynical-when I will not be accused of misleading the community and .the government. I look forward to the day when the words I -ay to the government and the minister will be accepted for what they, in fact, are-the absolute truth. Recently, there has been a lot of talk about mutual obligation between welfare recipients and government. The government uses this language regularly to highlight what it believes is the propensity for people on welfare to cheat the system. I reject this assessment and reject the implication that, by opposing the government on this issue, I am and we are in some way supporting welfare rorts. There is no doubt that the Australian Labor Party want to assist young Australians off welfare dependency-there is absolutely no question about that-but not in the way that has been proposed by the Howard government with their youth allowance. To abolish unemployment benefits for 16and 17-year-olds whilst also slashing the educational opportunities they have is the wrong way to reform the welfare state. To have the income test placed upon families with 18to 20-year-olds come into effect at income levels of $23,350 is the wrong way to reform our welfare state. The government appears to believe that if you force young people to stay at school longer they will happily and successfully emerge from that process well qualified, happy and successful, and will automatically walk into a job or a career. However in the real world in which I operate, and we on this side operate, you cannot assume that by setting these extremely stringent rules you can successfully interfere in the lives and the relationships of families. The decisions being taken by the government in relation to literacy and numeracy, for example, set more hurdles and direct more blame at young people because they are not in paid work. I have heard the comments of many educational experts voicing their concern over these initiatives. What are they saying? They are saying, quite simply, 'Don't re-create the schoolroom problems that some of these young people actually have already sitting on their shoulders. Don't believe that you can scoop up groups of young people-who do, in some instances, have undeniable literacy and numeracy problems-and put them back into a system and a process from which they unsuccessfully emerged in the past.' Let us look closely at those individuals that we are talking about. Let us talk about them as individuals, not as groups and statistics. Probably the only effective way that we could even begin to attempt to address those literacy and numeracy problems would be one on one, in a specially contrived fashion by which Iill of their problems, all of their difficulties, all of their concerns that they have carried through school, are addressed as one. 4944 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 But I do not really expect that any government is going to be prepared to fund at that level in the climate in which we find ourselves. Whilst it may be very admirable for this government to politically grandstand-and that is what I call it-about the problems of literacy and numeracy, the message going out to the community from the government is that the whole reason these unemployed young people do not have work is that they are illiterate and innumerate and they are not trying. This is yet another set of blame and yet another set of hurdles, with not one effective component in the process to fix any of the problems. It is pure political grandstanding, in a really cheap fashion, in my view, because it is attacking the very victim in our community and offering nothing in the real sense of the word to overcome those very problems. If people emerge out of an education system with a literacy and numeracy problem, you cannot just blame the education system, although that has to carry some degree of blame. You have to look very carefully at the individual people. You have to ask yourself why it is that the education system suited some and not others. What was it that was wrong for these young people, and what do we need to do to correct it? We should not herd them up and stick them in a room somewhere, take their money off them and say to them at the same time, 'We're blaming you. We're going to victimise you and you won't get another thing until you learn'in almost the same environment which previously they passed through unsuccessfully. I implore the government and the minister concerned to really think about this. At the same time as the government is affecting the outcomes of youth allowance payments, it is doing this to youth. Frankly, I deplore that attitude. It is not good enough. It is not constructive. It is not helpful. It is cheap political grandstanding .. I understand that the process for assessing literacy and numeracy is going to be left to the agencies commissioned to carry out these classes or these remedial programs. So how you are assessed in Newcastle may be quite different from how you are assessed in Canberra or Perth, or Darwin or anywhere else. I despair at that as well. Where is the true academic thinking behind teaching when you have a different set of rules dependent upon where you may be, not dependent upon needs as an individual? I quite often despair when I think of some of the decisions and the attitudes, particularly, that are coming forth from this government in a so-called attempt to address some of these extremely serious issues. These young people are our adult citizens of the future, and I believe that we have got to treat them a whole lot differently from the way we are under the current regime. It is not the fault of our young people that they cannot secure employment. Instead, we as a society collectively have to look very carefully at what we are doing. We are not providing the employment base and the work environment which encourages them to find work. Even the best of training programs-I want to talk about that very briefly-are no good if there is no employer out there to welcome these young people into ajob anyway. Hypothetically, you could create very well-qualified youngsters who still had no jobs. To talk of literacy and numeracy is fine, but I know university graduates who are not illiterate or innumerate but who cannot get work. Let us face it: there are two sides to this whole dilemma. It was very interesting yesterday to be at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research lunch in this place. The emphasis by a very wide range of extremely wellqualified economists was on what we should do about unemployment. I do not remember seeing Work for the Dole on their list. I do remember seeing a very strong mention in their Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4945 five-point plan of good, successful, recognised, well-funded training programs, all of which have been completely decimated, in every form, by the current government. The government walked into power after the 1996 election and decided that anything-good, bad or otherwise-that had been done by the previous government was not to their liking, so out it went. Millions of dollars worth of, in some cases, extremely good training programs were kicked out, purely in a political grandstanding fashion, with no consideration whatever of the success of any of it. What is interesting, though, is that some of the lesser funded but still existing programs that are beginning to emerge or to be talked about strangely reflect some of the things that were in fact in those previous programs. What this government has got to do is be honest, absolutely honest. It is no good blaming the young people. It is no good saying, 'Because you are illiterate and innumerate it is your fault.' It is no good removing financial support from them at the same time as you also force them to stay in a school environment, which, I might add, is now being seen in most parts of this country to be completely unprepared for it. The stories that I am now hearing-as, I am sure, many of my colleagues are-are that it is all very well to say to these kids, 'Back to school and stay there,' but you have got to make sure the education system in each of those states and territories, in country towns, in regional and rural areas, can cope with that. That is not happening either. It is a really cheap shot for any government to stand up and say, 'We are going to very effectively attempt to fix the unemployment problem for the young people-'--Our heart tells us it is the right thing to do,' while their head, in fact, is leading them down so many wrong paths that it is distressing. I know that from my own electorate when I get a phone call from a young girl who is crying hysterically because Centrelink cannot handle her Austudy application and information inquiry, or from a young man whose family is in unbelievable financial stress. How stupid is it that a 23-year-old man, who has been overseas for 18 months working around the wor-d gaining wonderful experience, has to ring me up on return and say, 'UntilI can find work, I am dependent on my parents'? That is an actual truth. When he rang me I thought: I do not believe this, he must be making it up-this is ridiculous. But it is the truth. He was a graduate of school, went overseas, worked, came back very much enhanced by his experiences, needed some support while he resettled and tried to find work, and was told he had to be financially dependent upon his parents. This is madness. AllI can say in conclusion is that I really hope that those more sensible members on the other side of the House, particularly all of those on the back bench who we know share many of our concerns, are given every power that they need to debate this strongly and vibrantly within their own party room. Someone has got to tell the ministers running these insane programs that they are wrong. Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (11.08 a.m.)-I will be brief today because I am sure that a great deal of what needs to be said about the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 and associated legislation has been said, but I think it is important to draw attention to some of the regional variations that occur. Sadly, the story is pretty much the same around the country, but my own experience as the member for Fremantle is one that I would like to put on the record in the context of those changes. One of the things you can say about this legislation is that the need for amendments so soon after the implementation of the initial bill is indicative of poorly thought out policy and poorly 4946 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 thought out programs. Mind you, I think all members could have referred them a great many more problems than those that they are. attempting to solve by this legislation. At base, of course, the edifice of this legislation is very clearly designed to transfer the burden of unemployment and income support to families, including those on very modest incomes indeed. That is one of the reasons that I parted company with the original legislation very early. In addition to shifting the burden from' government to families who could ill afford to support that burden, it represents an attack on the very hard-won independence of young adults. As the parent of a young man, I feel very deeply about the fact that young people are being told at the age of 21, in the case of youth allowance, and even older if they are seeking to study, that they are somehow dependent on their parents. Every other signal that we send them says that when they leave school, particularly, that is the point at which we expect them to start standing on their own two feet--even earlier in many respects. From the point of view of the criminal justice system, they are adults long before that. From the point of view of many of the charges that are made on them in the community, they are adults long before that. We accept them as voters at the age of 18. We understand when they leave school that they will have to make their own way in the world, whether through employment or further study. We accept that they can be married even younger than that and bear children, yet this legislation is saying to young people, basically, 'We regard you as dependants. We do not see you as having the capacity to stand apart from your parents.' It is a very convenient fiction indeed. Young people do not believe that and nor do their parents. They see it as a sleight of hand. In many respects it is a double standard. You only have to look at the Prime Minister's own situation. He has a young daughter. She is working in the work force and yet she is able, because of her father's position, to get a special parking place in Sydney where parking places must be at a premium. So there is some special treatment there of the relationship between father and daughter-in this case, to her advantage. What is happening in reverse with other families is that they are being asked to take on an extra burden when they do not have the means to provide for it. It represents a very considerable addition to what I see as the miserable attacks on the most disadvantaged in our community. Like many, I suppose, I have sat down and asked myself the question: why would this be occurring? Why would any government seek to place a burden on those already burdened; seek to remove support from those already lacking in support? I have racked my brains about that, and I cannot come up with an answer. I cannot imagine a philosophy, especially in Australia, that would allow you to conclude that you solve any of society's problems by shifting that burden. Yet it has happened in area after area. This is onethe tax changes are another-where we have seen support removed. IfI had to really answer the question-and I would find it very difficult-it is probably based on some misguided notion of standing on your own two feet, of getting government off the backs of the people. You hear that phrase very often from people who are quite happy to dip their hands into the government coffers when it is their own privilege that is at stakewhat Galbraith calls the 'culture of contentment'. So if the government need to provide a bailout, for instance, as they have done in various states-and, indeed, as has happened in the United States and other places, wh'en financial institutions collapse-that is fine. Terrific. No problems. But, if it is to provide for the welfare Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4947 of the least well off in the community, that is somehow the government intruding unnecessarily in the lives of citizens. I think that is, unfortunately, the message that is now being put across to a great many in our community. I think it is an appalling shift in the view that Australians have formerly had of government. Look at' some of the changes even in this legislation-which is essentially tidying up the original bill-to reduce, for instance, the rate of the disability support pensions or the amount that those under 21 will be paid. For example, a single pensioner aged 18 to 21 who is not living at home and who has a dependent child will actually lose money under these proposals. This is a further attack on what would have to be described as one of the most disadvantaged subgroups. This is a single pensioner, a young person 18 to 21, not living at home-struggling, in other words, to be independent, and probably for very good reason, apart from the fact that he or she is an adult with a dependent child. A person like this actually goes backwards under this legislation. Seven dollars may not seem like a lot to the architects of this legislation but, let me tell you, to people who have to live on it, on the amounts of money that they have under these regimes, it is an extraordinary situation. Knowing furthermore that there will be further imposts on them with the imposition of a GST really makes my heart bleed. I see these people; they come through my door. They cannot survive and they are not surviving. The government does not necessarily want to hear the stories but welfare agencies are stretched to the limit. The offices of members of parliament have queues of people a mile long in these circumstances where government support is simply not adequate. And it is not that these people are not pulling their weight. They are doing everything they possibly can. This legislation and the surrounding bills are generally indicative of the government's approach to income support for the young unemployed and for students. The only way I can describe it is miserly. Essentially, this legislation is punitive in the approach that it takes and, unfortunately, it is being delivered via a very poor service-and I do not blame the staff for that. I will have a bit more to say about that in a moment. In a sense, this legislation gives us the opportunity to revisit some of the warnings that we made when the initial youth allowance legislation went through. A great many people, including members on our side of the House, welfare groups and youth groups, pointed out to the government that there were likely to be serious problems, as indeed there are. Even so, I must say that even I have been amazed at the volume of complaints that this legislation has generated. What needs to be remembered, I think, is that at the outset it represented a complete loss of income support, or a very substantial reduction, for over 45,000 unemployed young people aged 18 to 21 who were, for the first time, made newly dependent on their families. Many examples have come to the attention of my electorate office, but I will give just one to indicate exactly how it affected many families. This example is of a young woman of 20 who had worked successfully, more or less continuously, and who had lived successfully independently since about the age of 15. I have no doubt that, like most families, her motherand I think it was a single mother, from memory-had provided her with a little additional support, as we all do. We do what we can for our young adult children. This young woman became very seriously ill and was forced to leave her job, so she went back home to live with her mother for six months. That was a matter of necessity; she could not continue to pay her rent; she was not working, so she lived at home. When she recovered and applied· for the appropriate support to find employment, she was told that she could not get any; that she was to be dependent on her mother. Her mother was at the very low end of 4948 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 the income scale but, even so, the young woman was assessed as being ineligible. The additional strain on the family was very substantial, and there were other dependent children. She was amazed that this was the case. A great many people who confront the legislation do not understand what has been done. Most people are fortunate enough not to have to ask for support in this way. When they do ask and they are told that they are not independent, that they are not adults and that they should go back to the parental situation, they feel diminished. This girl, like many in her position, was very upset because it was extremely difficult for her family to support her. Being an energetic young woman she found work reasonably quickly, but for the period during which she could not find work it was extremely difficult. Ultimately she took a job that she did not want. She wanted to get into good employment and to better herself. That was part of her reason for wanting to start again, but she could not; she had to take the nearest thing in order to take"" the burden off her family. I think that the important thing to consider here is the tensions caused by these newly created dependencies. In this case, the mother did what she could for the young adult daughter, but it was obviously extremely difficult for her to manage. In other cases, it is clearly not possible for families to accommodate the people who suddenly tum up on their doorsteps. Sometimes the children have left home out of necessity because family tension has been great. They have needed to leave-to become adults, to set themselves up. I think that is something all of us should think seriously about. If a government really wants to solve some of the problems associated with youth suicide and drug addiction, forcing people into what are already unhealthy relationships is not a very good step to solving those problems. These changes have clearly placed even greater burdens on families. Senator Harradine, I have to say, was right to be incensed that in the tax package no consideration has been given to the needs of these families, as he was promised they would be. There are substantial costs in providirig for the needs of a young adult; it is not just a matter of carving up things a little less generously for the rest of the family. There are needs these young people have if they are looking for. employment-as they would be-or if they are studying. It is not as though they simply occupy a space in a household. They actually have considerable costs, for example clothing and, one hopes, little things like recreationbeing able to go to the movies once in a while. These costs have to be considered. These additional burdens were supposed to be taken into account, and Senator Harradine understood that he had been given very firm assurances that they would be. But, apart from the general tax cuts they were offered, we now discover that these low income families were not even considered in the tax package. And, I might say, those tax cuts for the lowest income earners are very small indeed and are likely to be eaten up entirely by the increases through a GST. I remind members that half the tax cuts go to the top 20 per cent. This relief is skewed to the other end of the income scale, not the end where you would expect it to be. The remaining 80 per cent get the other half. I remind members that the depth of the betrayal of Senator Harradine, and of the rest of the community who implicitly were promised the same thing, is considerable. When asked before the Senate committee what steps had been taken in designing the package to account for this group about whom promises have been made, the government official revealed after some fairly strong questioning that he was not even aware that such a promise had been made. Noone had communicated to him the need to take account of this group. Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4949 Even though these families are clearly in desperate need of financial relief as a result of this bill, they are not going to be taken care of in the tax package. It is one of the amendments that we are not likely to see despite the promise given. It is not altogether surprising that Senator Harradine has been a little dark on the government. But, in the end, it is not a problem for Senator Harradine. It is a problem for the families who have been denied assistance. That is the point of this. It is not the politics of it and the fact that Senator Harradine has been upset by the government's betrayal, but the fact that there are a whole lot offamilies out therewith newly dependent children they have to provide for who are not being given any special consideration-indeed, no consideration at all. Nor was it considered important enough to even follow through on those matters. The other problem with the legislation, which became very clear to me as a local member, was the very unrealistic tests made to establish independence. Some of those are improved a little in this legislation and some are possibly compounded because they are enormously complicated. I challenge any member of this parliament to look at some of the forms that people are now required to fill out through CentreIink and to fill them out with 100 per cent accuracy. I think they would find that they failed rather dismally. In addition, some of the material that is required takes an inordinate number of hours to put together due to the number of attachments required. The difficulty in getting evidence required is very considerable in many cases. Remember that you are dealing here with people who are often not the most able members of the community in terms of their literacy and numeracy skills-something the government has recognised in a very punitive way. Nonetheless, it is true that many of the young unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, are people who have considerable problems in dealing with everyday literacy and numeracy demands that are made upon them. That is why as part of any decent labour market program you need to address those problems, but you need to address them in context and in a way that encourages and does not punish. There are, as I say, very unrealistic tests to establish independence, and people fall foul of them. They make the wrong claims. What happens then? They are called fraudsters; they are said to be rorting the system. They are blamed for the problems that Centrelink has created. I have had many examples of that, and only through the intervention of a member of parliament-in my case through my office-have injustices been able to be reversed. People have benefits cut off, for example. In one case not strictly related to the youth allowance, a gentleman on a disability pension received a letter from Centrelink saying that, as a result of a reassessment of his position that he had not initiated, he was entitled to an additional amount of money. Obviously, he was grateful for that. The money was paid into his account in due course and he settled into what he regarded as the new regime. About three months later he got another letter saying it was a mistake and he had been overpaid and that they were going to take $50 out of his pension every fortnight to repay it. That was absolutely thoughtless. I would challenge any minister here or any member of the bureaucracy in Canberra or any employee of Centrelink to try and live on those amounts of money, let alone have $50 a fortnight removed because of a mistake made by Centrelink. I have to say that that happens not once a week and sometimes not even once a day. But these problems are legion. If the government does not recognise that, it should. It is showing a distinct lack of humanity if it does not follow up on these complaints. We write to -he minister to register the complaint and we get the usual placatory letters back that tell us nothing and go nowhere. 4950 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 I have a lot of sympathy for the Centrelink people. There has been a massive increase in their workload. There have been substantial staff cuts and, as a result of restructuring of Centrelink and the old Department of Social Security, there are a lot of people working in jobs whose rules they do not know. The rules are changing all the time butthey do not know them. What we are seeing are delays and queues and errors in assessment that I have just talked about. , If you look at just a simple thing like getting through on the phone, the most recent figures show that 81 per cent of callers to Centrelink in 1998 did not get past the engaged signal. I have to say that is confirmed by my experience, and the experience of a great many other people, particularly those who try to do the right thing and use the telephone system rather than tum up and queue. That is dangerous because if you get through eventually and make a time for an appointment that appointment might be for two or three weeks later. In a recent Austudy case I know of, a young person had done just that and waited patiently to get an appointment. It was well after the beginning of term time before he finally got to the top of the queue whereupon they said to him, 'You don't really need to be here. You could have done that in writing.' I had been party to the initial application and it was not made .clear to him that that was what was required. As he walked out the door he looked at the form and it said, 'You are only paid from the date of application.' By then nearly a month had passed, during which time he had been living on the bones of his backside, not to put too fine a point on it. He did not get any money for that period even though he had been studying for the duration. That is a fairly typical problem created by the difficulty of getting through by phone and by the long queues. People are having to wait for weeks, in my electorate and in others, to get an appointment for youth allowance and for Austudy, not to mention other benefits. At Centrelink in Fremantle there are currently only four staff working on the youth allowance section-two are working on the applications, one is the manager, and one is the receptionist. Two additional staff were put on briefly to handle the Work for the Dole and mutual obligation schemes. The result is that people just cannot get service, and the staff themselves are in desperate straits. Those staff are under stress, and I have a great deal of sympathy for them. As a result of waiting too long, being given wrong information, and being messed around, people become abusive. Their tempers are short and sometimes there are violent reactions. I do not condone those but I can understand why they occur. . Centrelink staff sometimes ring my office in tears. Do not worry about the recipients of these benefits ringing us in tears. Centrelink staff do it as well. I get anonymous emails from staff members from right around the state complaining about the way they are being treated as employees by this government. The government should be a model employer. It is not. It fails miserably. These people are being asked to do ajob that is impossible to do with the resources they have. The result is a great deal of dissatisfaction and disaffection from people who should regard them with admiration because they do try enormously to do the right thing by their clients-a word I use reluctantly. The government has made a complete botch of this. This legislation, in a minor way, improves some of the obvious flaws, but the fundamental principles are wrong and they are not likely to be remedied by this tinkering around the edges. some aspects of the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 which is before the Main",167,Representatives Main Committee
394,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (11.27 A.m.),"I rise today to speak in opposition toWednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4951 Committee. I say this because I consider that the youth unemployment rate in this nation today, standing at 23.5 per cent, is clearly an astonishing and unacceptable figure. I am also especially concerned about the fact that after three years the current government has only been able to reduce youth unemployment by 18,500. That says to me that more has to be done to create decent opportunities that will encourage young people to stay longer at school. And, while staying at school, young people should give serious thought to whether they pursue post-secondary education at a university, or, alternatively, take up a TAPE course, especially as there are growing skill shortages at the moment in some of the traditional trades. That is happening at a time when apprenticeship training in the traditional trades is actually going backwards. I also indicate my opposition to some aspects of this bill because I consider that growing numbers of our young people are stuck in a rut, a rut of unemployment or jobs without real career aspects, because of the failure of some employers to front up to their responsibilities on the training front. In considering the issue of junior pay rates, I am very firmly of the view that, should the Industrial Relations Commission report recommend that some form of junior rates continue, it is absolutely essential that in that context employers-and I am saying all employers"""""":""'front up to their responsibility to ensure that training is part and parcel of such a system. I consider that young people are prepared to make a variety of sacrifices, provided that, in making those sacrifices, there are guarantees, especially as a result of access to decent training opportunities, of a better working life and career opportunity throughout the rest of their life. I suppose that takes me to the achievements of the Australian Labor Party between 1983 and 1993 when, I am pleased to say, the year 12 school retention rates and the proportion of school leavers who actually went to university doubled. I personally consider that a major achievement of which this nation ought to be proud. In the context of trying to ensure that we went down the path seriously of creating a long-term learning society, over a decade we actually doubled the year 12 school retention rates, which was all about trying to equip people, having achieved the essentials of life from a learning perspective, to build a reasonable and a decent career opportunity in the future. I think that was a wonderful achievement. My problem is that, since then, clearly cracks have developed in the pathways between school and work. That has really occurred over the last three years, and I think it is about time that this government got the message from the Australian community that our young people deserve better than the government is offering. The number of young people finishing secondary education has fallen since the Howard government was elected. This is related not only to a lack of emphasis on and support for keeping people at school but also to the squeeze on school funding. The squeeze on school funding has made it more difficult for the school system to look after career opportunities for our young people. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.32 a.m. to 11.44 a.m. number of young people finishing secondary education had fallen. What also disturbs me is the fact that the proportion of school leavers going to university has also fallen since the Howard government was elected. I consider this is because of government policies which in",176,Representatives Main Committee
395,Mr Martin Ferguson,"Prior to the suspension, I was referring to the fact that the4952 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 ..;ssence mean that children from wealthy families can fill places that are now denied to brighter, hard working children from lower and middle income families. It is almost as if, under the Howard government policies, if you are thick and rich you can get to university, but if you come from a struggling working-class family you may not. Because of the new policies which are in essence best described as 'if you have got the money you can get in', a lot of very bright young people from backgrounds that are not as wealthy are actually being denied an opportunity. That is not just bad for a young person and that young person's family; it is also bad for the nation. It means, in essence, that those with the potential and best capacity for leadership, who can take Australia forward in the 21st century, are being denied that opportunity because of their economic and social circumstances and their personal family background. I also believe that there are not enough training places for early schoolleavers due to deep cuts in support for vocational training and incentives to employers to take on new apprentices. On that note I refer in passing to the fact that this government actually withdrew some of the completion payments that apply to group training. One of the most important areas of apprenticeship training at the moment is, in fact, group training. The withdrawal of those completion payments is an absolute disgrace and it is actually going to pull Australia backwards on the skilling and the trade front in years to come. It is also interesting to note that, since Labor's last full year in government, the number of traditional apprenticeship commencements has plummeted by 5,000. That is going to be worsened potentially by the changes in completion payments with respect to group training. It is absurd that this is happening at the same time as key areas of the economy are also experiencing crucial skill shortages. This is evidenced by a report recently prepared by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business that actually identified, state by state and nationally, the fact that in a number of traditional areas of apprenticeship training we have now got major skill shortages in Australia-at a time when we are going backwards on the apprenticeship completion numbers in those traditional areas. With that in mind, I raise the fact that, as of 1 January this year, the government introduced the so-called youth allowance. The introduction of this government's youth allowance means that many 16and 17-year-olds who leave school early will no longer get any income support whatsoever. Furthermore, many young unemployed people aged between 18 and 21, and their families, are worse off because of this decision. Because of these decisions, schools will clearly need extra resources to meet the needs of these students. The federal Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs-as it was when this bill was originally prepared-put forward a cabinet submission recommending that $140 million be allocated to help schools cope with the extra students returning due to the youth allowance. In January 1998 the Howard government announced some additional funding, but it was $100 million short of the amount recommended in the cabinet submission. I suppose we come to the conclusion that something has gone missing. What has gone missing is not just the financial commitment, the under-budget allocation. More importantly, there is a failure by the government to actually commit itself to doing something in a proper way for these young people. It is all about savings rather than investment in our young people for the future. I probably do not need to remind the House that this piece of legislation was so badly mishandled by the Howard government that its implementation date was delayed for six months so as not to throw the school year out. Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4953 The purpose of the bill, as I understand it, is to tidy up the mess the government created. As such, it will receive support from this side of the House-but qualified support. We understand that the purpose of the bill is not to further reduce entitlements for young people. But, despite the bill's intended purpose, and some of the beneficial measures that the fulfilment of this purpose provide, there are some aspects of it which do further reduce entitlements for young people. I want to makeit absolutely clear that, in light of the appalling situation that the government has created for young people, Labor sees it as its duty to oppose any measures that will further reduce their entitlements. Labor will therefore, firstly, oppose the measure in schedule 3 which proposes that the actual means test can be applied even where the reason for applying it has not existed during the most recent tax year and the family has suffered a substantial decrease in income. Although it is acknowledged that this proposal reflects the old Austudy regulations, its incorporation into the Social Security Act will open up unfair practices. For example, the parents of a youth allowance applicant might have owned a company until January of 1998 when they sold that interest. Under the proposal, in 1999, even though they are being assessed on their income and expenditure during the 1998-99 tax year, they would be subject to the actual means test on the basis of an interest in the company they had not had for 12 months. I believe that this is quite a strange proposa) and extremely unfair. In fact, we are still awaiting advice from the government abou,t the rea'son for this measure, as it does not seem to make any sense. I Labor will also oppose the rate reductions contained in schedule 4 for disability support pensioners under the age of 21. The rate reductions mean that, for example, a single pensioner between 18 and 21 years of age, who does not live at home and who has a dependent child, will lose $7 per fortnight while a partnered pensioner over the age of 18 will gain about $17 per fortnight.. It seems to me that this is a perverse result and will clearly result in a reduction of moneys for one of the most vulnerable groups in the community. It is, unfortunately, typical of the current government's approach to the interests of vulnerable Australians. The schedule also seeks, unfortunately, to provide that the guardian allowance will not be paid to a person unless they are receiving family allowance at more than the minimum rate. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.51 a.m. to 12.04 p.m. allowance is reduced where income exceeds $23,550 plus $624 for each additional family allowance child. Amongst other things, a family allowance child can be a child receiving youth allowance. The problem is that the schedule seeks to amend this so that a child receiving youth allowance is a family allowance child only if they are under 18 years of age. But it does not take into account the fact that young unemployed people are now regarded as dependent until they are 21 years of age and may therefore receive a lower rate as a result of the youth allowance legislation. I believe this is clearly a contradictory result and that is why we are opposed to it. As a third matter, Labor proposes an amendment to the measure in schedule 4, under which the income test threshold for family allowance will not be increased on the basis of a child receiving youth allowance if the child is over 18. Our amendment would seek to provide that a person over the age of 18 would still be regarded as a dependant for the purposes of the",177,Representatives Main Committee
396,Mr Martin Ferguson,"Furthermore, under the current provisions, the rate of family4954 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 family allowance income test, if they are receiving a reduced rate of youth allowance because of the parental means test. Fourthly, Labor will oppose the measures in schedule 5 that seek to reduce the rates of exceptional circumstances relief payment and restart income support payment for people of youth allowance age. Labor will oppose this as it will clearly result in a reduced entitlement for some people. To sum up: the bottom line is that there are not enough training places available for those who want them. They continue to be turned away from a TAFE system which is in danger of falling into neglect. The changes embodied in this bill do nothing to assist such young people who are having enough difficulties at the moment with respect to even getting access to decent training courses. In this environment, the Labor Party will oppose any measures which seek to reduce entitlements for young Australians and their families. Part of our responsibility as a compassionate country is to look after those most at risk of not making a successful transition to economic independence. These young people deserve better than Work for the Dole, but that is what the thrust of this bill is about. It is, in essence, continuing what has become a characteristic of this government-pointing the finger at young people and saying that they are to blame, rather than facing up to the fact that government has to accept its responsibilities and also accept, publicly, that some of its policy decisions have not really contributed to assisting these young people and their families, who are crying out for help at the moment. For that reason I am firmly of the view that building new pathways from school to work means that we as a community have to help those who have lost their way, in essence to try and get them back on course. I do not consider that by reducing teenagers' income support the Howard government was actually trying to achieve the core objective that the Australian community expects of government-to have reasonable policies that get young people back on course. Instead, this type of legislation is more and more alienating our young people and pushing them into a wilderness of despair, a sense of a lack of hope for the future, rather than trying to develop an environment with government support mechanisms that guide our young people into the future and, basically, get them back on course. It must therefore be recognised by this government that there will always be some young people that are simply not suited to some type of institutional learning, whether in secondary schools or TAFEs, and it is no use for the government to say to them, 'We are going punish you for not being able to fit the institutional or the intellectual mould that this government believes all young people ought to fit into.' Unfortunately, that is not the way young people develop in this day and age. They are facing many pressures, many problems, and we have to try and develop a flexible system that accounts for those young people's needs-not a doctrinaire approach based on, 'If you do not do it this way, then you are out on your own and we're not going to offer any helping hand, or income support, even if you're in fairly difficult personal circumstances because of your family background, where you grew up, where you went to school, or the suburb or the'region that you lived in.' That is not the way we are going to solve the problems of these young people. As the other side of the coin, however, we have got to come to terms with the fact that some of these people are homeless and from very difficult family circumstances. Their problems need to be attended to, not only in a very compassionate way but also earlier, if we are not Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4955 to inherit a much worse state of unemployment and social alienation in the future. That is what we are close to ending up with at the moment. That is contributed to by the fact that this government, in its first 36 months, has not only reduced our capacity to get people into decent apprenticeship and training opportunities but has now sought to punish them when it comes to income support. It has worsened the situation by abolishing decent job programs for young people. It has ended the youth training initiative which formerly provided case management for some of those 15to 17-year-olds and it has disbanded SkillShare in favour of the new, hopelessly chaotic employment services market. All of that is not helping. I note recent reports about the fact that, when it comes to intensive assistance, some of those Job Network providers are spending nothing on training for young people. If it is good enough for the government to say to these young people, 'You're not getting youth allowance'-a sense of discipline and compulsion-then it should also be good enough for this government to say to those Job Network providers, 'You are getting very substantial amounts of government funds for intensive assistance. There is an obligation on you publicly to account for how you spend that money and to explain to the Australian taxpayer why, more often than not-and this includes companies such as Drake International-you are not spending on offering training opportunities to our young people.' For that reason, I argue that the government has created a disastrous situation for young people trying to cross the bridge between school and work. I must stress that, in the light of this disastrous situation, the opposition will in principle support the bill but, because of what we believe, we will also front up to the government on its potential weaknesses. For that reason, we strongly oppose some of the measures that I have outlined in my contribution to the debate today. In essence, if you want to get young people back on course, it is the responsibility of the government to offer better than what is offered in the bill before the House today. from people on this side of the House in this debate about the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999. This morning I have been privileged to hear the members for Fremantle and Batman. As the member for Batman pointed out, we are concerned particularly about schedules 3, 4 and 5 of this legislation. I want to briefly address the issues involved with schedules 3 and 4 in particular, because they have the potential to impact, I think adversely, upon many in the community and particularly on people in my own electorate of the Northern Territory. I refer firstly to schedule 3 of the bill which repeals the Social Security (Family Actual Means Test) Regulations 1998 and replaces them with similar provisions in the Social Security Act. Currently, the actual means test is provided for by the actual means test regulations, which are derived from the Austudy regulations: Schedule3 of this bill proposes to incorporate the actual means test into the provisions of the Social Security Act itself. Although the proposed new provisions are structured differently from those in the disallow able instrument, they are of a similar effect. There are, however, some differences. Those were spoken about-and I will not go into them-by the member for Batman in relation to their unfairness, particularly on the basis of an interest in a company that a person had not had for 12 months even though they were been assessed on their income and expenditure in the 1998-99 tax year. I want to concentrate in particular on the negative impacts of schedule 4 of the amendments to the act to address issues identified during the implementation of youth allowance and",179,Representatives Main Committee
397,Mr Snowdon (Northern Territory) (12.11 P.m.),"We have had a number of contributions4956 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 Austudy payment. Firstly, the schedule proposes to reduce the rate paid to some disability support pensioners under the age of 21-this, too, was referred to by the member for Batman-and to increase the rate for others. The effect of the changes varies depending on the pensioner's circumstances. For example, a single pensioner aged between 18 and 21 who does not live at home and who has a dependent child will lose $7 per fortnight while a partnered pensioner over the age of 18 will gain over $17 a fortnight. I do not think you have to be Einstein to work out that that is a regressive move and that, in fact, you are penalising people for being single and supporting pensioners. The other two areas of this schedule I want to address relate, firstly, to the guardian allowance of $37 per fortnight which can be paid to single parents in certain circumstances. The schedule seeks to provide that the guardian allowance will not be paid to a person unless they are receiving family allowance at more than the minimum rate. This, of course, is also unfair. The other element of schedule 4 that I am concerned about is that, under the current provisions, the rate of family allowance is reduced where income exceeds $23,550 plus $624 for each additional family allowance child. Among other things, a family allowance child can be a child receiving youth allowance. The schedule seeks to amend this so that a child receiving youth allowance is a family allowance child only if they are under 18 years of age. This may, of course, be consistent with the treatment of young people receiving education allowance other than the youth allowance, but it does not take into account the fact that young unemployed people are now regarded as dependent until they are 21 years old and may therefore receive a lower rate as a result of the youth allowance legislation. This, of course, is not only discriminatory but also unfair. 5 The way in which we are treating young people under this and other pieces of legislation being passed by this government and being put to the parliament by this government is indeed regressive and does penalise young people, particularly those who live in regional and remote Australia. I say that because one of the interesting exercises which I have been able to witness over the last 12 to 18 months has been this question of independence and the fact that students need to identify their independent status by earning income for 30 hours a week in a two-year period. If you live in a place like Alice Springs, which I do, or Katherine or Gove or any of the regional communities""in Central or Northern Australia-indeed, anywhere in Australia-and you leave school and are required to go away to university, then immediately you are penalised. I have personal experience of a young person who comes from a family which, whilst not well off, would certainly have been well above the means tests. This person wanted to go to university, had sufficient marks to go to university and was bright enough to get admitted into a number of universities. But he could not undertake the course in Central Australia and was required to move interstate to Sydney. Because of the circumstances of his parents and because he did not have sufficient income, nor did they, to pay for his full-time attendance at a university with residential requirements, he was forced to wait 18 months until he had saved the appropriate amount of money to indicate to the government that he was, in fact, independent. I do not think that is either fair or reasonable, and it is a position which pertains to a lot of individuals around Australia. I do not believe that the government have properly thought through the implications of these proposals for people who live outside major metropolitan Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4957 areas. That is something which they need to revisit and which is clearly unfair and grossly inappropriate. The member for Batman spoke about the adequacy of training provision in terms of what is happening to young Australians. I have also had first-hand experience of watching what happens in the bush. The service made available by agencies such as Centrelink to young Australians who work and live in remote Australia is entirely below standard. If you happen to live in a remote community, then the likelihood of getting any service at all out of Centrelink is all but nil. If you require, for example, to visit some Centrelink offices for an appointment and you happen to live hundreds of kilometres away from your local Centrelink office, the possibility of getting an appointment will certainly be up in the air because in some places you will not get an appointment for up to a week. But even if you do get an appointment, it will take you possibly a day to get an appointment to make an appointment. That, of course, is unreasonable. There is nothing within the framework put in place by the government which accounts for the locational disadvantage that people who live in rural and remote areas suffer in the delivery of government services, quite apart from the appropriateness of the level of service in terms of income support or otherwise. I say to the government that this is something which you are being marked down for right throughout Australia. Not only does it happen in this area; it happens basically in all areas of service provision. It seems to me that, whilst you parade yourselves as a champion of people in the bush, you are failing miserably when it comes to the'provision of these sorts of services. In the context of this piece of legislation, you should be examining the particular impacts on people who suffer locational disadvantage because they do not live. in a major metropolitan area. It is something which I know is hurting a lot of people. The member for Batman spoke about educational attainment levels. If you happen to live in a remote part of the Northern Territory, the likelihood of your getting to a high school is very remote. The likelihood of your achieving a successful outcome at a high school is even more remote because a significant proportion of those people who live in remote areas in the Northern Territory away from even smaller towns like Alice Springs and Katherine are Aboriginal people who do not have access to sufficient standards of educational service. I say to the government: if you are fair dinkum about providing services for young Australians, you will address this need. I do not believe it has been addressed. It is something which I have been critical of since I came back into the parliament last year and it needs to be addressed as a matter of some urgency. The way in which you have dismantled the service provision, the training provision, the labour market programs in regional Australia and the provisions that were made available under the old Commonwealth Employment Service, you have effectively withdrawn the services which provided people with the capacity to get access to mainstream services and replaced them with something which gives them access to nothing. This legislation only reinforces the negative view which many Australians have of the way in which Centrelink operates and the way in which the government is providing services to people who live in the bush. I am conscious of the time. I will complete my statement by saying that, whilst there are some aspects of this legislation which will obviously be of benefit in terms of the workability of the act because they are simply housekeeping measures, it can also be said that the general message within this legislation is that not enough care is being taken to make sure that the 4958 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 services and the standard of support which are available are sufficient to meet the needs of individual Australians who live in regional and remote areas. Motion (by Mr Lieberman) agreed to: That further proceedings on this bill be conducted in the House. Consideration resumed from 11 March. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 will amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989-the act. The act enables Australia to fulfil its international obligations as a party to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer-the Montreal protocol-to eliminate its consumption of ozone depleting substances. The act controls the import, export and manufacture of a range of ozone depleting substances, known as 'scheduled substances', by requiring licences for these activities, and by prohibiting the import and manufacture of certain products containing ozone depleting substances. The act is a key element in Australia's approach to ozone protection. It is administered and enforced in conjunction with complementary state and territory legislation and controls, and industry and non-government organisation activities, including voluntary codes of practice. This highly cooperative approach to environmental protection is detailed in the 1994 revised strategy for ozone protection and was endorsed by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council in 1995. The innovative licensing and quota systems, first enacted in 1989, enabled Australia to achieve by 1995 a phase-out of the ozone depleting substances CFCs-chlorofluorocarbonscarbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and HBFCs-hydrobromofluorocarbons. The phase-out has been total other than for a restricted range of essential uses. A total phase-out of halons, except for essential uses, was reached in 1992, one year in advance of Montreal protocol requirements. Australia's foresight in adopting such control measures was most recently borne out in the 1997 Montreal amendment which now requires parties to develop and implement a licensing system to regulate the import and export of ozone depleting substances. These outstanding efforts were formally recognised in 1997 through the award of a certificate of appreciation to the Australian government by the United Nations Environment Program, in a ceremony which marked the 10th anniversary of the Montreal protocol. The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 represents the most recent step in Australia's response to the challenge of ozone depletion. It proposes amendments to improve the operation of the act's licensing and quota systems, and to allow more effective and targeted regulation of ozone depleting substances. The amendments reflect agreed solutions to issues encountered by industry, government and community stakeholders in progressing Australia's phase-out of ozone depleting substances. The decision to implement these solutions through legislation was taken through ongoing dialogue with industry and consultation with the Office of Regulation Review to make the initiatives business effective. This is reflected in the conclusions of the regulation impact",181,Representatives Main Committee
398,Mr Vaile (Lyne,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (12.24 p.m.)-I move:Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4959 statements. As a party to the Montreal protocol and its amendments, Australia must phase-out consumption and production of HCFCs by 2020 and methyl bromide by 2005. The act provides that the import, export or manufacture of either HCFCs or methyl bromide is prohibited unless otherwise authorised under a 'controlled substances' licence. The bill clarifies that, in assessing an application for a 'controlled substances' licence, separate consideration may be given to each activity in which an applicant seeks to engage. Given the proximity of the scheduled phase-out dates for HCFCs and methyl bromide, and that neither substance is currently manufactured in Australia, this proposed amendment will ensure manufacturing is not commenced in Australia by 'controlled substances' licensees without due consideration. Australia's HCFC industry activity triggered the quota system under the act for the first time in 1997. The act limits the total quantity of HCFCs that may be imported or manufactured by licensees to approximately half the 'country cap' allocated by the Montreal protocol, whereby the quota system is triggered. The HCFC quota system will commence from 1 January 1999. From this date, HCFC 'controlled substances' licensees must seek a quota allocation to engage in the regulated HCFC activity of importation or manufacture. The quotas will be allocated for a period of two years. After the first quota allocation, quotas will be based on the licensee's individual activity in the penultimate calendar year before the start of the following quota period. The amendment enables the continued issuance of a 'controlled substances licence' for a two-year period, and further specifies as a condition of the licence the quantity of HCFCs a licensee may import or manufacture within any given year of a quota period. This will ensure Australia's HCFC controls remain equitable and efficient by avoiding possible distortion in the calculation of future quota allocations, for example, if a disproportionate amount of a total quota allocation is imported in the first year of a quota period. It is with the strong and active support of the fluorocarbon industry that this bill addresses this issue. During the development of the bill, the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department identified an area of duplication in the act, arising from its historical development which reflects Australia's changing international obligations. The ratification by Australia of the Montreal amendment to the Montreal protocol which the parties adopted at their ninth meeting in 1997 to ban trade in methyl bromide with ponprotocol countries, means the substance is now more effectively covered by the existing provisions in subsections 18(2) and (3), rather than in sections 42 and 43, which are to be repealed by the bill. Subsections 18(2) and 18(3) provide that it is a condition of a licence granted under the act that scheduled substances, which include methyl bromide, are not to be imported to, or exported from, a non-protocol country. Breach of the licence condition without reasonable excuse is an offence with a maximum penalty of 500 penalty units, currently $55,000. The bill also updates the Montreal protocol text in the act with the addition of the most recent text following schedule 3. The last two amendments will finetune the administration of the act. One allows ministerial delegation of the power to request further information in relation to a licence application. This will shorten the time for licence applications to be assessed and issued. 4960 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 Another clarifies the scope of the exemption from the prohibition on manufacturing or importing CFC-dependent refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. The amendment specifies that the exemption only applies to the import of the CFC-dependent refrigerated transport containers not their manufacture. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived. containers, the global shipping industry still relies to some extent on the existing fleet of these containers and so Australia will continue to permit their movement in and out of Australian ports. While Australia only contributes about one per cent to the total global consumption of ozone depleting substances, it represents a positive role model for the international community through its active participation in international ozone fora, bilateral activities with developing countries and domestic implementation of accelerated phase-out measures developed through a highly cooperative partnership with industry, the community and all levels of government. This bill will ensure that Australia not only continues to meet its international obligations under the Montreal protocol but demonstrates its ongoing commitment to the recovery of the ozone layer through innovative and effective cooperation with industry. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. in the stratosphere, known as the ozone layer, appears to have been declining since about 1960. But ozone loss has become much more rapid since about 1978. The reduction is greatest above the polar regions, especially Antarctica. The decline is not constant, being greatest at the beginning of spring, as the sun first appears after the long, dark Antarctic winter. Although the result is called a 'hole', it is rather a fall in concentration of stratospheric ozone gas. Naturally occurring substances and emissions such as sulfates and chlorine given off during volcanic eruptions are responsible in part for ozone destruction. However, it is human made gases, principally chlorofluorocarbons and halons, following eventual escape into· the stratosphere, which are particularly destructive of the ozone layer. These CFCs contain chlorine and the halons contain bromine. Chlorine and bromine attack ozone and break it down. A catalytic process is involved leading to one chlorine atom being responsible for the destruction of up to 100,000 ozone molecules. There has been concern about the depletion of the ozone layer on a proper basis. That is because the ozone layer reduces the amount of harmful ultraviolet radiation that reaches the earth's surface. The ozone layer is also an important part of the global climate system in which all life forms, including humans, have evolved. Any significant change to this layer can have far-reaching consequences for human health. So ozone destruction is an important issue to all Australians and indeed we are one of the countries most severely affected by the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. The direct human impacts include increased skin cancer and cataracts, and Australia already has the highest skin cancer rate in the world. There is also some evidence of ecological impacts, including phytoplankton in Antarctica, which in tum impacts on our southern fisheries. Ozone depletion is also a global issue, and we have global responsibilities. This includes the Montreal protocol, which aims to phase out the consumption of a number of substances which have been implicated in the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer.

400,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (12.31 P.m.),"As the Bills Digest points out, the ozoneWednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 4961 background to the international legal framework concerning depletion of the ozone layer, we have had the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer providing an international legal framework to address concerns regarding the adverse impact of certain substances on the ozone layer. The convention was agreed to back in March 1985 and was ratified by 165 countries including Australia. The Montreal protocol, finalised in September 1987 and ratified by Australia in 1989, established a mandatory timetable for the phase-out of ozone depleting substances. To meet Australia's obligations under the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal protocol, the Labor government passed the Ozone Protection Act in 1989, which was significantly amended by the Ozone Protection Amendment Act 1995. That legislation prohibits the import, export or manufacture of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and HBFCs from 1 January 1996 without an essential uses licence or a used substances licence. It established a system of controlled substances licences and reporting requirements for the import-export or manufacture of HCFCs and methyl bromide. It introduced two-yearly administrative fees for licences, with the fees set under the ozone protection regulations, and it established an Ozone Protection Trust Fund to allow revenue from the licensing schemes to be directed towards the cost of its administration and industry awareness programs for the phase-out of HCFCs and methyl bromide. As a result of these efforts, Australia achieved a total phase-out of CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and HBFCs in 1995. Halons were phased out in 1992, a year ahead of the Montreal protocol requirements. We froze consumption of HCFCs from 1 January 1996 to 1989 levels and the consumption of methyl bromide from 1 January 1995 to 1991 levels. These efforts were formally recognised in 1997 through the award of a certificate of appreciation to the Australian government by the United Nations Environment Program in a ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the Montreal protocol. So we can see that the Labor government has a proud record in this area, and that the former Labor government played an active role in developing and implementing a strategy for ozone protection in Australia during the late 1980s and the early 1990s. This was done in active cooperation with state and territory governments, as well as with industry. A long-term, bipartisan approach is required to address this problem. The Labor Party is supporting the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 [1999] because it makes a number of necessary amendments to ensure that Australia is able to undertake its international obligations under the Montreal protocol. We are supporting this amendment bill but would like to raise a number of issues in relation to the approach this government has taken on the ozone issue, and I will come to those shortly. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Ozone Protection Act by ensuring that separate authorisation needs to be provided for manufacturing, importing and exporting activities when issuing a controlled substances licence, by allowing conditions to be attached to a licence relating to the import, export or manufacture of the HCFCs, by upgrading and updating the schedules of the act in accordance with international developments, and by narrowing the exemption for refrigerated transport containers which contain controlled substances so that only their import and not their manufacture is permitted in Australia. 4962 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 On HCFCs, we are ahead of our targets. In the area of methyl bromide and halons, we believe that there is some room for improvement. Turning to methyl bromide, although the Montreal protocol requires a phase-out of methyl bromide by the year 2005, the date to which Australia has agreed, European countries have agreed to phase out the use of methyl bromide by the year 2001. Australia was previously viewed by the international community as being a leader in addressing the issue of methyl bromide. We are now regarded as falling behind due to this government's lack of commitment, and I think we need to make efforts here in Australia to match the European target of phase-out by the year 200l. Environment Australia has been responsible for developing the phase-out strategy for methyl bromide. It is now the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and ForestryAustralia to implement the phase-out, and we would question the government's commitment to implementation and, for example, ask: has the government allocated adequate resources to this department to implement the national methyl bromide response strategy? Another issue with methyl bromide is that the controls apply only to soil disinfestation uses. There are no controls on quarantine and preshipment uses. Therefore, the method of accounting for this chemical is very important. For example, there has been an increase in the reported quantities used in quarantine and preshipment uses. We need some indication from the government as to what steps. are being taken to ensure that the increase in reported use for quarantine.and preshipment uses does not increase to the extent that real environmental gains are lost. I turn now to halons. Australia led the world in the phase-out in the early 1990s. States and territories legislated for the removal of halons and the Commonwealth provided a supportive role. These halons have been collected in a halon bank. Other countries have not been as advanced in their halon phase-out and there is now a large black market in halons internationally. The Australian Defence Force has l-d the world in its commendable program to phase out halon use. By contrast, the US Department of Defense is now actively shopping for halon supplies throughout the world, to cover for its lack of action and continuing unnecessary overdependence on halon. Much of the currently banked halon material was provided by industry on the clear understanding that the banked material, above the relatively small amounts required for continuing essential use, would be destroyed. We share the concerns, raised by industries that have borne the cost of phasing out halon, that the halon they have removed on environmental protection grounds and banked in good faith for destruction will be sold off to less environmentally concerned bidders. We are looking for a commitment from this government that the halon bank will not be sold off. It would be an utter travesty if the superior environmental concern and performance shown by Australian firms and government instrumentalities were to be undone by a pitch for dubious export income. In conclusion, we support the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 [1999]. We note that it represents the bare minimum in terms of a government response to the ozone issue. From being regarded in the early 1990s as a world leader and honest broker in the management of ozone depleting substances, we have gone now to being regarded internationally as one of the least progressive developed countries. We can ill afford to be dragging the chain on an issue which has such a direct impact on Australians because we are some of the first to suffer as the hole in the ozone layer grows. Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 4963 will amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989. As my colleague the member for Wills has previously advised, the bill seeks to ensure that separate authorisation be provided for manufacturing, importing and exporting activities when a controlled substance licence is being issued. The bill will allow conditions to be attached to a licence relating to the import, export or manufacture of hydrochlorofluorocarbons. The bill also provides for the schedules in the act to be updated in accordance with international developments and, in addition, the bill includes provisions to narrow the exemption for refrigerated transport containers which contain controlled substances, so that their import and not their manufacture is permitted in Australia. Contrary to what the member for Wills was saying, this bill actually continues to maintain Australia's leading position in the international effort against ozone depletion. I will not be as disingenuous as he, but I will compliment the former Labor government on the work that it did, and suggest that this a further enhancement of that work and something that Australia can indeed be very proud of. The international legal framework within which Australia is operating is provided by the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The Vienna convention was signed in 1985 and has been ratified by 165 countries, including our own. The Montreal protocol, finalised in September 1987 and ratified by Australia in May 1989, established a mandatory timetable for the phase-out of ozone depleting substances. The Montreal protocol dealt with the phase-out of five chlorofluorocarbons and halons. When it was signed, it was expected that a range of CFC substitutes would be available. The dominant substitute, however, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, whilst causing much less damage to the ozone layer than CFCs, is still ozone depleting in its nature. Thus, in 1990 and 1992, the London and Copenhagen amendments to the Montreal protocol introduced a phase-out of HCFCs and methyl bromide by 2005 and 2020 respectively. By the time all developed countries are required to cease bulk consumption of these substances, we will be pleased to see even further progress 'against these amendments to the Montreal protocol. In order to meet Australia's obligations under the protocol, the Ozone Protection Amendment Act 1995 was established to control substance licensing systems which prohibit the import, export and manufacture of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and hydrobromochlorofluorocarbons from 1 January 1996, without an essential use or used substance licence. The 1995 act established a system of controlled substances licences and reporting requirements for the import, export or manufacture of HCFCs and methyl bromide. This bill makes further changes to the licensing legislation to ensure that importing, exporting and manufacturing activities are treated individually in their licence applications. Previously, a licence issued under these provisions did provide scope for the licence recipient to migrate from the area of need that they originally applied for into these other areas of activity. The good news is that Australia has been successful in meeting and exceeding its obligations under the Montreal protocol to date. We achieved a total phase-out of CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and hydrobromofluorocarbons in 1995 and halons in 1992, a year ahead of the requirements. Australia has frozen consumption of HCFCs at 1989 levels and the consumption of methyl bromide at 1991 levels.",186,Representatives Main Committee
401,Mr Bills On (Dunkley) (12.41 P.m.),"The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 [1999]4964 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 Under the current licensing situation, the ozone protection section of Environment Australia-and a number of the officers are here today-are charged with administering the controlled substance licences. Environment Australia inform me that licences under the act are issued for a two-year period, currently 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1999. Eighteen licences have been issued for this period, 14 for controlled substances, 11 of which are for HCFCs and three for methyl bromide. Three essential use licences have been issued-two for the import of CFCs for the manufacture of metered dose inhalers for asthma treatment and one for the import of small quantities of CFC-13, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform for essential laboratory use. One used substances licence was granted for the import of a limited quantity of halon and CFCs for destruction. The changes outlined in the bill will give the federal government greater control over the import and export of ozone depleting substances in the lead-up to their phase-out; and, because there are currently no manufacturers of HCFCs or methyl bromide in Australia at present, the government will be able to ensure that no future manufacture takes place without due consideration. The transport container import and export exemption is being retained in recognition of the fact that there are many containers in use around the world that will find their way to Australia and then be exported again. The government is changing the exemption to ensure that no transport containers using ozone depleting substances are manufactured in Australia. Australia has taken a leading role in meeting and exceeding its obligations under the Montreal protocol. In 1997 the Australian government received a certificate of appreciation from the United Nations Environment Program as formal recognition of its efforts in this area. Of course, we have good reason to support initiatives that will help reduce ozone depletion. Ozone depletion is widely recognised as having a highly detrimental effect on our ecosystems. There is considerable evidence that skin cancers are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which the ozone layer can protect us from. Australia has one of the world's highest incidences of skin cancer and the rates are rising. According to the Australian Cancer Society, the lifetime risk for a white Australian to develop a non-melanocytic skin cancer, is one in 1.5, and one in 50 for a melanoma. ABS statistics show that skin cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality in people aged 25 to 40. Between 1950 and 1994, the mortality rate due to malignant melanoma had slowed in men and fallen in women. This drop has been attributed to earlier detection and treatment during the 1980s. Deaths from non-melanocytic skin cancer, which have been dropping over most of the period from 1950 to 1985, began to show an increase again. The Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria reports that, over a 10-year period from about 1985, the incidence of non-malignant melanocytic skin cancer increased more than 25 per cent. Skin cancer has long dominated cancer incidence in Australia, where it outnumbers all other forms of cancer by at least two to one. Australia, New Zealand and Scotland are leading the world in melanoma cases per 100,000 head of population. North America and Europe also have high melanoma rates which are increasing between three per cent and seven per cent a year. As much as Australia likes to be a leader, this is one statistic where, I am sure, we would prefer not to be ahead of the pack. The fact that Australia has such a high incidence of skin cancer is alarming. That we also know that damaging the ozone layer makes the situation even worse, gives us motivation to act. Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4965 In the November 1996 issue of the journal Nature, a study was published which looked at projected skin cancer incidence under three scenarios. Those scenarios were: no restrictions on ozone depleting substances; reduced production of five ozone depleting chemicals by 50 per cent by 1999 under the Montreal protocol; or the elimination of production of 21 ozone depleting chemicals by 1996 under the Copenhagen amendments to the Montreal protocol. The study assumed full global compliance with the restrictions and no change in human behaviour with regard to sun exposure. The researchers estimated that under each of these three scenarios the news was not all that flash. Under the first scenario, without restrictions, skin cancer incidence would quadruple by the year 2100. Under the second scenario provided for by the Montreal protocol, skin cancer would double by the year 2100. Even under the Copenhagen amendments to the Montreal protocol, skin cancer incidence would increase by 10 per cent in the next 60 years. So any way you cut it, we have some real challenges ahead, only if considering the well-being of the human species, not to mention the broader impact on our ecosystems. Certainly there have been changes in Australian behaviour in the past three years. When members are visiting the magnificent foreshore in the Dunkley electorate, they are all encouraged to wear their shirts, hats and sunscreen. The jury is still out on the rate of skin cancer in 60 to 100 years time. Our research does illustrate that a huge difference can be made to the rate of skin cancer by ensuring that we meet all of our obligations under the Montreal protocol and its subsequent amendments. The irony of the situation is that while most of the ozone depleting substances are released in the Northern Hemisphere, the ozone hole, as it is so-called, appears over the Antarctic and a large part of the Southern Hemisphere. This is truly a global problem. The ozone hole is not actually a hole but a drastic thinning in the ozone layer which is caused by a build-up of ozone depleting gases in the cold Antarctic .vortex over the southern winter. The Antarctic vortex is a phenomenon that traps a large mass of air over the South Pole, which becomes starved of ozone and is then released as the air warms up in spring. Unfortunately for us in Australia, the hole then expands north leaving most of our country exposed to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation between September and December before dissipating. The ozone hole is not the only section of the ozone layer that is thinning. There has been a general five per cent to 10 per cent drop in ozone levels throughout the layer over the past decade. The surface area of the ozone hole over the Antarctic now covers an area approximately three times the size of Australia, or 26 million square kilometres according to the most recent report from the world meteorological organisation. Last September the hole was reported as being the deepest ever recorded for this time of year. This compared with an average of 20 million square kilometres in the last few years and exceeds the previous record for this time of year of 22 million square kilometres in September 1994. The changes we make now will not immediately solve the problem. Ozone depleting chemicals take two to five years to move into the stratosphere so iUs already too late to stop the loss of ozone that will occur in the next five years. The replacement of ozone depleting substances is a considerable area of challenge for us. An important part of the CFC and HCFC phase-out equation is to find replacements for these products. The replacements include HCFCs and, while they break down more quickly and pose less of a threat to the ozone layer, they are still ozone depleting substances. 4966 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 Another replacement is HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons. While they do not contain chlorine, and are therefore ozone safe, there is a large question mark over them because of issues of flammability and toxicity. Hydrocarbons are also viewed as an alternative. They are cheap and readily reliable, but they can be flammable and poisonous and they increase ground level pollution. Ammonia is viewed as a simple alternative for CFCs for refrigerators, but needs to be handled very carefully. I am not sure how many of us would like to indulge in too much ammonia bathing. Water or steam is also being advocated as an alternative for some of the cleaning applications of CFCs. CFCs are all around us. They are in airconditioners, refrigerators, foam insulation, cleaning fluids, industrial solvents, aerosol sprays, dehumidifiers and freezers. HCFCs are also in airconditioners and heat pumps. They are a very real presence in our community. An Australian company based in Melbourne, Esanty Refrigerants, has developed a CFC replacement product called ERI2. My colleague the member for Deakin has been a long-time strong supporter of their efforts to see it more widely introduced into the domestic and international market. ER12 is a hydrocarbon which can be used as a drop-in replacement for CFCs, and particularly R12 or freon-the CFCs used in car airconditioners up until about the mid-1990s. The debate about the best solution for CFCs and HCFCs is one for another day. Ozone depletion is a global environmental concern that can be abated by good policy and decisive action. I acknowledge the good work of a former Labor government in this area and would suggest that the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1998 [1999] is about good policy and decisive action. Today we need to pass this bill to ensure that Australia's record on ozone protection remains a strong one. Debate (on motion by Mr Jenkins) adjourned. Motion (by Mr Lieberman) proposed: That the committee do now adjourn. Regional Australia liberal in its use of the term 'region' and liberal in its frequent use of the term of late. Indeed, judging by the number of times coalition members have uttered the term lately, one could be excused for thinking they had just discovered regional Australia. The truth of the matter, however, is that this government is guilty of ignoring the plight of regions and it has done so at its own political peril. Regional Australia has responded through the ballot box and is desperate to have its voice heard. Now the Liberal coalition is feeling the backlash of regional discontent. I thought regional New South Wales made that patently clear last weekend. YetI believe this government is still struggling to come to terms with what it is really like to live in a region. Consistent with its continuing struggle to come to grips with regional issues is its constant definition of regional Australia as 'the bush'. This government has a clear misconception of regional Australia. Its concept of 'the bush' appears to be simply geographic, that it is stuck out in the middle of nowhere or is the back of beyond. Many regions like my own are not, yet we could be millions of miles away as far as this government is concerned.",189,Representatives Main Commitiee
402,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.57 P.m.),"Excuse the pun, but this government is veryWednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4967 BeforeI am accused of suffering from regional cringe, let me highlight comments made only this week by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston. He described the major breakdown of telecommunication services at Queenstown on Tasmania's rugged and remote west coast last weekend as a 'blip'. The Queenstown Hospital, the major medical and emergency centre for the entire west coast of Tasmania, was without standard telephone services for almost 30 hours or perhaps 29 hours. The minister for communications described it as a 'blip'. As far as this government is concerned, when something like that happens in the region it is a 'blip'. If it happened in a metropolitan area, would it be 'blip'? Not on your nelly. The headlines would read 'a disaster'. That is what I mean about this government's disregard for regional Austral!a. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you and I live in regions that have suffered because of a lack of coherent government policy. Telecommunications is just one area where regional areas like Tasmania, and my electorate of Braddon in particular, feel they are being let down. Take the alarming news of the dramatic fall in Telstra services to Tasmania as reported by the Australian Communications Authority. The provision of new services to major rural areas in Tasmania is in serious decline, falling well behind national standards. Many rural and remote areas are still in a telecommunications vacuum. They do not have services that most people simply take for granted, and now they are being asked to have faith in the government's headlong push to sell more of Telstra. Telstra is being sold off under the pretence of providing better services to regional areas, but where are they? A third of Telstra has been sold off yet King Island remains a telecommunications backwater. Television services in the far north-west and the west coast of Tasmania are lacking or are non-existent, and mobile phone black spots are too numerous to mention. These are services, facilities and choices that metropolitan areas take for granted, so imagine the hoo-ha if these services were 'blipped'. I do not think Senator Alston would be as dismissive of this as he was of the Tasmanian incident. If this government wants to get serious about improving regional telecommunications then it should channel some of the money from Telstra's massive dividends to the government into improving regional telecommunications infrastructure. A start would be to initiate a telecommunications audit in Tasmania. The result would not surprise Tasmanians but it would be an eye-opener for some members opposite, assuming they were interested. But it is not just telecommunications. The issues and challenges in my electorate are as many and varied as they are in regional areas spread across Australia. IfI look at health I see Tasmania's health system in crisis. This is not just the result of the former Liberal government's mismanagement of the area but also the result of this government's failure to fund and support the public health system. I see a lack of opportunity and resources for people to go on to higher education. I see a worsening in unemployment as a damning indictment of this government's treatment of regional Australia. Indeed, my electorate has one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia, but is there a coherent strategic plan to tackle this? I see a meagre, inadequate and offensively titled Work for the Dole scheme. I see a lack of industry policy to help boost regional economic growth, and I see a GST as a threat to the underprivileged, the less well off in the community, and the general consumer. (Time expired). 4968 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 Beaudesert BIue Nursing Service Woodridge State High 25th anniversary of the Beaudesert Blue Nursing Service. The night gave me and the community the opportunity to reflect on 25 years of invaluable service to the community by a service that commenced in 1973 after a proposal by the Reverend Ron Howe at a public meeting. From there the Beaudesert Blue Nurses were given wheels in the form of a second hand Holden Belmont by the local Lions Club, and in its first year of operation staff provided over 4,500 visits to local residents. For almost seven years the Beaudesert Blue Nurses operated from various places, including the homes of staff and from the local dental surgery. Then, in 1981, it took up permanent residence in William Street where it remains today. It is amazing that a service that started from such humble beginnings has grown to the reliable and valuable community asset it is today. Blue Nurses do not charge any fees of patients, so an enormous amount of fundraising is required to purchase vehicles, equipment, and the many other requirements needed. The Blue Nurses have an enormous rural community to service and support but they still managed to make close to 10,000 home visits, travelled over 90,000 kilometres, and supported 548 patients during the past 12 months. The Beaudesert community is also grateful to the Blue Nurses for the palliative care, antenatal and post-natal care, and acute and disabled care they provide seven days a week. All the services are aimed at encouraging independence and enhancing quality of life. I would like to take this opportunity in parliament today to thank all of the nurses, their staff, the volunteers, community sponsors and management for their dedication in providing support services to our frail, sick and aged in the Beaudesert Shire community. I want to give special thanks to the small band of dedicated, caring people who were credited with commencing the service 25 years ago: Jenny Pepper, the sister-in-charge; Elaine Kerrison; Bernie McNeven; Maisie Lewis; and the Reverend Ron Howe. Thanks also go to the present day staff and supporters and management team. Thanks also should go to the Chairman of the Beaudesert Blue Nurses, Alan Robert; to our service manager and director of nursing, Pam Simson; and to auxiliary chairman Debbie Brand. And special mention should be made to Lynley West for the hospitality she showed to my husband and I last Saturday. It was a very special night. I wish the Beaudesert Blue Nurses continued success. In another announcement, last weekend in Newcastle, the national titles of the Odyssey of the Mind competition took place. Woodridge State High School were awarded first place. This was a national event. I know it may seem strange that I am actually announcing this because it is not in my electorate. It is actually in the adjoining electorate of Rankin. I was quite surprised that the member for Rankin did not take this opportunity to make this outstanding announcement himself over the past two days debates. has not done so when something as outstanding as this has happened-a high school in an electorate to get up to a national level.

Student Unionism Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (1.06 p.m.)-In the few minutes available to me, I am very sad that I will have to announce what appears to be the demise of one of the student guilds in Western Australia. In various statements that have been made by the government in recent days, the Western Australian example has been held up as an example of what will happen nationwide with the introduction of voluntary student unionism. Indeed, Dr Kemp, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, has said on a number of occasions that the Western Australian situation is fine. Far from it; the reverse is true. Indeed, the four guilds in Western Australia came out today with a statement that said: During the recent debate on the issue of voluntary student unionism, Dr Kemp and others have made comments about WA student guilds and the effects that similar legislation has had upon our organisations. Dr Kemp has stated that VSU has had a positive impact upon the guilds in Western Australia ... The four guilds then go on to say: We wish to make it quite clear that the Western Australian VSU legislation has had a dramatic and negative impact upon our organisations and hence the ability of our organisations to provide essential services and representation to the students of Western Australia. It is signed by all four guilds: Murdoch, Curtin, UWA and Edith Cowan. Attached is a list of the various services and functions that have been either abolished, reduced or in some way cut back with the exception, however, of Edith Cowan. It does not appear here with its clear list of what has gone wrong. That is because it is about to go into voluntary liquidation. The guild cannot meet costs, including wages, and they are already $28,000 in debt with a further $25,000 likely in redundancies. All student honorariums were suspended yesterday. All casual shop staff will be given notice today-and there are approximately 20 of those. Two permanent staff are still on the books but it is not clear how their wages will be paid. They are looking at a voluntary schedule to keep the shops open. In the meantime, they will need to temporarily close them because they cannot pay the wages. The taverns are breaking even and they will need to keep them open if they are to have any revenue, but they are unsure if they can pay the wages at the taverns. They are going to have to. sell their remaining assets, principally two vehicles. The guild is discussing moving to voluntary administration at the Guild Council meeting on Thursday. The university have already offered to put in an administrative committee and a director to the end of the year. It seems at this stage to be the only way to avoid insolvency and councillor liability for debts. And they have very clear advice that they could be personally liable. That is why they have to look at this voluntary liquidation option. Advice from a local legal firm, Freehill, Hollingdale and Page, says, in summary: ... we are of the view that all members of the Guild Council, as the controlling body of the Guild may be personally liable for debts incurred by the Guild in the event that the Guild incurred those debts when it was reasonable to expect that the Guild would be unable to repay those debts . . . 4970 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 In other words, if these guild councillor students were knowledgeable about the financial difficulties of the university association and continued to trade, they would be held liable for those debts. For students with very little means, that is an extraordinary position to put them in. As I understand it, they have no other option than to move into voluntary liquidation or to effectively have the university take over the student organisation. The Vice-Chancellor of Edith Cowan University, Professor Millicent Poole, was asked just a couple of weeks ago about the success of voluntary student unionism. When it was put to her that it had been successful, she said: No, it certainly hasn't. In fact, it's led to some fairly significant problems for university administration. When asked what the problems were, she said: . . . the university has had to dip into its own resources to provide some of the social, cultural and sporting facilities that students want, so it's put a burden on us in terms of providing very real facilities that enrich student life. She was asked by the interviewer: Has there been any concurrent increase in federal funding for those things? That was a rhetorical question, really, to which Professor Poole answered: No, not at all. And it's also meant that we've had to put at risk what we consider an important aspect which is student representation arid advocacy . . . She pointed out that in 1994, when this legislation was introduced in WA, there were 17,000 members but when she was being interviewed the membership was at 10 per cent, which is about 2,000 students-a huge drop, with a huge concomitant drop in revenue, the consequences of which we are seeing today. What we are going to see in the case of Edith Cowan University is either the complete financial failure of the guild because of that very significant drop in membership, enforced by the state g6vernment, or the university having to take over the services without any additional funding. If that is the brave new world of student organisations and if WA is an example of what is to happen in the rest of the country, then God save the rest of the country. Drugs: Heroin House about my concern about the damage to young people, their loss and the devastation to families due to the scourge of heroin. I proposed in my contribution to that debate that the whole of the community needs to look at some of the broader reasons for this problem. I put forward the thesis that, regrettably, there were people now who were not taking responsibility for themselves and that the basic human instinct requires us to take responsibility for ourselves. I pointed to the consequences to us and to our families, our parents and our loved ones of what we do. I said, seriously and with sincerity, that I believe that some of the experimentation and succumbing by young people to pressure and to the scourge of drugs and drug pushers is perhaps due to their lack of acceptance of the devastation that it causes to themselves and to others. I put forward the proposition that we needed to introduce some form of awareness program, and suggested seriously that the depiction and the actual portrayal to people in society, through videoconferencing and other means, of young people lying dead on the slab in the morgue would be another means of getting it home to people that if you start the experiment of taking drugs the consequences are absolutely horrendous.",194,Representatnes Main Committee
406,Mr Lieberman (Indi) (1.11 P.m.),"RecentlyI spoke in the grievance debate in theWednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4971 As a result of my speech, I have had the privilege of being asked to speak on a number of programs across Australia about it and I have been overwhelmed by the support I have received, including from the media. I acknowledge and thank the media for their interest in this debate. I have not sought publicity for myself but I do feel strongly and passionately that we need to do more. I have also spoken with members of the police force. I believe, without wanting to cause alarm, that the police force generally ilosing some of its morale, because it feels that although its fight against crime in the drug scene and constantly having to be called-sometimes too late-with emergency workers to young people to try and resuscitate them are being publicised, the community does not seem to realise and take more acc.ount of it. The community just walks by and lets things happen, and that is causing a drop in morale. RecentlyI spoke with a policeman whose two friends were killed in a drug stake-out in Melbourneshot down. The effect of that on this young policeman was quite sad and profound. I took the view that all of us need to do more. This program that I put forward is one of the reasons for that, to try and get more people involved. I want to acknowledge and thank the contact that I had from the High Commissioner for Canada, who kindly informed me of a new program in Vancouver in which the media, in conjunction with others, is now portraying the actual devastation in the streets, with very graphic filming of young people being resuscitated and, unfortunately, sometimes not being revived. I understand that the impact of that in the community has been substantial. I hope that, with the assistance of Canada, I will soon be able to provide to members on all sides of the House, and to staff, the media and others, some videotapes of those films-the idea being that we might look at using them as part of our campaign. Finally, and sadly, I also want to thank the families who have been in touch with me from across Australia who have lost a son or daughter due to the heroin scourge. Their conversations with me have affected me profoundly. One family whose son died last year of an overdose said to me that if his body was available they would make it available if it would save one young life and stop one family from having to go through the horror that they went through. I thought that was a fairly substantial contribution. Yesterday I had contact from a mother in a small community near Euroa in my electorate who indicated that she has two sons-believe it or not-who are heroin addicts. One is 20-odd and the other one is 18. She described how she tried to grapple with this. She still loves them deeply and wants to help them. One of them has just gone on the road in the last couple of days after being home for a few days. (Time expired) Moana Primary School: Literacy Program quality of their children's education. The single most important aspect of educational achievement is an adequate standard of literacy. It is the door to educational achievement in all other areas, including mathematics. TodayI want to look at the positive example of a literacy program run by a school in my electorate. Moana Primary School has 370 students. It has made literacy the focus for the whole school for the last three years. The program starts in reception with an evaluation of the child's fine motor coordination skills-put simply, the child's ability to use a pencil. Problems with fine motor coordination are closely correlated with later literacy problems. If a problem is found,",196,Representatives Main Committee
407,Mr Cox (Kingston) (1.16 P.m.),"One of the principal concerns of most parents is the4972 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 31 March 1999 the child is given extra tuition to assist development of writing skills. Then in year I-that is, the first year after reception-all students are given a literacy test. This literacy test, which was designed and is administered within the school, checks each child's ability to sight words and recognise sounds and letters. If a problem is detected, teacher aides give one-on-one tuition in literacy skills for an additional 1Y:z hours per week in three half-hour sessions. These extra sessions continue for as long as it takes over the first two years to achieve a satisfactory improvement. In higher grades, literacy tests are done at the beginning and end of each school year. Ordinary reading classes are broken up into smaller groups, comprising children of similar standard, for more intensive and better focused teaching. This approach has resulted in good readers improving markedly. There is less progress, as you would expect, with those exhibiting difficulties, and less improvement with older children. It needs to be recognised that children have the greatest ability and enthusiasm for learning at the beginning of their school years. It is much easier, and cheaper, to fix literacy problems with early intervention. This demonstrates the folly of not giving sufficient resources to early childhood education. Moana Primary puts together resources for its literacy programs from a number of resources. Schools receive a salary budget that is based on numbers; it is up to the school whether it is used on specialists, such as drama teachers, or school service offices. In Moana Primary's case, available resources are devoted to literacy, including a literacy coordinator, and school service officers or teacher aides. The school also pursues grant funding to support its literacy program. In 1998 it received extra funding from the Commonwealth literacy project, a basic skills grant, early years grants and an early literacy grant, worth a total of $45,000. To date in 1999 it has received a total of $39,000. However, the early literacy grant, which last year was for $6,000, is allocated in the middle of the year. I hope the same amount or more will be forthcoming this year. The Moana Primary School Principal, Mike Underwood, and his staff are to be congratulated for their commitment to improving the literacy and therefore life opportunities of their students. It is much more difficult to help older children after they have suffered long-term literacy problems. For a child with a serious intellectual, speech, hearing or learning problem, eligibility for a negotiated curriculum program is assessed by a departmental guidance officer. In reality, resources are so short for special education that only those few with the most serious problems get any assistance. This kind of assistance is beyond the financial discretion individual schools have within their own budgets. While the federal government has provided some additional money for literacy programs, most of it is renaming existing funding under the disadvantaged schools program. This limited support must be seen in the context of other pressures that are being placed on school funding by the Howard government. These include the enrolment benchmark adjustment which cuts funding to state schools because of theoretical relative increases in enrolments at Catholic and independent schools. Another pressure is the cuts the Howard government has made in financial assistance grants to the states. These are the untied grants providing general revenue assistance. The states spend a proportion of their budgets on education so cuts to financial assistance grants imply a proportional reduction in education funding. A major new pressure on state education systems is the number of students over 15 years of age who will be forced to return to school this year because they do not have a job or are Wednesday, 31 March 1999 MAIN COMMITfEE ·4973 not in training and so would not otherwise qualify for the youth allowance. It is widely known that the minister's own submission to cabinet recommended an additional $140 million of funding to cover these costs, yet only $20 million was provided. On top of those pressures, we may have to add the additional cost on education of the .GST. All these pressures demonstrate that the Howard government has not shown consistent support for literacy.
