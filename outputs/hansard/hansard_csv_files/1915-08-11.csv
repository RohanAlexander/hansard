Can the Attorney-General see his way clear to insist that the 6 per cent, shall not be passed on to the consumer? The honourable gentleman is making arrangements whereby the people ehall get sugar at a fair price, and the grocers are losing profit; and, under the circumstances, something ought to be done. the wholesale distributor is allowed 6 per cent., though, as a matter of fact, he does not get all of that 6 per cent., but only, I think, 3£ per cent., while the other 2J per cent -thoug h I am not quite sure as to the proportion-goe s to the retailer. if is 3 per cent. any mistake, 1 per cent, goes to the carrier. I shall refresh my memory in regard to the matter. I know, however, that the wholesaler does not get the whole of the 6 per cent.; and the retail grocers, when they were before me, carefully omitted to state that they got the sugar, not at the wholesale price, plus 6 per cent., hut that they got it plus, say, 3$ per cent., leaving only the balance to the wholesaler for his labour. I venture to say that the wholesaler has a good deal to do in distributing sugar throughout the country parts of Australia. I have made inquiries with a view to ascertain whether the Commonwealth could do this distribution any cheaper, and my investigation goes to show that we haye not the machinery at our disposal, nor could we create any, to do it at less cost.

Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. regret that this motion should have happened to make its appearance on the day that we are expecting so important a statement as that whicli I understand is about to be delivered by the Treasurer. adjournment motion ? have in bringing this motion forward is to enable the fullest consideration possible to be given to the best means that should be adopted in these troublous times for handling the wheat harvest, the exportable surplus of which, ranging as it possibly will, from 60,000,000 to 70,000,000 bushels, will no doubt be a big factor in the successful financing of the country's operations during the next twelve months. My desire is to enable every aspect of the question, apart altogether from the arrangement recently made by the Government, through the Attorney-General, to be brought under review. So far, the House has been placed in possession of only very indefinite and incomplete information on this subject. That is one of the reasons why I moved the adjournment of the House at this particular stage. I am The honourable aware that on Friday next a conference will take place between some of the partners to this arrangement, and that the Attorney-General has been invited to the conference.

This statement, caref u l l y prepared and presented by the Attorney-General to the press of the country, was as follows: As already stated, the wheat-producing States-New"" South Wales, Victoria, Soutli Australia, and Western Australia-have , as the result of negotiations, decided to place the arrangements for securing freight for transporting the wheat available for export at the next harvest in the hands of the Commonwealth, and the Federal Attorney-General( Mr Hughes) has the matter in band. For some timo past he has been negotiating for this purpose, and yesterday an agreement was arrived at whereby the freight arrangements to be made, by the Commonwealth have been placed in the hands of Elder, Smith, and Co. and Gibbs, Bright, ancl Co., who are to act as exclusive agents of the Commonwealth for the above purpose. Mr Hughes was quite convinced that the Commonwealth's representatives would carry out the task in a way satisfactory to tlie Government and to the producers. It would no doubt be a great relief to the farmer to know that arrangements for the successful marketing of his crop were thus provided for. Speaking as to the amount of wheat that would probably have to be dealt with, Mr Hughes said that this must be largely a matter of speculation, and much would depend upon the season, but a fair estimate on which the Government agents intended to act was that the exportable crop would amount to about",7,Federalcapital Works Reduction Of Working Hours

52,Mr Rodgers,"The first intimation1,500,000 tons. Elder, Smith, and Co. and Gibbs, Bright, and Co. had expressed confidence that they would be able to secure freight which, with that already available, would be sufficient to meet all requirements. The arrangedetails, for I know that the Treasurer has ments made were entirely satisfactory to the Government, and were such that would not be open to criticism. That was the first announcement made, and honourable members availed themselves of the first opportunity that offered to seek from the Attorney-General definite details of the arrangements made. On the 28th ultimo the honourable gentleman was asked in this House the following question:Has the Attorney-General, acting on behalf of the Government, concluded an agreement with Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company, under which they will have the exclusive right to -engage the charters necessary for the exportation of the wheat gathered during the approaching harvest? I shall not read the whole of the question, or others that were put on the same subject, since they are already on record. The Attorney-General's reply wasThe Government have made an agreement -with Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company, and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company, with a view to obtaining sufficient freight for the exState, in the absence of the Minister of portation of wheat and other commodities from Australia, flour being included with wheat. In -doing this we have carefully considered the wheat buyers. I had an interview to-day with Messrs. Dreyfus, and one yesterday' with Messrs. Darling. Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company, and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company are in daily consultation with those firms. ture of the four wlieat States, Victoria, New The arrangements which the Government have made include and depend on the heartiest cooperation of every interest and every agency .concerned in the harvesting, handling, and transporting of these commodities. . . . I have every reason to believe, as the res u l t of deliberate inquiries, that the Attorney-General, prior to concluding this arrangement, had not consulted those interests which are primarily con-cerned in producing wheat in this -country, nor those interests concerned in buying it , in arranging for its shipment, and in financing the harvest. The States, we are told, are to be co-partners w i th the Commonwealth in this transaction, but I believe, from subsequent statements made by the Attorney General, that a f u l l and suflicient conference had not taken place before the making of this arrangement. ' General, in my opinion, entered into it with an insufficient knowledge of the conditions under which the whole of the harvest has to be handled, and of the various conflicting interests connected with it . I shall not weary the House by going into an important financial statement to submit, and that engagement necessarily restricts my opportunity of dealing with this matter. The Attorney-General made a statement in this House that he had consulted all the interests concerned, that they were in harmonious co-operation, and that he had appointed the two firms named to act as the exclusive agents of the Commonwealth. We may take it that, since they were to act on behalf of the Commonwealth, it was intended that they should deal with the whole of the wheat harvest of the Commonwealth, and in view of the Attorney-General's clear statement that they had been appointed exclusive charterers for Australia we may reasonably assume that he would have required the assent of the State Governments concerned to that arrangement. I now propose to read a deliberate and caref u l l y prepared statement made on behalf of the Victorian Government, one of the partners in this arrangement, by Mr. Hagelthorn, speaking on behalf of the Agriculture, which has an important bearing on the subject. In the Argus of 9th inst., the following paragraph appeared :' At the conference of Ministers for AgriculSoutli Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia, which will be held in Melbourne on Friday, a number of questions affecting the disposal of next season's harvest will be considered. The main subjects to be submitted hy the Victorian Minister( Mr Hutchinson) are:-(1) The supply of cornsacks; (2) transport to the seaboard; (3) storage of grain in bags and, if necessary, in bulk. These are the main questions that affect the States only, but the principal question to be considered by the States, in conjunction with the Commonwealth, is the shipping of the grain. We come now to the deliberate statement of the Minister""The present attitude of tlic Victorian Department,"" said the Minister for Public Works( Mr Hagelthorn) on Saturday, in the absence of Mr Hutchinson, "" is that, as far as possible, sh ippcrs of wheat who have been conducting this business for many years in Australia should still be allowed to conduct the business The Attorneywithout any interference by Government, just as in the ease of cornsacks it was decided by Victoria to allow trade to operate through the ordinary channels, and that, as faT as can he gauged at present, is having the desired results. There is no reason to suppose that those en--' gaged in the shipping of wheat are less able to handle the business economically and efficiently than they have in years gone by. In view, however, of thc abnormal conditions at present prevailing, the four wheat States and the Commonwealth will no doubt be able to render some help in supplementing the efforts of the exporters in finding shipping space. Thc financial side of the shipping proposition is of supreme importance, and must be thoroughly thrashed out, involving as it does anything from one and a quarter to two million tons of shipping space, and covering in money probably from five to six millions sterling. The Federal Attorney-General( Mr Hughes), I understand, will be presentThis clearly indicates that the conference had not been arranged by the AttorneyGeneralon behalf of the Federal Ministry, and the probabilities are that a permanent committee, representing thc Commonwealth and the Ministries of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, will be appointed, and will act for all in the best interests of the producers. Tbe preliminaries, have not been handled as they deserve to be, baving regard to the magnitude of the interests involved. It is dimcult to make a pre-harvest estimate, but in the harvest of 1913-14, which was the largest ever garnered 110,000,000 Prompted ments, and moved also by a desire to recover lost ground, the agriculturists the Commonwealth increased the area under cultivation. Victoria, according to statistics that have been compiled, acres have been placed under The prospects every State, and it is therefore to assume that we shall have this year a record harvest. the 120,000,000 how this harvest will be distributed. us look, first of all, to the needs of this country. mately 5,000,000 people, Australia require for home consumption, 6 bushels per head, 30,000,000 Approximately year in the Commonwealth acres, and allowing for seed purposes one bushel to the acre we account for a further 10,000,000 bushels. recent experience, shall never have a recurrence, the people of Australia will naturally desire that a Mr Eodgers. sufficient reserve of wheat should be retained to carry us well over until the f o l lowing season declares itself, and if we allow for 20,000,000 bushels being so retained we have a total of 60,000,000 bushels, or one-half of the estimated crop,, leaving us with a possible exportable surplus of 60,000,000 bushels. for that. Taking the standard price of 10s. per bag, which is not excessive, as the price that w ill be obtainable, we sliall have then an exportable surplus of £30,000,000 worth of wheat. My contention is that, having regard to the magnitude of the interests involved, and to the fact that the export of wheat w ill be a tremendous factor in the successful financing of our war operations, the Attorney-General has entered too precipitately into this arrangement. When he jumped into it he had at the time an insufficient to my way of thinking, knowledge of the great disturbance and dislocation of trade that would result from his action. Since the first step taken by him, however, he has very much mended his hand. In many respects his mind has undergone modifications, and in the Commonwealth, about the task before him is not likely to be bushels were gathered. the easy task which he thought it would prove. In answer to an interjection made by the various State Governa few moments ago by the Minister of Home Affairs, I assure the House that the of only interest I have in this matter is a this year have vastly direct interest as a wheat-grower. Nor In am I concerned with anybody who has any other interest. an additional 1,000,000 are uniformly good in yet know what the agreement is. ing what appears in Hansard and the Let us put it down for press, and I have made probably more sake of an approximation at inquiries than the honourable member has. bushels, and then consider The Attorney-General has told us that Let the Government, through the agency of two private firms, have undertaken' With a population of approxithe exclusive chartering of the Australian will wheat crop, and if we require confirmaallowing tion of that statement we have it in bushels. the records of this House.

56,Reasonable Mr Rodgers,"I am capable of read-hy the Attorney-General in this matter. First of all, I claim, with all deference, that not having said that this step was a war measure, or that it was prompted or requested by the Imperial authorities, he has no statutory authority for directly purchasing on behalf of the Commonwealth through these two agencies the .freights that may be necessary. I question very much if the statutory authority Tests in the Attorney-General as such to purchase freights for the Commonwealth. power over sea commerce is plenary. power over sea commerce does not vest in the> Attorney-General the right to exclude any person from chartering freight anywhere outside Australia and engaging in legitimate trade in the Commonwealth. To-day the export of wheat from Australia is disallowed, but I venture to say that the Attorney General will not contend that when there is a great surplus of wheat he can -discriminate between the man who can ship and the man who cannot ship, or -dictate as to the boats in which he. shall .ship and the boats in which he shall not ship. In the ordinary course of events ,-the embargo on wheat export must be lifted, and the Attorney-General will not set up the argument that he will then -have a right to dictate as to the vessels in which persons shall or shall not ship grain. the agreement is that in selecting two favoured firms to the entire exclusion of their trade competitors, the Attorney General has taken a course which I believe to be subversive of public policy and a firm, which two months after the de-detrimental to.the best interests of the community. I ask the Attorney-General, in all fairness, why these two firms were -selected, and why the whole of the shippers were not consulted, and asked to select from amongst themselves two firms who might, in the opinion of the entire trade, possess the organization, the knowCommonwealth, and that it practically ledge, and the experience in securing charters that would fit them above all others to undertake this work. I regard the the producers-that they are satisfied so -selection of these two firms as a form of favouritism that is very bad indeed in the public life of the country. May I ask the Attorney-General whether this is the first transaction the Commonwealth has had with these firms? Was this agreement initiated by the Attorney-General, or was it suggested to him by the firms themselves? As the result of honest trade and competition there are established in this community many shipping firms, all of whom are reputable. The two firms under discussion I believe to be entirely reputable. I have had business relations with Elder, Smith and Company, and I have found them in business honourable, straightforward, and satisfactory. But I ask the Attorney-General to state the reason why the two firms mentioned are the elect of the Commonwealth in respect of the wheat charters. I find that the Attorney-General is to be asked by an honourable member in this House whether Elder, Smith and Company were agents for Beer, Sondheimer and Company, of Frankfort, prior to the outbreak of the war. What the answer of the Attorney-General may be I do not know. it. for me fo wait for the Attorney-General's answer in this) matter, for I find in the Shipping and Commerce Journal-the motto of which, by the-way,-is, ""The Great Objective, the Advancement of Austraha"" -date d 1st October, 1914, two : months after the declaration of war, an advertisement by Elder, Smith, and Company. That. advertisement sets out the capital, business, and agencies of the company, and declares the firm to be agents My second reason for opposing for Beer, Sondheimer, and Company, of Frankfort. Therefore, I need not wait for information from .the Attorney-General, but I think the honourable gentleman owes it to the community to explain why claration of war announced that it was still an agent for an enemy' firm, has been made the elect of the Commonwealth. My third reason for objecting to the arrangement which the Government have made is that I believe it to be an unnecessary interference by the disturbs the wheat trade in all its ramifications. I take this view on behalf of long as they have the free markets of the world for their surplus production. They are always prepared to pay the world's price for freight.

As is well known in the trade, full commission of 5 per cent, is allowed by the ship-owners.

In 1911-12 the sailing freight from Australia worked out at an average of 25s. lOd. per ton, and the steam freight at 29s. 5d. per ton. In 1912-13 the freights were 33s. 5d. and 39s. lOd. per ton respectively. difference, does it? of Home Affairs would allow me to proceed. In 1913-14 the freight charge for sailing ships was 31s. 5d. per ton; and for steam-ships, 31s. 2d. per ton to the end of January. In April, 1904, a curious position was witnessed, in that the freights declined to 21s. 5d. per ton, owing to a heavy fall in the River Plate rates consequent upon heavy rains in that country.

House to continue my remarks. point out that there is a specific standing order dealing with this matter; but, of course, it is within the competence of the House to extend the time allotted to the honourable member. Isi t the pleasure of the House that the honourable member be granted an extension of five minutes? crux of the matter: Is this arrangement, however it may be finalized-seeing that it will disturb the ordinary and regular course of wheat operations in this country in the interests of the producers? I challenge the Attorney-General to say that it represents anything more than a pious hope on his part that it will do so. Crediting him with the best possible motives, I tell him that the shipping interests on the other side of the wcrld determine freights, and that any arrangement he may make within Australia will not result in reducing the world's freight charges. Two of the greatest wheat shippers in this country, Messrs. Dreyfus and Messrs. Darling, have their own arrangements for chartering in other parts of the world. Other operators in Australia employ some of the keenest wheat charterers it is possible to get anywhere. Of my own knowledge, I know what clever men they are. I do not believe that any arrangement the Government can make will take the place of the ordinary trade channels. I tell the A t torney-General that it w ill be impossible to get the buyers back, excepting by a joint undertaking by the Commonwealth and the States. Much, of course, depends upon the ability of big firms to make a successful bargain in the charter of tonnage. Two forces operate in this connection-thei r ability to sell their cargoes abroad, and to outstrip each other in the matter of freight. The Attorney-General is asking the lion and the lamb of the trade to lie down together. He is seeking to disturb the arrangements which make for competition. The action of the Government has brought the wheat buyers together in conference in self defence, and has forced them to make common cause. The Government will never be able to restore that keen competition that has been the life of the trade, and the oue protection to the farmers, always giving them a fair margin. If the price fixed is persisted in , it means dividing a war fortune of between £75,000 and £S0,000 between two firms; but I am pleased to hear the Ministerial statement this afternoon that it w ill not be insisted on. That w ill mean some relief to others concerned. Have not those who have for years successfully carried through the financing of the wheat export business no vested interests? Have their employees none? Have the export charterers and their staffs no interest? If they had won their positions in the Public Service, no Minister of the Crown would dare to tell them that their livelihood was gone, and that they must stand aside because the exigencies of the case demanded it . This is only another of those cases where State interference in the broadest sense may dislocate trade, but can never restore it . Every State which, in this country, has attempted to regulate shortages in production has failed. I believe blunders have been made practically by every State. Later, when the Attorney-General is putting his referenda proposals before the country he may say, "" On previous occasions the charge made against us was that our Socialistic ideals were experimental."" rangement disturbs private arrangements and private trade, putting the Statei n place of private enterprise. This w ill be another argument used by the Attorney General later on in urging that the State can better control these matters. able member is now going beyond the question before the Chair. that aspect of the case at present. Has the Attorney-General taken into f u l l cognizance the fact that wool is a competitor with wheat for freight space? That freight is fixed in Melbourne, probably through London arrangements; but it is fixed here every year. It may be claimed also by the Government that fhe arrangement for freight space for meat has been entirely satisfactory.

I believe that the arrangement will be unworkable. will be impossible for this one channel to amicably and satisfactorily allocate between the various interests in the different States the space that will be ordered or required. The arrangement is not in the best interests of the country, and the Attorney-General will serve the country well if, before it is too late, he attends on Friday next the Conference called by the States, and puts the matter on a better business basis than it is at present. I offer no excuse for bringing the question forward. WhatI have done I have done, in the public interest. If we are to have fair competition for the coming harvest, there must be as little State interference as possible, and the freest possible flow of trade.

I can conceive of no better way to advertise the circumstances m which Australia finds itself, and thus hamper Commonwealth and States, which, after all, have some right to speak with authority in this matter, since they represent all sections of the community, than that which the honourable member has taken. He has criticised the proposals of the Government without understanding them, and without even knowing what they are. He has condemned our action; but he does not in the least know what tliat action is. The one word of commendation which he saw fit to utter in regard to the Government proposal is that these two firms are reputable firms, but that one of them has been undoubtedly connected with the Germans. If the honourable member had commended us a little more, we should have been utterly undone. The only part of his speech which I thoroughly appreciated was that in which he left the question of wheat freights and launched into a denunciation of Socialism and the referenda-subject s on which he was apparently much more at home, but on which he knows even less than of the GoIt vernment's policy on wheat freights. He has hatched this afternoon the monstrous egg which he has been so long incubating, and which I besought him to sit on a little longer. However, he declined to do so, thus preventing the Prime Minister making his financial statement. He told the country that we are in a very parlous state, because the Commonwealth dares to lay its iconoclastic hand upon vested interests. There are in this country great interests which, apparently, we must in no circumstances touch, even to benefit the producer. Yet the honourable member says he is the friend of the producer. The honourable member said it wag by competition between these great vested interests that the farmer got a fair price; that the proposal that the Commonwealth and States should act jointly for the benefit of the producer would have the effect of preventing that competition, and reducing the price that the farmer will get for his wheat. His statement, boiled down, is that the endea[4.5] -The honourable vour to secure the co-operation of every interest in this country will be to the detriment of the farmer. I put that statement on one side as too childish to consider. Of course it is abundantly clear, as the honourable member knows, that the wheat shippers are not going to hand over their interests to any common pool, but propose to carry on their own business in their own way, so far as they are allowed to do it, each getting as much business as he can for himself. I come now to the question of freight. The honourable member complains that we made a bad bargain, that we ought to have made no bargain at all, but should have left things alone, for by leaving things alone, so he says, freights would be easier. Shortly, that is his argument. It is one that will not bear a moment's investigation. If any one will consider for a moment the present position of the freight market, and bear in mind that from 20 to 25 per cent, of the world's mercantile marine is now out of action, either interned, at the bottom of the sea, or engaged in transport work, he will realize what would probably happen if nothing at all were done to organize freight. The honourable member quoted freight rates at 25s. some years ago. I was unable to see",13,Honourable Members Hear Hear
89,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Attorthe relevance of his quotation. Does the honourable member not realize that if wheat were at the price it was two or three weeks ago in London, and freights were at the rate they were at that time, the farmer could not hope to get more than 3s. per bushel for his wheat? Does not the honourable member understand that the whole question is one of freight? member not understand that in the freight market, as in every other market of the world, the more operators there are the higher will be the rates? I take his own argument. He says that the more competitors there are for the farmers' wheat the higher w i ll be the price. Does he not see that if there is only one operator in the freight market it is absurd to say that that will make for higher freights ? to alter it . crete case as set out in the Argus of yesterday, and based on the opinion of the London TimesTke Times of June 30 states that freight rates and the price of grain have during the past few months heen moving strictly in unison. When grain was rising in price, freights also advanced, and lately, when grain was falling heavily in this country, freights likewise declined. They dropped because, with wheat markets in so weak a condition, there was no inducement to merchants to charter tonnage, and now, with the price of grain holdable member has already spoken. ing its own again, freights are once again firmer. Fifty shillings a ton was yesterday paid for the voyage from River Plate ports to this country, which compares with 42s. 6d. accepted a few days ago. The recent movements show how quickly freight markets answer to any falling off and increase in demand, and, incidentally, that there is no "" ring"" in the cargo steam-ship market. It was competition among the merchants themselves which forced the freights up to their extraordinary level, and the most natural preventive of any similar movements in future would be a perfectly cool attitude among the merchants. That is. a plain statement in the commercial columns of the Argus, dealing with a principle as old as the hills, that the more buyers the higher the price. This is a fundamental principle that operated long before our time and which w ill last u n t i l long after. The Commonwealth is acting on that principle, and is organizing for freights through one channel. All sellers of freight must deal through that one channel: Thus we have reversed the position; there are many sellers, but only one buyer. We are acting on behalf of all the producers of Australia, and in their interests, when we say that there shall be only one buyer of freights so far as wheat is concerned, and that that buyer shall be the Government, representing the whole of the people of Australia. In the face of this I do. the honourable member says that we have not given consideration to the interests of the fanner. He utterly fails to appreciate the danger in which the farmers stand, for while it is quite true, as the Times says, that the freight market rises and falls with the value of the commodity which is to he carried, we must remember that our wheat represents hardly 5 per cent, of the world's requirements. We must secure freight at a reasonable x ate and in sumcient quantity, and the arrangements we have made w ill effect that if anything w ill . I have no extravagant opinions on the matter, L e t me quote a conbecause, no matter what we might do, we cannot place on the surface of the water the 25 per cent, of the shipping that has gone. But, acting on behalf of the whole of the people of Australia, and on behalf of those who have wheat to sell, we can provide one channel, and secure freight on the most reasonable terms. swer one question ? ther, that in every step we have taken we have endeavoured not to disturb any existing agencies or interests. sought the active and cordial co-operation of every agency. you did not do so in time. able that some gentlemen would never be satisfied, and I do not hesitate to say that one particular interest is responsible for all the noise that we hear abroad to-day in connection with this particular matter. that when the State Government in Victoria appointed one particular seller nothing was heard by way of criticism, but when the Commonwealth steps in to do a service on behalf of the community, we",14,Honourable Members Hear Hear

This firm gave me no of freedom to trade. The fact is we are proceeding along sound business lines. We are endeavouring to secure, and we are securing, the active co-operation of all selves away from their German interests at the agencies interested in this matter in all the States of Australia.

There has been a meeting in this city of the Overseas Shipping Companies, and they also have approved of the arrangements which we have made. sons concerned. They are not the producers. the representatives of the various States shall meet on Eriday to consider other aspects of this matter. But I want to make it clear that the arrangements made in regard to freight, .whereby all freights shall proceed through the Commonwealth agencies, is definitely fixed. I had the positive assurance on Wednesday or Thursday of last week, from Sir Alexander Peacock, the Premier of Victoria, that no attempt will be made by Victoria to disturb the arrangement already arrived at. Sir Alexander informed me that he had no doubts as to the wisdom of the course adopted by the Commonwealth Government. The honourable member thought fit to say something about Elder. Smith, and Company. them personally. championship from me. If I may say so, without offence, it was a very contemptible the honourable gentleman himself. thing for tbe honourable member to do. If he was going to tell the story, he should that was the rate. have told the whole story. story is that when the war broke out amongst all the firms that were tied neck and crop to the Germans, Elder, Smith, and Company was the only firm that had the manliness, courage, and decency to cut themselves wholly free. Whilst this firm was never tied to Beer, Sondheimer, and Company, they held a number of shares in the Elder Metal Company, and they went into voluntary liquidation at the very first opportunity. Honorahle members are aware that I have been diligently pegging away at this matter almost from the moment that the present Government trouble whatever. They did not have to be invited to do what every one of tbe firms should have done. They cut thema loss to themselves of many thousands of pounds. They incurred heavy obligations which at the end of the war they may have to meet. They did not hesitate to do so. After what the honourable member for Wannon has said, I think it is only fair that these facts should be made known. Having heard what I havo had to say, I think the honourable member should accept the position as I state it. thing to be said against Elder, Smith, and Company, but as a firm I know nothing against them, and the honourable member did not dare to advance anything. I never before met one man connected with these firms. I am perfectly satisfied that both firms are firms of good reputation.

122,Mr Richard Foster,"I was glad practical dealing with these big firms w i l lsay, what I say now without fear of contradiction, that very often a very considerable proportion of the 5 per cent, discount goes into the hands of the farmers in the shape of better prices for their wheat. Minister has disturbed existing interests because at least two firms, possibly more, operating in Australia practically do not deal with brokers for charters. It is in London where charters are engaged, because it is there that the wheat is sold. In London, those two firms have, in connection with machinery for chartering purposes alone, a secret service by which they know the position of nearly every bottom on the ocean. It happens very often that a big operator in his London house, if he cannot obtain the price he wants for a shipment of wheat, can get the man to pay a trifle more, or get the charterer, who is on the spot, to take less. With that kind of machinery in London he can very often make a deal which would fall through if he had to cable to Australia. A firm I know ofI do not propose to mention the namehas its machinery in London, and at a considerable annual cost the machinery is kept going. But under this arrangement there will not be anything for that expert piece of machinery for chartering, and chartering alone, to do for twelve months. However, I do not intend to go into any details. The Attorney-General told us on the first occasion, in answer to questions, that he had the approval of several State Governments, which he named, and which I think included all the wheat-growing States except, possibly, In the circumstances, seeing that we have Western Australia, as he had not an opportunity to conclude an arrangement with thab State. indeed, if such were the fact on that occasion, that there is to be a conference ference has been held before concluding of Ministers of Agriculture from the wheat-growing States held this week, and that the president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce in Melbourne has invited the chamber in each wheat-growing State to send two members to meet in conference here on Priday. I take it that each Chamber of Commerce will select from its members two men in the wheat trade. sured us to-day, the only thing concluded has been the employment of two firms as exclusive agents-if there has been no other arrangement absolutely concluded, I urge the honourable and learned gentleman to meet in conference the men who Mr Richard Foster, will represent the trade interests, and put every phase of the question before him. If the trading interests are thoroughly satisfied, I consider that an arrangement such as has been indicated The by the Attorney-General will be for the benefit of the Commonwealth. And, while a wrong step may have been taken which cannot be retraced, I believe that the wheat-buyers will be patriotic enough to co-operate, because without earnest and sincere co-operation this scheme cannot be as successful as it ought to. Still, I regret that every penny of the discount of 5 per cent, is not to filter through the ordinary channels-whic h must be the best and most expert machinery-that have handled the wheat business of the Commonwealth for the last forty or fifty years, and has not only shifted the surplus to the Old World, but gone a very long way to assist in financing the harvest. The effect of the action of the Attorney-General, instead of checking the middleman, has been to introduce into this business a second middleman with vested interests, if we are to talk in this connection about such interests. I hope that as a result of this discussion the Attorney-General will not conclude the agreement until the conference of State Ministers of Agriculture, to assemble on Priday next, has finished its deliberations. Before making up my mind as to whether the agreement requires to be discussed here, I would like a copy to be tabled, so that I might be able to ascertain really what are its provisions. had from the honourable and learned gentleman to-day an admission that cerIt seems very strange tain details have yet to be settled, I think that he might well wait until the conthe agreement with the agents he has appointed. speech that he would submit the matter, and take the judgment of the House on it. before putting his signature to the docuI f , as the Minister asment the Attorney-General will wait to hear the views of the Ministers of Agriculture, who, I believe, have already entered into communication with other interests in addition to the shipping interests.

The Attorney-General has acted without sufficiently consulting all the interests involved, though, no doubt, it is the desire of the Government to protect those interests. By giving to two shipping agents a monopoly affecting a very large freight, the Government is practically ruining shipping brokers who have spent their lives in building up their businesses, and who should, with the other interests involved, have been consulted. I hope that on Friday the Attorney-General will consult with the Ministers of Agriculture regarding the agreement, and that if a wider consultation is possible, he will consult also with the representatives of all the interests concerned, so that an agreement may be arrived at which will have the hearty approval of the growers of wheat, and of those who control the machinery for the effective marketing of wheat in London.

Whether it is a fact that a further number of Norwegians have been admitted into Western Australia under contract conditions ? 2. If so, what action does the Minister propose to take to enforce the Contract Immigrants Act? absence of the Minister of External Affairs may I say that the answers to the honourable member's questions are1. An additional number of 143 Norwegians, making the full complement for the work of this season (extending over a period of four months) arrived at Point Cloates on the 3rd July under the same conditions as the first batch. All of these men return to Norway at the end of the season. 2. The Customs authorities had previously been instructed to notify the Western Australia Whaling Company of the necessity of obtaining approval of the terms of contracts under the Contract Immigrants Act before any further men landed. Through a misunderstanding on the part of the Customs authorities the company believed that such requirement was intended to apply only to future seasons' operations, and that my decision as to what action should be taken against the company, which decision I was only in a position to make on the 3rd July, before I knew of the arrival of the last batch referred to above, would probably cover the whole of the men engaged for the present season's work. I may further add that these men are virtually partners in the enterprise, and that there is no power under the Act to prevent them continuing at work. The whole of the agreements, however, so far as they relate to shore work, are null and void, but after giving the fullest consideration to all the special circumstances of the case, I have decided not to prosecute the company in respect of any of the men engaged for this season's operations. asked the Minister for the Navy, upon notice1. Whether the Minister of Defence is aware that licensed hotels are being utilized as reCTuiting places in the country districts of Victoria? 2. Whether this is being done with the knowledge of the Minister? 3. Whether the Minister will take steps to stop further employment of such places for recruiting purposes? honourable member's questions are1. No. 2. No. 3. In country districts, except Ballarat, Bendigo, and Geelong, the recruiting arrangements are made by Mayors and Shire Presidents. As far as is known the recruiting offices are situated at the various Town Halls and Shire offices, but inquiries are being made as to whether licensed hotels are being used as recruiting places in any localities. Ifi t is found that such is the case, immediate steps will be taken to remedy such a state of affairs. RE D CROSS FUND . Minister, upon noticeI n the momentary 1. Whether the Prime Minister has given any attention to reports appearing in the daily papers in regard to the immense sums of money being collected for various funds, including that of the Red Cross? 2. Whether the latter fund is or is not directly connected with the Australian Imperial Forces, now at, or being sent to, the front ? 3. Can the Prime Minister say in what way and .by whom this fund is controlled and distributed ? 4. If the Red Cross Fund is one directly connected with our Forces, should not the Government have some control, or at any rate be represented upon the central body which is directing this fund? 5. Is the Prime Minister aware that much dissatisfaction is being expressed that no information is published or audited balance sheets made available, so that the public may definitely know the destination of these moneys, and how and to whom they are distributed ? honourable member's questions are1. On the 16th July, 1915, a circular letter was addressed to the Premiers of the several States asking for full particulars of the different patriotic funds, showing the purposes to which they are devoted, the amount subscribed, and, if possible, the proposed method of distribution in each case; and suggesting that some scheme of co-ordination should be devised in regard to these funds. Earnest consideration was invited bf the question of the appointment of some central and properly representative body in each State for the control and distribution of the funds. 2 and 3.

Did Wages Board rates commence at the time the men embarked at Townsville and Cairns respectively, assuming any men were engaged; if not, what were the terms and conditions of their engagement? honourable member's questions are1. No. Men were, however, engaged at Townsville and Cairns to complete the erection of the station under construction at Woodlark Island. 2. The men so engaged were paid the rates obtaining at Woodlark Island, viz., labourers, 16s. 8d.; carpenters, plasterers, plumbers, and painters, 20s.; foremen, 23s. 6d., per day of eight hours-forty-fou r hours constituting a week's work. 3.

207,Mr Spence,"It is not sauerkraut?and the answer I received there to my complaint was that there were 20,000 additional men to train, and that it was difficult to find oflicers to give them the requisite instruction. If the Minister would give the sergeant-majors a chance, the difficulty would disappear. . They are well fitted to occupy higher positions; and if the Minister would do away with a little of the class feeling existing in conbut, judging by appearances, this war will nexion with the Army to-day, and give a few of the non-commissioned officers an opportunity to demonstrate their fitness to hold commissions, he would experience no difficulty in securing competent omcers to train the men. that the officers' schools of instruction should be expanded. Leader of the Opposition that that would be a wise course to adopt. Some of our sergeant-majors should be given commissions and afforded an opportunity to fill positions that are being given to-day to militia officers. Those who are not prepared to enlist should not be encouraged in the attitude they take up by being appointed to the good positions that are offering in Australia. I recognise tliat among our militia officers there are young men who have volunteered for service abroad, but who have not been allowed to go to the front because their services are required at home; and my objection applies only to those militia omcers who have not volunteered, and will not do so. They realize that by staying at home they can obtain good appointments worth about £700 a year. It is unfair that a major fighting in the Dardanelles should receive no more than an officer of thf* same rank placed in charge of a camp at Ballarat or elsewhere in Australia. The one man is risking his life, while the other is taking no risk, and is making no sacrifice. Wheni t is suggested to the Department of Defence that sergeant-majors should be given the opportunity to fill these positions, the reply made is that we have no one to take their place. I would point out that in Ballarat there are one or two retired sergeant-majors of the British Army who are anxious to serve the Commonwealth. One of these, Sergeant-Major Burrowes, superintendent of the Benevolent Asylum, is in the very prime of life, and has offered his services. He is willing to do anything to assist the Commonwealth. There are dozens of men of this class throughout Australia, and they could be made acting sergeant-majors, and could do the work being done by the sergeantmajors. In regard to the instruction of officers, no man under the age of twentythree is permitted to enter the schools. I recognise that we should not send men under that age to the front as officers; last a long time, and we must look into the future. We have not only to train officers to send abroad. There are plenty of brilliant youths in tbe community who have passed severe examinations, and who could be qualified by twelve months' instruction to take military positions in Australia. The Defence Department would, be well advised to allow those young fellows to enter a school of instruction. By a course of study, they would become competent to take the place of many permanent oflicers, some of whom are anxious to go to the front, but who are not permitted by the Department to do so. I trust that some action will be taken in regard to ..the militia omcers in the camps. We must not encourage the officers who are showing "" cold feet"" at this juncture. We must not give them the good positions. Let us give an opportunity to the sergeantmajors to fill these positions. In times of peace they have done splendid work in building up the defence scheme, and they are receiving to-day no encouragement from the Defence Department. There is another matter of importance. I have heard that a person at Ballarat with a German name has been the successful contractor for the supply of certain articles to the Defence Department. Another person of strong German proclivities has been appointed to a position. To my mind, the position is serious, and we ought to make very full inquiries before we appoint any one with a German name. I feel sure that if we we were in Germany we would not be treated as considerately as we are treating many Germans to-day. sire to say a few words in regard to camp drill instructors, concerning whom a question appears on the notice-paper. To my knowledge, an experienced man who has had active service, and is well qualified to act as drill instructor, but who was refused for active service on account of age, has proffered his services to the Department in the capacity of a drill instructor",27,Selection At Broadmeadows

I cannot conceive of anything more prejudicial to ova recruiting campaign than to have invalided soldiers, after having rendered this country such gallant service, kept without pay. wish to bring under tbe notice of the Minister of Home Affairs the method that is being adopted in regard to the engagement t>f men at Broadmeadows, or any other place where work is being carried out by his Department on behalf of any other Department. If , for example, there are six vacancies for carpenters -or labourers at Broadmeadows, instead of the Department selecting that number of men to fill the positions it probably sends out fifteen or. twenty applicants to the officer in charge of the work, who is intrusted with the task of making a selection. I say that this plan inflicts a hardship upon men who are unemployed. It puts them to unnecessary expense and trouble in travelling to Broadmeadows, and .possibly having to return to the city again. I trust that the Minister will take the matter into his consideration with a view to devising some better method of selection. General) [5.34] -In reply to the honourable member for Darling Downs, I wish to say that the arrangements made at the other end for the delivery of letters are in the hands of the Defence Department. My information is that those arrangements have recently shown a very considerable improvement. Indeed, I think they are now about as good as they can be made. Admittedly,great difficulty is experienced in tracing the wounded. The two Departments, however, are co-operating with a view to making the postal arrangements as perfect as possible. In regard to tbe matter of assistance to mail contractors and othera affected by the drought, the Deputy Postmasters-General were authorized some' time ago to make an additional allowance to postmen who have to pay an increased price for fodder for their horses. If the honourable member has any I specific complaint in that connection, I shall be glad to have it investigated. If claims are Question resolved in the affirmative.
