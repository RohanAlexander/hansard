Whetheri t is a fact that when arrested on the 24th October, -1917, William J. Fegan, of Brisbane, was under a surety bond of Â£50 (pursuant to Magistrate's order) not to do anything contrary to the War Precautions Act? 2. If so, has the said surety been estreated, and if'not, why not? 3. If Mr Fegan did nothing contrary to the War Precautions Act which justified the estreating of the sureties, why was he arrested and interned in Darlinghurst Gaol, Sydney, for the past twelve months? 4. Isi t a fact that Mr Fcgan holds a letter from Brigadier-General Irving, stating he was being arrested in consequence of a letter published by him (Fegan) in the Brisbane Daily Mail newspaper, and also in consequence of his evidence at the subsequent trial? 5. Is it a fact that he complied with the Magistrate's judgment by paying the fine and costs, amounting to Â£12 Ss. Sd., and giving the sureties required ? G. If so, was not his arrest and detention contrary to section G of the War Precautions Act, which provides that no person shall be punished a second time for the same oll'ence? 7. Having regard to the fact that Mr Fegan has a wife and seven children in Brisbane, whom he has not seen since his arrest in October, 1917, will the Minister direct that [284]2 Mr Fegan be transferred to the State of Queensland, and detained there in custody in either the military or civil gaol within a reasonable distance of Brisbane, so that his family may have an opportunity of visiting him? In reply to my inquiries, I am now able to furnish the following answers:1. Mr W. J. Fegan was under a recognisance of Â£25 and one surety of Â£25 not to do anything contrary to the War Precautions Act. 2. No. 3. Hd was arrested because he waa of hostile associations and an enemy of the TJnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. 4. Mr Fegan holds a iettt-r from tbe Commandant to the effect that he was arrested on the ground that by a letter published in tbe Brisbane Daily Mail and his evidence in a subsequent case, Mr Fegan showed that he was of hostile associations and an enemy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and F u l l weight w ill , however, Ireland. 5. It is believed so. 6. No. 7. It is not proposed to take the action suggested. honourable member for Hunter( Mr. Charlton) asked a question as to making retrospective a regulation in respect to fines on soldiers who subsequently lost their lives. I beg to inform h i m that this was considered by the Government, but it was decided not to do as suggested. It has not been the policy of the Department to make approvals of .this nature retrospective, e.g., increases in the payment of separation allowance were recently approved to date from 5th A p r i l , 1918. A great deal of work would be involved in investigating past cases, if the approval were made retrospective, and it is doubtful whether adjustment could be made in respect of casualties which occurred during the earlier period of the war. No information is available which would enable the amount of expenditure which would be incurred in back-dating the approval to be calculated, but it is estimated that between Â£60,000 and Â£80,000 would be involved. Approximately 40,000 cases w ill require to be investigated, and it is estimated that payments will require to be made in about 10,000 cases.",29,ANZACs On Furlough Applications For Discharge

I desire to inform the honourable member that the Minister for Defence does not consider the time has arrived to review this matter from the military side, but when it does he is confident that we shall have available Australian officers who, as a result of the experience gained in this war, will be quite competent to advise the Government on this matter. honourable member for Ballarat( Mr McGrath) asked a question with respect to the relief of men now in England unfit for further service out of England. I am now able to inform the honourable member that the Australian military authorities in London have been asked to change the unfit personnel periodically, returning those thus relieved to Australia for discharge. A certain number of qualified clerks who are unfit for active service have been despatched to the Pay Corps in England and to Egypt for duty in lines of communication. honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Colonies for presentation to His Majesty Hector Lamond) referred to a press statement that trainees at Broadmeadows Camp were kept twenty-four hours without food. I now beg to state that the Commandant, 3rd Military District, reports that it is not correct that trainees were kept twenty-four hours without food on going into camp. Instructions were issued by the Commandant, 3rd Military District, that the men were to carry twenty-four hours' rations with them as a precautionary measure. This order was apparently misunderstood by the officers commanding concerned, and the usual arrangements for the feeding of the men were not made, but an adequate supply of bread, jam, and tea was provided, portion of which was not consumed. Instructions have been issued to the Commandant that will prevent a recurrence of the matters complained of. honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) referred to the supply of shoddy yarn which had got into general use. I am now able to state that if the honourable member's statement refers to yarn supplied by the Government Woollen Mills to the Repatriation Department for supplied to the Red Cross for socks, he is evidently under a misapprehension. In the first place, no shoddy yarn has been supplied by the Government Woollen Mills, and secondly the yarn for making cloth and yarn for knitting wool are very dissimilar. If the yarn supplied for hand-loom weaving has been used for knitting socks, nothing but unsatisfactory results can be expected. THE WAR.

Australia remembers ' with pride the part played by her sons in the mighty struggle, and having borne her share of the heat and burdeu of the day, she rejoices with proud thankfulness in the overwhelming success achieved, under God'B providence, by the relentless pressure nf the Navy, and the heroic valour of the soldiers, and by the patient tenacity of the peoples of the British Empire and of tlie Allies. I shall have the honour, Mr nation, and we amongst them, have had President ond Mr Speaker, of forthwith transmitting to Tlis Majestv tbe King the loyal messc.tJfe which you bave tendered to me on behalf of tlie House of Representatives. C APTUREDGERMAN POSSESSIONS Minister and Treasurer) move That thc House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia declares that it is essential to the future safety and welfare of Australia that the captured German possessions in the Pacific, which are now occupied by the Australian and New Zealand troops, should not, in any circumstances, be restored to Germany; and that in the consideration and determination of proposals affecting the destination of these islands Australia should be consulted. Those who apprehend the gravity of this motion will observe that it is appropriately divided into two parts. first part, which is in the negative form, declares for the non-restoration of these captured German islands in the Pacific, and the second, which is in the positive form, declares for a consultation with the Imperial authorities before those interests are determined. plain that Australia is not asking for. it self any additional territory. captured islands are supposed to be rich, and to have a future of great potentiality. for plunder, and it is not because of any such desire that we are seeking a clear and definite line of action with regard His Excellency was pleased to them. It is true that when we found the cost of the war piling up upon our people we expected an indemnity for loss incurred by this country, and, possibly, in respect of the war expenditure that fell upon us. It is equally true, ' if one looks carefully at the proposals for peace which are to guide so largely the deliberations of the statesmen around the Peace table I refer to the fourteen points which emanated from the President of the United States of Americathat in none of them is there mention of an indemnity, but merely a reference to reparation for certain classes of losses inflicted upon the injured nations. There are other losses, however, which every to face. It may be said that if Germany is dismembered-that if the great Confederation, in addition to shedding its kings, also sheds the ties that bind together its scattered parts, sq that the German Empire is divided into a congeries of isolated, and, possibly, rival independent ' Republics-it will not be possible for us to [3.16] I secure from it an indemnity or to obtain even the reparation for which President Wilson's Note provides. If that be so, it may be necessary for Australia to take the view, apart from others that I am about to enunciate, that we or some one should hold these captured German Possessions in fief and in trust for the payment of some of the losses to which Australia has had to submit in consequence of the war. I make that statement in distinct recognition of the fact that in certain quarters it has become The fashionable to speak of "" n o annexations "" as being a humanitarian doctrine. In regard to some of the territories that are in issue in this stru<rele it is possibly a wise and beneficent doctrine, but it is not so with regard to territories that have been recently It is thus made acquired; that have been money-making propositions for the Germans ever since These they secured them; and over the backs of the aboriginal populations of which the whip of Germany has been extended But we did not enter the war ever since she has possessed them.

96,Mr Watt (Balaclava,"Acting Primeno annexations, we, as trustees of the future, ought to see if it is not possible to obtain a true indemnity or proper reparation, that we do hold in pawn some territory that w ill help to relieve the debt of the people of this country in future years. We submit this motion, however, on higher grounds. we seek to insure the safety of the lives of future generations in Australia. This is no new, no party, conception of the position. It does not evolve from this or from tute the main strategic point of the whole any particular Government, but has been the doctrine of the most educated type of Australian sentiment for over thirt y years. I . have not had time, in the rushing life of to-day, to thoroughly scan the history of the genesis of this policy in Australia, but I can go back to the year 1883, and give one typical illustration of how statesmen had deliberated upon this question long before this Parliament was called into existence, and had established with regard to it a public view and conscience. In December, 1883, there was an Intercolonial Conference, at which the following resolution was passed:That' the further acquisition of dominion in the Pacific south of the Equator by any foreign power would be highly detrimental to the safety and wtell-being of tbe British possessions in Australasia, and injurious to the interests of the Empire. It was in August of the following that-notwithstanding lian communities, through the lips of their rulers, spoke emphatically regarding this matter in this and many other Germany was permitted to make the annexations now known as German New Guinea, Wilhelmshaven, of the Archipelago. on this question-and seek advice as to what is the naval conception dangers-tends It is in the direction that, from a naval defence point of view, Australia has an outlying frontier, and that a large part of that frontier is made up of Papua, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon the Fiji group and their channels, and neighbouring waters. Beyond that frontier there are look-out posts which it is Mr Watt. important that Australia should understand, and, if possible, govern. The late German possessions in German New Guinea, chiefly the Bismarck Archipelago and the island of Bougainville, in the Solomons, form,perhaps, the most important part of that frontier. The naval advisers of the Government go further, We submit it because and say that, from a strictly naval point' of view, the Bismarck Archipelago and the surrounding possessions, which we now hold under military occupation, constiof the Pacific. They advise the Government that to obtain the same degree of defence as the possession of these islands would mean-if we possibly could obtain them-woul d cost Australia an additional expenditure of several million pounds per annum. If these possessions, or others like them, were allowed to remain in the hands of an enemy, or even a potential enemy, that would be the position. It is, I think, withi n the knowledge of honourable members, although not withi n the knowledge of the country generally, that in one of these possessions there is perhaps one of the finest outlines for a naval base in the southern hemisphere. We are advised that there are there several first-rate harbors w it h in reasonable distance of one another, and of ready access : that there is one magnificent river, year navigable for some 300 or 400* miles from that the Austraits mouth; that it has no bar at its entrance, heing of estuary formation, and that it affords shelter and all the means waysof sustenance and equipment such as probably no harbour in Australia could supply. We are advised, further, that in and other islands this group there are all the indications The naval opinion of oil supplies, which would form an inwe as laymen must valuable auxiliary asset; and that it is beyond the hurricane belt which, from the of our responsibilities and naval point of view, apart altogether from only in the one direction. the other geographical features to which E have alluded, makes it immensely important. It is said by the advisers of the Government' that if we were to allow these possessions to gravitate or d r if t back to Islands, even a crippled enemy such as Germany might be after this war, they would still form a menace so imminent that, within the limits of one day, an attack could be made by aeroplane upon the coast of Australia, and, within the limits of two or three days, by ordinary naval craft. If honourable members care to study the map they w ill see that from one point in German New Guinea, by a direct, accessible line, the distance to Townsville is only 1,050 miles. I have here a map which I shall be glad to show honourable members if they desire to see it . These are broadly, and in very rugged sketch, the plain, frank opinions of the naval authorities of Australia in advising the Government of the danger from the naval point of view of allowing these territories to revert to enemy control. I ask honourable members, in deliberating upon them, merely to think, as laymen are entitled to do, on the lessons of this war. An attack such as would be possible from striking points of this kind could be made, not only on our ports, but on our territories bordering thereon, as well as upon all our trading and shipping routes. If in the future, tliere is to be warfare some time, and up to the middle of this -and there is probably no man daring enough to predict that war may not recur, despite the smashing and humiliating defeat of Germany, at this stage, from a military point of view-and if submarine warfare is to be the feature of the future, such a danger spot might practically cut off Australia from the rest of the world as far as shipping and cable communication are concerned. Thus, instead of that great immunity that we have enjoyed during these four years, thanks to the fact that the British Navy did sweep the seas of German craft, Australia might have no possibility of exchanging her products or her men. Her oversea trade, upon which her very life blood depends, would vanish, and instead of prosperity and immunity, we should have an awful isolation, such as a distant community of this kind dare not think of with equanimity. I want to quote some illustrations of the conception which the authorities in Germany had, and, for all we know, still have, of these captured possessions. A d miral von Gapow, a prominent adviser i i i naval affairs to the German Government, maintained in a speech in 1917 that unless Germany got back her former sea possessions her entire trade in the Far East would be crippled. He went on to sayGermany must insist upon having New Caledonia and French Oceania. The German Empire wants a naval base. We must establish in the German world a ship route which will make "" her independent of England, America, and Japan. to the Germany of Liebknecht. had better go there. I do not propose to deal with the converted Germany on which my friend is probably hanging his hopes, but with Germany as we have known her, in all her craft, duplicity, and her merciless years. twentieths of the Socialists. they may have been the tools of the rul ing class; a.t any rate, they were "" in it "" up to their very necks. Herr Ernest Kienetz, who was for year, spokesman for the Nationalist party of Germany, amongst other things has writtenThe real value of our South Sea and Australasian possessions is to ' be found in other regions than economic. We must hold them for the world's prestige, without which we cannot have a world policy or a colonial policy. We dare not disappear from the earth's greatest ocean if only because of the Chinese, Australian, Anglo-Saxon, and Japanese antagonism, wbicb is so great that a peaceful settlement is hardly possible. This antagonism must be exploited to tbe utmost. Let us, therefore, retain our South Sea possessions, and try to increase them. An influential journal in Germany, the Die Fremdenblatt, of Hamburg, as late as the middle of this year saidGermany will return to the southern hemisphere, and establish coaling stations and fortified military posts, ^so that she may defy Australian and New ""Zealand ambitions. The last quotation I shall make-becaus e they are all of a piece, although they come from different types of mind, representing, not merely the military, but apparently the whole mind of Germany-is from Professor Paul Preuess, of whom we have read a good deal in recent years.

Then he proceeds characteristically to sayGermany's whole object in the Pacific must he to make mischief. He then goes on to show at length how this could he done. It is as plain as the sun at noonday what the object is, and why this crafty, restless, and predatory people made up their minds to settle down in this great key-point of the new world that is now developing. It is suggested by interjection, and also by utterances in British communities, bhat there has come ""to Germany a great change of heart because she has driven the Hohenzollerns into captivity. Germany really means business, she will demonstrate the fact to the Allied nations by delivering over to the great Allied Council the men responsible for the war. When she has done this, and she could do it if she liked, then doubtless the civilized world will regard it as an act of honest and sincere reform, and not a piece of pious humbug. But I do not believe that men can change suddenly. It is true, that there have been some great conversions-St. Paul, of Tarsus, got his on the road to Damascus-but , generally, I am not a believer in such sudden changes; and certainly not in the case of a people with the psychology of the Prussians, whose roots of brutality and ferocity are laid too deep, more particularly when one sees, as one might have expected to see, that, although this Republic has arisen, Hindenburg still offers to head the army of the Republic. There is no change of voice or heart visible so far as we can see in the present attitude of Germany. I am not speculating whether this group of German Republics-the fragments of a broken Confederation-ca n run a great Navy, or whether they can establish a colonial policy; only the future can teach us that. In the meantime it is better to be sure than sorry. Afr. Watt possibilities. says, we must look to the possibility of a recrudescence of the evil which we have had to confront in the last few years. I have no hesitation,in view of the facts before the Government-and they are well-known to the country-in saying that any proposition to restore these islands to Germany, either in her past or present state, is a grotesque, preposterous, and dangerous dream, arid I want the House to affirm that by this motion. I say, further, that from an Australian point of yiew the restoration would be equivalent to a German victory-Australi a should make up her mind as to that. So far as the Government are aware, New Zealand stands four-square with us in this matter. The utterances of New Zealand leaders, irrespective of party, have, like the utterances of the AustraIf lian Government, gone straight against restoration. It is perfectly plain that the interests of tbe two Dominions are absolutely identical. An interjection fell from my honourable friend, the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Spence), that the German Government had proved cruel to the natives of these equatorial islands. If there was no other reason,civilized humanity would be justified in expelling Germany from countries where she had subjected the aboriginal people to the grossest cruelty. It may be.said, without any exaggeration, that in no island country over which the Germau flag has flown during the last thirty years is there anything in the hearts of the people but Hatred of their German masters. tions in Africa, equatorial and otherwise. I have said that this motion is in the negative form, and I think my honourable friends opposite will solemnly agree with the wisdom of that.

We are told to-day that it is not a new Germany we have to deal with, but that it is the Old Germany, and that, because von Hindenburg is in a position to do certain things we must discredit everything that has happened during the past few days. Let me quote the words of the Prime Minister as recorded in Hansard of the 23rd February, 1917, page 10632. It was the day prior to the Ready incident, when the Prinie Minister telegraphed to the Premier of Tasmania. When he was moving for the extension of the life of the last Parliament he saidAs to peace, and thc terms upon which the Empire should make it, let me state my own view. I have been unsparing in my denunciation of the military povveT of Germany, but I shall never stand quiet under tlie criticism of being thought desirous to humiliate and crush a giant nation. I am not in favour of humiliating Germany as such, but I am in favour of destroying the military power of Germany, and to bhat end I will bend every ounce of energy I possess. But, so far as the German people are concerned, wben they have exorcised themselves of the monster that now has them in its foul grip, when the evil has been burnt out of them byfire, and they have been purged of this disease that corrupts their body, they shall stand again in the councils of the nations. I shall do nothing to place them outside the pale. I will be no party in any respect to a ruthless policy towards Germany as a nation, but to that military despotism that now directs and possesses it, that menaces civilization and threatens the welfare of this continent, I am opposed, and will do all that in me lies to utterly destroy. Will any one say that the military power of Germany has not been swept away? the head. more information on the point than I have, but let me quote the words of President Wilson to Congress on Tuesday last, as reported in the Age of yesterdayArmed Imperialism sueh as the men conceived who were but yesterday the masters of Germany is at an end, its illicit ambitions engulfed in black disaster. Wbo will now seek to revive it? The arbitrary power of the military caste of Germany,"" which once could secretly and of its own single choice disturb the peace of the world, is discredited and destroyed, and more than that-muc h more than that-ha s been accomplished.

There is here matter for no -small anxiety and misgiving. When peace is made, upon whose promises and engagements besides our own is it to rest? Let us be perfectly frank with ourselves and admit that these questions cannot be satisfactorily answered now or at once."" The motion submitted to-day could have been carried a month ago. as easily be carried a month hence. The Peace Conference w ill not have concluded its considerations a month hence. It may not have commenced by that time. What President Wilson says is correct. There must be some stability in the Governments of Middle Europe before the The honPeace Conference can meet, because it would be impossible to come to any binding agreement at a Conference at which those on one side represented the nations for which they stood, and those on the other were not representative of any country, or, at best, represented only I s the honorsmall sections of the populations for which they stood. There is therefore no need for Jiurrying through this motion. Unless the Government proposes to interfere with the consideration of the Electoral B ill in the Senate, the motion cannot be dealt with in that Chamber this week. months ago, carried a resolution to the same effect as this. Chambers' of the Legislature, arrived at on the motion of the Government, will carry much more weight than any such If honourable memresolution as that to which the honourable member refers. Our resolution will, I presume, be transmitfed to the Imperial authorities, who will be asked to place before the Peace Conference when it meets the views of the Australian people. How the Australian people are to be represented at that Conference is a matter for this Government. regard to the German coloniesare made known the better. Australia at the Peace Conference will probably be one-sided. It will be the representation of the party whose proposals the Australian people have twice rejected. With what The Acting Prime Minister yesterday gave me a copy of the motion, but there is no good reason for hurrying through its discussion. If it is the desire pf the Government and of the Ministerial party merely to grab territory, I am opposed to the motion. I am opposed to the grabbing of territory merely to appease an earth hunger.

The natives live in their various tribal organizations under chiefs and councils, absolutely fair deal.

President Wilson has this among his fourteen pointsA free, open-minded and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that, in sovereignty, the interests of the population concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the Government whose title has to be determined. The first consideration must be that of the interests of the native populations. It may be said that, in many cases, the natives are not competent to decide whether they should be under their former masters or employers, or under a new set of masters or employers. There was an excellent article in to-day's Ar/e on the subject, followed by an excellent letter, in which it was pointed out that probably for the first time in the history of the world, we now have open diplomacy, the public discussion of what should be done with the various countries, whose fate is at stake, instead of matters being fixed up privately by delegates sitting round a table.

Having passed the necessary examination, he was entitled to a commission, and he proceeded to London on four days' leave. While there be took ill . The charge made against Ozanne is that he took ill , and did not report in the regular manner. ties on the other side, however, know very little about the matter. I see on the file a letter from General Birdwood,in which he states that Ozanne did not. report sick in a proper manner. There are also on the file a number of papers by Senator Pearce dealing with this aspect of the case. They all go to show, to my mind, that the authorities were not aware of the procedure followed by soldiers who took ill in London. I have had considerable experience of the practice followed in such cases, and venture to say that I saved the lives of at least a hundred Australian boys by inducing them to do exactly what Ozanne did when he took ill in London, I do not blame any one in Australia for what happened to Ozanne oufc here. A lot of people ar.e of the opinion that it was due to political party motives. I do not think it was. Brigadier-General McCAnderson, who was in London, caused all the trouble. In view of the cable message sent to the Department here stating that a charge of desertion was laid against Ozanne, I do not blame Senator Pearce and others for believing that the message was correct. If a soldier takes ill while on leave, he has to report-and these instructions appear on his card-to the nearest hospital, or to the nearest military doctor. Ozanne went to Dr. Shaw,who was stationed at Horseferry-road, and reported, just as thousands of other soldiers have done, that he was ill . The doctor ordered him to Southall, where we have an auxiliary hospital, and he was detained there for two or three weeks. He had leave, I think, until 18th November. On the night upon which that leave expired he returned to his unit, and reported to the orderly, as well as to Captain Dewson and Lieutenant Simmons, that he had been ordered to return next day to the Southall hospital. He went to that hospital, where he was operated upon for nasal trouble. Meantime his unit had proceeded to France. He bad no chance of going with it , and when he l e f t the hospital he went up to London and reported to Brigadier-General McC. Anderson, who said to him, "" Y o u are qualified for The military authoria commission, but there is no commission in the Arnry Service Corps that I can give you."" Men of Ozanne's age are much better qualified for the Army Service Corps than are younger men. Ozanne's age was such as to make h i m unfit to go into the trenches, but Brigadier-General Anderson said to him, "" I can only give you a position in the infantry."" Ozanne said he would accept such a position, and would go wherever he was sent. Brigadier-General Anderson then said he would give him a pass to remain in Londonf o r a few weeks, and that as soon as word was received from France he would be able. to j o in his unit there. I was in London when the order reached Ozanne to report to Brigadier-General Anderson. He reported, and returning to me an hour later, said that he had a commission in the 24th Battalion, and that on the following day he was to go before a Medical Board of three doctors. When a commission is granted in such circumstances, as distinguished from promotion on the field, it is necessary for the recipient of that commission to prove that he is medically fit. Ozanne went before the three doctors. The chairman, of the Board was, I think, Surgeon-General Howse, who reported fhat he was medically unfit, not only for the trenches, but for any service whatever. No one heard the word desertion spoken of in connection with Ozanne in the Old Country, and it came as a shock to me to read in the Australian papers that such a charge had been-made against him. Here is a letter fro m the official file, which is unsigned, but evidently came from General Griffiths or Brigadier-General McC. Anderson. It 9 was apparently written in reply to a communication from Senator Pearce:From Commandant, Australian Imperial Force, Head-quarters, London. To Senator Pearce, Defence, Melbourne, 23rd April, 1917. Senator Pearce, Defence, Melbourne. A7599, Your WY615. Our records show Ozanne leave granted from Larkhill Camp from 10th November to 18th November, and this was subsequently extended by telegram, and that on 20th November he was admitted to Southall Hospital owing to old injury causing deflected septum. Admission to hospital was reported to Ozanne's commanding officer by this office, memo. 29965, on same date. Ozanne was detained as an in-patient until 24th November, and on discharge medical officer reported, in writing, he would require to keep him under observation for two weeks, for which purpose he was to visit Southall. You Trill, therefore, see that some mistake has been made in statement that he was absent withe t leave on embarkation of unit, 22nd Novembc:. . . . It will probably be remembered tliat General Monash, in a cablegram sent by Brigadier-General Anderson to Australia, is alleged to have said that had he known where Ozanne was when his unit embarked, he would have had h i m arrested and tried as a deserter. Here, however, is a letter, evidently from the Commanding Officer at Head-quarters, London, saying that Ozanne had been sent to Southall Hospitalf o r treatment. ber referring to the letter which he says is unsigned? from the official records, and its genuineness w ill not be disputed. There is only one man to blame for what has taken place in regard to exQuartermaster-Sergeant Ozanne. I have here a copy of a long cablegram as to Ozanne having been absent without leave, which is supposed to have been signed by General Monash. But I have seen, and can produce, a letter sent by General Monash to a relative, in which he declares that he never sent any cablegram to Australia in regard to Ozanne. The honourable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney) has also seen that letter. believe that what happened was that General Monash reported to BrigadierC!eneral McC. Anderson, who thought this was an opportunity to show his gratitude to some one for the position to which he had been appointed by fabricating something, and that he sent out the cablegram which ruined Ozanne. charge to make against Brigadier-General Anderson. MrM c GRATH It is, but it is absolutely true that I have seen the letter from General Monash, in which he denies having sent the alleged cable. member repeat it outside? MrM c GRATH I have made the same statement outside. I have remained very quiet, but now that the war is over, 1 feel free to bring this matter forward. I have had my own troubles, and could, if I wished, make it very unpleasant for some people. Every member of the Australian Imperial Eorce who was a sergeant, and happened also to be a member of Parliament, did not enjoy too good a time in the Army. I have not uttered a word of complaint, although I could have said that I was kept hanging about the fron t line in the neighbourhood of Ypresf or about three months, and could aot get anything to do. I could have told tliat story with considerable effect against the recruiting movement had I desired to do so, but I remained quiet. It is almost inconceivable that such a cable message It is. taken as that to which I have referred could have been sent from Head-quarters, London, to the Department here, in view of the following letter that Brigadier. General Anderson gave to the alleged deserter prior to his ieaving London:Australian Imperial Forces. Administrative Head-quarters', 130 Horseferry-road, London, S.W., 24th March, 1917. Quartermaster-Sergeant Ozanne, Australian Imperial Forces. In response to your inquiries, I beg to state that the records show you came to this country from Australia with the 3rdDivision to finish training for France. You were sent to a training school to ascerI tain your fitness for commissioned rank, and as the result of the course there and subsequent examinations, you obtained a pass of over 80 per cent, marks.

180,Mr Poynton,"Would the ""honorableofficer, but it was a satisfactory indication of qualification, and that you had. successfully passed all the tests placed before you at. this school. That paragraph at least shows that this man was a student, and went there with fche f u l l intention of faithfull y carrying out his duties. He only did as thousands of other Australians have done in endeavouring to qualify himself for a higher position; and the fact that he obtained over 80 per oent. of marks stands to his creditThe G.O.C., 3rd Division, did not require your services as an officer in his division, but other vacancies were available for officers in other divisions iii France, and you expressed a desire to obtain one. At that time, acting on the advice of our medical officersA t this time he was supposed to be a deserteryou underwent medical treatment and a minor operation for post-nasal trouble, and at the end submitted yourself for medical examination in the usual way, but you were passed out as unfit, and recommended to return to Australia, as any job you could have done on this side would not have been in a fighting capacity. There is nothing available for you here, and you are now going back to Australia, and in consequence of adverse medical report, you are unable to take up a commission even if one had been available suitable to . your physical abilities. At the special request of the Eight Hon. the High Commissioner, the rule of the Defence Department insisting that soldiers should travel by transport, has been in your case relaxed, and you have been provided with a passage on a P. and 0. steamer. This request was based on the grounds of your being a member of Parliament, and in the opinion of the High Commissioner, you should be in Australia in time to take part in the general Federal parliamentary election fixed for the 5th May. You are leaving to-day for Australia, and I hope you will have a safe and pleasant journey home, and be able to assist to solve the difficulties evidently agitating tbe minds of our countrymen out there. (Signed) Brigadier-General, Commandant. I do not think that any man could have better testimony as to character than Mr Ozanne has in this letter written two days before he left Londonf o r Australia. On his arrival at Fremantle there came a message that he was liable to be arrested as a deserter; and that was circulated throughout Corio and Australia generally. How would any honourable member feel if he were placed in such a position as Mr Ozanne then found himself i I might here mention that Mr. Ozanne was not the only man to get a passage on a Peninsular and Oriental boat. I know a clergyman, who, accompanied by his son, went from Australia to England on a Peninsular and Oriental boat. That son had been taken out of the Army to be batman to his father, and the two had nice tours in England, Scotland, and France, just where there were no shells falling. A major thought that this clergyman's services were required in Australia, and he and his son were sent back on a Peninsular ancl Oriental boat at the expense of the country. It is true fchafc Mr Ozanne's passage was paid, but fchat was because there was no other way for him to return. I may say that Colonel Griffiths, about that time, came into the room of which I was in charge, and, in forming me that there had been a dissolution of the Commonwealth Parliament, said thafc I ought to be in Australia looking after my seat, and suggested that I should sign a form' which would enable me to leave Londoni n a few days. However, I had always made up my mind that, having joined the A r m y, I would not leave it until I could do my bit in France, so I declined the offer .with thanks. Fortunately, through the kind offices of Colonel, now Brigadier-General, Griffiths, one of the finest men the Australian Army possesses, I did get to France: but, doubtless, I should have been exposed to the same sort of attacks as Mr. Ozanne had I come back on a Peninsular aud Oriental boat. A charge is made that Mr Ozanne presented an hotel bill for Â£ 5 2s. 3d. incurred at Weymouth. As a matter of fact, it was his duty to go to that plaice. He was ordered to Australia, but he wanted very much to go to France to see how the boys were treated, R. McC. ANDERSON, and he did go to France, but at his own expense to the .extent of Â£60. A t this time he. was supposed to be a deserter, but he was heing received at head-quarters by General Birdwood, and also one of the French generals, who took hi m along the firing line. He made an exact report of what he observed on his visit, and he did not sav he was in the firing line as a fighter. When he came back to London, and went to Weymouth, he was driven there in a motor car by General Sir Newton Moorea man who knew nothing about the military when the war broke out, when he was given the rank of general. vears. He was a colonel when the honourable member was in long clothes. colonels and majors embraced gallant soldiers during these last few days, while I .know they have never left Victoria. Sir Newton Moore took Mr to Australia concerning the Ozanne case; Ozanne to the hotel, and Mr Ozanne was not permitted to pay, and thought he was the personal guest of the General. The hotel bill of Â£5 2s. 3d. represented four or five days' stay, at a tariff rate of the letter referred to. I do not say that this 17s-6d. per day, and I think I am right in saying that Mr Ozanne had one drink and a cigar after each meal. That is not very extravagant, and I .remind honourable members that there are no cigars to be had at five for a Is. in England, and not much of a cigar can be purchased for 2s. 3d. Had Mr Ozanne been returned to this Parliament, he would have been very useful to the country because of his experience in France and at Home, for, amongst other things, he could have given much advice as to the treatment of our boys. He never believed that he would be defeated at the election; and, personally, I feel very sorry that he was. I appeal to the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) to for a moment put himself in the position of Mr Ozanne. I am not in tbe habit of making extravagant or foolish statements, but I speak from a long association with this man. I was associated with him from the day he left Australia, and I was at Charing Cross to wish him ion voyage when he left on his return trip. I can give the Government 7ny word that he did not desert for one second, as the records clearly and conclusively prove. There is no necessity to have General Monash here for an inquiry, because he had practically nothing to do with the affair. We have all the documents to prove that every time he was away from Camp, Ozanne had a pass; indeed, we have most of the passes, together with the medical certificates and the letter from General Anderson. There wasnever a charge of desertion made against him in London, and Ozanne knew nothing of it until he arrived at Fremantle. that a cable sent to Australia is a forgery. as produce a letter written by General Monash to a relative, in which he states that he never signed any cable to be sent and that letter I can produce. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) brought a friend of General Monash to me the other night, and I saw cablegram was created or forged in Australia, but I believe it was sent from London. I know some of the strong influences which were at work there at the time. There were certain men, of whom the Government are not aware, who made strong efforts to induce Mr Ozanne to take the conscription side. He was bitterly opposed to conscription, and despite the influences brought to bear, said, ""During my country's troubles I have not been a traitor, and neither will I be a traitor to my party."" He stuck solidly to his party, and his attitude caused some bitter feeling in certain directions in London. He was sent back here as medically unfit, and with no word ahout desertion; and from the day of his arrival he has never received justice at the hands of the Government or the military of Australia. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to accede to the request for a Royal Commission. For all I care, the Commission may be composed entirely of members from behind the Government, for I am confident that with the documents and evidence available they will acquit Mr Ozanne of any charge of desertion. 1 Minister and Treasurer) [4.57] I have listened very intently to the remarks of the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr McGrath).

McGrath's motion, because, as I read the Monash file of papers, no .charee of desertion was mn.de by General Monash against ex-Qunrtsrmister-Sergeant A. T. Ozmne. The file discloses that General Monash, on 6th April, 1917, addressing the Assistant Adber w ill see that, according to the dejutant-General, Australian Imperial Porce. partmental filps, the Minister's statement drew attention to the fact that Ozanne had overstayed the leave granted to him from bis is accurate.

It may dealt with for this offence, but that the authobe urged that General Monash's evidence could rities in London did not support bim in the be taken on commission, but I would submit matter. war Again, in a letter to Brigadier-General R. McC. Anderson, Administrative Head-Quarters, London, dated loth December, 1916, General Monash stated that he (Ozanne) received a certain number of days' leave, but did not return to his Unit witliin the period defined I was pleased to by his leave. He was not present with his Unit when the Unit embarked, and he was reported "" absent without leave ""; and expressed the hope that the authorities in London, who are responsible, will take the necessary action to vindicate discipline by sending this non-commissioned oflicer over to France under escort, to be dealt with in the ordinary way. On ISth July, 1917, Mr Tudor, M.P., on notice, asked a number of questions in relation to this case, which were duly replied to, and it was indicated to the House that the papers I am glad to hear from the would be laid on the table of the House on the 10th July, 1917. Tbis waa done. The papers were bud on the table, and were in possession of members of Parliament, as well as the press.

In some cases, reply was made that if the request was repeated at the close of the war, when the necessary witnesses had returned to Australia, the application would be considered on its merits. 1 would point out to you that a Commission of Inquiry into the charge as formulated would not only be a trial of ex-Quartermaster-Serthe matter at all. that this would be grossly unfair, because",47,Tudor I F New Zealand Evidence Be Required

He has since risen to be Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army in the field, but as a Divisional Commander he ordered Ozanne to he sent to Head-Quarters for punishment as a defaulting non-commissioned officer. For that reason General Monash comes right into the picture. I assure the honorahle member for Ballarat that I wish to see Ozanne get a fair deal, and at the right time and in the right way I shall assist him to get it. I think he has made good his case for such an inquiry, and, of course, when it is held the case will necessarily stand on its merits. If the honourable member is satisfied with .that assurance, I shall take counsel with the Minister for Defence as to the best way and the best time for this inquiry to be held. [5.10] -The honourable member for Bal1 larat, in stating this case, did not make it a political matter. Unfortunately there are two phases of the question. First of all there is the family feeling in connection with it, and secondly there are the disabilities under which Ozanne has suffered. The mother of ex-QuartermasterSergeant Ozanne had one son killed at the Front. She was proud that he had done his duty to the country. Her other son also went to the war, and returned in sheer disgrace. I differ from the honourable member for Ballarat, for I say that the charge against Ozanne was deliberately made in order to defeat him at the election for Corio, and it had that effect. able member charge? I do say that the Minister for Defence is culpable to a great degree. I had the pleasure of addressing sixteen or seventeen meetings in the Corio electorate at the time of the last general election, and I have participated in two other election campaigns in the constituency. Therefore, I know the district well. At every meeting I received a good hearing, and had no trouble with my audience, but at the conclusion of my remarks I was overwhelmed with questions as to why Ozanne had deserted. It was impossible to escape from that charge; it was published in the newspapers, and they could not be induced to print even a statement as to the possibility of doubt in regard to the charge, let alone a direct contradiction of it. The accusation wa3 used by the newspapers and the National party for political purposes during that fight. Only a man who has been in the Army knows what a charge of desertion means. A soldier could commit no greater crime than to be absent without leave from his unit when it embarked for the Front. Ozanne had to fight the election with that charge hanging over him, and his wife and family were subjected to the taunts of the political crowd, who used the accusation to injure their opponent's candidature. It may be said that all is fair in love and war, and that a political party is justified in resorting to such tactics. I would do much for my party, but I"" would not commit perjury for it ; yet perjury was committed in the Ozanne case. I say nothing against the honourable member who defeated Mr Ozanne.

The moment one came down to question time in the Corio campaign there were dozens of questions,particularly from among the women.

One does not like to speak of such matters, It is said that but Mr Ozanne's brother has been killed at the Pront,. and the feelings of the mother when her other son has to bear the charge -of having deserted can be readily understood. I am willing to admit that the Acting Prune Minister( Mr Watt) is quite ready to do all he can towards clearing up this matter, but there is no need to wait for the return of General Monasn. A ll we ask is for a letter from the Defence Deoartment giving the facts of this man's case, stating his record, and showing whether he had tlie acquiescence of his conifoanding officer in what he did or whether another officer placed him under requisition on such and such a date.

These matters should not be left to the final decision of the military authorities. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -Ho w would the honourable member propose to deal with him? kind there should be a Board of two or three men. Of course, one of them would need to have military knowledge, but the others should be appointed from Outside the Military Forces.

In another case, which is fourteen months old, documents cannot be secured from the Old Country. However, although the charge that lies over Mr Ozanne's head is a horrible one, he is willing to face it, and he should be given the opportunity of doing so. He has certainly not been treated fairly.

On the other hand, if the charges against him are substantiated, he should take his gruelling. I believe that he is prepared for any inquiry based upon those grounds. Now, concerning my connection with, this matter: As most honourable memhers know, it had been arranged that I should tour Victoria, in the interests of recruiting, to deliver a series of lectures illustrated with pictures. I was to visit each electorate in turn, staying for a fortnight. Corio was the first electorate that I entered. "" I went there some seven weeks or so before the election. When I had been in Geelong for about five days, I was asked if I would nominate -for the Corio seat. I told those who approached me that I did not aspire to parliamentary honours; that I knew a little of the politics of Queensland, but had only a very limited knowledge of Federal politics, and that I thought that, as a Queenslander, I had no chance of securing the endorsement of the party. However, upon being pressed to allow myself to be nominated, I did so, although I looked upon the nomination form as merely waste paper. I then went into the Ballarat electorate, and there I was asked seas serving his country, and I had allowed myself to be nominated for Corio. I was not particularly anxious to secure the party endorsement, and no one was more surprised than 1 was when I was chosen to contest the seat. At my first election meeting 1 made it clear that it was not my intention to discuss Mr many persons, including women, who said Ozanne or the merits of his case, and I thereafter left both severely alone. A l though, like the honoraible member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews), I was inundated with questions about the case, I resolutely refused to discuss it by replying either to question or interjection regarding it. On the Thursday before polling day, when I was addressing a midday meeting in the market square at Geelong, I was questioned on.the subject by a staunch supporter of Mr Ozanne, and. 1 replied that I was not opposing Mr Ozanne personally, but was standing in the interests of the Nationalist party, because the attitude of that party towards the war was in accord with my own. I said, tooI think the statement is on record in the files of the local press-that I thought people would be wise to reserve judgment concerning Mr Ozanne until he had returned to Australia to answer the charges levelled against him. I have uo feeling in this matter. I hope"" that Mr Ozanne will be given an opportunity to clear himself, if he can, of tlie charges. But I wish to remove the impression which seems to be firmly embedded in the minds of some honourable members, that hi3 defeat at the election was due to tbese charges. I do not think that it was. Party feeling was particularly strong at fche election, but if you compare the record of the voting at Corio for Senate candidates wifch that of the voting for the House of Reyjresentatives candidates you will see that, on party lines, Mr Ozanne came out much better than the Labour Senate candidates. That is attributed by some of my supporters to the lact that on the evening of the day before the election a telegram came from Fremantle to the supporters of Mr Ozanne in Geelong, of which I cannot from memory give the exact words, but its effect was that Mr Ozanne was in a position to clear himself of the charges made against him. This was read at the final rally in the Mechanics Institute, and at an overflow meeting in the hall next door. My supporters told me that that telegram 'had a decided influence on thepolling. I know that in moving round the booths of the division I met that they would vote for Mr Ozanne because he was under a cloud, and there was doubt as to his guilt, but that they would vote for the Nationalist Senate candidates. If Mr Ozanne's defeat can be attributed to anything beyond the strength of the Nationalist party in the Corio division, it is attributable to the circulation throughout the electorate of Corio of certain letters sent from France",52,Tudor I F New Zealand Evidence Be Required

In these letters he represented himself a3 having been in the firing line, although, according to the dates with which they were headed, it was impossible for him to have been there. Personally, 1 hold that neither the charges against him, nor the circulation of these letters, influenced the electors to a great extent. Buti f there was such influence, the blame must attach to Mr Ozanne for having misled people as he did. I have nothing to say agaanst Mr Ozanne personally. Whether my political career be long or short, I hope that throughout it I shall treat every one fairly and squarely. should not have referred to this matter today had it not been for some remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) a few weeks ago. I hope that before the next election the Government will hold an inquiry which will give Mr Ozanne the opportunitv to exonerate himself, if he can do so. I have listened with a good deal of pleasure to the remarks of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister). I am glad that he approves of the amendment, though it is only what I would have expected of him. I was a little hurt at his mention of certain letters. There was no need for that. If the matter has any relevance, it can be lef t over for the inquiry. I have, perhaps, the longest political experience of any honourable member, and I know that a more terrible charge cannot be made against a man than to accuse him of being a traitor and a deserter. I was at the declaration of the Corio poll, where the bitterness of certain women was extreme. Por the first time in twenty-eight years I then said something to a woman which might be regarded as rude. I have always tried to treat all women who cross my path as I would wish my mother, my wife, and my daughter to be treated, but I was stung by the bitterness of one woman into uttering what might have been considered a rude remark, and afterwards members of the League to which she belonged personally thanked me for having been one of the few persons who could silence her tongue. I was present at a large meeting in the Corio division, and I say that, if ever a man was crucified unjustly that man was Ozanne. I have here a certificate that should satisfy any medical man as to Mr. Ozanne's incapacity for active service. It is as follows : Military Hospital, Southall, 15th November, 1916. Quartermaster-Sergeant Ozanne. I have examined Sergeant Ozanne to-day. He has a deflected septum to the left with adhesion to the inferior terbinated bone. An operation is the only means of giving relief. He would require three to four weeks' leavein case of operation. E. SHUTBR, Major. Leave to be granted -K . E. O. SHAW, Captain, A.M.C, Military Head-Quarters, London. No man who looks through these papers I can believe the charges against Mr Ozanne. I thank the Acting PrimeM i nister ( Mr Watt) for the way in which he has treated this ""matter, but I do not agree with him that Mr Ozanne should be dealt with in fche same way as any other returned man. It is to be remembered that he was called upon when he returned to Australia to fight for his poli-tical life. Only seven or eight members of Parliament have volunteered for active service, and they alone could provide cases similar to that of Mr Ozanne. 1 wonder that the Acting Prime Minister did not see that. The ship i-Â± which Mr Ozanne returned to Australia was delayed. I have that from passengers who were travelling: by it . I cannot prove that it was delayed designedly, but why was it delaved ? It was not allowed to pass a certain point, and Mr Ozanne could not leave it until it reached Adelaide. A wireless telegram was sent saying that he was a deserter. Why, if be was a deserter, was he not shot? Why, if he was a deserter, should he ftot be branded for all time, and prevented from holding any office in the Commonwealth, State, OT municipality? I have not time for a traitor or for a deserter. But this man's brother died at the Pront, and Mr. Ozanne himself, although over forty years of aee, succeeded in getting 83 per cent, of the marks obtainable at an examination for which he sat. He was prevented from going to the Pront by a physical defect which, if the doctors had been shrewd enough, might have been discovered in Australia.

259,Mr Hector Lamond,"I amif at the end of them we are still to have near to our shores nations that may become hostile and attack Australia from the bases which Germany owned before the war. BecauseI feel that the taking of those islands from the control of other nations is necessary for the future peace of this continent, I am wholly in accord with the motion. I would have been glad had it been framed in more definite and emphatic terms, because to us the matter involved is one of life and death. It is a question of whether we are to reay the fruits of the sacrifices our people have made, or whether when the war ends, we are still to live in terror that some day in the lives of our children or our children's children, Australia will again have to go through the horror of the last four years, but nearer home. My view of this matter has not changed since the day when the Queensland Government performed the patriotic act of taking possession of New Guinea. I believed then that the attitude of the Colonial Office was inimical to the interests of Australia, and no one who has studied the question since can deny that that is so. ""We have been in danger for many years past of having that portion of New Guinea controlled by Germany used as a base of operations against Australia, and we have failed to learn the lesson of this war if we do not recognise that it is unsafe to give possession of points of advantage near to us to any other nation. Thc lesson taught by the war is that the friends of last century are the enemies of to-day; that every nation has to make an effort to be self-contained, and, as far as possible, keep from near its borders any other nation that is likely to challenge it3 supreeffort which the Prime Minister is makmacy at any future time. The effort that is being made now to matter. I think that many people are obtain some security for the future peace beginning to realize the truth of what we of the world must concern itself with the said at the time, that when the Opposifuture of the Pacific Islands. The question in this Parliament prevented the tion of Australia's security in the ""future Prime Minister from attending that most is one of vital importance to us; but it important meeting of the Imperial War must not be forgotten that at the Peace Cabinet, they did an irreparable injury Conference which will consider this questo the Australian cause. If , as a result tion, if it were only a matter of Ausof that action, the terms of the armistice tralia's interests, we should have, at the are so interpreted as to prevent Australia Mr Hector Lamond. most, one voice against all the other voices around the table. It will be only because the attention of the world has been directed to the preservation of peace in future that this question will claim that consideration which it ought to have in the final adjustment of the terms of peace. We must remember that Australia has not only to look for benefits from the war, but that she has to accept the responsibilities which her geographical position imposes upon her. She has to do her part in securing the future of the world for Democracy, and it may be that the deliberations of the Peace Conference will place upon her shoulders the responsibility of supervising the good government of the islands adjacent to this continent until, in the ordinary course of political development, they are able to set up independent governmental institutions of their own. If we are called upon to undertake the government of portions of New Guinea other than that controlled already by Australia, we should accept that responsibility, because it is necessary that good government should exist there, and, because of the position of the islands, that responsibility comes more naturally to us than to nations at the other side of the world. Personally, I hope that, whatever decision is arrived at by the peace delegates, we shall not have joint control of any of the Pacific Islands. International control of the islands has been a failure in every instance in which it has been tried, and it is far better to place the sole responsibility on one nation than to divide it among two or three, for that naturally leads to friction and bad government. I appreciate to the fullest degree the ing in England at the present time to get a hearing for the Australian view in this securing a fair deal at the Peace table, that responsibility must rest upon the party led by the honourable member forYarra( Mr Tudor), and cannot be placed upon any other shoulders.

BecauseI believe this motion will result in the Imperial Government giving consideration to the claim of Australia to equitable treatment in this matter, and will acquaint the authorities overseas with the importance to the future of this continent of the elimination of Germany from the Pacific, I support the motion. Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 7J 5:p.m.f I intend to vote for this motion. would much rather it had readThat the House of Kepresentatives of the Commonwealth of Australia declares that it is essential for the future safety and welfare of Australia thut the occupied German Possessions in the Pacific should not be restored to Germany, and that in the consideration and determination of proposals affecting thc destination of those islands, Australia should be consulted. There is an old adage that if we cannot get all we want, we ought to take what we can get, and I shall' vote for the motion, because I have sufficient belief in the future of the world. The most democratic and most powerful nations [285] having joined together with the one desire of laying the foundations of a lasting peace, I know that they will so rule the peoples of the nations that such matters as this will have every just consideration; and that no future troubles will arise concerning them.

I fail to see how the flag bearing the cruel eagles can ever be'resuscitated again, In We are years gone by my hope was that the middle and southern States of Germany would become republican. That wish of mine has now been fulfilled. In .regard to the motion, the question is whether we want more land. Speaking as an Australian and a lover of my country, I would say that at present we want no more land, because all that the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic race has done so far as Australia is concerned is to embroider its borders with splendid cities. The large interior, which could be cultivated by the conservation of water and by the boring of wells, in a sense has not yet been touched. We therefore do not want any further land at present, but speaking for the future and with a vista of a glorious Australia, one of the great homes of the I white race, helping to keep up the civilization which the western nations have so far brought to such a high pitch, I would say, "" Yes, let us take all that we can."" Against that idea we have the splendid precept laid down by President Wilson that there shall be no aggrandization of territory, followed by the declaration of the United Kingdom that Great Britain wants no territorial increase. Surely with the wide spaces we have in Australia we should follow those splendid examples, and say that we already have enough land of our own.

If Australia is not represented as I could wish it to be, we must lay theblame upon the electors, but whoever is there, if he carries out any plan or fight for the benefit and welfare of Australia, will certainly earn my thanks and my regard. The other day I came across some words of Demosthenes, which, I think, are quite apropos. Speaking on the Embassy of nations after warfare who were making peace, he saidI knew well-anythin g given up in passing from war to peace is loss to the careless side; war. since, when people generally have once made up their minds for peace, they will not renew the war for the sake of what has heen sacrificed. This, therefore, remains in possession of the holders. At the meeting of the various plenipotentiaries of the nations, care must be who left Germany in' the rebel year of taken that no careless oversight will land 1848.

Honourable the land whose rulers would not permit members will agree with me that there is ' them to visit their birthplaces. I propose great safety in clause 5 of President Wilto quote the words of Frederick theson's fourteen points, which reads as folGreat, that great scoundrel, who equally lows :A free, open-minded, and absolutely imparequally with him knew nothing that tial adjustment of all Colonial claims, based would prevent him from doing what he upon a strict observance of the principle that had the power to do. These were his in determining all such questions of sovewordsreignty, the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the Government whose title is to be determined. It will make it safe, not only for the people of She coloured races, but alsofor ourselves. At present, the Germans in the Caroline Islands collect labour in Dr. Moloney. vessels which fly the British flag, andi. they have made that flag such a terror to the natives that whenever a boat flying the British colours approaches an island,, the native population rushes off into the forests and hills. The Germans are purposely making our flag an object of terror to these natives, so that if ever their voices are taken upon the matter of the future ownership of the islands,, they will vote for the other nation, and not for the country whose flag they have learned to fear. All this has happened since the Two friends of mine from New Guinea,, who spent several hours with me last night, stated definitely that the British flag is absolutely a symbol of fear to the natives. I owe much to my old German teachers Kaiser, or a Czar to exist, but they had with the late Kaiser broke treaties, and I begin by taking. Afterwards I can always: find learned men to demonstrate it was my good right. Here is another quotation from the great Goethe. Surely, if any one knew hiss Countrymen, or those who were akin to his countrymen-, the Prussians, well, it was he. Speaking of the Kaiser's people, he said that they wereCruel by nature, whom civilization has rendered ferocious. Surely any one who has gone through the ""White-Books, 'various other books that have been published by the nations concerning this war must agree that the man who told his soldiers that, once they took the oath, if he gave the order they would have to shoot even their own parents, and that his word only was the law, was merely following in the footsteps of that great scoundrel who was his progenitor. TheN or th-E astern Ensign, speaking of the Kaiser and his myrmidons, has made, use of these words:A band of the greatest criminals the world has ever known.. Belgium,. France, Bussia, Holland, and Servia have been ravaged, robbed, and rnined, whilst tbe most unmentionable crimes have been committed on every side against the fair name of womankind. In the A ere of the 2nd October, 1918, President Wilson is quoted as having said that the Governments of the CentralE m pires werewithout honour. They Observe no covenants, and accent no nrinciples but force and their own interest. We cannot "" come to terms with them. They have made it impossible."" Earlv in the fight, when I was taking the platform for recruiting, I made a statempnt WhatI wished for then, I hope will come to pass. I saidLet us hope that a civilization will rise from the carnage of blood and murder men call war that will destroy the power of despots, whether kings, kaisers, or czars, to make human beings be-ome mad. with the curse of the murder and rapine of war. and I hope that civilization will be willing; and able to pay as much to save infant life, to educate the young, to keep old acre from want, and to eliminate poverty, as it now spends upon war to destroy man at_ bis most useful period of life. One could hardly pick up a newspaper to-day without finding that another monarch has gone, another king has lost his crown. About eighteen months ago there was a f u l l drawing by Low in the pages of the Bulletin bearing the words, "" An y old crowns for sale."" Surely that day has come. I have never recognised any difference between the criminal who wears rags and one who has worn the [285]2 Imperial crown of Germany. I appeal to the Old, Old Book, particularly to the Book of Joshua. In Holbein's Dance of Death there is a picture of Joshua. The artist of the middle ages has painted hi m Blue-Bopks, and the as wearing the armour of the middle ages, and at the foot of the picture we have the words, "" Thirty and one kings were killed by Joshua."" If it be true that the Crown Prince of Germany has lost his life few will regret it . The only regret of many, including myself, will be that he met with so easy a death. The Statesman's Tear-Book for 1918 shows that the various States of Germany are represented as follows in the Bundesrat and the Reichstag: Number oi Number of Members Deputies States of the Empire. iu in BundesReichstag. rat.

On the other hand, Bavaria has only six members. in the Bundesrat and forty-eight deputies in the Reichstag. If the representation of Prussia were on the same basis as that of Bavaria, it would not have a majority in the lower House. Kingdoms now? public flies over every one of them. The revolutionary feeling, as many of us foresaw, has come from the interior of Germany, and it has certainly hastened the coming of peace. I recall a statement made in August, 1914, by the Consuli n Melbourne for the last of the Allies to join us-the little Republic of Nicaragua, on the Isthmus of Panama. He told me then that we should not win even if we had 100 men for every one that Germany put into the field, and that not until we had ten large pieces of ordnance for every one possessed by Germany would we be able to blast our way through to Berlin. He said he had seen four revolutions and four different Presidents in his own country, and that while representing that country at Berlin he had enjoyed the secret information given to representatives Powers. Amongst other statements madety him was one to the effect that he had been through a new building in Germany four stories up and four stories down, which was stocked with munitions only to be used when Germany was invaded, and that this building had a floor space of 2 miles square. How great, then, was the achievement of our. ""contemptible little Army,"" ill-equipped as it was, m stemming back the onrush of the best equipped A r m y in the world; but to Prance must special credit be given for the stand that it has made. It is absolutely necessary to pass a motion of this kind. As my leader ( Mr 100,000 American citizens of German Tudor) has said, there may be no immediate hurry, and the passing of it may not have much influence with the Peace Conference, but it will tend, at all events, to show that Australia is quick to express through opinion it holds with respect to this great question. question of an indemnity being paid by Germany had been introduced into this Dr. Moloney. motion. WhatI suggest is not a penal indemnity, but one by way of justice. I perfer to see Germany called upon to pay such an indemnity rather than that the workers of Australia should have to bear an interest burden of from Â£15,000,000 to Â£20,000,000 a year. W h y Where are these should such a load be handed down to our The flag of the Rechildren and our children's children t Innocent as we are of this war, the"" children as yet unborn will be even more innocent of it , and it would be an infamy to burden them for all times with the cross of interest payments. I hope we shall never agree to' anything of the kind. It has been estimated that the coal resources of Germany alone, at a valuation of 5s. ,per tori, are worth Â£240,000,000,000. If that be correct, then they are, in themselves, sufficient to provide, in time, for the payment of such an indemnity as might be demanded of Germany. I do not ask that the enemy should be called upon to pay down at once, as the unfortunate Japanese nation was once asked to do, the indemnity demanded of her. I should not mind if the payment were extended over 100 years; but I certainly think that an indemnity of foreign should be paid. The German race would not be crucified by having to comply with such a demand. Having put an end to the autocratic forms of government which disgraced their earlier history, the workers of the German Empire w ill have the right to leave their country, and seek a living elsewhere, if , as a result of the war, they find that local taxation is too heavy for them. I am not afraid of my fellow-Australian citizens of German parentage. In the very first days of the war the Melbourne T u r n Verein offered its splendid club-rooms for use as a hospital for our soldiers. Some thirty of its members volunteered, and we know that over parentage have marched to the Front under the flag of the United States of America. I could have wished that Roosevelt, rather than Wilson, had been President of the great Republic of the its National Parliament the United States of America. Asi t is, I believe that Roosevelt stimulated the I could have wished that the President, and led him to take action such as he might have hesitated to take had he been left to his own more philosophic moods. No one will say that if Roosevelt had been in the presidential chair the torpedoeing of the Lusitania would have occurred. The TJnited States of America long before that outrage took place would have been in the war if Roosevelt had had his way. I look to the future with joy, since I believe that this will he the last great war in the world's history. At one time. I had a fear of the East and the West coming into conflict, but I no longer entertain it. I know what noble work has been done by the stronger of our eastern. Allies; its fleet has .protected our coastal towns and has prevented them from being utterly destroyed. No one will say that the splendid Australia was ahle to guarantee the safety of our coastal towns, stretching, as they do, from Brisbane round to Perth. Vessels of the Japanese fleet have been protecting our shores, and it was due to the generosity and splendid spirit of chivalry displayed by the Japanese that our own cruiser, the Sydney, was allowed to go out to meet and destroy the Emden. I loathe war, and wonder sometimes why the Almighty permits it. To me the fact that 12,000,000 men have been killed, or have died as the result of wounds or sickness, in this war is appalling. It ' is equally appalling to learn that some 30,000,000 men have been wounded in a hundred different ways. heartily in praise to the Creator that at last the war is over. Providence must view with feelings of sorrow the efforts tar destroy each other which are made by those whom He has endowed with brain power above that of all other forms of life. Why should a brute like the Kaiser have been allowed to plunge the world into war? Men who share my views can join with me in showing respect to our own King, since his is a limited monarchy. Our King may not make war without the consent of his people. If he were an autocrat, then I shoulJ wish him to disappear just as the monarchs of the German Kingdoms have been swept away. King Edward, when Prince of Wales, was once discussing with a friend the question of whether England would ever become a Republic. He said that while he might come to the throne, he thought that England would one day become a Republic. If it did, he declared the best way out of the difficulty : would be for the people to make him their first President, and then give him an opportunity to disappear into private life. It is a tribute to the spirit of the British that, although the people of Great Britain have one of the least up-to-date franchises, they have yet more liberty than have the people of other nations with a wider franchise. The franchise of Great Britain is undoubtedly ridiculous; it is certainly absurd that a woman under thirty should not be allowed to record her vote. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I should like this motion to be amended in the way I have suggested. We should do nothing that is likely to create in the minds of an Ally a feeling of distrust, and it seems to me that there could he placed upon this motion a construction altogether foreign to the wishes and desires of honourable memhers. If we left the disposal of these island colonies to the Conference which is to settle the peace terms, it would remove what I may term the' personal note when we speak of Australia and New Zealand. IfI cannot get my ideas accepted, I shall vote for the motion, such as it is. ; motion having been introduced, set in terms which every member of the House can cordially endorse, I feel it is my duty to interpose on a proposal which ' one might prefer tp see passed without comment or question, my own views as bo tlie possibility of justice requiring something further for Australia than what is actually implied in its terms. Instead of being a humble member of the House, had I tlie responsibility attaching to the Government, I should have hesitated to introduce this motion, and for two reasons. In the first place, I realize that we are speaking as a section of the Empire upon a subject on which we have every right to be heard; but we are not speaking to persons without sympathy for us, or who have no difficulties in the",60,Lamond That Is It To The Flag Of Germany Never Dream

His house has in ""all human likelihood been insured, as the ship undoubtedly was, so that civilian reparation means reparation to the Government for damage done to its civilians. What is the difference between the damage done to the civilians of this country by the taxation levied -here, and the damage done to the civilians of the Mother Country? The latter has been met by the various insurance schemes specially' formulated to meet such contingencies; and the very insurance companies could not have reparation made to them, because they have put up their premiums in order to be able to meet the claims made. I shall take honourable members one . stage f u r t h e r; and this is, perhaps, the most interesting phase to my mind. The Empire makes war as a whole, with all its energies and heart, for a common purpose. But in the terms of peace, under Â©ur loose Constitution, one section of the Empire-on e Government, fortunately, composed of the very best of persons with the deepest sympathy for us and our aspirations-make s the peace. Again, the one section that makes the peace gets, on behalf of the Empire-for it is the trustee for the Empire-anythin g which comes out of the melting pot, amongst which may be some of the potentially richest provinces in the world. Take one simple illustration. Let us assume that the Peace Conference decides that Mesopotamia, which at one time was the granary of the then civilized world, is not to revert to that tyrannical and wasteful rule thatturned it fro m a granary to a desert, but it. If that happens, not the' Empire, but the TJnited Kingdom, which is the trustee for the Empire, gets territory worth thousands of millions sterling, while Australia gets another oompetitor in .grain in the markets of the Mother Country. I do not say these things in any spirit <jf cavil, because honourable members on both sides know that my whole desire, -since I have been a member of this House, has been to wipe out the anomalies in this loose Imperial Constitution of ours, and give the people throughout the British Dominions another suffrage, the right to have some part in the conduct of the Empire's international affairs. be called disloyal. things now because I think that the shortest, way to success is to be perfectly frank and free. As one of the keenest Imperialists in this Chamber, through all the years I have sat here, I say that it is of vital importance to the solidarity of our race in the future that the Dominions of the Empire shall be generously and considerately treated in connection with the peace proposals. I do not for a moment say, as some people loosely say in the street, that this .country should have all its war expenditure met. There is one part of our war expenditure that this country would be too proud to have met by others; I refer to the extra money we are only too happy to have paid to our soldiers, an expenditure we prefer to bear as a. tribute to the men who have kept us where we are. But there are some phases of our expenditure which should be met, in justice to the country, first on the ground that the phrase ' ' .civilian reparation "" does not meet our needs.; secondly, that any territorial aggrandisement the Empire gets is at the expense, so to speak, of Australia in providing another competitor; and thirdly, because I trust that this Empire of ours in the future will every day grow closer together, with the people in greater sympathy and harmony, and .that we should look back"" upon a common gain without any bitterness at the suffering that has gone. I do hope that we shall get one that the Empire is to ' receive compensation at the Peace Conference that has been referred to to-day, -but which I believe is none the less real. The greatest military Powers in the world have been disarmed, and that, in my humble judgment, means that many swords may be turned into many plough-shares, and many energies that have been devoted to preparations for war may well, be diverted to the development of the resources of mankind. I hope and believe that that is one of the results we shall get out of this war. But we would be mad to assume that this is the",64,Lamond That Is It To The Flag Of Germany Never Dream

I need not refer to the direction in which such things may possibly occur again, but let us hope that so long as we live we shall not have a repetitainly opposed to such references. tion of what we have passed through during the last few years. I have urged my views in connection with this motion in no sense because I fear the justice we shall receive at the hands of the Mother Country, but solely that those who may work sympathetically for us in connection with the peace proposals may realize that the terms of this motion are not all that justice requires for the Australian Commonwealth. [8.22] -Many times during this discussion we on this side of the chamber have been taunted with the question, "" Will you vote for' the motion ?"" I say emphatically that I shall not vote for the motion as it is worded, and I take the risk ofall the threats that may be made as to what I am immediately called to order. will happen to me on account of that attitude. The wording of the motion is somewhat peculiar, especially as we are dealing with the islands in the Pacific. It says that in ho circumstances shall the captured German Possessions in the Pacific, which are now occupied by Australian and New Zealand troops, be restored to Germany. There is no reference whatever to the islands captured by Japan. I know it is a very nasty statement to make, but I must accept the responsibility for saying that I would as soon have the Germans holding the islands in the Pacific as I would have the J apanese. introduce that phase at this stage? a reference of that kind to an Allied Power permissible under' the Standing Orders? Johnson) I was about to intervene when the honourable member rose to the point of order. I think it would be very i l ladvised -on the part of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to pursue the subject which he has introduced. He has referred to one of our Allies in terms which may cause serious offence. I am sure he will recognise the unwisdom of further references of the kind, and that the general sense of the House is cernot intended to be offensive. I speak solely from the industrial and racial standpoints. It does seem somewhat peculiar that members on the Government side should be able to give expression to their feelings without restraint, and that the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Kelly) should be able to make a remark which, if voiced by me, would have been considered disloyal. Throughout the war I have refrained from alluding to one of our Allies, but the motion says that in no circumstances must Germany, whether reformed or. otherwise, re-occupy the Pacific islands, because to do so would be to create a menace to Australia. When I endeavour to point to another menace I quite understand the delicacy of the situation, and I would be the last person to introduce any discussion that would be likely to bring about international difficulties ; but I am of opinion that nothing I may say will create any difficulty between Great Britain and Japan. Today the Caroline and Marshall Islands are controlled by Japan. member not to pursue that subject. ruling, sir, but I fail to see that it is any reflection on the people or Government of Japan to say that they desire the possession of those islands. between discussing New Guinea and discussing the Caroline and Marshall Islands? cumstances of the present time, there is a great difference between a discussion of the future of territory taken from a conquered enemy and the discussion of the future of captured territory at present .controlled by one of our Allies.",66,Lamond That Is It To The Flag Of Germany Never Dream

According to my knowledge of history at some time in the past Great Britain has been at war with every one of her present Allies. men. to the time when the name of Bussia was anathema to every Britisher. We remember well the great Russian scare of not many years ago. We were told that Russia was menacing India, and endeavouring to obtain political influence in Afghanistan. British politicians"" and the press discussed that matter very freely, and the feeling towards Russia was war. As a matter of fact, the war was one of real hatred, because the Russians desired, just as the Germans have done, to able members studied the history of Gersecure the trade of India. said to be sapping the commercial interests of Britishers in that country. There is no need for me to recite the dipastic about the war when they thought lomatic arrangements that were made to avert the threatened trouble, because honourable members are familiar with the facts. At the time of the Fashoda incident the French and the British peoples were,at variance; feeling ran high, there was talk of war. Nobody ever dreamed that Britain would ever be at war with Turkey, because Turkey always looked upon Great Britain as one of her protectors; yet for the last four years we have been waging war against the Turkish Empire. We are discussing now our future relations with the German nation, with which we have never previously been at war. Hitherto there has always been an affinity between Great Britain and Germany, but to-day the two nationsare enemies, and the name of Germany is anathema to every Britisher. is not surprised? understand any people feeling hatred towards another people who, by no stretch of imagination, can be blamed, as a people, for what has taken place during the last. few years. against the unfortunate German worker in regard to this war, and if the Allies, High Command'did. approve of them. as peoples, do not wish to be placed in the same category with the Germans, of whose "" kultur "" we have spoken so sarcastically, they will not deal with the German people, as some persons desire that they shall be dealt with. Have honourable members read the speech of President Wilson published in yesterday's press, in which he spoke of his feelings towards the German people? The Prime Minister of Australia ( Mr Hughes) has expressed himself similarly, and so has Mr Fisher, the former Leader of the Labour Party. I know, of course, that he was brought to book for his remarks. I say, again, that we have no right to blame the German people for the purely a Prussian design. Have honorThey were many and learnt how the different States were forced into the German Federation? there was a chance of winning. supposed to have enthusiastic feelings towards the present Government, but have they ? Are the people to be charged with the remissness of the Government? Do honourable members understand the limited power of the German people in the Reichstag?

No reformed Germany under a socialistic regime would tolerate a Hindenburg in its that they will have no more of Kaiserism, and will become.,, as we ourselves would like to be, although we are not,a civilized nation, will honourable members still say that in no circumstances shall Germanv nave the opportunity of regaining her overseas dominions ? The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Kelly) gave the whole show away when he referred to the present value of copra. I am' informed that the oij and butter extracted from copra will supplant almost every other product of that character. We say that we shall not deal commercially with the Germans; that we shall not accept their cure for cancer, or for bald heads; that we shall not listen to their music; that we shall not encourage through commerce any of their great discoveries, such as making cocoanut oil palatable. The Germans, in their organized thoroughness, have discovered how to make that cocoanut oil palatable, wherefore it has now I admit that; but become a matter of commercial concern throughout the world. There are teeming millions of Jews in Europe who are fond of fried edibles, and to whom the f a t of the pig is abhorrent.

The extracts from copra are now When did Great being used to a vastly greater extent than ever before. The product of copra in future will be in greater demand than ever.

There is not an honourable member opposite, who is conversant with the history of Britain's troubles, and of her desire for dominance and commercial expansion, but who must be aware that those islands of the Pacific may create further international turmoil.

We say, rightly, that every brick torn from every building in the territories occupied by the German army, that every tree hewn down and blown down, and that every ton of coal and iron taken from the mines of Erance and Belgium shall be paid for by Germany. It is quite right that Germany should repay and make reparation for all such things as that.; for I know that if we had lost the war there would have been added to our burden of war indebtedness by the Prussian military caste ah indemnity which would have rendered us abject slaves foi generations and centuries to come. But that is what we are trying to do with Germany now.

I ask the honorahle member for Wannon to cease interjecting. The nature of these interjections is such as to create a very high state of feeling in the House, and provoke considerable disorder. Therefore it is more than ever necessary for honourable members to exercise a reasonable degree of self-restraint in the matter of interjections. member ask the boys who have come back from the Eront what they think of the "" poor "" Belgians. I am not allowed to pursue that matter further, but I can say that there is just as much to the discredit putting our views before the people. of the Belgian people as there is to the discredit of the German people. We talk about the feeling of one nation to another. It is quite within the bounds of possibility that New Zealand may declare war against Australia over these islands in the Pacific. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) may laugh, but the desire of the people of New pen to him when he is crushed henea,th Zealand is to secure control of some of the islands They claim Samoa, and when it comes to a question of partitioning we may find Governments which are Looking for benefits out of the war attacking one another if they think that benefits are being secured by others'which are not accruing to themselves. . If I am any judge, ill-feeling will be created between Australia and New Zealand. We have our Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) in Great Britain urg* ing the claims of Australia. On the other hand, we have the Ward-Massey combination urging the interests of New Zealand. I bet the four of them are not like lambs lying down in the fold. Each is trying to get special benefits for his own country, not for the people, but for the commercialism of his own country. At a.football match I have seen as much feeling and hatred displayed by the opposing teams and their supporters as could be displayed by people of hostile countries towards one another. At times feelings of hatred find expression in this chamber, but I must say that they are not so strenuously expressed as they are outside among the supporters of the parties here. During an election or a conscription referendum campaign in Australia greater hatred has been displayed than has ever been felt by. the people of Erance and Germany towards one another. No stronger hand and no greater exercise of the mailed fist or the Kaiser spirit could have been exercised by the ex-Emperor of Germany than was exercised by the present Prime Minister during his last two fights against the Labour party.

The retention of our control over these islands is absolutely essential to our safety and integrity. It is clearly pointed out in the report of the Inter-State Commission that there is only one means by which the people of these territories can be raised to anything like a reasonable standard of civilization, and that j s by providing for the natives a system of education, including the teaching of a uniform language, so that they may be trained to habits of industry. On the occasion of a recent visit' to JapanI had an opportunity to call at the Philippines. ThereI saw bhe Filipinos being trained under a system of State education. English is being taught as a compulsory subject in all the State schools, and the natives are being trained to take charge of their own affairs. They occupy all the seats in both Houses of Parliament, and fill important positions in the various schools. They carry out for themselves most of the administrative work of the .country. Thi3 is an illustration of the fact that with a proper system of Government control providing for the education of the natives and the compulsory teaching of a uniform language, it is possible to raise the people of these islands to something like .a reasonable standard of civilization. exactly savages. they are in some respects similar to the native races of Papua. : is superior to the Papuan. had the opportunities that the Filipinos have enjoyed.

The terms of this motion are such as should meet with the unanimous approbation of tliis Parliament.

B r it a in has the most right to them, and -is in the best position to govern them. When we recognise the part that the Pacific musb play in the world's destiny, and how essential it is that Australia, should continue a part of the British Empire, we shall realize at once that we should cultivate a closer re. lationship w i th the great Republic of the United States of America.

336,Mr Considine (Barrier) [9.28],"proposition to place before a Parliament that claims to represent ""one of the most advanced Democracies in the world. We are told in the termsof this motion that it is essential for the future safety and welfare of Australia that the captured German Possessions in the Pacific, which are now occupied by Australian and New Zealand troops, should not, in any circumstances, be restored to Germany. I am one of those who believe that the German working classes do not want the return of the colonies. I do not believe that any intelligent working class community, or section of humanity to-day, concerns itself with the question of Golonial Possessions. A far greater question interests the, people of the world today. It is not alone in the belligerent countries where thrones have toppled over, and where others are shaking, that this attitude is to be found. The peoples of the world are undergoing a mental revolution. The great catastrophe that overwhelmed Europe has left no part of the world untouched. classes of all countries have been affected by this great catastrophe, which has quickened their minds, widened their vision, and shown to them that there are other considerations more important than that of who shall own certain islands in the Pacific or elsewhere. To-day, the working classes of the world are not concerning themselves with these, to my mind, comparatively trivial affairs. They do not _ concern themselves with the question of who shall control the Pacific but own the world and make impossible a repetition of the tragedy that has just closed; and I trust that we have intelligence enough in the world to prevent such a repetition. I am sure that not one of us desires to see war; and if we could formulate some scheme to abolish it we would do so. It is claimed that under no circumstances shall the Pacific islands, now occupied by Australian and New Zealand troops, be returned to Germany. The German Empire has gone for ever, though the German people We do not know how they will re-establish themselves, whether as a number of Ifr. Considine. independent Republics or a federation of free peoples. This is only a surface motion, a move to take advantage of the patriotic and latent national spirit in the people of Australia for political purposes. That this is the real reason for the motion is supported by the contention of the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond), that, no nation but the Commonwealth of Australia should have control of these islands. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Kelly) told us that he is an out-and-out Imperialist. I believe that that is true, and that honourable gentlemen opposite, conscientiously for the most part, hold the opinion that in Imperialism lies the safety of the Commonwealth and the continuance of the Empire. My own opinion is that Imperialism is not a good doctrine, because it means the crushing out of liberty. The Commonwealth, if it desires to pursue a national policy, would be far better-served The working by one such as that adopted by the United States of America prior to the AmericanSpanish wara policy of minding its own affairs on the continent without regard to outlying Possessions contiguous thereto. We are told that it is not for economic gain that Australia desires these Possessions in the Pacific, but only with the idea of safeguarding the Commonwealth. The object, it is said, is to take hostages for the future, because, if these islands got and the islands therein, into the possession of some foreign power, who, or which class, shall it would be necessary to largely increase our naval and military expenditure. Yet, during the course of the war, we were told that it would result in a League of Nations, the grand outcome of which would be the rendering of war impossible, with the supremacy of the Allies on sea and land. comes of the argument that we must have naval bases in the Pacific? remain. by negotiation. whether it is.

340,Mr Considine,"I do not know the imposition of the harshest terms possible, only leave a legacy of hate; and we have a striking instance in the policy'of revenge that ruled Francef r o m 1870. However, that is outside the scope of the motion. The only attempted justification for the motion has been that put forward by those who term themselves Imperialists, and believe in Imperial expansion. The oration of the honourable member for Wentworth ( MrK e l l y ) ,was a lesson' to yesterday are the friends of to-morrow; nil economic students, as showing why the islands in the Pacific should be acquired by Australia. The reason given is that these islands are rich in copra, and, as the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) told us, there are good indications of oil. The' honourable member for Wentworth pointed to Mesopotamia as the granary of the world, and he waxed sadly eloquent as he contemplated the future competition, of that country, under British control, with Australia in the production of foodstuffs. Althoughi t has been stated that Australia, tbe Empire, and our Allies entered the war without any thought of acquiring an inch of territory, it is remarkable .should hav.e been made by similar statesmen at the time of the Boer war in 1899. On the latter occasion the object was stated to be merely that of, obtaining the franchise for the Uitlanders, but at the conclusion of hostilities the two Republics were incorporated in the British Empire. happy coincidence; and so with Mesopotamia, the Pacific Islands, and so forth. of opinion by those of us whose views are not in harmony with the ideas of the supporters of this motion will not produce any great tangible result. We are asked to be silent at this stage in-the history of Australia, because the people today are naturally in an excited state over the victory of the Allies; and it is thought that we might be afraid to runcounter to the popular trend. . It may be that popular .opinion in Australia will endorse this motion, but I am satisfied that the working men and women in the country, when the war fever has died down and ordinary work-a-day existence [286] is resumed, will not care who is in possession of the Pacific Islands. dren to be protected in the future. a proposal of the kin d in regard to which that same old argument was not used. Honourable members opposite have told us that our Allies of 100 years ago are our enemies to-day-that the enemies of and it may be that history will repeat itself. We on this side may not say a word about our friends of to-day, though honourable members opposite may tell us about the friends of yesterday being our enemies of to-day. The people of Australia, the Empire, and the world will be asked to train children, to build up armaments, in order to safeguard Australia, not this time in Europe, but much nearer home. We shall be told, as in the past, that the greatest security for peace is to prepare for war. This war, which was to end war, is, apparently, to result i u making preparations against some at least of our quondam friends, because if the victorious Allies of to-day are supreme on land and sea, war, if it comes, must be amongst themselves. What is there that similar protestations inherent in the system that makes war m the future, not only possible, but probable? It is the same thing that is behind this motion-the conflict for markets, and the necessity for reaching ou'u for fresh lands. As Professor Atkinson pointed out last night in the Herald,the League of Nations, which is toreOf course, that was only a deem humanity, is but the political framework of another trust-it is the' oil trusts, steel trusts, and others which have I recognise that the expression broken the confines of any one nation, and are reaching oufc for international control.

344,' Mr Considine,"And we shall findStates of America is organizing its shi^s and the whole industrial and commerch 1 paraphernalia. It is nothing but a world economic imperialism, of which we are laying the foundations, and this motion is one of the bricks fitting into the Imperial structure that is being raised for the purpose of the international exploitation of the workers more freely than took place und'er the old divisions and. groupings of the world. To-day it is not Germany fhat is to be our enemy. all sorts of virtues will be discovered in the middle ploiters of Germany. Wien the German workers and their Soviets are attempting to follow the example of their working class brethren in Russia, in establishing a free and independent, economic and political organization, there will be no more talk about the ""Huns."" atrocities of the German militarists and exploiters of the German people will be forgotten, and all sorts of tales will be issued through the Northcliffe press and its agencies about the atrocities of the Bolsheviks of Germany. We shall find more apologists like Eord MilneT, who says, ""We do not want Bolshevism in Germany,"" and Sir Edward Carson, who has fallen foul of Lord Northcliffe on the same subject; and though it was said to be necessary foT the Empire to go to war in order to make the world safe for Democracy, we shall be told that there is too much Democracy in Europe, and that it must not be carried too far, because the poor, ignorant Russians and Germans do not know how to govern themselves. We are told that the German people are responsible for the crimes of their taskmasters-the people who were kept down by the bayonets aud rifles of the German autocracy, and who had the choice of being shot in front by the Allies or being stabbed in the back by the bayonets of their own soldiers. And the Australian workers would have been in just the same position if honourable members opposite had had their way, and conscription had been adopted. The German people have had to carry the military legions of the Kaiser; but the Russian revolutionaries sent 10,000 emissaries into Germany and Mr Considine. used the ambassador's presence in Berlin for the purpose of disseminating Bolshevik literature throughout Germany, with the result that to-day the German autocracy is broken down. Wheu the Bolshevik revolution broke out in Russia, I prophesied that the ideas of the Bolsheviks would be found more efficacious on the Western Front than would the bayonets of all the Allies, and that prophecy has been realized. To-day not a throne in .GerIn a few weeks' time many is occupied; all are marked "" To Let."" In Austria the same thing' is occlass excurring, but the only concern of the exploiters in this country is whether they can wring indemnities out of the people who are endeavouring to emancipate themselves. Indemnities and annexations are for honourable members opposite to settle; they do not interest the working All the class in this or any other country. They in every country have to work to pay the indemnities, which the capitalists will collect and enforce so long as they have the power behind.them. Not only in Germany and Austria and Bulgaria are thrones falling to the ground, and the aristocrats being invited to leave, but we read that the Dutch Socialists in Holland are to hold a meeting on Sunday to consider the question of declaring a Soviet Republic in Holland. The Swiss workers, too, are active. To-night's paper reportsA general strike has begun everywhere . . . . There is considerable labour unrest of a revolutionary character throughout Switzerland, and strong hostility is being shown tomeasures aiming at the preservation of order. The Federal Council announces its intention to call up additional troops, and will resist the revolutionary movement for reforms, which, it is prepared to introduce voluntarily. In Sweden a movement is afoot for the establishment of a Republic, and a cable message statesThe Independent Socialists in Sweden have issued a manifesto urging the formation of workmen's, soldiers, and peasants' councils everywhere, for the purpose of bringing in a Republic, a Socialist Government, general demobilization, and an eight-hour day. The whole world is seething with unrest. We are in the midst of a change in the 'economic order, and within a few months, or, at the most, a few years, we shall mat be concerned with the acquisition of New Guinea or other islands in the Pacific; but honourable members who represent the capitalistic interests will -be concerned as to how they will preserve control of those means of government which enable them to exploit the working class of this country. The history of the development of British institutions is that the authorities have always forestalled revolution -by reform, and I hppe that will be Just as Australia was spared the horrors incidental to the conscription system, so, too, I hope it will be spared the civil strife and bloodshed thatother countries have had to go through in order to find their way to freedom.. I hope that honourable members will be wise in their day and generation, and will not waste time with such trumpery affairs-as the ownership of the captured German Possessions in the Pacific, because they know f u l l well that there is no possibility that they will be returned to Germany. -The German Empire, as a military Power, is ended.. The German people are in the ascendant; the working class has control, and the workers in no country, who are out for economic freedom, have any use for colonial Possessions.. They are not out to perpetuate the economic -imperialism that necessitates the exploitation of other countries and their populations. Their policy is to take possession of the machinery of wealth production, and to make .it impossible to set one people against another -really represent their ""desires, ber is frightening the honourable member -for Grampians ( Mr Jowett). frighten anybody; brat as the honourable member is unusually silent, my remarks must bave had some effect upon him. I have a recollection of having read in one of the world's good books that certain rich men. were told that the only way for them to reach salvation was to get rid of their possessions, and they went away sorrowful, because they had much. The matters with which I have been dealing demand serious attention, and cannot be dismissed by a casual laugh. They reach down into fundamentals. The whole structure of capitalistic society rests upon economic conditions, and all that that means; and we cannot leave economic conditions in this country unchanged while the world is rocking and seething with revolution. If we are to avoid the catastrophies that are occurring in other countries, we must devote our brains and energies to an alteration of the economic conditions in Australia, the experience -in Australia. to giving the workers industrial as well as political Democracy.

I cannot 'understand why there should have been such a qualification and l i m itation as there is in ,the terms of the motion. If those words of limitation were inserted accidentally, or without f u l l recognition of their significance, I thafc they deleted. If they were inserted deliberately, I would prefer personally to dissociate myself from the limitation. the present circumstances, however,it is infinitely important that a resolution should go for t h from this Parliament drawing the attention of the I m perial Government and of the Allies to this most important aspect of the future of the whole of the German colonies, so far as Australian sentiment is concerned. I wo'ild', however, have the more heartily voted for such a motion without the limitation. islands are a good place for cattle, if not for sheep. minds me of another aspect of the debate. It has been inferred by speakers opposite, as a slur upon those honourable members supporting the'motion on this side, that in some way our demand that the former German colonies should' not. be restored to Germany is due to the fact that some people in Australia hope to obtain commercial advantage, or that they desire some further acquisition of territory. believe that I speak for all honourable members on this side when I say that there is no such thought in tbe minds of honourable members. ""Upon a celebrated occasion in the House of Commons during the Napoleonic Wars, one of England's greatest patriots and statesmen-the prototvpe, I am inclined to say. of . Lloyd GeorgeWilliam P it t the younger, was asked by one of the leading members of the Opposition ( Mr Tierney) if he could give in a single sentence a reason why England should continue the war against Erance. P it t replied, "" I can answer, not in a single sentence, but in a single word, and that word is 'safety'. "" And that is our answer to the taunts of the Opposition with respect to. our motives now. The object of this motion can be put into one word, that is safety-safet y for Austraha, for the British Empire, for civilization against the greatest danger that has ever menaced mankind.

402,,"Mr JOWETT -That is everything.these islands are so nearly contiguous to Australia that their occupation-no t by an enemy, because nobody supposes there will be any change in their occupation during a time of war, but by a Power with whicli at some time or other we may have been at war-woul d he a danger to the Commonwealth. The logical extension of that argument is that, wherever we possess territory we should obtain possession of territory, in order to protect it , and that thus we should run up our flag' on the various small islands of the Pacific, declaring our right from propinquity to all, even those remotely associated with us geographically, until we have extended round the universe a chain of* power curiously like that described by the notlamented Kaiser as World Power. One wonders what w ill he the danger to Australia arisinsr from the possession by fche German people of islands in the Pacific, if the objects for which this war has been waged are achieved. fchose objects was to make the world safe for Democracy. Now if the world is to be made safe for Democracy, it certainly follows that we musfc give effect-to another of President Wilson's fourteen pointsfche one relating to the reduction of armaments. Good headway has been made in this direction in the case of the Germanic Power. But before that result.can be achieved, we had to accept the declaration, not only that there would be a reduction of armaments on thp part of Germany, but that there would be a reduction of armaments on the part of all civilized Powers involved in this war. That is one of the provisions of the fourteen points laid down by President Wilson. Thus, although we of the Labour movement, and the Internationalist movement, view with intense pleasure the overthrow of German militarism, We recognise that the work which our soldiers have accomplished in that regard will .be largely u n f r u it f ul if it be confined to one country, to the British Government. It puts in reand does not apply to all the belligerent nations. If , therefore, f u l l effect is to be. given fco the points affirmed by President Wilson, it necessarily follows that not only will Germany be rendered harmless as a [287]It is said that military Power, but that all the nations affected by the peace terms which are shortly to be adopted, will also be rendered incapable of inflicting misery on the world in the way that militarism has done in the past. If , then, the world is made safe for Democracy, what matters this resolution, which is based, as the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr. Jowett) would have us believe, on .consiadjacent or nearly contiguous derations of safety. Suppose-and I do not advocate"" it-that these Pacific islands were to revert to Germany. I s it not perfectly clear that if effect be given to the peace terms, they cannot be used for any aggressive purpose? Words were recently used by a gentleman in Sydney, which Â«eem to me to illuminate some of -the observations made by the honourable member for Grampians and others this evening. A little while ago the retention of what were called the "" H u n "" colonies was discussed by the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, and Mr R. Teece submitted a motion in One of that connection, which was unanimously agreed to. That resolution readsThat in view of the German possessions in the Pacific having been taken possession qf by Great Britain during the present war, it is in the best interests of the British Empire and the sifety of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that they sliould be retained by Great Britain. This resolution to be forwarded to each Chamber of Commerce and other public body throughout the Commonwealth, with the suggestion to approve and confirm. The attitude of the Government towards this question, towards the Allies, and towards the Imperial, authorities, is -illuminated by the words attributed to Mr Teece when submitting that motion. He said--He felt humiliated that through the supineness of the British Government the necessity for such a motion had arisen. It is perfectly evident that this resolution, so f a r as it can have any effect, w ill, if adopted, operate as an embarrassment spectful terms what Mr Teece expressed in terms lacking respect. It affirms that the British Government have exhibited supineness in this matter. Doesi t not occur to honourable members opposite that",83,Lamond That Is It To The Flag Of Germany Never Dream

That may be five years, ten years, or twenty years hence, but this Government implies that never at any time, although the Avar is over, and although they do not know what the terms of peace will be, is our attitude to alter. Although the Imperial Government and the Imperial Prime Minister himself has laid clown the policy that there must be no such thing as mere useless punitive reprisals, although the Imperial Government is opposed to any of the absurd economic boycotts which were accepted at the Paris Conference largely through the folly of our Prime these things have come to pass-w e are pledging ourselves by this resolution at to colonial claims.

I am sure that nobody is in a hurry to settle this .momentous question; but, at the same time, although I propose to have a good deal to say in regard to the adjustment of territorial claims and Imperial questions as they will arise after the war, I think I have sufficiently indicated my view of this motion. challenged by the acting Prime Minister to vote against the motion, and I was threatened that if I did so I would be represented outside this Parliament as being a spokesman for Germany and a supporter of German interests.

Joint control was instituted in Samoa, with the result that Germany and Britain were on the verge of war on two separate occasions. With America and Great Britain withdrew from the island in disgust, and allowed them to do as they chose.
