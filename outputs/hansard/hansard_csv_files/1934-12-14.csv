0,"Asked A Question Relating To The Position Of The Trade Agreement Between Canada And Australia. As This Agreement Is Of Great Value To The Canned F R U I T S Industry, I Should Be Glad Of Information As To The Present Position? Members W I L L Appreciate That, I N The Great Survey We Arc Making Designed To Bring About A Number Of Trade Treaties, I T Is Impossible To Expect Them To Be Finalized Within The Short Time That Has Elapsed Since This Government Came Into Office. The Work Involved Requires, Not Only Investigation I N Australia, But Also A Great Deal Of Contact With Countries Over","seas. Attention is being given to tbe Canadian position. of the Minister been drawn to a press report of a statement made by Mr Irvine Geddes, of the Orient Shipping Line, at the launching of the liner Orion that "" an artificial l i m it is now placed on the size of ships for the Australian run. If the Orion's beam had been increased no dry dock in Australia could take her."" In view of the serious nature of the statement, w ill the Minister say if it is correct? The honourable member was good enough te inform me yesterday that he proposed to raise this matter. Island Dockyard is able to dock the Orion, and even vessels of greater length, beam and draft. Mr Geddes must have been misinformed on the subject. fact that it is at least ten years since the Orient Company docked any vessel at Cockatoo Island probably accounts for the mistake. MT . PRICE the South Australian biscuit manufacturers a letter which reads as follows:The biscuit industry appears to be receiving all the "" knocks"" of recent legislation. Already subject to 5 per cent, ealea tax (whilst their competitive lines such aa cakes, buns. *c., are exempt), they are in January next to be burdened with a flour tax, creating double taxation, the sales tax being collected on the flour tax. Now, in addition to these taxes, the Federal Government has seen fit to give the industry a further ""knock"" by considerably reducing the tariff on imported biscuits. The members of this association earnestly solicit your assistance in lodging a very strong protest on their behalf, and request that the former tariff rates be reinstated. They would appreciate your taking this inatter up with other South Australian representatives at Canberra, and hope that your combined efforts will result in the lessening of the burdens inflicted on the biscuit manufacturing industry. W ill the Minister give an undertaking that honourable members will be given an opportunity to debate this important question before the duty becomes operative? on the notice-paper for discussion, and the item "" biscuits"" w ill be discussed with others in the schedule. I shall, however, clear up one misunderstanding of the honourable member. Sales tax on flour w i ll apply to all imported biscuits.

Would a decrease in the distribution of Hansard lead to the curtailment of speeches in thia House, and will tlie Minister consult his colleagues and Mr Speaker as to the quesur a religious organization) and includes any tion of bringing about a desirable economy in this regard? I do not propose to venture any opinion as to the rjossibility of a decrease of the circulation leading to a curtailment of speeches in this House. That is for honourable members themselves to determine, although it occurs to me that it is a matter to be governed by the Standing Orders rather than by any move in the direction suggested in the honourable member's question. Houses were originally allowed twelve copies for distribution to those whom they nominated. This number was some years later increased to 35. Lists aru furnished by members to the Government Printer. In the first Parliament a general instruction was given to the Principal Parliamentary Reporter by President Baker and Mr Speaker Holder to grant any application from newspapers registered by the Postmaster-General's Department, schools of art and kindred organizations, debating societies having a membership of 50 or over. This has been acted upon, and taken to include organizations employees. No other presiding officer in this Parliament has felt justified in altering that direction. 1 may add that the National Library is tbe richer by the overseas publications it receives in exchange for copies of the Commonwealth parliamentary debates, and that there is an ever-increasing demand for these debates from the leading libraries of the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

"" The object of this amendment is to give uffect to a suggestion I made during the Kocond-reading debate with due regard to the criticism of that suggestion made by the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey). The evil of the clause as it stands is that it creates an offence of making a false return or furnishing false particulars, and does not enable the offender to plead that he made the false return or furnished the false particulars innocently. Under a he original act, if the defendant could satisfy the court that he had furnished a false return or supplied false particulars through ignorance or inadvertence, that was a complete defence. That provision in July last was cut out of the act, I think, through ignorance or inadvertence, because .the attention of the House at the time was not drawn to it. I suggested that it should be restored. The Minister made certain criticisms of that suggestion which carried a good deal of weight, and I have given consideration to them in framing this amendment. It is a serious thing for a man to be convicted of having made a false statement or furnished -a false return. It stigmatizes him for life as a liar, or, possibly, a perjurer. It could be brought up against him in cross-examination in any court proceeding, and he might have great difficulty in exculpating himself by trying to show that the court did not think he had wilfully committed this offence. WhatI propose, and the Minister is meeting me to a certain extent, is that in a prosecution for an offence under paragraph c of sub-clause 1 of this clause, or section 45 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act 19301934, it shall be a defence if the defendant proves that he has not previously been convicted of any offence against the act and that, so far as be knew, the statement, if prepared by him personally, was perfectly accurate and, if prepared by any one else on his behalf, was, if false, made through ignorance or inadvertence. Of the weight that should be attached to the allegations of the defendant the court would be the judge,I think the committee should agree to my proposal, or alter tbe act. A man should not be charged and convicted of having made a opportunity to urge in his own defence that it was not incorrect to his knowledge. surer) [10.31] A limited number of typewritten copies of an amendment which I propose to submit have been circulated among honourable members. It is on the lines generally indicated by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn); but the Government is unable to accept bis amendment in its full form. One reason is that it seeks to",17,Sales Tax Procedure Bil L

18,Mr Casey (Corio,"Assistant Treaamend section 45 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930-1934. Throughout this bill the Government has endeavoured not to touch the existing structure of the law. All prosecutions in future will be under this measure when it becomes law, and not under the individual sales tax assessment acts, except in an emergency. If and when we have cause during the course of tlie next calendar year to amend the sales tax assessment acts individually, I give an assurance that the Government will sympathetically consider an amendment of section 45 on the lines suggested by the honourable member for Bourke. In the meantime, all prosecutions will normally be under this legislation, and, in effect, section 45 will be defunct. would a defendant be able to plead inadvertence? actions are concerned; but we have had bitter experience in cases where leniency has been shown by tbe department. It is now held that a taxpayer must be responsible for the acts of bis accountant or other agent who makes up his returns. The revenue has definitely suffered on account of fraud. -Tb e proposal of the Minister goes two-thirds of the way towards meeting my amendment; but I should have thought it desirable to cover possible typing errors. It is important that section 45 of the Sales Tap Assessment Act (No. 1) should be amended at the earliest possible moment. As I pointed out when speaking on the second reading, this bill does not supersede that act; it merely provides an alternative procedure. T understand that the Minister assures us that, except in extreme cases, the Commissioner will not take any proceedings under the No. 1 act-the y will be taken under this bill-and that early next year the Government will consider the advisability of bringing the act into line with this measure. Therefore, I accept the Government's proposal, and ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment-by have-withdrawn . glad that the Minister has taken this course. Some time ago I came across a business man who could neither read nor write, and he had to depend entirely on outside assistance for the preparation of his returns. This legislation penalizes the small business man beyond all reason. I know one who was sent bankrupt last week because of the penalties imposed by the department. He admitted, bis guilt. The amount of sales tax due from 1930 to 1932 was set down as £58 os. 8d. For late payments he was charged £8 14s. Id., and for late lodgement of returns £20 19s. 7d. He was presented with an account for over £87, which is out of all proportion to the debt of £58. Since 1932 lie has mot his liabilities to the department. Everybody knows that whilst the small man cannot gather the sales tax from his clients, the big man can do so because of mass production. Officers of the department should not have tbe right to penalize. small men without taking them to court and obtaining a verdict. I do not know any firm in Sydney that can inflict penalties comparable with those imposed by the Taxation Department. The man to whom I have just referred had given a bill of sale over his property. He had been in business for twenty years, and owed practically nothing, except the debt to the department; but the department sent him bankrupt. If at any time he desires to revive his business, he must pay penalties amounting to at least £29, in addition to court costs. The charges inflicted by the department amount to usury, because the small man is unable to compete with the big man. The department is ""cleaning u p "" the small men all over Sydney. It says that those who do not pay their sales tax are competing unfairly against those who do. What about the honest man who pays the tax ? reasonable to impose such penalties on men in a small way of business. member desire the tax to apply only to the big men ? within certain limits; but I point out that leniency is not shown to tlie small men. big men.",18,Sales Tax Procedure Bil L

The Assistant Treasurer .( Mr Casey) has said that the wealthy cannot, evade this tax. In other avenues of taxation, it would seem that, distinct discrimination is exercised. At times the department goes out in the manner of a young and enthusiastic .policeman who is ambitious to obtain a stride, 'to harass and -make trouble for tbe little fellow, while it lets the big fellow go.

This clause provides for the imposition of a penalty in certain cases. The penalty should hot, always be on the one side. Powers are given which seem to me to be undue. This Parliament has undoubtedly been drifting into the prac lice of giving extraordinarily wide powers to Ministers and departmental heads. Reference is made in the 'clause to regulations made by the Commissioner. Surely when power exists to make regulations under the aet, additional powei should n'oi be given to the Commissioner to ehUble his staff either to request or to demand -information other than that required by the act.

I hare h'ad placed before me the Case of a man who lives in a eduntry district far distant from the city. He rarely sees a city newspaper. He paid £38 in sale's tax when there was no need to do so.

These additional advances will be dealt with by the commission in conjunction with the present indebtedness of the purchasers. At present it is competent for the War Service Homes Commissioner to increase the statutory advance to purchasers from £800 to £950 for the purpose of providing additional accommodation, renovations, construction of verandahs, or anything in the nature of additions to the home; but sewerage connection has been ruled as not being an addition to the home. Therefore, it is essential that the act should be amended to enable the Commissioner to make further advances to the purchasers to connect their homes with sewerage systems.

This bill provides for an appropriation of the sum of £5,000 as a grant to Mrs. Mary Josephine U l m , the wife of Flight Lieutenant C. T . P.

When this flight was in contemplation, representations were made to the Government that the Commonwealth should guarantee a bank overdraft to meet the expenses in connection with the purchase of an aeroplane in which to carry out the flight, and to meet other incidental expenses. given very careful consideration by the Government, which was informed by its technical advisers that the flight had a reasonable ehance of success. This assurance, together with the fact that a British aircraft was being used, and that the flight, if successful, would be a demonstration of the value of long-range flights between Australia and other continents, induced the Government to give the guarantee. The Government agreed that, in the unfortunate event of its having to stand up to its guarantee, it would approach Parliament for authority to appropriate the necessary moneys. The committee (Consideration of arrangement was that if MrU l m did not repay the overdraft to the Commonwealth Bank by the 30th June, 1935, the Commonwealth Government would liquidate the debt to the Commonwealth Bank over and above the proceeds from the securities held by the bank. The securities were a life policy for £10,000 taken out by Mr. Ulm, which had a proviso that if he met his death outside Australia while on a flying enterprise, not more than £5,000 should be claimable under it . The remaining security was the aeroplane, Faithi n Australia, which had an assumed value of between £3,000 and £4,000. These negotiations took place at the end of the last parliamentary session. It is now my unfortunate lot to introduce this hill, which has been made necessary by the tragedy which, it is assumed, has taken place. It was open to the Government to do one of two things. To let the Commonwealth Bank realize on the securities it holds would mean that Mr Ulm's widow would be left without any assistance at all, because I understand his assets of every description This sum represents the were pledged in various ways to enable him to get the necessary finance to make this flight. It was an all-in enterprise for MrU l m , and it has, unfortunately, failed. The Government had either to let things take their own course, in which case Mrs, U l m would be left without any means whatever, or allow Mrs. U l m to have at least the proceeds of her husband's life insurance policy, and that is what it is proposed to do. We were faeed with two possibilities: The first was to let the bank realize in due course on the life insurance policy and on the aeroplane The matter was and, if there were any deficiency, to make it up in cash to the Commonwealth Bank. The death of MrU l m , of course, is not yet assumed by the insurance company. In the ordinary course of events, the company would allow some considerable time to elapse before it paid the money due under the policy.

Ulm to the amount of the claim under the insurance policy, £5,000, and then let the Commonwealth Bank, in due course, when the insurance company is prepared to meet the liability, collect the amount due under the policy. The proposal as put to the House-and it is hoped that the House will accept it-is that the Government should make a direct grant of £5,000 to Mrs. Ulm and let the Commonwealth Bank realize on the securities which it holds. This will enable Mrs. Ulm to have the benefit of this money at an early date instead of having to wait for it for six or twelve months. In the unfortunate circumstances that obtain, I submit the bill to the House. I am sure that every honourable member feels the deepest sorrow and regret at what is deemed to have been the tragic end of a very gallant enterprise and of three very distinguished and gallant Australian aviators.

A new government might be faced with all sorts of liabilities of which it was totally unaware, and of which the public also was unaware. In this case I think the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) would greatly ease the anxiety of honourable members and the public generally if he could give us an assurance that there is no other guarantee, not necessarily to aviators, but to any enterprise that might have made a sentimental special appeal to members of the present or any preceding government. We are the custodians of the taxpayers' money, and should scrutinize and view with the greatest possible sense of justice tbe proposal now before us. I am not in any way casting a reflection upon the action of the Government in giving assistance to this particular flight. The guarantee, no doubt, was granted after proper inquiries had been made and recommendations received from expert advisers. But, assuming all this, it still leaves open the possibility of establishing a very dangerous precedent. I hope that the Assistant Treasurer will be able to give the assurance for which I have asked, and be able also to inform us that the arraiigement made was not published at the time either owing to business exigencies, or because Parliament was not actually in session. 1 whole-heartedly support this grant to the lady whose husband did so much for Australian aviation and who iu the end haa given his life in the cause of aviation. surer) [11.40] -S o far as my memory goes I believe the situation is unique.

In committee: I The bill. At the same time, I offer no objection to the bill, but 1 seek information on one point. Is it advisable that any government should guarantee expenses incurred in connection with an aeroplane flight across a large stretch of ocean? 1 understand that a very definite risk is undertaken by those who fly over large areas of water in an aeroplane as opposed to a seaplane. A seaplane offers a fighting chance, so far as I am able to gather from experts; but when an aeroplane is used in such circumstances the element of risk is very greatly increased. The late Mr Bert Hinkler was a personal friend of mine. In the course of conversation I asked him whether he did not think an aviator was undertaking an unnecessary risk in proposing to fly across a vast extent of ocean in an aeroplane, with no knowledge of what the weather conditions might be at the other end. He said that a seaplane was safer than an aeroplane, but that an aeroplane was preferred because it was faster. It is rather remarkable that two aviators who recently made a successful flight from Australia to New Zealand in an aeroplane should have been prosecuted",24,Second Reading

Unfortunately the precautions taken in this regard were ineffectual, and the machine has been lost. as a seaplane for such a flight? land machine, particularly one with a retractable undercarriage, is considerably faster. Au aviator sacrifices a certain amount of speed by using a 3eaplane, but 1 have no doubt that the comparative values of a seaplane and a land machine were taken into account by Mr Ulm. It is a fact that owing to the greater weight you do not get the same performance out of a flying boat that you get from an aeroplane. That too, no doubt, was taken into account. As to the possible commercial value of the flight, may I say that it was meant to have been the forerunner of a service from Australia at least as far as Honolulu. It was underthat these works should be put into operastood that Mr Ulm's scheme would not necessitate longer hops than 1,100 miles, landings being made at intermediate islands.

As to the major amounts to be granted to tbe States, particulars of which are set out in the bill, clause 4 providesAny amount granted to a State under this section shall be paid upon condition that it is expended by the State in the carrying out of such works as are, from time to time, specified by the Treasurer by notice published in the Gazette. The other portion of the bill relates to specific grants in aid of the mining industry. The nation owes a great deal to the workers who have fallen by the way in that industry, and it is a pathetic fact that at this stage of our history, in all the big mining centres, the health of the workers is undermined. They are suffering from incurable diseases, and they and their dependants have not the advantage of any substantial provision for their maintenance, in many cases, by way of invalid or other pensions. These conditions should not prevail in any civilized country. I urge that the present bill suggests two important lines of thought. One is tion with the utmost possible expedition, for they have been too long delayed. The other point is that they should be put into operation at standard living wages.

The causes may be summarized in this phrase: Unemployment arises out of the essentially and fundamentally wrong and unjust distribution of the wealth created by the worldng classes, and out of sweating. The root cure for unemployment is to re-establish the purchasing power of the consuming public, which is, in a very large majority, the working classes in Australia. ployment arises from capitalism. with the honorahle member.

Are there idle hands ready to be applied to work, and has the nation the resources available for supplying the fundamental needs of the people of this country?"" It would not take a very elaborate investigation to prove that there are idle bands, and expert hands, ready to be applied to useful work which is waiting to be done, and that the resources ol the nation are more than ample for the purpose. doubt as to the wealth production of Australia. All the problems we have been discussing in this chamber for weeks past arise from a glut of production. We do not know what to do with our surplus wheat. We do not appear to be able to market our superfluous wool and fruit. Thousands of people in this country could consume more fruit and more butter. Is there any doubt as to the fact that hundreds of thousands of children, women and men are insufficiently supplied with fruit? Is there any question at all but that the home market, in Australia for these commodities is under-supplied? The two problems are that the people are in want, and that we have a glut of the goods and materials necessary to supply those wants. Yet it is suggested that it would be unjust and impolite to attempt to put into operation any policy which wouid remove that absurd anomaly. As far back as the election of 1931, the working classes of Australia, emaccepted the assurances of the former Nationalist but then United Australia party that its return to power would mean employment for them. Those working men went to the poll with heads bowed and eyes averted in despair. They voted for the United Australia party in the belief, which was well founded, that it controlled the money-bags, and that through it alone employment could be obtained. That is nearly four years ago, and ever since some of them have been harbouring that "" hope deferred"" that "" maketh the heart sick"". What was the change at have no the last election? Large bodies of workers in electorates like my own, disgusted and disappointed, voted for the return of Labour men. Order! I always regret to have to interrupt a debate; but honourable members generally must realize that the discussion is becoming very wide of the bill, the purpose of which is ""to authorize the issue and application of a certain sum of money for the purposes of works and services and for the grant of financial Assistance to the States and for other purposes.""

It is true that the Treasurer is"" under obligation to certify that certain works are to be undertaken from time to time; but I have a vivid recollection of the neglect and delay of f«rtain State governments in the past in submitting plans for employment.

Further procrastination would be inexcusable. I have not sufficient confidence in many of the governments of the States to believe that they .ire seriously and intelligently grappling with this tremendous problem, and I am afraid that tbe curse of the Commonwealth, which is duality of control, will adversely affect the prospects of the unemployed people obtaining work.

It is idle to say that private enterprise should give the lead. The National Parliament, which controls tbe finance and taxation resources of the country, could set the pace, and it should not be subordinate to other governmental institutions. It could do much by precept and example to remove, in part, the horrid anomaly referred to over and over again recently in this Parliament that want, penury and misery abound in a land of plenty. to refer briefly to the methods adopted by at least one State authority making relief work available to the unemployed. I have received a letter from Western Australia in which the serious allegation is ma'de that"" the Government of that State fs denying wtfrk to person's who will not join a particular union. that *the"" Government of Western Australia has prepared a small programme of works under whioh each unemployed man in the country will receive £4 10s. before Christmas, aiftd the right to a railway faro to Perth; Shortly after that announcement was made, the ganger told his men that he bad received specific instructions from the Minister of Employment,. Mr ILenneally, that men were not to be employed on the job unless they joined the Australian Workers Union. Some of these men have never been unionists. They accepted this casual work simply because they were outof employment. They refused to join, the Australian Workers Union, and were promptly dismissed. The fee payable upon joining that union is 25s., of which, I am informed, 5s. is an affiliation fee in connection with the political activities of the union. I have no wish to embark upon a discussion of the principles"" of compulsory unionism. It is OUe of those matters upon which we' have differed aud will always differ. The point is, that the Government represents the whole community; it is providing public funds for puj-pbses of employment, and it is not its function to deprive any section of the community of the right to participate in this expenditure. It would be very wrong if the Ootrtmortwcalth Government, not being ia favour of compulsory unionism, laid it down that unionists should not be employed. It is equally wrong for a Government that believes in compulsory Unionism to deny a man the right to work merely because he will not join a union. I would protest against the adoption of coercive methods in any walk of life. This attempt to obtain from a man who is given casual employment, so that he may earn £4 10s. before Christmas, a fee of 25s., portion of which is to be devoted to political purposes, is a cruel form of extortion to which this Government should not be a party. These are public funds, and every unemployed man, whether he be a unionist or not, is equally entitled to the opportunity to share in their distribution. I call upon the Commonwealth",28,Casey

The State Government is acting purely as the agent for the Commonwealth, which is entitled to dictate the manner in which Commonwealth funds shall be distributed. I notice that the Minister must approve of all proposed works, and that it is not compulsory on him to provide money for any works. The Commonwealth is merely handing the money over to tbe States and local governing bodies, retaining the right of general supervision of the expenditure. It is a principle of the party that sits on this side of the House, and should be of everyone, that public funds should be equally available to every member of the community, irrespective of political, religious secure for themselves a good job at steady or any other beliefs. I trust that the Commonwealth will not permit any government to enforce its own political ideas in the distribution of these Commonwealth funds. disappointed with this measure, particularly in view of the fact that the schedule of works that we were given to understand would bo submitted by the 'Government has not been brought down. When approval was given recently to the raising of a loan of £5,000,000, the impression conveyed was that the money would bo allocated to purposes of employment. We now find that provision is made for the expenditure of only £1,533,750. New South Wales is to have the distribution of £350,000. Sub-clause 2 of clause 4 of the bill definitely states that any amount granted to any State shall be paid on the condition that it is expended in the carrying out of such works as are from time to time specified by the Treasurer by notice published in the Gazette. We have never had any intimation of the nature of the proposed works. Clause5 provides that certain grants will be made for assistance to metalliferous mining. That will have a harsh effect upon men in other branches of the mining industry who desire to participate in this relief. They will he compelled to leave their homes, which represent their life's savings, and their families, to go to the wilds of Australia for prospecting purposes. That is not what tbe unemployed expected. Men who are engaged in other industries, and are in comparatively comfortable circumstances have been assisted on their holdings by means of a bounty that is partly to be made up by a tax upon these very people. No one can deny that that is due to the political pressure which one section can bring to bear upon the Government. We should have definite information as to the schedule of works to be carried out by the States. Further, the Commonwealth should direct the States as to the manner in which the works should be proceeded with, and should instruct them that award rates of wages and conditions must be observed. On tbe hustings the Government exhorted tbe unemployed to vote for the United Australia party, and thus wages. I take it that ""steady wages"" means award rates. We know that these conditions have not been observed in some of the States. I have received from the Premier's Department of New South Wales a letter dated the 12th December, in reply to representations that I made at the suggestion of the Minister for Defence and other members of the Cabinet, regarding the clearing of the aerodrome at Cessnock. Portion of the letter readsI may say that this inatter was before tbe uneinployed relief committee some time ago, and it was provided that such provision could not be made for this work. It was pointed out, further, that the Cessnock Municipal Council could carry out any improvement at the aerodrome under the emergency relief scheme, if adopted. The emergency relief scheme provides work for one day a week, or for a specified number of hours a day in the case of single men, while others participate according to the food requirements of their families. In my opinion, a scheme along those lines is to be adopted for the works that are carried out in New South Wales with the money made available by the Commonwealth. Seeing that the Government believes, or claims to believe, iu union rates of wages and conditions, it should see that they are observed. Certain statements have been published in the press in regard to the schedule of works to be carried out.

I do not know i i they were ignored for party political reasons. can be very hopeful about that particular job. the assurance of l i e Under-Secretary for Employment, and I am sure that he is sincere in what he says; but at the same time, as he does not hold a position in the Cabinet, and is necessarily subject to Cabinet decisions, he may not be able to carry out his intention. It is a pity the honourable gentleman has not been elevated tp ful l Cabinet rank, in accordance with the promise given to tbe people during the election campaign that a Cabinet Minister would be appointed to this task. That the honourable gentleman who is carying out a most important job should be relegated to the dungeons of this House, where it is almost impossible to find him, is a state of affairs which should not bo tolerated. In an attempt to solve one of the most difficult problems confronting this country, the honourable member is facing a gigantic task and has my fullest sympathy. The people of the Maitland district have, in common with other people of the Commonwealth, suffered from the effects of the general depression, but in addition abnormal floods have increased their difficulties. The Government should finance the construction of a canal which would mitigate to some extent the effect of the disastrous floods that occur so frequently in that locality. Engineers say that a canal to take the tidal waters from Hexham or Morpeth through Maitland to Singleton would greatly relieve congestion among shipping in the port of Newcastle. This work would be revenue producing, because the canal would save a considerable amount of freight on primary products to the port of Newcastle, and in addition would give employment to a number of people in that locality who have been hard hit by the effects of two floods within the last eighteen months. During those floods large numbers of live stock wen; drowned, and damage was caused to the extent of many thousands of pounds. At any time another flood may take place, and it is of no use for us to be wise after the event and say "" Had we known of this trouble we would have endeavoured to rectify it "" . I hope that we will not have a recurrence of the floods in the Hunter Valley, but each successive flood seems to become more serious The river banks have now to be built up with sandbags. Apart from the construction of the canal and the undertaking of sewerage works, why should not some roadwork be undertaken in the mining centres? Maitland cannot be called a mining centre; it is the centre of an agricultural district. I have constantly asked that something should be done for the coal-fields districts, but with no success. If tbe road which has been partly made from West Wallsend to Kurri Kurri were completed, people in the Maitland district could not be isolated by floods. They would still have access to Sydney, Newcastle and other places. In addition to this the distance between the coal-fields and Newcastle would be shortenend considerably. A road from Cessnock to Lake Macquarie, giving the coal-fields' people access to Newcastle and all parts of the Lake Macquarie district, was surveyed and partly formed prior to the depression, but work \ipon it has since been abandoned.",30,Casey

88,Mr James,"I am pleased to haveClauses5 and 6 of the bill make provision for metalliferous mining. Many representations have been made in this House that something should be done to rehabilitate the coal industry, and I have often submitted proposals for the setting up of a plant for the extraction of oil from coal under the low temperature carbonization process. Sufficient data has been placed before the House to show that it is an economic commercial proposition. According to a book written by Ivor Thomas, plants in Germany for the treatment of coal by this process are (iXtracting 12 per cent, of the fuel oil requirements of the nation, or more than the .total Australian requirements of fuel for motor port purposes. the Admiralty purchases all its oil fuel requirements from Low Temperature Carbonization Limited. According to Mr Thomas, there is room for the exploitation of the hydrogenation process in addition to the process already mentioned. If something were done in that direction it would go a long way to relieving the tragic position which exists amongst those employed in the coal industry to-day. I ask the Under-Secretary for Employment to give serious consideration to this matter. A deputation is anxious to wait upon him in Sydney, and I ask him if he will receive it at a time convenient to himself. Representatives of municipalities on tbe coal-fields are anxious to interview him to see what works can be carried out in their districts, and I am sure that they could put a case before him just as capably as can the representatives of the State Government. These works could be approved, and a request made to the State authorities to include them in their programme. picion that the money is to be spent in certain districts in order to further the prospect of United Australia party candidates at the forthcoming State elections. it has been said during the debate that "" time is the essence of the contract"". It is clearly indicated here that the Under-Secretary for Employment ( Mr should be carried out in country districts, Stewart) has lost no time in getting down to practical work. However, I would be pleased if we oould be furnished with further particulars concerning the works upon which this money is to be spent. I notice that a sum of £200,000 has been allocated for Commonwealth works, and in regard to these, at any rate, the nature of the works, and the areas in which they are to be. carried out, could be divulged. In view of ' comments made during the debate, I think it would be of assistance to the Government and the Under-Secretary for Employment if the Public Works Committee were re-appointed to inquire into proposed works, and submit recommendations thereon. Much has been said regarding the delay transexperienced in obtaining schedules of In Great Britain proposed works from the State authorities, but those of us who have had experience in the smaller sphere of civic government know how difficult it is to reach finality in preparing schedules, estimates of costs and arranging the organization necessary. Therefore, in the larger national areas with city and country interests to be considered these difficulties would be enhanced. I observe that a sum of approximately £90,000 has been set aside for expenditure on the Yass-Canberra road. This is a work of first-class importance, and the decision of the Government in regard to it is interesting as indicating its preference for road transport over rail communication between these two-centres. It wi21 bo interesting to see in such areas as these how the policy will work out in the final analysis. I urge the Government to make it a condition that all materials used in the work must bo of Australian manufacture, so as to encourage further employment. There are a great many public works in New South Wales which might be undertaken, and, That would remove a susin fact, as much a3 £10,000,000 could easily be 3pent upon public works. For instance, in Sydney, concerning which, of course, I have greater knowledge, there are many reproductive water and sewerage schemes which in those congested areas are necessary for the health of the people. The great mass of unemployed persons reside in the cities, and while it is desirable that certain works it would be economical to provide the city unemployed with work in areas",31,Casey

Undertakings such as tbe construction of marine drives on the north and south sides of Sydney Harbour recommend themselves, because, with the co-operation of the municipal authorities, such undertakings might be made reproductive. Might I suggest tliat consideration be given to provision of nvenues of employment for those who for various reasons cannot be included in this works programme? During the last election campaign, the Government announced that it would work in f u l l co-operation with the States to relieve unemployment, and I congratulate it upon having taken such early steps to honour its promise. [12.54] -The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) scouted the suggestion that this money might be used to employ men at less than award rates of wages. In Victoria, many municipal workers have been dismissed, and other men working for sustenance have been taken on in their place, with the result that there has been a considerable shrinkage in the membership of the municipal workers' union. happen in New South Wales. whether it was or not, but I know what has happened in Victoria. I should like to receive an assurance from the Under Secretary for Employment ( Mr Stewart) that all works will be carried out at award wages, and under award conditions. If municipalities are permitted to depart from that principle, the object of this grant will not be achieved. The honourable member for Perth( MrN a i r n ) said that in Western Australia, men wore compelled to become members of the Australian Workers Union before they could receive government employment, and be seemed to think that there was something wrong with that. To me, the practice seems to be eminently sound. Those who do not I sol The housing belong to a registered organization do not have to be paid award rates of wages, so that the condition is really made for their own protection. I am glad a considerable part of this money is to be deveted to assisting the mining industry. I agree with the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Fisken) that the gold-mining industry should be encouraged. Many men who were assisted to engage in prospecting operations have now made good, and are off the dole. I cannot understand why the Government has not been able to f u r nish us with fuller particulars as to how this money is to be expended. When I was iu Melbourne recently I tried to obtain particulars regarding the expenditure of the grant of £176,000, but was unsuccessful, and in the end found that the desired details were published in the newspapers before being made available to honourable members. We have been given to understand that the Go vornment is contemplating a much larger undertaking than any provided for here, namely, the standardization of the railway gauge, and I am sure that the proposal will be supported by honourable members of all parties. This is a work of truly national importance, which will be of benefit, not only to those who receive employment, but also to every other secknow what method has been followed in the allocation of this money to the various States. The greater part of it has been allocated to New South Wales and Victoria, while the three other mainland States are to receive equal sums, and Tasmania is to receive £50.000. I wish that the total amount available were larger, and, in view of the promises made by the Government during the election campaign, we had reason to expect tiiat it would be. I cannot join with some other honourable members in congratulating the Government upon the speed with which it has honoured its promises. Indeed, it seem3 to me that it has proceeded at a snail's pace, but it is gratifying to learn that something is at last being done. Silting suspended from 1 to l.SO p.m.",32,Casey

It gives no indication, nor do I understand has any indication been forthcoming, as to the principle which is to be adopted in making grants in aid of State schemes. Take, for instance, the position where, with the object of relieving unemployment, assistance is to be granted to two municipalities in the same State in carrying out sewerage schemes. The sum necessary for the work might be the same in each case; but, unless there is some underlying principle governing these grants, one municipality might receive £10,000 or £15,000, while the other State activities in that direction. This receives only £5.000 or £6,000. In that, event, a great deal of discontent will arise. I therefore ask whether the grants in such cases will be made on the basis of ability or inability to pay. One municipality might be in such a healthy financonsultation with every Minister for cial position as to be able to proceed with the scheme with very little assistance; the other might be in such poor circumstances as to need a large measure of help. Are the grants to be made on the basis of ability or inability to pay, or on him to believe that that measure of tbe basis of what proportion of the grant will give direct, as opposed to indirect, employment? To illustrate what I have in mind, let us assume that a scheme involving a cost of £30,000 would permit of £20,000 being spent on direct employment. In such a case, would the Commonwealth find a percentage of that £20,000 ? Municipalities in my electorate are submitting to the State Government schemes which, no doubt, will come before the Commonwealth Government. They will be asking for assistance, and I therefore want to know on what basis that assistance will be forthcoming. I hope that a just and equitable system will be adopted. I come now to the proposed vote in respect that sums States to schemes, and to provide for loans for batteries and machinery to mining companies. If that is so, a great deal of this money will be more or less wasted. the general debate. The bill Much of it will go to men with very little knowledge of mining. We have not in Australia to-day any great body of unemployed miners. There is, I understand, a scarcity of expert miners, so that a great deal of this money may be mis-spent unless proper precautions are observed. I doubt whether the Government is entitled to enter upon a money-lending business so far as mining companies are concerned. There may be some advantage to be derived from such a policy, but it seems to me that the granting of money for miners' sustenance, or by way of loans to mining companies, is more of a State than a Commonwealth concern. will place an extra 5,500 men in work. basis of that estimate? Mi. STEWART -It was arrived at after 1 Mines in Australia. mation was supplied to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment to lead employment will be provided? In regard to prospecting for gold, I think the Government should continue the course it has already entered upon in the making of geological surveys in Central Australia. We should send out men to survey different localities. If as a result of their work it be possible to inform the State authorities of the existence of auriferous areas of which they were unaware, and, if in addition we can supply information as to the prospects, I think private enterprise will step in and develop such areas. I wish further to know whether there is to be an investigation by experts before advances are made to small bodies of men for the erection of mining batteries.

I desire in conclusion to congratulate the Government on having brought down this bill. Complaint has been made of delay on the part of the Government in providing for relief work. That complaint cannot be substantiated. The Government has been in office for only a very short period. took place exactly three months ago today. time the States have had to be consulted to provide schemes, the money has had to be found and various other matters have required attention, so that I think the Government is to be complimented on having made so early an attack on the problem of unemployment relief. to put to the Ministeri n charge of this b ill a question relating to the wages and labour conditions to be observed in connection with works carried out by means of these grants. Does the Government propose to follow the system that has been in force in some of the Statesthe system of giving a man one day's work a week? If so, these grants w ill not be of much service to the unemployed. In New South Wales men are given relief work on from one to four days a week, according to the size of their families. I believe that the Under Secretary for E m ployment ( Mr Stewart) recently had a .conference with the Trades and Labour -Council in New South Wales. Officials of the council were very well satisfied with that conference, but they have .asked cision has been arrived at in relation to wages. I am speaking on behalf of that .council when I say that we do not care in what part of the State any of these works are carried out; our chief concern is that as much work as possible shall be provided and that proper wages and labour ! am glad to conditions shall be observed. I congraassurance. The Undertulate the Government on having introfor Employment has reduced this bill and am hopeful that it w ill speedily take still further steps to relieve the unemployed. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) said yesterday that no trouble had arisen in connection with relief work in New South Wales. As a matter of fact there has been a good deal of trouble. Some municipalities have dismissed men who had been employed for fifteen or sixteen years, and have replaced them by men who are given one or two days' work a week at low rates of wages. That is not a f a ir thing. The New South Wales government charges the Water and Sewerage Board3 per cent, interest on moneys adI n the meanvanced for unemployment relief. The grants to be made by the Commonwealth w ill be free of interest so that the Commonwealth is entitled to demand that proper wages and working conditions shall be observed on all works carried out under this scheme. My long experience as a member of the Government Unemployed Committee of New South Wales convinces me that road-making gives the largest proportion of direct employment. The percentage cost of material used in road-making is less than that in connection with any other work. I congratulate the Government also on its proposal to make advances to prospectors. In New South Wales, a prospector receives £1 a week, and is entitled to any return that he gets from his labours. I am satisfied that, as the Under Secretary for Employment has said, this prospecting grant will provide employment for 5,000 men. Hundreds of men apply to be placed on the list of prospectors for gold in New South Wales, and I am sure that this vote w ill be much appreciated. I repeat that my sole concern, and that of our party, is not as to where any of these works is to be carried out, but that the unemployed shall be given something to do at f a i r rates me to ascertain what deof wages. proposal is afoot to supply the town of Albany, in Western Australia, with a sewerage system, and I have passed on to the Minister a communication which",34,Casey

This work would provide a considerable amount of labour,"" and I trust that it w ill be possible for assistteer for it . ance in regard to it to be given to the State under the provisions of this bill. 11.46J I emphasize the importance of carrying out the proposed works on the basis of regular weekly employment at award rates of pay, and not on the old sustenance or relief basis. We should take a lesson from the experience of unemployment relief work that we have had in the last three or four years. Probably £30,000,000 has been expended in sustenance payments and relief work of various descriptions, and no permanent good has come out of it . Certainly those men who have been given intermittent employment for a few days have been able to keep their families and themselves from starvation, but, from an economic point of view, the plan has proved a complete failure. I am glad that action is being taken to put work in operation before Christmas, and no doubt early in the new year a start could be made on the scheme for the standardization of the vailway gauge. There is room for a considerable amount of employment in that regard in South Australia. It is strange that some of the States are standing back, and sabotaging tlie efforts which the Commonwealth Government is willing to make in the direction of finding much useful employment. In New South Wales, the amount of unemployment is stated to be 26 per cent., and, although the position is not quite so serious in Victoria, it is bad enough. I urge the Minister not to be guided by those who still imagine that the best way to spend the money to be provided for employment is to continue the sustenance and dole system. Like the honourable member for Cook( Mr. Garden), I do not mind in what localities work is provided, so long us all are employed. Men need regular wages at the rates fixed by law for their particular class of work. The amount set aside for the encouragement of the mining industry is a wLe provision. The honourable member for In d i ( Mr Hutchinson) need not be afraid of unskilled labour being applied to mining operations. So long as one expert miner is placed in charge of a party of five or six men they can be safely sent out to do prospecting work, and, as a rule, men of a good type volunI hope that the Minister w ill stand to his own statement, and to that of the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) that the wages to be paid under this scheme w ill be the award rates which apply to the particular classes of work undertaken. question which 1. submitted to him, the Prime Minister informed me that the ordinary rates provided under the law would he observed, and that the men would be given regular employment as far as possible. He added that there need be no fear on that score, because Commonwealth officials would have some supervision in the matter. A wrong impression may have been created by the honourable member for Perth( MrN a i r n ) , who read a message from his electorate to the effect that one of his constituents had been refused a share of relief work, the wages for which would have been £4, unless he first joined the Australian Workers Union, and paid 25s. for a memibership ticket. Such a condition would not be imposed, even in good times, much less in <a time of depression. As I understand the position, Western Australia has a Labour Government, which believes in trade unionism, and the employment of men at the wages fixed by the State Arbitration. Court. It considers that the workmen who get the benefit of the efforts of the union to obtain reasonable conditions of employment should contribute to the funds of the union. It must see that the men whom it employs receive the wages fixed in accordance with the law. If it paid non-unionists less than award rates, it would violate the law, and, therefore, all men employed by the State government receive the award rates. The price of a membership ticket for a f u l l year is 25s., but that money may be paid in instalments spread over twelve months. A workman might be required to pay only 2s. 6d. down, and he would then be allowed to enjoy the privileges of union membership for four or five months without paying another penny. It would be a bad",35,Casey

104,Mr Holloway,"In reply to abusiness proposition for him to lose those advantages for the sake of a deposit of 2s. 6d. I am glad that an effort is being made to provide additional work before Christmas, and early in the new year. We shall, of course, support it. But I hope that the Commonwealth Government will seek to influence the Government of Victoria to agree to participate in a general effort to have a uniform railway gauge. the Premier of Victoria seems to be opposed to this work at the moment. For many years the people of Australia have been expecting this huge work to be put in hand. Students of political economy and defence measures are almost unanimous in the view that our railway gauges should be standardized. I always speak and vote against militarism, but I can appreciate that for defence purposes we must have a uniform railway gauge. If Australia were ever invadeda very unlikely happening-and we had necessity to concentrate our forces, we should find it almost impossible to do so under existing conditions. The breaks of gauge at numerous points in our railway systems, and our obsolete rollingvernment would not be justified in perstock, would make the rapid transportation of troops impossible. Our gauges must be made uniform some day, and as labour and material are both available at lower prices to-day than for very many years, this seems to be the opportune time to do the work. I hope the Government will resist the temptation to spread this money over the largest possible number of people by paying it out practically as a dole. We want something better than that. continuous policy is necessary. municipal councils appear to think that they can get work done more cheaply under what amount to practically dole conditions; but they forget that by adopting these methods they seriously undermine the capacity of citizens to pay rates and taxes. I have sufficient faith in the Under-Secretary for Employment ( Mr Stewart) to believe that at the various conferences he will doubtless attend before it is finally determined how L5l] this money shall be spent, he will, with his modern outlook, resist the attempts of those who wish to follow the old-fashioned and futile methods that have been pursued for the last four or five years. wish briefly to support the views of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden), and other I am sorry that honourable members who have requested that award rates and conditions shall apply to the expenditure of this money. The National Government, and the various State governments, should not even think of following the example of certain bad employers of labour, who seem to take pleasure in doing their utmost to break down the living standards of the people. I do not say that all employers of labour fall into this objectionable category, but some do. I should be sorry to think that any Minister of this Government would lend himself to the furtherance of that policy. Wages paid from money made available by this Parliament for public works should be in accordance with the legal determinations that govern the employment of our people. The Gopetuating either directly or indirectly, the conditions that prevail in connection with certain relief works in New South Wales which, in my opinion, are little short of scandalous. We have been told that some of this money may be expended in water conservation work. The Woronora dam, which is being constructed by the Water and Sewerage Board as a subsidiary to the Sydney water supply is a great undertaking to which reasonable conditions of work should apply, for every A resident of Sydney who uses more than Some a certain quantity of water annually will be required to pay a water rate towards the cost and maintenance of it ; and, of course, every citizen, irrespective of the quantity of water he may use, will contribute through the general rates, towards its cost and maintenance. I hope an assurance will be given to us that not one penny of this money will be spent on works performed under the relief conditions that at present operate in New South Wales. The National Parliament",36,Casey
105,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [2.5],"I should not lend itself to the tearing down of the living standards of the nation. It cannot be said that award rates and conditions are being observed when men are being given only one or two days' work a week at award rates and left unemployed for the remainder of the week. It would be humbug to call those award conditions, for such people must maintain themselves and their families for a week on the proceeds of a couple of days' work. I ask the Prime Minister, who is at present in the chamber, to do his utmost to resist the continuance of sweating conditions in these relief works, which may not unfairly be compared with the worse sweating conditions of the past. I am not very greatly concerned about the particular works upon which this monejy is to be spent, though I feel that members of this titled to such information, that they are providing the money that is to be expended. Of course we should all like to think that substantial undertakings would be put in hand in our own electorates; but the principal requirement is that extensive works shall be started under conditions of labour which the wage tribunals of this country have declared to be the lowest possible for the maintenance of the people under reasonable living conditions. If proper conditions are observed in connection with future works I shall be quite prepared to forget what has happened during the last year or so. If the National Parliament lends itself to the adoption of lower standards than those stipulated the various wage-framing of the country, its prestige will be diminished, and the reputation of any member of the Ministry associated with such undermining of wages and conditions will be totally lost. Anything which tends to perpetuate the conditions which have caused so much human misery and woe, and so many tears, in the last few years, is to be condemned in the most unmeasured terms. This Parliament cannot be surprised if , in the event of anything like that happening, the people lose all their respect for our great national institutions. I hope that the all-too-poor wages and conditions which our industrial arbitration authorities have prescribed for various callings will be observed so Mr Lazzarini. that married men will be able to maintain their wives and families in reasonably decent circumstances. sorry to hear the statement of the Under Secretary for Employment ( Mr Stewart) that no really definite programme of works had been submitted to the Government by the Tasmanian Ministry.

I believe that plans are also ready for works to be undertaken in Launceston for the prevention of floods. The unemployed position is worse in Tasmania at present than it has been for many years. The Melbourne Age of the 12th December published the following message from Hobart:Tlie Commonwealth Grants Commission, which is taking evidence on Tasmania's claim for financial assistance from the Federal Government, received a statement this morning from the Chief Secretary ( Mr T. Dalton), who outlined the State's efforts to provide unemployment relief . . . Despite the fact that the Government had placed some 2,000 men at work since July, on 10th November there were more persons in receipt of sustenance than at any other period, and the numbers would undoubtedly increase. Some concern was being felt because large numbers of applications for sustenance were being received from email farmers and orehardists. If the Commonwealth Government would undertake reproductive works immediately the situation would be considerably relieved. There is a fairly large unexplored area which has considerable mineral possibilities in the south-western portion of Tasmania. In it have been located practically all the minerals that have been discovered in Australia. A few years ago one man went there at his own expense, and, having put up a sluice box right on the water's edge, was able to recover about £1,400 worth of osmiridium. Gold has also been discovered and at the present time a number of fossickers are mining for tin. Assistance for prospecting purposes is needed. I say, with other honourable members, that the need is to place our people in occupations that will provide them with employment for more than a few months. Sir Herbert Gepp, in, I think, 1930, reported on the manufacture of paper from hardwood forests. In his report he said that if the requirements of Australia were supplied, between 5,000 and 6,000 persons would be absorbed. The small experimental plant which was shown at the Wembley Exhibition was subsequently procured by a company and brought to Tasmania, where it was proved that paper can be commercially manufactured. The existing forests are sufficiently extensive to last for all time. In Tasmania the timber grows a great deal faster than in any other part of the world. I am well acquainted with the difficulties of the people of Tasmania, and am prepared to give every assistance to the Government with the object of relieving the prevailing distress. I agree with other honourable members, however, that relief works do not meet the requirements. The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) adopts a hypocritical attitude when he says that men employed on those works are paid the basic wage. that when they are given, only one or two days' work a week? Employment should be provided for them on every day of the week. I am a primary producer, and speak with authority when I say that last year the bulk of the produce grown in Tasmania went to waste, not because the people did not want it, but because they could not afford to purchase it. Had Tasmanian potatoes been marketed in Sydney last year at as low as Is. a cwt. that would not have benefited thousands of people in that State, because they had no purchasing power. I offered to people in my district at a ridiculously low price a quantity of potatoes that I had in a shed, but they could not find even the small amount asked; consequently I made no charge sooner than allow the potatoes to rot. So long as such conditions exist, a young country like Australia will get nowhere. I heard a Minister say last night that New South Wales had applied for £10,000,000. If that State can bring forward a programme of reproductive works to cost £10,000,000, the money should be found. Such an expenditure would bring prosperity not only to men on the basic wage, but also to primary producers in the different States. I am sure that the States will furnish complete lists of works, and that they will be dealt with sympathetically by the Minister.

I wish to contribute to what has been opposite that they do. so well said by several honourable memcourse, a scintilla of accuracy in the bers, but particularly by the honourable statements of the honourable member for members for Cook( Mr Garden) and Barton( Mr Lane) and other honourable Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), as members-the States do make a pretence to tbe necessity for maintaining wage of paying award rates, at any rate the standards in Australia in any scheme States of New South Wales and Victoria which the Commonwealth undertakes on do. But they pay on an hourly basis, behalf of the unemployed. At the elecand refuse to employ people for sufficient tions that have just been fought, all parties went before the country with periods to enable them to earn award proposals for a large-scale provision of rates of wages. Before the advent of the work that would employ people and thus Argyle Government in Victoria we did, give them the means to purchase comfor several years, attempt, more or less modities.

They were thus permited to The general scheme of wide employment. It be provided by an expansion of credit or the issue of new money. It is univerby honourable members on this side that the States do not pay award wages, and There is, of",39,Casey
113,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [2.26]. It Has Been Said By Honourable Members,"employ men for as many hours a week as they liked, and for each hour pay l/44th or l/48th of the weekly wage. That is absolutely useless. It is destroymorally and physically, the working ing the working classes of Victoria and New South Wales. When work is carried out on that basis, nobody gets a decent wage, everybody gets a pittance, and the whole working class is gradually accustomed to working for that pittance. If people demonstrate, over several years, at the old decent rates. their capacity to keep alive on a fewshillings a week, a few shillings will become their .permanent wage. I do not believe that the Under-Secretary for Employment or this Government stands for that. I think that this Parliament, having power to grant to the States financial assistance on whatever terms it likes to prescribe, should insist, either by the provision of legislation or by executive act, that work which is to be done under this scheme shall be paid for at award rates and under award conditions. Instead of men being employed for six, twelve, or thirteen hours a week, they should be employed for a full week at full wages. Then, and only then, is it possible to make them decent, self respecting men and effective consumers of our goods. There is something in the words of John Stuart Mill, ""When you have desperate diseases, small cures, ineffective cures, are worse than no cures at a l l "" . The conditions of the working classes in Victoria and Australia generally are much worse now than at any time during this crisis. Instead of getting be provided, and hold the view that if better, they are getting worse. Australia is facing years ahead which will be worse than any it has experienced in the past. Australia must approach the position at which it must declare that no person must go without a decent living and that in order to ensure this the country's resources will have to be pooled, even if it means that a superfluity must be denied to some. I believe that that is the attitude of the people generally, apart from any consideration of party. I believe we realize that our standard is dropping to that of older countries. An eminent physician has written that, if the people of any city of Europe were to be given decent meals for a week, the conditions prevailing in those cities would not be endured. And the conditions of Australia to-day are allowed to continue only because, classes are being broken down. I hope the Under-Secretary for Employment ( Mr Stewart) will consider these things, and do his best to pioneer for the Commonwealth a scheme that will, as far as possible, give employment to the people were not for the desire of the Government in this bill to provide money for employment, I should use every effort to prevent it from becoming law. I give the Government credit for bringing it forward, however, because relief is urgently needed. But Parliament is losing its grasp of the publicfinanceswhen it allows a bill of this kind to be introduced. I urge the Government to endeavour to see that this money is distributed among as many people as possible. I am prepared as a rule to trust tbe State governments to see that justice is done in the expenditure of money granted by the Commonwealth, but in Western Australia a little time ago, sustenance workers were refused employment unless they joined a union. They formed a union among themselves only to find that it was not one of the organizations the Government would recognize. I differ from the honourable gentleman who has just spoken. I trust that as many people as possible will share in the money to it is not possible to employ the whole of the people on full time, it is far better to employ a greater number of them on part time. Men in employment indirectly create employment for others. I hope that this is the beginning of a new era, and that it will not be necessary for us to have another bill of this sort introduced into the House. Money is being provided more for the sake of providing employment than to undertake works of a reproductive character. No big schemes, such as the uniform railway gauge project, have been put forward. to that matter was arranged to take place in Canberra this week, but tbe representatives of the States could not attend.",40,Casey

That ground has already been largely covered, and it is only necessary for me to add that we propose to give preference to those schemes in regard to which authorities other than the Commonwealth are in a position to make contributions. We are also taking into consideration the geographical location of unemployment. One honourable member raised some doubt regarding the security for the advances to be made for the assistance of the mining industry. Such advances are to be made on a £1 for £1 basis with the State Governments, when the money is intended to be lent to individuals. State authorities, whioh are much closer to the details of these ventures than we are, will be careful to protect their own interests, and ours will be protected at the an undertaking.

Does ference to applications from financially embarrassed municipalities, or will consideration be given to the relation the proposed grant bears to the total sum to be spent on a particular work? Perhaps the Government could make a ruling that it will advance one-fifth of the money which is to be spent for the purpose of providing direct employment.

149,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [4.49],"I supthe Clerk Assistant, who are at all times ready to help us with good advice, and God knows we, and particularly Ministers, frequently need it. Hansard is perhaps the best friend of honourable members, and we are always indebted to the staff for its work. I also wish to express our tbanks to the messengers who so promptly answer the call bell and thus make the work of honourable members lighter. The Librarian and the various members of the Library staff have been wonderfully helpful to honourable members. I wish to assure them, if they are listening, that any feeling tha' may have been expressed in a debate a', an early hour this morning in regard to the Library was directed to tbe honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) and his associates on the Library committee. able member is the only member of the committee whom I can see. The members of the Library staff are unfailing in their courtesy and assistance to us. I have seen many adjournments of Parliament at the Christmas season and many reassemblings in the new year. Unfortunately, it is true that many faces that we see when we are dispersing we do not see when we reassemble. Some honourable members, on occasions when an election intervenes, fall victims to the just wrath of the democracy or to its unjust judgment-that is a matter for them to decide-and others pass to another world. In examining old photographs one notices the names of former honourable members who have disappeared, and the gaps become greater and greater as the years go by. This makes one feel that whatever opinions we may hold, and however strongly we may express them from time to time, it is a good thing when Christmas comes to absorb the Christmas feeling and determine to wipe the slate clean, forgetting the rancour and disputes of the past. In that spirit I wish all honourable members a very happy 'Christmas. Being neither the leader nor the deputy leader of a party, I feel that a few words should be said on this occasion on behalf of the rank and file. Unhappily for all concernedalthough I was the one most concernedI was not a member of the last Parliament, but I have been a much longer time a member of this Parliament than not a member of it, not counting the years of my minority. I have taken part in many valedictory gatherings of this kind, and they have all been characterized by an intense thankfulness that we were able to go home at Christmas time with a sense of duty well done. When an honourable gentleman has been out of Parliament for some time he naturally returns with a chastened spirit, but I should like you to understand, Mr Speaker, that the docile and obedient attitude which I have adopted towards you and towards the House generally since this Parliament assembled is not entirely characteristic of me, but arises out of the fact that I have been absent from these surroundings for a time. The preliminaries of this Parliament are now over, and I hope when we meet again to be able to offer some more worthy tests of your skill as a Speaker than I have felt justified in submitting so far. All of us are very sensitive in regard to our own rights. For a time. I thought that you had adopted the policy of promptly calling me to order for any interjections that were made in the course of my speeches. I found, however, that in that quite unjust view-as it seems to have beenI was not supported by any other honourable member on either my own side or the other side of the House. All would seem to have taken sides with you. So that, if we are to judge by the balance of opinion, it is probable that you were right in every case. At all events, there is no doubt in anybody's mind except my own, and I certainly give you the benefit of it. As to the Chairman of Committees, I think we have all been struck with the absolute impartiality with which he has given the call to honourable members on both sides of the House; that is, when all the Western Australians have spoken. After all, the far-flung claims of farflung parts of the Empire have to be considered. I do not want to usurp the functions of the honourable member for Keid( Mr Gander), who dealt adequately with the personal side of the matter at the",48,Adjournment Valedictory

152,Mr Beennan (Batman) [4.53],"beginning of this Parliament, but I have noticed in this Parliament a number of new Ministers. Looking at the Minister for Defence( Mr Parkhill), one would never realize how fierce he can appear on occasions, and one would certainly hope that he could never be so fierce as he sometimes looks. I notice that the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) is absent from his place. He is a successor of mine and, on that account, in my view, occupies, next to the Prime Minister, the highest position in the Ministry. He is what might be called a new man among us. I notice that he has now entered the chamber. I am pleased that a messenger was despatched to intimate to him that his presence was desired here. He should not be absent while matters that concern his department are being discussed. He has been urbanity itself, and a very worthy successor of his not immediate predecessor. When he approaches the table, especially when wearing a red tie, and begins to speak in that purring voice of his, with eyes half closed, I say to myself "" This is leagues. But as Christmas is approachthe polite approach of a Bengal tiger "". But the honourable gentleman has developed the qualities not so much of the Bengal tiger as of the urbane Attorney General. On behalf of myself and the rank and file I express pleasure at the fact that, so far, none of us has been named. I am sure that I have deserved it, even in this first session. I thank you, sir, for your I wish to express my very deep appreciamagnanimity, and congratulate myself tion of the very kind references that have and others upon the good fortune which been made to myself and my work by the has thus been enjoyed without having Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), the Leader been entirely deserved.

I am very grateful to the Hansard staff. They have always made good speeches even out of my worse ones, and out of others worse than mine. I must thank them and the officers of the House and everybody who takes part in running this august assembly. At any rate, in all sinceritybecause a little flippancy is usually allowed on occasions like thisI thank you, Mr Speaker, and the officers of the Library, and everybody associated with the House for their courtesy. I hope that we shall come back refreshed, ful l of knowledge, and ready to impart to the press and to the peonle the learning we have imbibed from the large number of books we have taken from the Library. [5.2] I cannot allow an occasion like this to pass without calling attention to the peace and decorum that mark the "" evacuation of the Balkans"" by our friends the leader of the State Labour party of New South Wales and his coling, and the spirit of goodwill is abroad, perhaps it is well that I , as one of the bitterest opponents of that party, should extend to yourself, Mr Speaker, and the officers and staff the Christmas felicitations, which, owing to his unavoidable absence, the honourable gentleman who leads the Lang party has not been able to utter. of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), and the honourable member for Batman( Mr member for Batman, I shall retire from the chair very happy indeed.",49,Adjournment Valedictory

154,Mr Speaker (Hon. G. J. Bell),"officers and staff of the House, and especially the Hansard staff, are very f u l l y deserved. I personally am very much indebted to the officers of the House for the assistance they have given to me since I was called upon to undertake the very important duties of Speaker. W it h out their assistance, I am afraid that I should not have earned the complimentary remarks of honourable members. On behalf of the staff and myself I extend to the Prime Minister, the leaders of all parties, and honourable members generally, our best wi-shes during the coming recess, a happy Christmas, and a prosperous New Year. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.5 p.m. until a date and hour to be fixed by Mr Speaker.

My colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs advises that the export assistance paid by the Fruit Industry Sugar Concessiou Committee is available on absolutely equal terms to frui t processers in all States. The absence of payments to Western Australian processers for the year in question merely signifies that the fruit processing industry in that State is relatively very small and apparently was unable to secure any export business during that year. the Interior, upon noticeIs it the intention of the Government to consider assistance to the gold-mining industry in New Guinea and the Mandated Territory; if not, will he give consideration to action on the same lines as that taken in Northern Australia? present to grant to Papua and New Guinea assistance of the nature which the Government has decided to afford the mining industry in the Commonwealth.
