Our universities firstly, to abolish the student learning are not only schools of knowledge and skills entitlement which places limits on the but places of enlightenment. They provide number of years a student can study full time students with the knowledge they need to while in a Commonwealth supported place. gain employment.

We who have the dedication and drive to can do this in a number of ways. One is by complete further study. As a society, it is enhancing teaching and research and finding important for us to ensure that these are the the locus between these two areas. We can people that we continue to support. The do it also by encouraging a greater sense of famous American educationalist John Dewey openness and tolerance of people's views in once said: 'Education is not preparation for the university sector and by ensuring that life; education is life itself.' For many people students are not put at a disadvantage the pursuit of education is indeed a lifelong academically when they express their own goal. There are people who are interested in views on an issue. But, more significantly, gaining knowledge for the sake of learning. we can do it by allowing universities greater Indeed, we all told by our teachers at school autonomy over their destiny, both in funding that we learn something every day, even if and in the allocation of their resources, by we are not consciously studying.

The report While Dewey was right in saying that recommends a move away from restricted education is life itself, we are wise to ensure supply, with available places capped under that subsidised university education does not the Higher Education Support Act 2003.

Compacts could help or teaching but will simply make life harder reconcile the two areas and provide greater for our universities. diversity to the sector. These plans would Another area I would like to touch on is then be linked to the university's Commonacademic freedom. As I said at the start, our wealth Grants Scheme funding agreement. universities are more than just conduits for However, the coalition does have concerns skills and knowledge. They are places where that compacts, if poorly implemented-and students can exchange ideas, intellectual as the record of the government is certainly not well as moral, without fear of reproach or great on that front-have the potential to discrimination. This bill introduces a impose new regulatory burdens on tertiary legislative requirement for universities to institutions. Worse, they may be used by an promote and protect free intellectual inquiry interventionist government to micromanage in learning, teaching and research. What it the teaching and research curricula of fails to do, however, is describe exactly what universities and to pervert the desired policies universities might be required to put outcome of a fully integrated research and in place to ensure academic freedom is protected. Just as with their demand driven here in this country can no longer have the proposal, the devil is in the detail and benefit of accessing those places. particularly in the implementation.

175,"(2) Schedule 2, Item 6, Page 15 (Lines 24 And Mr Albanese","I moveThursday, 23 June 2011 Dawson Electorate: Hydeaway Bay Hydeaway Bay in my electorate of Dawson. The threat to life and property from the Queensland floods and Cyclone Yasi has passed, and life goes on smoothly for most. But that is not the case for the residents of Hydeaway Bay. They were very lucky that no-one was killed or seriously injured when, after the deluge of rain we got in the north in the months following Cyclone Yasi, tonnes of mud and rock slid down the side of the mountain earlier this year, narrowly missing homes and forcing the evacuation of dozens of families from the area. I have since had several meetings with residents of Hydeaway Bay who have emotional tales of fear and uncertainty that continue today. They heard the terrible roar as mud and rocks as big as small cars crashed through trees, swept through their yards and passed their homes. It happened again and again during those few days. They know it can happen again even now, but they do not know when or where. Any noise in the night makes them ask, 'Is this the one?' Residents of Hydeaway Bay now know that landslides have happened there before. They have been told that a council engineer advised that the hill was unstable and should not be developed, but it was developed. People bought blocks of land unaware of the history of the site or the potential for landslides. These residents formed an action group in a bid to fix the problem. They have requested a geotechnical survey to determine the extent of the problem and they want stabilising work to be carried out. If the area cannot be made safe they want the local government to buy back properties, as has been the case in other areas. For my part, I sought to secure disaster relief payments for residents who had to evacuate their homes because of the landslide, which was essentially caused by heavy rain. Sadly my request was denied by the Attorney-General this month for reasons I could not really work out, but the biggest hurdle to my efforts and the efforts of the local action group is the local mayor, Mike Brunker, who has swept residents' concerns aside and actively derided attempts to secure disaster relief payments. In doing so, he has basically signalled that he thinks the residents of Hydeaway Bay were better off after this landslide than some of the people in the town of Bowen who had no electricity for two days after Cyclone Yasi hit and yet received disaster relief payments. I can assure Mr Brunker that the events at Hydeaway Bay were very different. They were life-threatening and will continue to be life-threatening until something is done. I have seen damaged properties, including one with probably more than $10,000 worth of damage. Immediately after the event, Mr Brunker was quoted in the Townsville Bulletin as saying: I'm worried about the people living there and they are worried as well. Two weeks later he changed his tune when talking to the ABC and said that the event was not significant enough to activate the funding because: … no-one's been in hardship, so no payments will be required.

Either way, Mr Brunker has proved that he is in no way capable of representing ordinary people. I have written to the Queensland recovery authority and Major General Mick Slater to request a site visit and request that the authority advise the state government or force the council to rectify the problem. Australia-New Zealand Relationship Minister of New Zealand, I wish to make some comments on Australia's close relationship with our neighbour New Zealand. My electorate has a special connection with New Zealand given that according to statistics provided by the City of Casey there are approximately 5,000 residents of the local population who were born in New Zealand and who are now living in my electorate of Holt. New Zealand residents in the electorate of Holt have enriched our local community and have definitely brought their rich culture to the fore. The New Zealand residents in my local community have also brought with them, somewhat disconcertingly, their passion for rugby to suburbs like Hampton Park, Doveton, Cranbourne and Narre Warren, as many residents are now diehard Melbourne Storm fans, which again concerns me, and are also looking forward to following the Rugby World Cup that starts on 9 September this year in New Zealand. I understand that even our local Mayor of the City of Casey, Councillor Shar Balmes, has New Zealand heritage. In recent times the thoughts of this community and the local community generally have been with New Zealand as our close neighbour across the Tasman has experienced a profound series of tragedies in recent months. The first was when an explosion ripped through the Pike River mine in November last year. Obviously, Australia was quick to respond and offer assistance by sending our specialists, experts and machinery to assist with the recovery effort. Unfortunately, as we know, 29 brave individuals died as a result of this tragedy, including two Australians, and our thoughts are with them and their friends and family. Following this tragedy the city of Christchurch, which had already experienced a 7.1magnitude earthquake in September 2010, suffered a more severe 6.3-magnitude earthquake closer to the surface on 22 February 2011. This earthquake caused widespread damage across Christchurch, particularly in the central city and eastern suburbs, with damage exacerbated by buildings and infrastructure already weakened by the 4 September earthquake and its aftershocks. Significant liquefaction affected the eastern suburbs of the city, producing around 200,000 tonnes of silt. In total, 181 people were killed in the earthquake, making the earthquake the second-deadliest natural disaster recorded in New Zealand. Following the earthquake 300 members of the Australian police, as the New Zealand Prime Minister and our Australian Prime Minister have said, arrived in Christchurch to a spontaneous standing ovationemphasising the ties between our two countries. The damage is of the order of NZ$15-16 billion, making it New Zealand's costliest natural disaster. Given the loss of life and the profound suffering experienced by those in Christchurch and New Zealand and particularly given the number of people in my electorate who have New Zealand heritage and background, it has been a very difficult time for them but I reassure them that our thoughts are with them at this very difficult time and I note there have been some aftershocks subsequently MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Constituency Statements

(Time expired) Hinkler Electorate: Bruce Highway group's fight to get more funding for the highway has been bolstered by the RACQ's recent Unroadworthy Roads survey, which reports its entire length as being amongst the top 10 worse state and national road networks in Queensland. Our highway group will be redoubling efforts to get serious funding for improvements such as road resurfacing and widening, as well as more overtaking lanes and additional maintenance. I already have a number of highway black spots in my electorate and I would like to see them fixed as a matter of priority. As a member of the group, I will be asking local residents to put forward their own nominations for repair and rehabilitation. Every member of the LNP's lobby group knows the importance of fixing the highway, and we are committed to seeing billions going into improvements and upgrades over the coming years. I ache when I see waste by some government departments while the vital arterial roads which service Queensland struggle for funding. SoI make no apology for keeping up judicious pressure. Having said that, I am not churlish so I recognise that work is now well advanced on the Isis River Bridge at a site that is not only dangerous in its own right but a major bottleneck at flood time Under Labor, our nation's finances have been in such an appalling state that the 2011-12 budget did not contain one additional dollar towards fixing the Bruce Highway. In fact, the only announcement of any significance for the next 12 months was the reinstatement of five previously deferred upgrades. That is nowhere near good enough. The RACQ's survey mirrors my own concerns about the government's failure to get serious about the highway and it also highlights state and federal Labor's neglect of regional and local roads which are vital as part of our investment profile. A prime example is Old Toogoom Road in my electorate, which has been the subject of two coalition election pledges, whilst Labor has studiously ignored it. In fact, it was listed in the top five worse individual roads in Queensland; whereas I have pledged $1 million towards fixing it at two elections, Labor has consistently failed to match that. It must be said that the Old Toogoom Road had to be 'named' and Labor 'shamed' to get any action on it. I hope that it, along with the Urraween extension and River Heads Road in the Hervey Bay area will be seriously considered by the federal government as being in areas where an expanding community needs additional support. Isaacs Electorate: Take a Break Occasional Childcare Program Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:39): The Victorian Liberal government is set to scrap an important childcare program called Take a Break from September this year. I want to clear up some misinformation put out by the Baillieu government. Take a Break program operates from our neighbourhood and community centres and provides respite for parents and carers of children up to the age of six, enabling them to participate in recreational and social activities or undertake volunteer or part-time work that would otherwise not be possible. It is disappointing that the new Liberal government has decided to cut the $1.9 million needed for the Take a Break program. The Baillieu government has also cut $480 million from the Victorian education department's budget. MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Constituency Statements
179,Mr Neville (Hinkler,The Nationals Deputy Whip) (09:36): The LNP Bruce Highway,151,Constituency Statements
180,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for ClimateThe decision to cease funding of this program will impact on hundreds of families and leave many childcare staff across neighbourhood houses in Victoria with uncertain futures. The Baillieu government had promised to continue funding the program until the end of this year, but has reneged on this agreement also. Wendy Lovell, the Minister for Children and Early Childhood Development said in the Victorian parliament on 14 June that occasional care providers are required to deliver at least three months of the program from 1 July 2011 and can use the remaining three months of funding for transitional arrangements. This means that the Take a Break program is likely to end prematurely in September 2011 as centres are forced to meet the cost of redundancy payments to staff. Previously this important program was funded by the state and federal governments. In July 2010, the federal government agreed to provide an additional $210.6 million over five years for the Victorian government to support preschools. In acknowledging the substantial increase in funding for early childhood education, the previous state Labor government agreed to fully fund the Take a Break program. The significant funding boost delivered by the federal government for early childhood education and childcare in Victoria is part of the Commonwealth's $20 million reform process that will see areas that were previously funded solely by state and territory governments receiving significant additional investment from the Commonwealth over the next four years. On Monday many concerned mums, dads, grandparents and carers joined together across Victoria to express their disappointment at the decision by the Baillieu government to axe this program and called for the Baillieu government to commit to funding this program. TomorrowI will meet with parents and carers at Chelsea Occasional Childcare Centre to discuss how beneficial the Take a Break program has been and how the decision by the Baillieu government to slash the program will impact on their families, staff and neighbourhood houses. I have written to state Liberal representatives Wendy Lovell, the minister, as well as to Lorraine Wreford, the Liberal member for Mordialloc, Donna Bauer, the Liberal member for Carrum and Inga Peulich, the Liberal member for South East Metropolitan Region in the state Legislative Council calling on them to demand that Mr Baillieu immediately restore the funding for this very important program. Hasluck Electorate: Schools highlight the misleading advertising being produced by the Labor Party in my electorate of Hasluck. This week, half-page advertisements in some local papers by Senator Pratt stated that the Gillard government is delivering the biggest investments ever into WA schools. The advertisements also claim that Labor is helping families balance the budget. These points are misleading and an attempt by the Prime Minister to stop the bleeding of her credibility in my electorate. Just last week, for example, coalition senators stopped Labor from axing the childcare rebate, hardly the position of a government that is helping the family budget to balance. In contrast, this is the first budget delivered by a federal government in eight years that is not providing tax cuts for everyday Australians. In fact, Labor is stripping away $2 billion in support for families and imposing $6 billion worth of new and higher taxes. As for Hasluck schools, Labor's waste gets worse. The computers in schools program has blown out by a further $200 million, taking the total cost up to $1.4 billion. Add to this $11.6 million extra in waste spending by the Gillard Labor government to clean up the mess left MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Constituency Statements
181,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (09:42,"I normally do not rise in a negative mood, but today Ibehind by the Building the Education Revolution. These vast sums of money are just numbers to Labor governments which rely so heavily on tax and spend instead of being fiscally responsible with my constituents' money. My office receives calls and emails every day from constituents concerned about Labor's failed border protection policies. It has lost control of Australia's borders and the cost of maintaining asylum seekers has bloated to $1.75 billion since last year's budget. The so-called Malaysian solution alone is approaching $300 million. That is $2 billion wasted by this reckless alliance of the Greens, Independents and Labor members. Just imagine for a minute what $2 billion would do for schools, local government and the broader families in Australia. But thanks to Labor this $2 billion will never be spent on Australian citizens. Finally, the biggest hypocrisy of the misleading advertisements is the failure to mention the impact of the carbon tax on local families and businesses. Details are scant from this Labor government and this is creating uncertainty across many industries. What we do know is that, under the Gillard-Brown carbon tax, at a carbon price of $26 a tonne, average power bills will rise by $300 a year, petrol prices will increase by 6.5c a litre and grocery prices will increase by five per cent. What the final carbon price will be, though, is hard to determine at this point. Some Green politicians have talked about making it $100 a tonne. This would drive prices sky-high when times are already hard on the families of Hasluck. I call on the Labor government to inject some honesty into its advertisements and I reject the misleading claims made by the Prime Minister and Senator Pratt in this advertisement. (Time expired) National Broadband Network Ms COLLINS (Franklin-Parliamentary Secretary for Community Services) (09:46): I want to talk about the electorate of Franklin today, particularly about the National Broadband Network. One of the suburbs in my electorate, Kingston Beach, is about to receive construction of stage 2 of the NBN rollout in Tasmania. For those on the other side, who do not appear to be aware of just how this NBN rollout is going across the country, in Tasmania we have already had our three stage 1 communities-that is, Midway Point, Scottsdale and Smithton-connected to the NBN. Stage2 construction at Kingston Beach in my electorate is commencing in coming weeks. When advertisements for development applications appeared in the local papers a couple of months ago, my electorate office was overwhelmed by people from Kingston Beach contacting my office to find more information about how they could connect to the National Broadband Network. Kingston Beach obviously is one of the first areas in Australia to be connected to the service and we know that it will deliver practical benefits for the households there. In Tasmania we are also looking forward to stage 3 of the rollout, which will happen immediately after stage 2 is complete. Stage3 will connect 90,000 homes and businesses in Tasmania. At the end of that stage more than 100,000 Tasmanians will be connected to the National Broadband Network. At a statewide level, we know what services this will provide to Tasmania as those 100,000 homes and businesses are connected. We have seen from some of the implementation trials the benefits to aged care, rural health and education services as the NBN better connects regional and rural Tasmania to mainland Australia and the rest of the world. MAIN COMMITTEE I have also been contacted by many local businesses that are currently outside the stage 1 and 2 rollout areas and they are very, very keen to be connected to the NBN. They want to know when they can be connected to the National Broadband Network. We know from the ABS statistics about internet activity that Australians are participating more strongly in the online digital economy than ever before. There is an increasing desire for more speed and more bandwidth but, as we all know, it is not just about speed in homes. It is about delivery of government services, delivery of community services and improved outcomes for people in their homes and businesses. Tasmanian homes and businesses are becoming increasingly reliant on internet services as they go about their daily business. People are doing their banking, doing university courses, even working from home using existing broadband technology, but they know that that needs to increase. One of the issues with wireless that I am aware of is that it does not work that well in Tasmania because of the topography. Wireless is seen by the opposition as a solution-they should get down to Tasmania and see how it works. (Time expired) Higgins Electorate: Education Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (09:49): Like my good friend the member for Hasluck, I rise to speak about the issue of education, first to congratulate the recipients of the Premier's VCE Awards in my electorate of Higgins: Jessica Ginberg of Korowa Anglican Girls School, Marisa Lucente from Lauriston Girls School, Diana Jackobson of Loreto Mandeville Hall, Mary An Nguyen of Loreto Mandeville Hall and Olena Stepko of the Malvern Russian Community School. From Melbourne High School, recipients were Taqi Ali, Axel Almet, Minto Feliz, Paul Khoo, Vinay Sastry, Rohan Singh, Shiamalan Thanaskanda, Aneesh Tiwary, Ashwin Sharma Umakantha Sarma, Ross Unger, Matthew Wilbraham and John Wong; from Sacre Coeur, Stephanie Lightfoot; from St Catherine's School, Amelia Hamer, Mimi Horman and Jessica Sutherland; from St Kevin's College, Keenan Chiu; and from the King David School, Bryan Ladowsky. It is wonderful that all of these students have achieved such a high standard and have been recognised for that wonderful achievement. For that we pay tribute, as well, to their fellow students, their parents, their peers and to the teachers at the school. It is right to be celebrating excellence and achievement. It is because of the importance of recognising the good work that is done within these schools, I have instituted the Higgins Medal to recognise leadership and service. But there is a threat to excellence at our schools and, in particular, the schools in Higgins. There is a threat by this government to the funding of those schools and their being able to continue delivering this excellence. It will be a threat because this government has not said that it will not consider another Latham-Gillard style hit list again on our schools. When I look to the indexation funding of our schools, it is not guaranteed beyond 2013. This will have a dramatic impact on 19 out of 42 schools in my electorate of Higgins. I want to briefly mention them: St Mary's school will have a total shortfall by 2017 of $824,473; St Joseph's Primary School, $776,313; the Kurrajong school, $217,946; the Holy Eucharist School, $503,166; Korowa Anglican Girls' School $909,156; Lauriston Girls' School, $1,045,693; Loreto Mandeville Hall $3,476,687; Our Lady of Lourdes School, $273,147; Our Lady of Victories Parish School, $204,860; Presentation College $22,582,329; St Anthony's Primary School, $539,106; St Catherine's School, $617,548 and the list goes on. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Carbon Pricing Ms KING (Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing) (09:52): We all know the important role the Australian government plays in addressing climate change and in reducing our nation's carbon footprint. Government members believe that climate change is real, and we are taking action because we want Australia's 1,000 largest polluting companies to pay for producing carbon. Those opposite want to let our nation's largest polluters off the hook. We know that a carbon price will provide an incentive for the big polluters to reduce their carbon footprint. Making polluters pay is the most effective way to cut pollution and drive investment in the clean energy future at the least cost to the economy. We will provide households with assistance where those opposite will be making households pay over $700 a year to subsidise the polluters. The government have committed that all revenue from a carbon price will go to providing households with fair and generous assistance to support jobs in the most affected industries and to invest in clean energy and climate change programs. It was back in September 2009 that the Leader of the Opposition visited Beaufort near my electorate and told the local Liberal Party faithful that 'climate change is absolute crap' and went onto announce that he was a climate change sceptic. Nothing has changed. While those opposite continue spruiking to their Liberal Party colleagues about how crap climate change is, we on this side have got on with the business of tackling it. We believe climate change is real. Those opposite deny it. As part of our plan to tackle climate change, we are also looking to renewable energy. Renewable energy generation is playing an important role in reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, and the Australian government has introduced a number of initiatives that will significantly increase investment in renewable energies. We have seen great support in the community for tackling climate change and for renewable energies through the 100 per cent renewable energy campaign. I want to recognise and commend the work of my local community organisation, BREAZE, who have been working very hard to spread this message, doorknocking some 600 households in my electorate to talk about renewable energy and to garner support for renewable energy being part of the government's carbon pricing. The government have acted on renewable energies. We have set a renewable energy target of 20 per cent for Australia's electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020. The RET includes incentives to help Australian households, businesses and communities to do their bit on climate change. We are also investing $5 billion in the Clean Energy Initiative, which provides a comprehensive range of measures to support development, demonstration and introduction of low-emission technologies that are not yet commercially competitive in Australia's electricity sector. Only last week we announced funding to build the largest power station in the world as part of the government's $1.5 billion Solar Flagships program. We are also investing $1.8 billion in the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships program. Including a price on carbon is fundamental to the long-term sustainability of our nation's environment and to our economy, and we are complementing our plan for a carbon price with our strong support for renewable energy. (Time expired) Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service Dr STONE (Murray) (09:55): There are massive increases proposed for Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service packing shed registration charges. This is an extraordinary MAIN COMMITTEE increase in cost to our packing shed operators. It is so substantial that a lot of our growers and packers are saying: 'The job is too hard. We will have to walk away.' Growers currently pay $330 per annum to register packing sheds and to comply with the import requirements of all the overseas countries that buy Australian fresh fruit and vegetables. Under the proposed new charges and following the removal of the 40 per cent government rebate on costs and charges, AQIS expects growers to pay over $12,300. That is a 3,700 per cent increase in the charge for packing sheds. The charge does not add value and there is nothing different; it is just a fee that is to be applied. With that charge you get the approval registration so you can export to markets like Thailand, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, the USA and New Zealand. Given the seasonal nature of Australian fruit and vegetable exports, the sheds in my area pack for only two or three months of the year. The 3,700 per cent increase in these registration charges is just extraordinary. Such a huge cost of business would not be tolerated by any other sector, I propose. Is this just a cash grab from the government, which we know is cash-strapped and which each day puts us further in debt? Is it to do with their deficit? There is absolutely no way you can account for the extraordinary increase in costs as a result of increasing inspecting, registering and actual costs for salaries, vehicle fuel or anything else. It is impossible to justify it in any way. This may be a reason for the fire blight protocols that are now proposed. We are told AQIS is just going to allow New Zealand to use its local domestic protocols for the importation of fresh New Zealand fruit. There will be no new specially export orientated protocols to keep fresh fruit with fire blight out of Australia. Perhaps because this government is cash-strapped and deeply in debt this is being allowed and will happen from 4 July. It is our farmers who are going to pay. Any government organisation which thinks it can get away with increasing a fee from $330 to $12,300 per annum really must imagine it is not in a parliamentary democracy. We have to challenge this; we have to say it cannot be tolerated if we do, in fact, want to continue to produce food for both our domestic markets and globally. Farmers and their fruit packers, quite simply, cannot take such a hit. It is just not possible. (Time expired) Richardson, Professor Jack, AO Special Minister of State) (09:58): I rise to speak on the life and death of Professor Jack Richardson, the first Commonwealth Ombudsman. Professor Jack Richardson was a distinguished law academic and the inaugural Commonwealth Ombudsman. He died on 13 June 2011, aged 90. Professor Richardson was a renowned expert in trade practices law, air and space law and Australian federalism, publishing in the vicinity of 60 books on these subjects. Educated at Geelong College and Melbourne University, Professor Richardson practised as a barrister for many years before becoming secretary of the joint parliamentary committee that reviewed the Australian Constitution in the late 1950s. He joined the Australian National University in 1961 as Dean of the Faculty of Law and in 1977 was appointed emeritus professor. In the same year he became Australia's first Commonwealth Ombudsman. Before the establishment of the ombudsman's office, it was recognised that existing avenues of redress for complaints with administrative actions and decisions were complex, expensive and difficult for many Australians. The establishment of the Office of the MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Constituency Statements
182,Mr Gray (Brand,"Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity andCommonwealth Ombudsman in 1977 was an important innovation in how government deals with concerns and grievances of individual citizens. It would provide the citizen with a legitimate complaint about official action with access to any impartial investigator to inquire into that matter. The establishment and development of this challenging role clearly required an individual of exceptional character to perform it. On 17 March 1977, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser announced the appointment, saying Professor Richardson was 'a distinguished academic of high Australian and international standing who will bring to this office the qualities and experience which are necessary to perform this challenging role.' In July 1977 Professor Richardson established the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office in Canberra, with five staff members overseeing the first critical years and guidance of the office through the substantial changes and growth in jurisdiction and case load. He developed the office's reputation for intellectual rigour and a robust approach to public administration. He fostered effective relationships with the department heads, though many took exception to his 1982 milk carton advertising campaign in Canberra with the slogan 'Bamboozled by the bureaucracy? Call the Ombudsman.' With the cooperation of agencies, the Ombudsman began conducting more informal complaint inquiries to achieve faster resolution of less complex complaints. During his tenure he established offices across the country in order to improve access to this important service. He retired as Commonwealth Ombudsman on 23 September 1985. Professor Richardson felt his greatest contribution to the role was to introduce a comprehensive oral complaint mechanism which led to significant increases in complaints. Towards the end of his time as Ombudsman, the total number of approaches the office had received exceeded 20,000. Professor Richardson was recognised for his contribution to the field. In 1984 he was awarded the Officer of the Order of Australia and in 2002 the Ombudsman's office established the Jack Richardson Prize in Administrative Law at the ANU in recognition of the contributions that he had made. This prize is awarded for the best essay by an undergraduate student in administrative law. The Commonwealth Ombudsman is now a key national integrity agency with over 140 staff. While its function and role have expanded, its core activities and value to the community have changed little, thanks to the great contribution made by Professor Richardson in its formative years. We acknowledge Jack Richardson and the contribution that he has made to the integrity of Australian government and public administration. the time for constituency statements has concluded. Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. This bill seeks to amend eight acts across five portfolios as part of an ongoing commitment to update and clarify the Commonwealth's financial MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Constituency Statements
183,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper,In accordance with standing order 193,157,Bills
184,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (10:02,"I rise to speak on the Financial Framework Legislationframework and to amend and improve the governance and financial arrangements of existing government bodies. The timing of this contribution is highly ironic, given that there has been signed today, we understand, what is called a 'definitive agreement' between the NBN Co. and Telstra for Telstra's participation in the rollout of the National Broadband Network. Here we are debating sensible changes to the government's financial framework, yet on the same day we have an announcement which is the result of what could be considered none other than blackmail by this government of one of our major commercial operations, Telstra. Telstra have been forced into this agreement to hand over billions of dollars of their infrastructure, much of which will ultimately be duplicated and forced to be made redundant. Therefore, this action today is party to the further sovereign risk that this government has turned into an art form over the last four years. It is another example of where the great free enterprise culture and reputation of Australia is taking a huge hit. This government has presided over the greatest growth of government in our lives since, or even including, the Whitlam government. We have seen Australia as the only country in the world which reregulated its labour market in the middle of the global financial crisis. We are the only country which has sought to introduce what must be considered the most bureaucratic, the most socialist, interventionist way of putting a price on carbon that could be considered-an approach which is going to massively increase taxation and massively increase the involvement of bureaucracy in the running of a thousand companies around Australia, in addition to the tax that is being added. We have got a government that has in so many respects sought to make decisions on behalf of the community. And now we are the only country in the world that I know of that is renationalising its telecommunications system-this is on a day when we are discussing improving the financial arrangements for the Australian government. Specifically, this bill seeks to improve the readability of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 by transferring the detail relating to the corporate plans of government business enterprises into the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Regulations 1997. It also seeks to improve the readability of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 by clarifying its interaction with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Amendments are also proposed to six other acts in line with further improving the Commonwealth's financial framework and are said to reflect best practice. These include making consequential amendments to the Legislative Instruments Act as a result of the FMA Act changes outlined earlier. It involves updating the Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008. It involves amending the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. It involves updating a reference in the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. And it involves repealing a redundant paragraph to the Science and Industry Research Act 1949. This bill is the eighth financial framework legislation amendment bill since 2004. It is part of an ongoing commitment to address financial framework issues as they arise as related to financial management provisions, governance structures and legislative anomalies. Given what has happened today in terms of the blackmail by this government of Telstra in forcing them into an agreement which is being signed today-at great cost to the taxpayer, I might add-it shows that there is a long way to go yet with governance structures and financial management provisions within this government's framework. The bill reflects a commitment to ongoing maintenance and reform of the Commonwealth's financial framework as it applies MAIN COMMITTEE across government and related entities such as government business enterprises. I understand the government intends to move an amendment to address a drafting error in schedule 2 of the bill. The explanatory memorandum of this bill states that these amendments will have no financial impact, which we accept. It goes on to say the changes may lead to productivity gains, which the coalition would of course welcome. But, again, it stands in stark contrast to the creation of a massive monopoly in the telecommunications area which will militate against productivity improvements in this economy in a most significant way. Schedule1 of this bill deals with the content requirements of a GBE's corporate plan which will see these specified in regulations. While the bill does not touch on issues around corporate plans and riding instructions to the CEOs of GBEs, it is housekeeping in nature. The government says this bill will make a contribution to improving governance arrangements for our GBEs. It is a very small incremental step. I would have thought the bill might have provided some opportunity to make some serious efforts to address widespread concern about the corporate governance and financial arrangements surrounding the operation of NBN Co. While there are some specific proposals which will go to improving the efficiency and the operation and governance of entities such as Wheat Exports Australia, albeit in a small way, NBN Co. is the one GBE where proper government oversight is sadly lacking, in the coalition's view. The lack of transparency to date has been an absolute disgrace. The inability for the parliament, much less the community, to be given advice as to what is happening, how it is happening, what decisions are being taken, the normal governance requirements and the normal provisions of any corporate structure that are required by law in this country have all been overridden by legislation designed to maintain a secretive shroud around the operations of NBN Co., a GBE which this bill suggests the government is improving the financial arrangements of. It is not good enough. The NBN Co. annual report states that the company regularly reports to its shareholder ministers. What that means we have no idea. What are they reporting? What is being said? Why can the parliament not see some of the normal reporting requirements provided for and required of other government instrumentalities, and certainly of every corporate structure in the country? I would like to think the minister for finance as a joint shareholder minister has a very close watching brief over its activities. However, I am not confident that this is the case. This entity will churn through taxpayers' dollars at an alarming rate. It is already doing so. Today we learned that the deal between NBN Co. and Telstra has been formalised. The blackmail has now been signed off. It has now been legitimised; it has now been swept under the carpet in the murky way in which the government has gone about forcing the hand of one of our largest corporate entities into a deal which is grubby in the extreme. This deal will cost taxpayers $11 billion for the government to embark upon what was undoubtedly a political exercise from the outset. Having failed to find a way of introducing the $4.7 billion proposal that they took to the 2007 election and the embarrassment of their failure after 18 months or two years to find a workable way of introducing a broadband network with their original proposal, the government hatched this proposal during an aircraft flight from Melbourne to Brisbane-we are told. It was hatched in a conversation between the Prime Minister and the MAIN COMMITTEE Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. It did not even go to the cabinet for a decision. This is a $50 billion infrastructure decision. This is a GBE. This is a government organisation which goes contrary to all that we are seeing in this bill today. This is tokenism, compared with what has happened. To have a situation where this structure can be created in this anti-competitive way will send another sovereign risk message, along with the mining tax, the carbon tax, the flood tax, all of the changes to industrial relations, many of which are now creating enormous uncertainty out there, and the many other sovereign risks that have been imposed-the fact that the ink was not even dry on the PBS deal, done with all the big pharmaceuticals, and the government was breaking that deal. These are sovereign risk issues. We are now getting a reputation that we have never had. We have never been a risky place for investment. We are now seen in New York, London, Hong Kong and other financial markets as a country that involves enormous risk. This government should be putting in place regulations and laws that create certainty about investment not create great uncertainty among all those investors. We are a country that has always relied on foreign investment and always will rely on foreign investment, yet that is being compromised in the extreme. So we see an organisation where already $7 billion of contracts have been signed. Who knows if these contracts will produce value for money? There has been no cost-benefit analysis. There has been no public scrutiny of the use of this money and the prospect of this money generating value for money. What real incentive is there for this company to achieve value for money? My contacts in the telecommunications sector tell me that this NBN Co. is spending money like there is no tomorrow and that there is no discipline-someone else is signing the cheque. Much of what they are buying is at full tote odds plus 20 per cent because they are a government enterprise with a blank cheque that they can have signed. Someone else is responsible-we are. As taxpayers, we are all paying for this and we are doing so without any knowledge of what is really going on. This proposal is a political whim of this government. It was never given any decent scrutiny-no scrutiny, not even by cabinet. It is a total disgrace. It will, in the future, be seen as one of the biggest mistakes of this government and one of the most glaring examples of its incompetence. It will be a symbol of this government's incompetence and inability to govern in the interests of this country. It will be hung around the neck of this government in future as a great symbol of its incompetence and its capacity to discourage others around the world from investing in this country. The government should hang its head in shame. At the same time as this government is bringing in bills that, in a small incremental way, are looking at various governance issues, it is allowing this absolute debacle to be visited upon the Australian community. Under this government, there is no pressure on the NBN Co. to run a tight ship. The government has itself set a dreadful example to any GBE when it comes to achieving value for money for taxpayers. What leadership is being shown? None. How well is this government demonstrating to GBEs that it is serious about the proper operation and use of taxpayers' money? Not at all. This is a quite damaging, debilitating and irresponsible way in which to govern this country. The community will pay in a very big way for such lack of leadership. MAIN COMMITTEE It is quite extraordinary that not one but two finance ministers could endorse taxpayer funded spending of this scale without a cost-benefit analysis. I suspect Lindsay Tanner left this place because he could not live with these sorts of decisions. That is my feeling. Here is a man who spent so many years looking to get into government but who, after three years as Minister for Finance and Deregulation, did not, you could tell, have his heart in it in many cases. He was being overridden. The gang of four, we now hear, would meet and then one would leave-Lindsay Tanner-and the gang of three would modify the decisions. In this case, with the NBN Co., there was not even a gang of four; it was a gain of one plus the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy-and it never went to cabinet. What a disgrace. This is a day on which we should all hang our heads in shame, a day when we are supposedly debating, discussing and supporting the introduction of some improvements to governance while, on the same day, a decision is being endorsed where there was blackmail by this government to ensure that it could go ahead with what is the biggest disgrace of government involvement in business enterprise in this nation's history. The fact that this is being permitted to happen under the existing financial framework, which we are discussing today, does indeed sound alarm bells. With a government such as this one, I suspect it would not matter how tight the framework was; it would still do as it pleases. That is what we have seen. This is a company that, as it stands, generates no profits, delivers few services and has next to no customers. We all remember the fanfare surrounding the switch-on of services at one of the test sites in Armidale. Millions were spent and how many customers were there? There were seven. There are only 22 million to go. Despite this, NBN Co. had 656 employees as of 31 January and will have more than 1,000 by the end of this financial year-only a couple of weeks away. In its 2010 financial report, NBN Co. revealed that 75 per cent of staff-at that time, 34-were getting paid between $300,000 and $400,000. I mentioned the way in which money was being thrown around by this new government enterprise. That in itself is evidence enough, quite apart from what we are hearing through the trade about the billions of dollars being spent in other ways with great question marks over them. By the next election NBN Co. will have generated revenues of $205 million, if it is lucky, and will have paid out much more in staff wages and entitlements. They have been in the field now for two years and what are we seeing for it? Who can forget the appointment of the infamous Mike Kaiser on a package of $450,000 as head of government relations and external affairs. I do not know anyone around this place who, in the year and a half this man has been employed, has ever seen him, yet he is responsible for government relations. He should be the man who is informing the opposition and the crossbenchers and the public, but he has done nothing but get $450,000 as head of government relations and external affairs. This is another symbol of the incompetence, waste and in-house boys' club-jobs for the boys. A failed, discredited member of the Queensland government and the Queensland Labor Party ends up with $450,000 for a job of government relations but no-one has seen him in 18 months. What is going on in this organisation? It is a GBE, where we are supposed to have some decent governance requirements. It would be interesting to know what Mr Kaiser has been doing to earn that type of money. From next month the NBN Co. will be subject to FOI laws but exempted from any request that encapsulates any of its commercial activities. How convenient that is! All of the normal MAIN COMMITTEE processes that corporations are required to participate in, their continuous disclosure requirements-not for this organisation, not on your nelly! This is an organisation which the government has shrouded in secrecy, in rules and regulations which apply to no-one else. It is being protected from any scrutiny, and why? Because the government is so embarrassed about the way in which they have gone about this, about the waste of taxpayers' money, that they want to ensure there is no capacity for any proper scrutiny of this organisation now or into the future. We are being saddled with the biggest white elephant conceivable, by an investment which is sending such poor signals to investors around the world. Given that its entire business model is based on the NBN being a commercial venture, this exemption from any scrutiny, from any capacity to see some of the consequences of their commercial activities, or how their investment measures up against their returns, will arguably cover every request made of NBN Co. While the coalition is not opposing this bill, the bill must surely act as a powerful wake-up call about the inadequacy of the government's financial framework. If the National Broadband Network, the largest government backed business enterprise in Australia's history, can present such an enormous risk to the taxpayer and reintroduce all of the worse features of a monopoly to the most dynamic sector in this economy-this is the nonsense that is going on in the most dynamic sector of this and every economy around the world, the area that is changing almost monthly in terms of new technology. The power of competition is exciting and is leading to extraordinary developments, changes and improvements to people's lives. While all that is going on, we are heading back to the PMG days, where we had the culture of a bureaucracy. You can smell it already in the arrogant way in which Senate estimates are being treated by this organisation. Compare the first hearings of NBN Co. before the Senate estimates with the last lot of hearings. They have gone from people who were looking to be receptive to the arrogance of a government monopoly, an unaccountable monopoly which is not going to face any scrutiny of any consequence. We are seeing it now with the failure of their $450,000 government affairs person to ever make himself available to ensure that those who are not in the government, the opposition, the crossbenchers and the public generally are informed. The financial framework is not working. We have got no concern about the changes, the tinkering that is in this bill. We were prominently reminded today that the blackmail is now being brought to fruition with the deal struck with Telstra. If that deal can occur on the same day, the financial framework of this government is not working. No wonder people are starting to be confused. No wonder savings have gone from minus one to 11½ per cent. People are anxious. They are anxious and they are not prepared to spend money because they do not feel that there is any direction in this government. There is no direction. They have a Prime Minister who has no authority, no direction and a government which is floundering. All they are doing is seeking to intervene and to cover up the decisions that have been taken. No wonder people are anxious. No wonder savings are going through the roof. There is a problem in the retail sector because people are not spending. Tens of billions of dollars more have been saved in this last 12 months than would normally be saved. Retail is on its knees because of this government's incompetence, the failure of any direction, the failure to have people feel that this government knows what it is doing. The only thing it knows how to do is to inveigle itself into the lives and the decision-making of Australians. It is building MAIN COMMITTEE infrastructure and organisations like the NBN Co., which are not accountable and which run against the great free enterprise culture that both sides of politics in the past have contributed to. It is a highly dysfunctional, highly dangerous cowboy-style government that we are now witnessing. Whilst we are happy to support this bill, I do want to place very firmly on the record that the financial framework that this government is working to has failed. It can get away with gross mismanagement and gross incompetence. It can get away with snubbing its nose to proper practice, to proper governance, to proper scrutiny and to responsible government but the chickens are now coming home to roost. Business is concerned, anxious and uncertain. Households are concerned, anxious and uncertain. Australia is running into the sand. This government today has proved itself to be totally incompetent and they must go. Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (10:28): I was trying to think, as I was listening to the confected outrage of the member for Goldstein, where I last heard so much passion for such low stakes. I realised it was in the current debate over the Liberal Party presidency. I know the member for Goldstein is an Alan Stockdale man and I am sure he would also have views on some of this overblown, overheated debate that has been going on in the public arena. Peter Reith is the policy candidate, isn't he? debating the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011 and he ought to be relevant to the bill. Dr LEIGH: As you rightly point out, Mr Deputy Speaker, we are focusing today on a piece of legislation which is the eighth financial framework legislation amendment bill since 2004. It is part of an ongoing program whereby the government will address financial framework issues as they arise, taking a whole-of-government approach. This bill, if passed, would amend a number of different acts. It would amend the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, updating arrangements regarding the corporate plan for a government business enterprise to enable the content requirements of corporate GBE plans to be specified in regulations, rather than in the act. It would amend the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to clarify the legal status of determinations, instructions and guidelines issued under the act. It would also clarify specific provisions and make consequential amendments in these two acts and a further six acts, updating the Commonwealth's financial framework and improving the governance arrangements for several Commonwealth agencies and bodies. I was struck by the member for Goldstein's aspersions cast on the former member for Melbourne, Mr Lindsay Tanner. They particularly surprised me given that the member for Goldstein has been admirably open about the relationship between his own personal life and his job, given some of the real challenges we face here. SoI found it somewhat disappointing that he would reflect on Lindsay Tanner's stated decision to resign to spend more time with his wife and children and cast aspersions on Mr Tanner, suggesting that his decision to leave the parliament was in some way policy related. I would like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to Lindsay Tanner for his extraordinary work as the minister for finance in the last term of government and commend him on his recent book Sideshow, which has opened up an important debate about how we deepen policy discussion in this country. MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Bills
185,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper,"I remind the member that we areWhen we think about the financial framework of the Commonwealth it naturally draws us into appropriate levels of Commonwealth borrowing. It is useful to use this opportunity to dispel a few myths which have been out in the community-sometimes written on bunting surrounding polling booths-about the level of government debt. According to the 2011-12 Budget Paper No. 1, net debt is forecast to peak in 2011-12 at 7.2 per cent of GDP. It will fall to 5.8 per cent of GDP in 2014-15. It is extremely low by international standards. Average net debt levels in the major economies measured for all levels of government are projected to be around 80 per cent of GDP in 2011. So Australia's net debt will peak at less than one-tenth of that of major advanced economies. What have we bought for this debt? We have two things. Firstly, we put in place substantial fiscal stimulus during the global financial crisis, stimulus which was timely, targeted and temporary and which saved around 200,000 jobs. But, of course, those opposite would have had us do something much worse. Most of the rise in government debt is a result of the fact that revenue is written down in a downturn. Corporate profits in particular fall substantially. By taking a no-debt position those opposite would have had the federal government cut spending in the global financial crisis. There is a precedent for this. During the time of the Great Depression, President Herbert Hoover cut spending as the slump began. It is generally regarded as one of the worse macroeconomic decisions in history-and that is the approach that those opposite would have had the Australian government take. A no-debt approach suggests not only a no-stimulus approach; it actually suggests that when downturns come governments should cut spending. There could be no clearer definition of fiscal irresponsibility. The billions that have been wiped off budget revenues and the hit on the budget as a result of recent natural disasters have meant that it has been necessary to increase the government borrowing limit a little earlier than anticipated. That increase to $250 billion has been supported by one of the many predecessors of the member for Goldstein as shadow finance minister. Senator Barnaby Joyce has said that the National Party will responsibly support this amendment, but the member for Goldstein rails against it, instead shouting about 'sovereign risk', an argument that is the last refuge of a shadow finance minister who has run out of every other idea. The Commonwealth government borrowing limit is lower than would have been the case under the projections in the period of the global financial crisis. In the 2009-10 budget, gross debt was expected to reach more than $300 billion. The $250 billion limit is, of course, noticeably lower than that. It is useful to put Australia's debt levels into perspective. One way of thinking about this is to think about an individual earning $100,000 per year who owes $7,200. That is substantially below what the typical Australian household owes, for example, on their home, and it looks more like the kind of loan one might take out to purchase a modest hatchback car. In fact, many Australians carry credit card debt of more than $7,200. They probably should not, but it is certainly an indication that the Commonwealth debt levels are extremely modest compared to household debt levels. They are also extremely modest compared to debt levels in other countries. For example, US net debt will hit 85.7 per cent of GDP in 2016, UK net debt will peak at 79.5 per cent of GDP in 2013 and Japanese net debt will hit 163.9 per cent of GDP in 2016. The Australian government's financial positions have been backed by the RBA, whose statement of monetary policy has said that 'with the budget projected to return to surplus over MAIN COMMITTEE the next few years, the impact of fiscal policy will be contractionary'. Compared with Australian households and compared with other developed economies, Australia's net debt levels are low and manageable. Global rating agencies and the IMF take exactly the same position. Standard and Poor's said recently that Australia has 'exceptionally strong public sector finances' underpinned by 'low public debt and strong fiscal discipline'. In response to the budget, S&P noted the 'sound profile of Australia's public finances, which remain among the strongest of its peer group'. Net debt will return to surplus in the next budget and to zero in 2019-20. It is important to recognise that the government borrowing limit not only takes into account net debt but also takes into account investments the government makes for policy purposes on which we need to borrow to fund, such as, for example, the National Broadband Network. The member for Goldstein would have Australians remain in the slow lane of the information superhighway. We on this side of the House see superfast broadband as being a key infrastructure investment in the future. It is a network which will transform the way in which we deliver education, health and the jobs of the future. Dr LEIGH: Those opposite are happy to interject, to rail against the investments of the future, but one wonders what they will say in their dotage when their grandchildren ask them: 'Why is it that Australia was left behind? Why did Australia not invest when other countries were investing?' That is the position they take on many other debates as well: 'Australia should not try to clean up its economy; Australia should not make the investments in the infrastructure of the future; Australia should not make investments in the education of the future.' The increase in the government debt level is required to make productive investments like the National Broadband Network. It is also required for other instances in which the Commonwealth borrows money in order to make important policy investments-for example, HELP, where government makes loans to young Australians to go to university; which students will of course pay back. The HELP policy is supported by both sides of this House. One would naturally expect that as more students go to university there are more HELP debts and it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to factor this in when thinking about our borrowing limit. We have invested in the residential mortgage backed securities market. We have a small stake in the IMF, and that too necessitates an increase in the borrowing limit. The utter lack of understanding by those opposite of the importance of government borrowing has a long history. It is not just something that those opposite are misunderstanding now; it is something that they misunderstood while in government. In 2002 the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, made an ill-fated attempt to shut down the government bond markets, suggesting that it would be appropriate to retire all government bonds. On The 7.30 Report on 30 October, 2002, Ken Farrow, from the Australian Financial Markets Association, pointed out: What's at stake is the fundamentals of the financial market of this country. We have a zero, risk-free, curve that the Government bond market creates. Off the back of that curve, most other financial products are priced. Our futures market is priced off that bond curve, and our derivatives market. Mr Farrow pointed out in the same interview: MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Bills
186,Opposition Members Interjecting,"… if you remove the government bond market, we'll see an increase in interest rates. Peter Costello eventually backed off that attempt to shut down the government bond market, but those opposite have clearly learned nothing from that episode. Clearly, they misunderstand the many roles that the government borrowing limit plays. There has been a quite sensible proposal made that, instead of the government borrowing limit being expressed in dollar terms, it should instead be expressed as a share of GDP. That proposal is presently being considered by the government. Naturally, as the size of GDP and the size of government proportionately increases, one might expect that the government borrowing limit would need to increase. That is a proposal that is on the table at the moment. I commend the bill to the House. Special Minister of State) (10:42): I thank all members who contributed to the debate on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011.

The amendment would ensure that chief executive's instructions will continue to be considered as not being legislative instruments. Schedules 2 and 3 of the bill currently aim to improve the interaction of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 regarding three types of instruments: special account determinations, guidelines such as those dealing with procurement, and chief executive's instruments. Special accounts and guidelines have always been treated as legislative instruments and have been registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. That will continue to be the case under the bill. By contrast, chief executive's instructions are an integral management tool that, since their inception, have not been treated as legislative instruments and have not been registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments by the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing within the Attorney-General's Department.

Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011. I say from the outset that the coalition regards this as a non-controversial piece of legislation and we will be supporting the bill in its passage through the parliament. I also acknowledge my good friend the Leader of the Nationals, who is the shadow minister for infrastructure and transport and indeed a former minister in this place. He is unable to join the debate today, but he would like me to highlight that the coalition has a strong record of public policy with regard to these matters. It is certainly an area where I believe the wider community expects us as members to ensure that there are appropriate environmental safeguards for this type of activity. Obviously, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Livermore, in your electorate of Capricornia you are blessed with some extraordinary marine biodiversity and the community values it very highly. To take appropriate measures in providing sensible safeguards and sensible reforms to accommodate activities in the marine environment is something that the coalition does support. Australia has been a member of the International Maritime Organisation since its establishment in 1948 and we have played an active role in the development of conventions and treaties over many years. As I said, the coalition and the current government-which I commend for it-have a long history of supporting sensible reforms. This bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to implement amendments to annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL, to prevent marine pollution during ship-to-ship oil transfer operations. These requirements entered into force internationally on 1 January 2011, and this bill will bring Australia's legislation into line with this scheme. The bill requires that all oil tankers with 150 gross tonnage and above involved in ship-toship oil transfers have an operations plan prescribing how to conduct those transfers. It is designed to ensure that consideration has been given to the processes involved in the ship-toship transfer and that hazard prevention safeguards are in place to prevent an oil spill. These plans will be checked by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to ensure they meet with their requirements. As you would expect, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, the bill also stipulates that ship-to-ship transfers must be undertaken in accordance with the approved MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Bills
189,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (10:45,"I join the debate on the Protection of the Seaoperations plan and that ship-to-ship transfers must be overseen by the master of a ship involved or a suitably qualified person. I believe that that is an important safeguard. The master of an oil tanker involved in such a transfer will be required to notify the administration of the country in whose waters the transfer will take place at least 48 hours prior to the oil transfer operations to ensure that response equipment is available in case of an oil spill during the transfer. That is a very reasonable consideration. We need to ensure that, in what it is fair to say would be the unlikely event of a spill occurring, it is conducted in a proper and correct manner with the appropriate safeguards. But, in any case, we need to ensure that the appropriate equipment is available on the mainland to deal with any unfortunate or unforeseen events. A record of such transfers needs to be provided at least 48 hours prior to the transfer to ensure that the Australian authorities are in a position to respond. Whilst the measures in this bill are important, it should be noted that, to date, there has been only one ship-to-ship transfer, which I am aware of, in Australian waters. In March this year, Caltex conducted a successful transfer off the coast of Sydney. I note from the minister's second reading speech an expectation that, in the future, this will become a more common event, particularly in the sense that Australian ports will not be able to cope with the supertankers that are becoming more commonplace and so there will be a need to provide these transfers to smaller vessels that can access Australian ports. Quite simply, it does not really matter how much we do in terms of dredging some of our ports they will not be able to cope with these vessels of enormous capacity, so these shipto-ship transfers will become more frequent in the future. I understand that Caltex operates using world best practice standards and carried out the transfer earlier this year in compliance with the requirements of the MARPOL convention even though it had not been officially enacted in Australia at that point. I understand that the transfer was carefully planned and carried out in close consultation with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and it is my understanding that it was a well-conducted operation. Whilst at this point ship-to-ship transfers of this type are not commonplace in Australia, as I have said, I think it is reasonable and prudent of the government to adopt this amendment to the MARPOL convention into Australian law. I am pleased to support the bill to implement the amendments to the MARPOL convention annex 1 in Australia. It is important that we take these measures to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect our environment when undertaking these potentially hazardous operations. I thank the House. Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011 amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 so as to give effect to the amendments to annex 1 of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, adopted in July 2009. The new chapter 8 included in the annex deals with the prevention of pollution during transfer of oil cargo between oil tankers at sea. The International Maritime Organisation, of which Australia is a member and which oversees the relevant shipping conventions, is a United Nations agency established in 1948 and is responsible for the safety and security of shipping and for the prevention of pollution by ships. The bill demonstrates the government's ongoing commitment to protecting Australia's marine environment. Australia depends almost exclusively on shipping to move its exports MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Bills
190,Mr Zappia (Makin) (10:52,"This Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution fromand imports. Australia has the fifth largest shipping task in the world in terms of tonnes of cargo shipped and kilometres travelled. Our oceans do not only drive our economy; they are also home to over 30,000 plant and animal species. Australia has some of the most unique and diverse oceans in the world and it is important that we do whatever we can to protect them. From obsolete sea vessels to dangerous uranium and other toxic chemicals, our oceans have been a convenient dumping ground for mankind for too long. Industrial and household waste are commonly dumped into our oceans. The environmental damage caused is immeasurable, but what is out of sight is out of mind for many and, regrettably, serious damage has been done to many ocean areas. Of course, not all ocean pollution is deliberate-accidents do occur. To date, one of the greatest threats to the marine environment has been oil spills. Since coming to office in 2007, the government has significantly improved the protection of Australia's marine environment with legislation regarding civil liability for bunker oil pollution damage; the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Regulations; the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Regulations; and the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, which dealt with sulphur oxides. This amendment bill will add another layer of protection for our marine environment. Under the traditional law of the sea, ships have the right of 'innocent passage' when transiting territorial and international waters. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states that passage is innocent as long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal state. Consistent with this right, a system of global regulation has been implemented to ensure ships are subject to uniform pollution standards whether they are on the high seas, in territorial waters or in port. Generally, shipping is an environmentally friendly mode of transport. Ships are the least energy intensive of all modes of transport. Shipping currently contributes just four per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from the Australian freight transport sector but carries a quarter of domestic freight. As an IMO member, Australia has adopted several international conventions, including the International Convention on the Control of Harmful and Anti-fouling Systems on Ships 2001; the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage 2001; the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992; the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1992; the Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties 1969; the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships; the Protocol on Preparedness, Response and Cooperation to Pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances 2000; the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation 1990 and the protocol to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution. The intention of the amendments associated with this bill is to prevent marine pollution during ship-to-ship oil transfer operations between oil tankers. The new requirements apply to oil tankers of 150 gross tonnage and above. The bill will require such tankers involved in ship-to-ship oil transfer operations to have on board a ship-to-ship operations plan, and for transfers to be carried out in accordance with that plan. The decision to adopt international MAIN COMMITTEE conventions was taken after extensive consultation with all parties involved, including the oil and shipping industries, state authorities and interested Commonwealth departments The most common reason for transferring oil between oil tankers is where crude oil is being carried on a tanker that is too big to enter a port where an oil refinery is located. With the new super-size carriers, this is becoming a reasonably common occurrence. When this is the case, the oil is transferred to smaller tankers. This does not yet happen too often in Australian waters. The first and, to this point, only such transfer was successfully carried out off the New South Wales coast in March of this year. When it does happen, it is important that it is done in a responsible manner. The new previsions will apply from 1 April 2012 and substantial penalties may be applied where breaches occur. For example, failure to carry out a ship-to-ship operations plan risks a penalty of 500 penalty units, or $55,000. If the oil cargo transfer is not done in accordance with the ship's operations plan, the master of the subject oil tanker would risk a maximum penalty of 200 penalty units, or $22,000. The amendments in this bill reflect international best practice as developed by International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Ltd, an international not-for-profit organisation which assists in all aspects of preparing for and responding to spills from ships of oil, chemicals and other substances. Coastal states will be required to be notified in advance of any proposed transfers, which means that they will be able to be prepared to respond in case of any spills occurring during a transfer. The risk of oil spills and other risks associated with shipping increases as Australian ships continue to be replaced with foreign-flagged, substandard vessels crewed with poorly trained seamen. Australian registered shipping numbers have almost halved from 75 in 1996 to 39 in 2010. Australian ships have negligible international trade business and are increasingly losing domestic trade to foreign competition. A quick scan of shipping accidents on the Australian coastline will expose the poor record of foreign-flagged ships when compared to Australian vessels. It should come as no surprise. Poorly maintained vessels with untrained or low-paid crews inevitably result in disaster. Supporting an Australian shipping industry would not only reduce the risk of environmental damage but also be good for the Australian economy. Australia's growing resource export trade will mean more ships going to and from Australia. It makes good economic sense, therefore, to see more of those ships registered and crewed in Australia. That would also minimise the likelihood of our sea waters being polluted by accidents. It is clear that there is a very strong relationship between the good record of ships crewed by Australian crews, registered here in Australia, and the incidence of damage that conversely occurs when foreign flagged ships are being used. It is also of concern that, given that we are likely to see more shipping trade in this country as a result of our resources export trade, foreign-flagged ships will have a clear effect on our economy. Many of these foreign-flagged ships, which are often registered in tax haven countries, are in effect denying the Australian economy of income that should properly be coming back to Australia. It is also of concern that many of these foreign-flagged ships are quite often exploiting their own crews. There have been a number of incidents in recent years in Australian waters of foreign crews being exploited by the masters of their ships. These are matters that should be of concern to this parliament. On the one hand we have an opportunity to increase the shipping trade for Australia, we have an opportunity to increase employment for Australian seamen and we have an opportunity to ensure that we minimise MAIN COMMITTEE the risks to the ocean waters around this country but, on the other hand, at the very same time we are seeing an increase in the number of foreign-owned ships carrying out the legitimate business of Australian commodities shipping. The regulations in this bill quite properly need to be imposed, and I believe they will help minimise the risks associated with ship-to-ship oil transfers. However, I believe there is a bigger issue at stake here and that is to ensure that more of that ship-to-ship trade is managed by Australian shipping organisations. I commend the bill to the House. Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011. By way of background, Australia has been a member of the IMO since its establishment in 1948 and has played an extremely active role in the developing of conventions and treaties over many years. One of the good things about our engagement through the IMO is that it has always had bipartisan support in this parliament. The Marpol has six annexes which deal with different aspects of marine pollution, and all six have been implemented by Labor and coalition governments over time. Relevant to this bill, annex 1 relates to the prevention of pollution by oil, and it entered into force internationally on 2 October 1983 and in Australia on 14 January 1988. Its introduction received bipartisan support, as I said before, and in 2004 the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the IMO adopted a revised version of annex 1 which entered into force in Australia and internationally in 2007. The current amendments to annex 1 were adopted by the MEPC of the IMO on 17 July 2009 and came into force internationally on 1 January 2011. They recognise the potential for pollution damage resulting from oil spills during ship-to-ship oil transfer operations. Amendments to other annexes of Marpol have consistently received bipartisan support. Most recently the coalition has supported bills which update liability provisions for oil spills, in 2008, and which implement improved air pollution standards for ships, in 2006. The most distressing things that I ever see on our televisions in our marine environment are large-scale oil spills. Whether they have come from submerged rig blow-outs or indeed from grounding of ships, the environmental damage they do is extreme, costly and of benefit to no-one. This bill seeks to put into place plans for ships above 150 gross tonnage to develop and submit an approved plan prior to any ship-to-ship operation. It also means that there is a responsibility of the master. Just by way of background, as far as I understand, there are only two people in this parliament that have held levels of ships master certificates and they are Senator Nigel Scullion and me. I have now rescinded my ticket because I had an inability-working in this place-to keep up my sea time. It was very disappointing. I have been around boats and vessels for a period of years. Making sure that situations on boats are environmentally managed is extremely important. What is also important is that we have in place measures so that, if such spills do occur, they are addressed as rapidly as possible. Making sure that plans are adequate is a position that is coveted by the Maritime Safety Authority to make sure they meet their minimum requirements. As I said, this then becomes the responsibility of the master of the vessel. The master of the vessel can delegate that to a suitably qualified position but, as always, it is the master of the vessel that is responsible for the operations of their vessel. Why do we need this bill to be in place given there has only been one, as I can recollect, ship-to-ship transfer? I think that was by Caltex vessels. It is because the increase in size of MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Bills
191,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (11:03,"I support the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of the tankers moving oil and fuels in and around our coastline may require a debunkering into smaller vessels to be able to access smaller ports as we see more growth into smaller regions. That said, it is important that this government, through its actions, is proactive in these measures. There is no point in waiting until an incident has occurred to work out what is going to be done. One of the important things about being in and around the sea-as I said, I have spent a number of hours, days and weeks out on the water-is the people who help make sure that our seas remain safe. I would like, as I speak to this bill, to also recognise the work and support work that happens through organisations such as the volunteer marine rescue services. In my area at Nelson Bay and through areas in the Great Lakes, Foster, Newcastle and Lemon Tree Passage, volunteers support the marine environment through Marine Rescue NSW. Marine Rescue NSW is a newly merged body of all the various marine rescue organisations in New South Wales. One of the important things they do is maintain a radio watch 24 hours a day. They work with AMSA and other organisations to make sure the quality of the service they are providing, albeit a volunteer service, is up to scratch. Having been out at sea, sometimes in less than favourable conditions as I have been doing delivery voyages and things like that, it is always refreshing to know that when you put out a radio call, even checking in your daily position, there are people there to receive those radio calls and acknowledge that you are there. It is all part of our maritime safety regime we have in Australia. In fact there are 56 unit bases along the east coast from Eden to Point Danger which provide that great service. A couple of weeks ago, on 5 June, I had the honour to attend a recognition ceremony for the volunteers from Marine Rescue Australia. I would like to point out to this chamber that these people are volunteers who will go to sea in the roughest of weather to save other individuals. The key point here is that they are volunteers, usually in their senior years, who are putting their lives on the line in atrocious conditions to provide safety at sea for others when most people should be at home in bed. They do it and they get away with what they do because they are highly-trained individuals dedicated to the pursuit of survival at sea. In recognising these volunteers, some who have provided decades of service, I would like to put their names on the record in the Hansard. From the Lemon Tree Passage unit there was Ray Conibear and Alan Ford who both joined in 2001, Dianne Wilson who has been volunteering since 1995 and Richard Osborne who entered the unit back in 1982. From the Nelson Bay unit, Brian and Maureen Wheatley signed up in March 2001, Heather Harmer, June Toms, Colin Bain and Patrick Johnson have been members since 2000, Marshall Britts, George Lawson, David Fairless, Malcolm Milliken, Nigel Waters, Geoffrey Moore, Joe Kolossa, Louise Moore, Eryl Thomas and Arthur Heiler joined in 1999, Ken Ross-Sampson, James Benson, Yvonne and John Almgren joined in 1998, Barry Hayes and Ramon Calvert joined in 1996, Kevin Lanyon, Bruce Shade and Alvin Kemp joined in 1994, John Smith joined in 1993, Shirley Clark and Lloyd Cropper joined up in 1991, Peter Phillipson and Rod Reeson joined in 1987, Harold Gibson joined in 1985, Mary Penny joined in 1983, Kevin Clark and Peter Shevlin joined in 1982 and last but by no means least John Thompson, who has been helping keep people safe on our waterways since 1968. That is more than four decades of volunteering service. MAIN COMMITTEE I quite often say to Thommo, 'Mate, you've got to get a life.' But he is typical of all those people in Marine Rescue who put their lives on the line regularly, going out to save people who are in distressed vessels off our coastline. Quite frankly an oil spill coming from a yacht, a fishing boat or a large cruiser can be equally as damaging as a small spill from a ship. Even though one might be pumping crude and the others have pure dieseline or petrol they can equally be damaging. These are the people who have an absolute commitment to our community. I will give you an example. In 2009 our local marine rescue unit performed 140 maritime rescues. That is 140 times; not all of them in bad and atrocious weather-the boat might have broken down on a perfectly sunny day. I have sat around and talked to these guys. They inherited a boat that was given to them called the Daniel Kane which came out of England and was a lifeboat there. It is a fully enclosed boat where the people who work on it are all below decks and strapped in and it will go out in absolutely atrocious conditions. Our region is no stranger to ship disasters, and I would remind this chamber of the fate of the Pasha Bulker. It was only by sheer good fortune when she was beached in that massive storm that there was no massive oil spill. I know that besides the professionals there and the tugboat drivers it was the volunteers like the Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service who got people onto the ship and evacuated the ship. It was people like our Marine Rescue units who were standing by ready to help in case they were needed. Protecting our seas is important and that is why this legislation is another pathway forward to protecting that marine environment. We can remember things such as the Exxon Valdez and the devastation that that created up in the north Pacific. We can remember the Gulf of Mexico, that is only a year on, and the devastation on a very broad scope that had on the southern states of the USA. It was not just that the oils and crude got washed up in the rivers, it went all the way up through into the Everglades area and it affected the marine nurseries and the financial liabilities of those towns. That is why in conclusion it is critical to be proactive. It is critical to have plans that are evaluated by professionals independently and, as always with the master of the vessel, it is critical to hold the master of the vessel responsible for the operations and safety of the vessel. The coalition commends this bill before the House. volunteer organisations right around our coastline. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (11:15): I rise to speak on the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011. This bill will certainly assist in protecting one of our most important national and international natural resources: our ocean. I have heard it said that roughly 80 per cent of Australians live within 80 miles-to use the old measure-of the sea, and half of our houses are within 15 kilometres of the ocean. Such an ocean-looking nation we are, quite different from the images of the Red Centre that we so often see that typify Australia. We are also famous for our beaches and we want to keep it that way. It is no wonder that the ocean is a treasured part of Australia's heritage. It has provided many generations with a living and the ability to raise a family, right back to the very first Australians. As a parliament, it is imperative that we are proactive in ensuring that such an important component of our livelihood and heritage is protected. This bill aims to do that. MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Bills
192,The Deputy Speaker (Ms K Livermore,"That was a lovely tribute to thoseThis bill is concerned with the transfer of oil between oil tankers carrying crude oil for cargo purposes. These ship-to-ship transfers of oil occur when an oil tanker carrying crude oil is too large to dock in a port where an oil refinery is located. So ship-to-ship transfers are actually a necessary event. Those ship-to-ship transfers are currently very rare and, to the best of my knowledge, only one has occurred this year-in March. So they are rare circumstances. But one mistake is one too many. This legislation is needed because it is absolutely vital that ship-to-ship transfers, if they occur, are carried out in a responsible manner. Our ocean is just far too important to allow risk to be a part of the equation out there. Additionally, with a growing international economy, there is a chance that ship-to-ship transfers of crude oil will become more necessary into the future. It is therefore imperative that this parliament respond, and appropriately regulate such transfers to ensure that they are carried out successfully. As I understand it, responsibility for the safe regulation of domestic New South Wales coastal trade is a responsibility shared between the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments. New South Wales is generally responsible for intrastate voyages. Trading vessels that operate on interstate voyages or are recarrying domestic cargo are part of an international voyage and are regulated by the Commonwealth. All trading vessels operating in Australian waters are required to comply with the Commonwealth and state marine pollution legislation. Trading vessels arriving at and departing from overseas destinations have to comply with a number of Commonwealth laws. They have a requirement to exchange ballast water en route to prevent marine pest incursions, as happened quite infamously in the 1990s with the Japanese starfish which devastated the Tasmanian scallop fishery. So these regulations are very, very significant and highly practical in their impact. These are important threats, but perhaps the threat we fear most as a coastal nation is the threat of serious pollution from ships. Maritime oil spills are one of the greatest possible threats to our marine ecosystem that we can imagine. In protecting marine ecosystems it is absolutely vital that we do all we can to prevent maritime oil spills, because the cost of a cure far outweighs any cost of prevention. The cost of any regulation and prevention measure really is naturally much less than the overall cost of cleaning up a maritime oil spill. The economic and social costs of such a catastrophic event are just too high even to contemplate. Indeed, communities in Alaska are still bearing the repercussions of the Exxon Valdez having run aground in Prince William Sound so many years ago. Many in this parliament represent these coastal electorates. We understand the immense importance of coastal environments. The electorate of Robertson contains many beautiful beaches and other coastal environments, many of which have become national landmarks. This was demonstrated with the great public interest generated by the scuttling of the former HMAS Adelaide in the seat of Robertson. Additionally, the beaches on the Central Coast have attracted holidaymakers for generations. Living in a coastal area, you understand the importance of beaches to our local communities. Indeed, it is part of our national character. It is for these reasons that it is important, in representing the people of Robertson, that I support this fundamental piece of legislation. Every bill passed by this parliament is of national significance and this bill is certainly no exception. Indeed, any bill that aims to prevent an environmental catastrophe that would potentially have irreversible effects should be of national significance. Last Saturday, I was privileged to participate in the Five Lands Walk, an annual event aimed at increasing MAIN COMMITTEE awareness of the spiritual importance of the natural environment. Having participated in the event for several years, I am heartened by the connection that the participants in the Five Lands Walk have with our local environment. This type of spiritual connection is indeed the type of connection that the very first Australians had for millennia. This is the environment that we need to protect and it is the role of this parliament to pass appropriate legislation to achieve these ends. Saturday was the sixth annual walk and it has become a tradition that young, local Indigenous dancers call in the whales. This is the time of year that the whales are migrating up the eastern seaboard of New South Wales. On the weekend of the winter solstice, while others are making merry in the hinterland-I know there is a big festival up in the Blue Mountains-the whales are passing right by our coast. They passed Tudibaring Headland and Bulbaring Headland, to use the Indigenous names for those areas, on Saturday at exactly the time the girls did their dance. That is something that has happened every year. This intimate connection with our environment is something we should never underplay and this bill is a reflection of that deep understanding of our connection with our environment. This legislation is constructed to ensure a very practical end-that the transfer of crude oil between ships in Australian waters reflects international best practice. As stated in the minister's second reading speech, these standards are contained in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation, recognising risks associated with shipto-ship transfer, adopted this international convention. It is important that as a nation we take our responsibility and adopt those same standards. An example of a new provision contained in this bill is that proposed in section 11B. The proposed section requires that, if a ship-to-ship transfer occurs, it must be carried out in accordance with the ship-to-ship operations plan. The plan is the critical element. This means that a ship-to-ship transfer of crude oil must commence with a planning phase and both ships have to comply with that plan. If they fail to do so, they will be subject to criminal sanction. Additionally, under the proposed section 11E, a master of an Australian oil tanker-and I was quite surprised to hear about the level of expertise here in the House, as mentioned by the previous speaker-involved in a ship-to-ship oil transfer will be subject to criminal sanction if the master fails to make a record of the transfer as soon as practicable. So there is planning and reporting. Subsection 11F(1) also provides that the master of a tanker which has been involved in a ship-to-ship oil transfer operation in Australian waters will have committed a criminal offence if the master has failed to notify a prescribed officer of the transfer at least 48 hours before the transfer began. The regulations of this bill therefore ensure that such transfers of oil are carried out with appropriate notice and in accordance with a plan and that they are recorded once completed successfully. This is vital considering the amount of oil that ship-to-ship transfers involve. These transfers typically do occur in accordance with very strict guidelines and practices which cargo ships abide by. Despite this it is vital that we legislate to ensure standards are high and complied with when these transfers occur in Australian waters or when involving Australian ships. This government has ensured that the standards set down in this bill do reflect best international practice. It is worth noting that the standards embedded in the key elements included in this bill were developed initially by the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Ltd. This is an international not-for-profit MAIN COMMITTEE service organisation that, throughout its history, has been predominantly concerned with the administration of compensation schemes. Not surprisingly the ITOPF has quite naturally developed an important role in providing advice in regard to the response to oil spill incidents. In addition it has a keen interest in preventing such spills. We need only cast our minds back to the devastating oil spill that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico last year to observe the absolute devastation of an entire marine environment. In addition there was the terrible economic impact that flowed on from that environmental devastation. We have seen what oil can do when it is not carefully managed and when preventative action is not properly managed. I hope that throughout my lifetime this nation never has to deal with a major oil spill of such magnitude. This government since being elected has been committed to ensuring that safety at sea and the safety of our environment is ensured. I am proud to support a government that has significantly improved the protection and sustainability of Australia's marine environment. This is demonstrated by our legislative record with the passing of legislation regarding civil liability for bunker oil pollution damage. Also this government has been proactive in enacting regulations including the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Regulations and Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Regulations. Such legislative activity is rarely commented upon by our news media. I am sure that if some oil spilled we would all hear about it, and there would be so much blame apportioned and so much regret. Prevention is less engaging for the media, but is a vital part of good governance and that is what is happening here today. Often preventative legislation is regarded as unexciting in comparison to other matters being debated in the parliament or sometimes unexciting simply to debate or for the entertainment that it provides. But we in this place are in the business of governing, not in the business of entertaining. This legislation is a fair reflection of that. I assert most forcefully that the prevention of major oil spills is vitally important in securing our environmental and economic future as a coastal nation. Whilst ship-to-ship transfers of crude oil rarely occur in Australian waters, when they do happen they must occur under appropriate regulation that meets the world standard. Anything less would incur far too great a risk of environmental tragedy. The ocean is one of our most treasured and important environmental assets. In representing my electorate of Robertson I will always think of our sparkling eastern seaboard. I think of the people who enjoy it for fishing, for swimming, for surfing, for boogie boarding, for sailing and even for those new things where you stand up and paddle; I see them all the time at Avoca. We have wonderfully innovative ways of enjoying the ocean. We need to have legislation that is preventative and innovates and moves us to a safer place. I commend the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011 to the House. of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011. The intent of this bill is to ensure that amendments to annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships are implemented in Australia. The amendments have been made in recognition of the potential for pollution to occur when oil is being transferred from one ship to another. Whilst this happens rarely in Australia it is important that all reasonable measures MAIN COMMITTEE be taken to reduce the risk of an oil spill when these types of transfers occur at sea. Under this legislation oil tankers with 150 gross tonnage and above that are involved in ship-to-ship oil transfers must have a ship-to-ship operations plan that details how such transfers are to be managed. Australian oil tanker operation plans will be checked by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and approved if they comply with the provisions of the legislation. Importantly, the master of an oil tanker that will be undertaking the ship-to-ship transfer is required to notify the administration of the country in which the transfer is to take place at least 48 hours before the operation in order to ensure the presence of the right equipment to clean up an oil spill should it occur. That way, serious damage to waterways and coastlines might be prevented by early intervention. It is my understanding that ship-to-ship transfers of oil have occurred in Australian waters on only one occasion, off the coast of Sydney, by Caltex. Caltex have advised that they are already compliant with the provisions of this legislation. I have a personal interest in this legislation. Honourable members will be aware of what has become widely known as the Queensland summer of disasters, during which our beautiful region suffered through the worse season of natural disasters in the state's history. We were buffeted by floods and cyclones all through the summer, and these have done untold damage to our state and have robbed us of too many lives. However, in March 2009 Queensland suffered from one of its worse man-made disasters, when the container ship Pacific Adventurer spilled approximately 270,000 litres of oil into Moreton Bay. The oil spill affected 20 kilometres of pristine coastline from Cape Moreton to Blue Lagoon in South-East Queensland. It was a shock to my community when, on Thursday, 12 March 2009, the Premier declared Moreton Island, Bribie Island and more southern parts of the Sunshine Coast a disaster zone. Bribie Island, in my own electorate, was one of the worse-affected areas. Queensland beaches are famous all over the world and the tourism industry was seriously threatened by the oil that was spilled. Community safety was compromised and our precious beaches and waterways were closed. This caused untold distress and economic damage to the region, its people and its wildlife. Some of Queensland's major tourist attractions along the Sunshine Coast were affected, together with Moreton Island and Bribie Island. This legislation will require that all transfers of oil are carried out in accordance with an oil tanker's ship-to-ship operation plan. This will apply when the transfer occurs in the sea near a state or territory in Australia's exclusive economic zone, or when the supertanker is involved in Australia and the transfer occurs while the tanker is outside the Australian exclusive economic zone. Most of the oil that was spilled into Moreton Bay polluted our sandy beaches, but when the oil spill occurred the weather was terrible. This resulted in a lot of the oil that had been buried in the sand being deposited back on the beaches by the rough seas. Without exception, all the areas affected have tourism as one of their major industries, so the clean-up effort was huge and aimed to ensure that people's expectation of Queensland's fabled beaches were met. Clean we did, for two months. Up to 2,500 people were involved in the clean-up and, reflective of the true Queensland spirit we saw this summer, volunteers came from everywhere: from the community, from agencies, from interstate and from the oil industry. At times during the response there were up to 400 people working on Moreton Island. During the clean-up approximately 3,000 tonnes of oil-soaked sand was removed from Moreton Island. It was backbreaking work but mostly done manually, using shovels and rakes to fill about 8,000 bags each day. Fortunately, the affected areas are now back to their pristine condition. MAIN COMMITTEE As recently as April of last year, the Shen Neng1 ran aground near Great Keppel Island on the Great Barrier Reef. In this instance there were serious concerns that the ship would break up, spilling its 975 tonnes of oil into the fragile environment of the Great Barrier Reef. As it was, some oil was spilled, requiring the use of chemical dispersants to break up the oil slick, which measured 3,000 metres by 100 metres. It was very fortunate that the skills of the salvage effort ensured that only a minimal amount of oil was spilled and that the ship was prevented from breaking up. Nonetheless, the incident serves as a stark reminder that we need to do all we can to protect our valuable and fragile marine environment. There is not a lot we can do to prevent rain and cyclones; however, it is our responsibility to do what we can to prevent man-made disasters, such as oil spills, from damaging our coast and waterways. In this context, the coalition supports this legislation. in the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill. This legislation derives from changes internationally through the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, or MARPOL, which commenced in 1983 and itself derives from UN activity through the International Maritime Organisation, established in 1948. As many speakers will indicate, there is a very real reason for trying to avoid oil spillages at sea. Obviously for this country there would be a threat to our tourism industry and to fishing, but more particularly there is the impact on wildlife, particularly birds but also whales, otters et cetera. Those impacts include hypothermia, the poisoning of animals and birds as they try to clean themselves, the effect on reproduction, the problem of blinding which makes them vulnerable to predators, many birds become too heavy to fly, oil bubbles in the fur of some animals lead to their inability to float, and whales' blowholes become plugged so they basically cannot breathe. That is another reason why we should be very vigilant and very active in this area. We hear people denigrating international activity and international cooperation through organisations such as the UN, but the fact is that trying to overcome national self-interest and corporate power to reach agreements such as this and have parallel legislation in countries is a worthwhile human endeavour. Perhaps the most extreme example of what can occur is demonstrated by the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident. A quarter of a million birds are believed to have perished as a result of that leakage-it was more than a leakage; 25 olympic pools of oil were lost, spreading over 28,000 kilometres. This case was also indicative of corporate power in the world, because in one of the most infamous examples of corporate power and doubts arising over the US Supreme Court, the initial penalties resulting from the Exxon Valdez were reduced from $2.5 billion to $500 million, and court cases were stretched out over a decade. Despite efforts by the US Congress to ensure there were measures to counter disregard, disinterest and negligence by corporations in regard to the carriage of oil, we had an example where the political nature of members of the US Supreme Court led to a massive reduction in punitive damages. Whilst it is estimated that the contribution of oil spillages to the overall problem is of a lower order-estimates go between five and eight per cent of the oil pollution in the world-it is still important. If we can take action internationally and as a nation to reduce the possibility, it is a worthwhile venture. It is of interest that 70 per cent of oil pollution comes from MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Bills
193,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa) (11:34,"I support the provisions being put forwardconsumer use-run-off, et cetera. As I say, that five or eight per cent is important when we are trying to ensure that we move in the right direction. As well as Exxon Valdez, there has been a focus on the Gulf of Mexico over the last year or so. That certainly gained international attention because of the huge media coverage and the impact on Louisiana's wetlands and fishing and shrimp industries. There was the image of a US President not acting strongly enough. It focused international attention, in the globalised world of media presence, on making sure we all have some indication of what can occur. There have been multiple examples-Exxon Valdez, the Kuwaiti oilfields, whether it involves spillages through ship crashes or negligence in ship maintenance or, as I say, the search for oil itself. This legislation includes a commendable series of measures designed to reduce the problem. It includes penalties for ships not having plans of action for problems that might occur; equally, there are penalties of up to $6,000 for inappropriate qualifications of people on ships, with some leniency depending on how much notice the ship operators have had. There is a penalty of $22,000 for failure to report incidents and strict liability in regard to a ship-toship plan. So there is a series of measures here to bring Australia into line with international provisions. This is as a result of international action. While I heard one speaker saying that Australian waters have not been affected by this many times, there is always the possibility. Who would have foreseen 20 years ago what is happening in international transport? Who knows what is going to occur with oil shortages over the next few decades-how it will be transported, in what kinds of vehicles, the nature of Australian ports? The degree of caution, vigilance and action early on are commendable. We are, through this legislation, moving on the threat of spillage from ships transporting oil, chemicals and other substances. In conclusion, I commend this as a necessary measure and stress again both the threat to the environment and an indication of this country being involved in international organisations, and the very positive outcomes which occur through international cooperation. spectacular environments in the world, in particular our marine life. Being the world's largest island, our coastline boasts hundreds of beautiful islands and reefs and each of these provides support to their unique ecosystems. From whale sharks in Western Australia to the heritage listed Great Barrier Reef, our marine environment is worth protecting. The bill we are debating today, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011, relates to safety measures which are to be implemented by oil tankers during ship-to-ship transfers. They are important. Imagine the damage an oil spill would cause to our marine environments. We saw the devastation caused last year by the massive deepwater oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet even spills on a smaller scale can have hugely detrimental effects on an environment and can occur from ship-to-ship oil transfers. One of the most serious cases of a ship-to-ship oil transfer spill occurred off Texas in 1990, which resulted in 4.3 million gallons of crude oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico. Oil spills are hugely destructive. We saw for ourselves a major impact on our islands and coastline north of Brisbane from a relatively smaller oil spill from the Pacific Adventurer, as detailed previously by my colleague the member for Longman. I commend Brisbane City Council and the then Lord Mayor, Campbell Newman, for their response and for the subsequent campaign by Brisbane Marketing to reinvigorate the region. Oil spills damage the environment for marine wildlife and cause MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Wyatt Roy Longman 11 29 I Rise To Speak To The Protection Of The Sea Prevention
194,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (11:41,"Australia is fortunate to be home to some of the moststress to the complex ecosystems which exist along our shore lines. As well as the environmental harm they cause, the economic repercussions of a clean-up can be quite drastic. We do not want to see this happen in Australian waters. That is why the coalition is supportive of today's amendments. As a nation we have always valued our unique biodiversity and have been a member of the International Maritime Organisation since its establishment in 1948. It has always been acknowledged that the best way of increasing safety and reducing pollution at sea is by developing international regulations that all shipping nations adopt. Australia has played an active role in the International Maritime Organisation over the years, helping to develop conventions and treaties. It is wonderful that our nation is part of such a successful, multinational organisation that continues to adapt to the changing conditions of the world in which it operates. As part of the IMO, the MARPOL convention is part of the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes. All of its six annexes have been implemented over the years by both coalition and Labor governments to ensure that Australian standards are in line with international conventions. Today's amendments, which deal with protecting the sea from pollution caused by vessels engaged in ship-to-ship transfers of oil, were adopted by the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the IMO in July 2009 and came into force internationally in January this year. Amendments to the annexes of the MARPOL have consistently received bipartisan support, reflecting the importance of those sensible measures as well as the value Australia places on protecting our marine environments. The amendments today bring Australia's legislation in line with the relevant MARPOL convention annex and, therefore, in line with international standards. This bill will implement safety measures which will require all oil tankers of a gross tonnage of 150 or more involved in ship-to-ship oil transfer operations to have a ship-to-ship operations plan on board. This plan will prescribe how to conduct oil transfers, the implication being that the fact that a tanker does not have this plan on board indicates that it may not have sufficient safeguards in place to avoid an oil spill. The scheme is designed to ensure that oil tankers give due consideration to the ship-to-ship transfer practices and that their hazard prevention safeguards adequately prevent an oil spill. These ship-to-ship operation plans will be checked by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and if they are found to comply with the bill's requirements they will be approved for use. These requirements will apply to ship-to-ship transfers carried out from April next year. After this time, a record of ship-to-ship transfers occurring near an Australian state or territory must be kept, and a 48-hour notification of a transfer must be given to the country in whose waters it will take place. Given the disastrous effect an oil spill could have on the Australian coastline, it is important to note that ship-to-ship transfer is uncommon in Australian waters. In fact there has been only one ship-to-ship operation conducted near Australia in our history. That case occurred in March of this year and was administered by Caltex, as they have advised that this method of transfer is a cost-effective way of transporting oil from distant locations in Africa. This transfer was completely successful and in full accordance with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. This method of ship-to-ship transfer is important for companies such as MAIN COMMITTEE Caltex as they can use a large vessel or supertanker to transport the oil over great distances, but they need to be able to transfer to smaller vessels which can then take the commodity to port. Another environmental benefit of this is that it reduces the number of oil tankers travelling on the sea, thus reducing the increased pollution that multiple vessels travelling large distances would cause. For the foreseeable future it is likely that Caltex will be the only company engaged in the ship-to-ship process. As they already operate under best practice, the company believe that they are already compliant and the amendment will have no negative effect on their business. So whilst a current company already employs these standards, today's amendments will ensure that the standards are already in place to protect our marine environment from any future tankers that use ship-to-ship transfers. The coalition will always support sensible policies which deliver real outcomes for Australia. Both sides of this place have given support to MARPOL amendments over the years to ensure that Australia upholds international standards wherever possible. It is said that the best defence is a good offence and these measures will help to protect our precious marine environment from the disastrous effects an oil spill would cause. I am pleased to support this bill. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (11:48): As someone with a keen interest in the marine environment, it gives me great pleasure to speak today on the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011. This bill seeks to implement amendments to annex 1 of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The intention of the bill is to prevent spills occurring during ship-toship oil transfers between oil tankers. The new requirement under the bill will apply to oil tankers over 150 gross tonnes. These transfers most often occur when an oil tanker is too large to enter a port where there is a refinery, so it becomes necessary to transfer the oil to smaller ships. Many will perhaps think it is odd that the member for Canberra would rise to speak on this legislation. After all, Canberra is not well known for its great beaches, its bustling working ports or its maritime tradition. As I said, I rise to speak on the bill because I am motivated by our national interest and because I believe that, whilst such transfers are rare in Australia, the potential damage that could result from a spill is enormous. My dad is a very keen snorkeller, skindiver and sailor, and as a result my sisters and I were brought up swimming from an early age, with a strong appreciation and respect for the ocean and a strong appreciation and respect for its dangers, beauty and wealth of life. So, from a very young age, I have been extremely conscious of the need to protect Australia's marine environment. I was fortunate recently to visit the Australian Antarctic Division in Tasmania with the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. During this trip, I spoke with scientists from the division as well as from the University of Tasmania. In my conversations with them. I learned of the pressures being placed on the oceans of the world due to climate change. I learned how the protein value of krill populations could diminish from increased ocean acidity caused by a sudden and dramatic increase in the Earth's temperature due to climate change. The division is, thankfully, undertaking a comprehensive, unique and significant study of krill which has drawn interest from scientists all over the world. When we were there that day, there were scientists from Germany, the United States, MAIN COMMITTEE from memory, and a range of other countries who were drawn to this very unique research taking place only in the division and only in Tasmania. Krill are a vitally important part of the marine environment. They are the foundation of the marine food chain and many species, both large and small, directly depend on this vital food source for survival. Beyond this, many more, including us, are indirectly linked to the survival of these tiny creatures. My trip to Tasmania more than settled in my mind the need for this parliament to take immediate action on climate change through a carbon price. It also underscored the need to protect our precious marine environment from all sorts of threats, including potential oil spills in Australia. The transportation of oil through sea lanes represents an important source of marine pollution. WhilstI have noted that such spills in Australia are rare, when they occur the potential environmental damage is enormous. Not only do they have an immediate and devastating impact in the short term but also research has shown that there is significant long term damage from spills. Oil in the marine environment can irritate the eyes of the wildlife that encounter it. It also contaminates food sources, damages or disrupts the fins of fish and clogs fur and feathers. We have all seen those dreadful images from around the world of birds covered in oil from the range of disasters that have happened with oil spills. They really underscore this point. Longer term exposure has other dire consequences for these creatures, such as organ failure. One of the substances contained in crude oil is a compound known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, or PAH. This compound is known to be mutagenic and carcinogenic, and whilst naturally occurring in certain circumstances it is significantly present in crude oil. PAH has been demonstrated to have highly toxic and long-term effects on the reproduction of fish, even at very low levels. But, well apart from the ecological cost of oil spillage, there is also the social and economic cost to those people who live near the site of spills. The recent events in the Gulf of Mexico highlight the effect on communities. Local anglers were prevented from fishing for months, sending many of them to the wall and decimating local economies. Tourism to the area all but ceased as once picturesque beaches were covered with a thick black coating of oil, and of course they will take many years to fully recover, if indeed they ever do. There have been concerns about the health of the people who live in areas near these disasters, as well as the health of those who clean up the spills. In the Gulf of Mexico, there have been reports of skin and eye irritations. One academic study focused on the effects on the health of workers who were sent to clean up the 2003 spill from the Tasman Spirit tanker in Karachi. This study found an increase in respiratory problems in the people who cleaned up the spill. The report also found an increase in coughs, skin and eye irritations, sore throats and headaches as a result of people being close to the spill. While these spills are perhaps larger than that contemplated by this legislation, even a minor incident can have devastating consequences. One such example occurred in 1976, when an oil tanker which had unloaded its cargo sought to wash its tanks out with seawater. Although only an estimated five tonnes of oil were released, it had the effect of calming the waves and attracting a migrating flock of ducks. Some 60,000 died as a result of this spill. While this is perhaps an isolated incident, it does serve to highlight the effects of oil spills. MAIN COMMITTEE While they may be rare, the effects can never be truly predicted and are highly damaging. That is why we need strong legislation to prevent such events from ever occurring. Today's legislation seeks to do just that. It requires a ship-to-ship operation plan in all ships. This will ensure that tankers have appropriate equipment and qualified and trained onboard crew to undertake the operation. It will also ensure coastal states are notified of an operation proposed in their areas, which will allow them to move quickly should the worse happen. The bill is an example of world's best practice regulation and will bring Australia into line with international convention. Since 2007, the government has introduced legislation covering civil liability for bunker oil pollution damage. We have introduced the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Regulations and the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Amendment Regulations. The Gillard government is deeply committed to protecting Australia's environment, and I commend the bill to the House. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (11:56): I also rise to support the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oil Transfers) Bill 2011. The coalition has a long history of supporting sensible reform to protect our marine environment, and the bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to implement amendments to annex 1 of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL, to prevent marine pollution during ship-to-ship oil transfer operations. These requirements entered into force internationally on 1 January 2011, and this bill will bring Australia's legislation into line with that scheme. The measures of the bill are that oil tankers with 150 gross tonnage and above will be involved in ship-to-ship oil transfers and that they must have an operational plan prescribing how to conduct those transfers. It is also designed to ensure that consideration has been given to the process involved in the ship-to-ship transfer and that hazard prevention safeguards are in place to prevent an oil spill. These plans have been checked by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, who will ensure that they meet the requirements. As you would expect, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, the bill also stipulates that ship-to-ship transfers must be made in accordance with the approved operations plan and that ship-to-ship transfers must be overseen by the master of a ship involved, or by a suitably qualified person. A record of ship-to-ship transfers must be kept and notification must be given to the country in whose waters the transfer is to take place approximately 48 hours prior to the transfer. RecentlyI met with representatives of the Australian Marine Conservation Society. They are the voice for Australia's oceans. A constituent of mine in Brisbane, Mr Omar Ameer, was one of the representatives to visit me. He is a volunteer for the society. He is very dedicated and spends many hours in his fight to help conserve Australia's marine environments. I want to congratulate him and the organisation for the very fine work that they do in this particular area. Their head office is located in my electorate of Brisbane, and the work that they do on behalf of all of the community to protect ocean wildlife, make our fisheries sustainable and create places in the sea where our precious ocean animals are safe from harm is to be commended. The Australian Marine Conservation Society are working actively with passionate scientists, educators and advocates who have defended Australia's oceans for more than 40 years. Australians love the sea and, as an island nation, we value our ocean wildlife, our fur seals, our humpback whales and our sea turtles. Measures outlined in this bill have the specific aim of protecting these gifts that we have been given. Moreton Bay, on the eastern MAIN COMMITTEE coast of Australia 45 kilometres from Brisbane, is one of Queensland's most precious coastal resources. The waters of Moreton Bay are a popular destination for recreational anglers and are used by commercial operators who provide seafood to the market. The protection of this area, along with our waters, is of great importance. Brisbane has a great love for Moreton Bay and its 30 beaches, its wonderful, beautiful islands and its national marine park. This region also plays a very important role in the world's biodiversity, hosting 40,000 migratory birds each year, as recognised by the World Wetlands Day celebrations. We all remember one of Australia's worse oil disasters on 11 March 2009. We saw the cyclone-buffeted cargo ship Pacific Adventurer leak some 270,000 litres of fuel into Moreton Bay. It blackened the beaches of Moreton Bay and Bribie Island and beaches along the Sunshine Coast. The oil washed onto beaches, rocky reefs and mangroves on the northeastern side of Moreton Bay and Bribie Island, and onto the beaches and mangrove wetlands between Caloundra and Coolum Beach on the Sunshine Coast. Many of the affected areas were located within the Moreton Bay Marine Park and the Moreton Bay Ramsar site. It will take many years for these areas to fully recover. The Bligh government's response to the Moreton Bay oil spill disaster was just another bungle from a tired and inept Labor administration. It took far too long for them to recognise that there was a problem occurring, and then they delayed the start of the clean-up effort. Several of the local restaurants and many of the hotels and function centres that received shipments of fish from the waters off the Queensland coast refused to stock any fish due to the spill. The cost of that particular operation also hurt the economy terribly. It cost at least $10 million. In July 2009, the total clean-up bill was estimated to be some $34 million. The President of the Queensland Seafood Industry Association, Neil Green, said at the time that the 30 containers of ammonium nitrate that fell off the Pacific Adventurer on the Wednesday morning were also a major concern to commercial fishermen and the potential impact on fishing stock was absolutely devastating. I support any safeguards that we can implement to prevent such ecodisasters. The coalition has supported the bills which have updated liability provisions for oil spills in 2008 and implemented improved air pollution standards for ships in 2010. These measures, combined with the current bill, will in the long term reduce the risk, and lessen the impact, of disasters such as those I have outlined. The measures in the bill are very important. It also needs to be noted that to date a ship-to-ship transfer has occurred only once in Australian waters. In March this year Caltex conducted a successful transfer off the coast of Sydney. Debate adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Frankston City Council Splash Card Type1 Diabetes Carers Allowance Southern Hemisphere metropolis of Frankston has done it again, achieving two awards in the National Awards for Local Government. I am delighted to share with the parliament that the MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Wyatt Roy Longman 11 29 I Rise To Speak To The Protection Of The Sea Prevention
195,Mr Melham,I move:,184,Adjournment
196,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (12:04,"I bring a note of celebration and excitement. The greatSplash Card has won the National Awards for Local Government National Award for Excellence and also the National Awards for Local Government Inspired Cities category. This is an enormous tribute to Frankston City Council and to all of the team involved in this outstanding initiative. Essentially, the Splash Card is a student discount card and it is leading economic development and also local employment, local shopping and youth engagement initiatives in Frankston city. The program predominantly operates through online mediums such as websites, email, SMS, Facebook and Twitter, connecting youth, through these avenues and the avenues that they prefer, with our community. Not once has the program been marketed through the traditional media-it simply has not needed to be done. Instead, this innovative approach is engaging people, particularly young people, and sets an excellent example for social media strategy for other local governments. The concept behind it is for the council, through this Splash Card, to engage youth and alert them to local employment opportunities, in a no-nonsense fashion that reduces bureaucracy and provides opportunities for local business and local employers, and also to engage local people in what is going on in their community, the great city of Frankston. The Splash Card provides secondary and tertiary students with discounts at over 50 streetside business in Frankston City Centre. Students are required to register online, they provide the council with information for ongoing interactions and then they are on their way. Students can receive their cards online, or they are posted to them within 72 hours. The great idea about this is that those holding a Splash Card are in a position to take advantage of in-store discounts. It provides an avenue for them to be updated about new commercial offers from local small businesses in Frankston city, and it also lets them know about events and competitions that may be of interest to them. A very exciting part of it, though, is that it also alerts young people in our community to local employment opportunities, and we have already seen some examples where, by learning about employment opportunities through digital media and online services, young people have been able to find employment in Frankston city. So far, in just 15 months of operation, the Splash Card has been distributed to over 25,000 students, 20,000 of whom are tertiary students. Over 2,200 students have registered online; that number continues to grow, and the council has a useful database to engage with local people about issues of concern to them. So there are a few elements to the program: the activation of the Frankston City Centre through a creative engagement means and marketing means; an opportunity to encourage students to shop in Frankston city; a way of sharing information about events and opportunities and discounts; a way of retaining talented local people in the area as they are alerted to opportunities for employment; and also a way of engaging with the community in Frankston city. Rather than just hanging out in the streets of Frankston, young people are encouraged to engage, to shop, to support, to look for employment opportunities and to be connected with what is going on in their city. This is a fantastic initiative of Frankston City's and they have well deserved the recognition that they have earned. To the economic development team, particularly Jonathan Reichwald, Samantha Jackson and others that are active in this area, my strong, hearty congratulations for their win. On a slightly less exciting area, there is some concern about government pondering changes to type 1 diabetes carers allowance. I know the minister has met with a number of people in the local community who are concerned about a proposal that would see parents of MAIN COMMITTEE children with type 1 diabetes losing some of the carer allowances and benefits when those young people hit 10 years of age. The thinking behind it, as I understand it, is that at that age a 10-year-old should be able to manage their medication, but parents are telling me that the challenges get harder and more demanding as parents are actively involved with their preteenage children, making sure that they make good dietary choices and good healthcare arrangements. There is also the issue of the cost of medication itself. Under this measure, if the government proceeds with it, some may lose their healthcare card and see medications costing $268 rather than $5.50. SoI urge the government to think carefully about that issue. In the few seconds that are left I want to thank Minister Roxon's staff for meeting with me about the area of workforce shortage challenges in the Dunkley electorate, including at the Belvedere Park clinic, where Dr Hura and the other doctors have been looking after my family for many years. A number are retiring, Dr Barry being one of them, and we need to make sure that we can replace those doctors. You can see the area of workforce shortage. (Time expired) Whitlam Institute Western Sydney, I have been honoured to attend a number of functions at the Whitlam Institute. It is housed in the historically significant Parramatta Female Orphan School on the Parramatta campus of the university. The Whitlam Institute is guided by the three great aims that drove the agenda of the Whitlam government in 1972, as well as recording the historical legacy of Gough Whitlam's years in public life. Those aims are: to promote equality, to involve the people of Australia in the decision-making processes of our land and to liberate the talents and uplift the horizons of the Australian people. It exists for those Australians who care about what matters in a fair Australia. It bridges Mr Whitlam's public legacy and the contemporary relevance of his program to public policy. I have previously noted in this place a contribution of the Whitlam government and of Gough himself to the advancement of greater Western Sydney, including the establishment of the university itself. It is only appropriate that the institute house Mr Whitlam's records and papers from his private collection in addition to its other scholarly activities. The Whitlam Institute works as an educator, policy influencer and research institute, amongst its many activities. The institute has, over the past five years, conducted the 'What matters?' Competition for students in years 5 to 12 across the ACT and New South Wales. Students write between 500 and 600 words to share their thoughts on what matters to them. Since its inception in 2007, the number of entries has risen from a few hundred to a few thousand. Every entry is read and every student who contributes is acknowledged through a certificate. The 2010 competition saw essays on a range of subjects, such as global unity, poverty, the death of a sibling, the palm oil industry and honour killings. This year saw the successful inaugural Gough Whitlam Oration given by the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, on 'Walking the reform road'. There are regular exhibitions, such as the lauded ' Mrs Prime Minister' and the upcoming 'Shell-shocked Australia', in conjunction with the National Archives and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Another tradition has developed with the celebration of Gough's birthday on 11 July each year; his 95th birthday is next month. All this is in addition to its research program. In a relatively short few years, the professionalism and contribution of the Whitlam Institute has continued to grow. MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Adjournment
197,Mr Melham (Banks) (12:09,"Since its establishment in 2000 by the University ofI wish to pay particular tribute to the Director of the Whitlam Institute, Mr Eric Sidoti. Throughout his long career and prior to his appointment, Eric was engaged in a range of activities across many policy areas, including education and training, employment, human rights, development, Indigenous land rights and education, humanitarian law and conflict and welfare issues. Apart from his own consultancy business, he was previously involved in a leadership capacity at the Human Rights Council of Australia, Amnesty International Australia and the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. In 2002, Eric addressed the annual general meeting of the Professional Teachers Council, where he introduced the value set that has underpinned his contribution to public policy with reference to Harper Lee's book To Kill a Mockingbird. He said: Harper Lee's work spoke to me at least about our shared humanity, the way we relate, about respect and justice. She spoke to me about the destructive powers of ignorance, and prejudice. To Kill a Mockingbird has been a constant reminder to me that the human is the essential determinant of rights. I applaud Eric's work as the Director of the Whitlam Institute. I congratulate the institute, for its commitment to the legacy of a great man and the future of public policy debate in this country. In his policy speech on 13 November 1972, Gough Whitlam had this to say: We want to give a new life and a new meaning in this new nation to the touchstone of modern democracy-to liberty, equality, fraternity. Professor Janice Reid, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, had this to say: Gough has always argued that the people of Australia should be heard and involved in the decisions governments make. How fitting then that the opportunity to speak up and be heard offered by this What Matters? competition is being so enthusiastically embraced by so many young people. I commend the Whitlam Institute on its work. South Australia: Walking Trails Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (12:14): I would like to speak about walking trails in South Australia. South Australia has a number of long-distance walking trails. The Heysen trail, which was completed in the 1980s, runs from Cape Jervis on the Fleurieu Peninsula to Parachilna in the Flinders Ranges. It is 1,200 kilometres of walking trail and was modelled on some of the walking trails in Europe and the United States. It was the vision of Warren Bonython, an explorer, an adventurer and a very keen bushwalker. It honours South Australian artist Hans Heysen, who brought the Flinders Ranges and the Adelaide Hills to the Australian community and to the international community. There are also the Mawson Trail, which is a long-distance cycling trail, and the Kidman Trail, which is a multi-use trail and can cope with horse riding. RecentlyI walked some of these trails with my family. In walking some of the shorter walking trails around Adelaide, we went on a walk from Waterfall Gully to Mount Lofty. I was amazed at the numbers of people who were taking this walk. It is a 3.8-kilometre walk up to the summit. Mount Lofty was devastated by the Ash Wednesday bushfires in the early 1980s. I remember doing that walk when the summit was quite bare and it was a very lonely walk; you might see one or two other people making that walk. When my family and I did it MAIN COMMITTEE on the Monday of the long weekend it was like Rundle Mall; people were walking up in single file. The reason I raise this is there are many other walking trails that people can use. The Yurrebilla Trail, which I have also walked with my family, is 54 kilometres. It links all of the national parks in the Adelaide Hills. It begins at the Belair National Park, runs through Brown Hill Creek, Cleland park, Horsnell Gully, Morialta and Black Hill. This is a great opportunity, right next to the city, to see wildlife-to see koalas, to see the abundant birdlife-in the Adelaide Hills. It was a vision of the South Australian Liberal government to link up all of these parks through a walking trail. There is one thing I would like to see, as the local member. The Liberal and National parties proposed at the last election a green army with teams to go out and work in the environment. One project I would like to see the green armies working on is upgrading these walking trails. The walking trail from Waterfall Gully kiosk to Mount Lofty-which I think the member for Kingston walked quite recently, and that was covered on radio-has been significantly upgraded. There is more work that can be done on the walking trails to make them more user-friendly so that more people can use them. If you have a look at the numbers of people doing that walk up Mount Lofty, people are doing it to train for mountaineering, doing it for exercise, doing it to appreciate nature. The amount of participation is tremendous. There is also the Sea to Summit walk, which runs from Seacliff to Mount Lofty. Over the same long weekend there was a race from the sea to the summit, which is Mount Lofty, again using the bushland that exists in the metropolitan area. The green army proposal would be a way of upgrading our walking trails to get more people to appreciate our beautiful environment. One thing that struck me with the Yurrebilla Trail is how few people were using that beautiful trail through the Belair National Park compared to the very well-travelled walk up Mount Lofty. I do hope that the coalition will be pushing ahead with our green army proposal. I think that there is a lot of work that can be done on walking trails so that they can be better used by the community. Free Trade Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (12:19): I rise to discuss the benefits of free trade to the Australian economy and the Australian consumer. Estimates from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade show that households have benefited by $3,900 per annum as a result of the reductions in tariffs and the elimination of export quotas over recent decades. A large part of that boost has been in the form of prices being lower for consumers than they would otherwise have been in the presence of tariffs. The real prices of heavily protected products have fallen sharply. Boys' footwear has fallen by 50 per cent, prices of major household appliances have fallen by 47 per cent and prices of automobiles have fallen by 37 per cent. One in five Australians is now employed as a result of exports and imports. Australians working in export industries are paid 60 per cent more than other working Australians. I want to use this opportunity to praise the trade minister, Craig Emerson, for his recent statements in this area. He follows very much in the traditions of the Hawke and Keating governments of trade liberalisation. Trade liberalisation in Australia has been a Labor achievement; whether through Gough Whitlam's 1973 tariff cuts or the Hawke tariff cuts in 1988 and 1991, the tough decisions have been Labor decisions. The Australian economy is better for that-we are a more resilient economy. I think one of the reasons we have MAIN COMMITTEE weathered these shocks so well in recent years has been because Australian businesses naturally think of themselves as international businesses engaged with the world economy and diversified across international markets. Lowering Australian trade barriers is worthwhile in its own right, regardless of what other countries do. As the great Cambridge economist Joan Robinson put it, it is worth removing the rocks from your harbours even if other trading partners do not take the rocks out of their harbours. Thankfully, our other trading partners have also been taking the rocks from their harbours. Among Australia's major trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region, which buys 70 per cent of Australia's exports, average tariffs have been cut over the last quarter century from more than 25 per cent to around five per cent, according to a recent Productivity Commission trade policy statement. I would like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to the late Senator Peter Cook, who was, for a time, Australia's minister for trade and, when I worked for him in the late 1990s, the shadow minister for trade. Peter died a little under six years ago, having resigned from this place almost exactly six years ago. He was just 62 at the time when he passed away, but he left a great legacy. He held a range of different portfolios, including industry, shipping, resources, industrial relations and trade. He understood intuitively that the benefits of trade liberalisation flow to all Australians. He understood, as very much a self-taught politician and one of the last who had not finished high school to serve in a cabinet, the benefits of comparative advantage, of doing what Australia does best. When he returned from the 1999 Seattle trade talks, where he and his wife, Barbara, had been caught up in the riots and the tear gas, Peter set about rewriting Labor's trade policy. Its opening paragraph firmly committed our party to free trade. He was an instinctive internationalist, perhaps because he was engaged in that most global of sports-sailing. When doctors told him he had only a year to live, Peter Cook told them what he thought of their prognosis by buying a 41-foot yacht. He never lost track of what mattered. He cut through the arcane complexity of trade agreements to make simple and straightforward points, and he recognised so well the interconnection between a strong social policy and an internationalist outlook. On the shores of Lake Geneva, the building that was once the International Labour Organisation is now the World Trade Organisation. Yet it still bears on its walls the original social realist murals, depicting workers battling for their rights. Peter Cook once remarked how fitting he found the building, melding the rights of labour with the principle that trade across national boundaries should be unfettered. It was a great gain to the parliament and public debate that Peter Cook served for 22 years in the national parliament. We owe him much. Indigenous Affairs it is for every one of us in this chamber to remember we are not here forever, but when it comes to Indigenous well-being we need to be doing more than consulting alone, and more, certainly, than sitting here in our public lives and seeing nothing changing. That is why yesterday's release of 'Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory' caused so much alarm, if not MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Adjournment
198,Mr Laming (Bowman) (12:24,"It is important for every government to consult, just asinsult, in Central Australia. This offer by Minister Macklin to yet again consult on the Northern Territory intervention is more of the same. Minister Macklin can now be very proud that she has an entire page of links to reports under her tenure, looking at an examining the Central Australian situation. Is there a need for more reports and more consultation in the absence of action? Mr Deputy Speaker, I put to you that it is one thing to talk about spending money but quite another to talk about changing the lot of those who are living in Central Australia. You may well be proud of every single one of these links that take you to reports written by committed authors, mostly now forgotten, but, in reality, what is changing out there? Go back two years, one month and one day, and an almost identically titled report was released promising again in not stronger futures but future directions to, yes, consult on the Northern Territory intervention. That was two years, one month and one day ago. We seem to see the word 'future' in many of these government documents because there is nothing to talk about in the present. And, of course, the past is something for which one only apologises on behalf of others. As we look to the future with documents like this, I can see more promises to consult. How long do we have to consult about children not going to school? How long do we have to consult about people not taking up a completely reasonable job just down the road on a mine site? How long should we have to live with the watered-down, mutual obligation laws under former Minister O'Connor from 2008 when he put in the hardship clause, which said that if you had less than $5,000 in liquidity one cannot be breached. Who on earth who is facing breaching or mutual obligation, has a quick $5,000 in their bank account? No-one. It was a blanket exemption on mutual obligation. All that Indigenous Australians are asking for is some decision, some strength. It is one thing to be using the rhetoric of 'stepping up' and 'getting tough' when you are talking to people in the south, but quite another when you tiptoe around communities whispering that it is such an unfair intervention. In reality, the only thing that has changed between these two reports is the adjectives. Even the photo shot of the minister is exactly the same. The only thing that has changed is the adjectives: back in 2009 the minister was talking about 'hurt' and 'betrayal', and then in 2011 she is talking about 'anger', 'fear' and 'distrust'. In the end, apart from the adjectives changing, the content is exactly the same. The great problem is: how can adjectives even change when nothing is happening, except an almost anthropological fixation of the Labor side of this chamber to watch the intervention and consult on it. Yes, we as a coalition government brought it in towards the end of 2007 and, correct, we had just three months to consult. Let us accept that it could have been implemented far better. Mr Melham: You didn't talk to anyone, not even the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. consulted even better. But certainly an Australian government receiving bipartisan support in November of 2007 could have started a process of consultation. But, no, like you are looking through an oven window at a rising souffle of frustration, you just sit there and measure the intervention and talk about it, but nothing has been improved. Despite everything that was promised in 2008 and 2009, in those interminable reports written by well-meaning people, there is a fundamental failure here. MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Adjournment
199,Mr Laming,"I accept that intervention, Madam Deputy Speaker. It could have beenMinister Macklin is quite happy to fund Noel Pearson to increase school attendance to 85 per cent. She funds him to increase school attendance but does not have the wit to take the ideas of Pearson and disseminate them anywhere else in the country. So in the rest of Central Australia we have school attendance rates that have stalled at 60 per cent and have barely changed one per cent in the following three years. The ideas are there, they can be easily disseminated, but they have not been taken up. Deputy Speaker, I appeal to you. There have never been a lot of jobs in Central Australia. There has certainly been difficulty matching jobs to people. But with the mining explosion and the thousands of jobs appearing, there is no excuse for having remote Indigenous communities hyperendemically unemployed right next door to mine sites. There is a time when we have to match these good young people to job opportunities just down the road. The Kimberley has more jobs than it has working-age Aboriginal adults, but this government has not had the wit to put the two together for the simple reason that they find it impossible with their left-wing ideology to make someone do something if they do not feel like doing it at the time. That means you do not have to send your kids to school, you do not have to take up a job if you do not feel like it, you do not have to drink in moderation if you do not feel like it, and that is the fundamental problem with Labor's approach-they have been unable to apply mutual obligation to the challenge of Central Australia. Kingston Electorate: McLaren Vale RSL and Naval Association Beachvale Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (12:29): I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the great work of two returned service organisations in my electorate of Kingston, the McLaren Vale RSL and the Naval Association Beachvale Subsection. The McLaren Vale RSL makes a real difference in the lives of both members of the veteran community and the wider community by providing a range of age appropriate programs and activities aimed at addressing issues such as social isolation, disadvantage, health and well-being as well as positive lifestyle choices. The RSL is a safe and comfortable place where ex-service men and women and members of the wider community can come to socialise and undertake new and different activities. The McLaren Vale RSL also works extremely hard both to commemorate the service of our veteran community and to increase understanding in the wider community of issues of relevance to veterans. I was honoured to attend the unveiling of the McLaren Vale RSL's Peacekeepers Memorial last weekend. The memorial is a testimony to the hard work of this veterans' organisation. This important and impressive project would not have come to fruition if it was not for the vision and dedication of members of the McLaren Vale RSL, and in particular President Brian Flavel and Secretary John Gyepes. The focal point of the memorial is a decommissioned Leopard tank, which was never deployed and has never 'fired a shot in anger'. This will serve as a fitting tribute to Australian peacekeepers, who may not have always received the recognition they deserve. Australia has a proud history of providing transitional support to regions troubled by conflict or political turmoil, with over 65,000 Australians having taken part in over 50 UN and other multilateral peace and security operations in more than two dozen theatres of conflict since 1947. We continue this long standing tradition today as an active contributor of both personnel and financial support to UN and other multilateral peace operations around the world. MAIN COMMITTEE The memorial will provide our local community with an opportunity to honour the Australian men and women who have served and continue to serve in important peacekeeping missions. It will become a valuable asset to the region and it will serve as a visible reminder both of our nation's military history and of the sacrifices made by Australian Defence Force personnel as well as members of the Australian Federal Police in the promotion of peace and stability throughout the world. The McLaren Vale RSL worked hard to secure the decommissioned Leopard tank and to secure funding for the memorial through a range of grants programs, and I commend them on pulling together all these grants programs, all these parcels of money, to make a very splendid memorial indeed. I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight the great work done by the Naval Association Beachvale Subsection. This important local community group provides services both to ex-service men and women, many of whom are members of the subsection, and to the broader community. It was my pleasure also on the weekend to attend the Naval Association's annual anniversary luncheon. This luncheon marks the day that the organisation came into existence. It was a fantastic event celebrating the history of this local group but also recognising the services and sacrifices made by Australia's ex-naval personnel. I also commend the naval cadets who were there waiting on us on the day. They provided a very professional service and were very respectful. I would like to congratulate them. They come out to a lot of different memorial services and really work hard and respectfully. I think they really contribute to our local community. The subsection contributes significantly to help people with pension and welfare issues and they have a number of pension and welfare officers who provide members and nonmembers with information about the availability of government financial assistance. These officers can help people with applications for payments such as DVA pension and apart from that are an important source of information. The subsection also works in partnership with other local groups and lends its facilities to members as well as keen local residents who perhaps want to be involved in activities such as craft, chess, cards and even indoor bowls. I would like to really commend this organisation for its outreach work and the dedication it provides to its local members and retired servicemen and women. The effort of these people is enormous. I would like to congratulate both of these organisations for making a significant contribution to veterans in our local area and also to the wider community. (Time expired) Grey Electorate: Telecommunications three communities in the west of my electorate. The first is Streaky Bay on the stunning west coast of South Australia's Eyre Peninsula. It is 730 kilometres from Adelaide and 300 kilometres north-west of Port Lincoln. The backbone of the economy is agriculture; they grow wheat, other grains and livestock. It has a vibrant fishing and aquaculture industry expressed in oyster and abalone production. It has an increasing tourist sector, beautiful islands, a spectacular coastline, including cliffs, sweeping beaches and a string of protected bays, seal and sea lion colonies, and growth in sea change population-I have spoken to people who have come from the other side of the world to buy real estate and to live and visit Streaky Bay. The population of the council area is 2,025 according to the 2006 census, and around MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Adjournment
200,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (12:34,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to tell you a tale today of1,070 of those live within the township. In that part of the world, it is a substantial centre, and certainly a confident and growing town. Just 140 kilometres down the road, also on Eyre Peninsula, is another excellent, vibrant community: Wudinna. Wudinna is the biggest town in the Wudinna District Council, and like many of my inland towns is an agricultural service centre. It has fantastic services for a community of this size: a 23-bed hospital, resident doctor and dentist, swimming pool, aged care and large farm service businesses. Wudinna is a good community to live in. It is highly motivated-just last year they unveiled the Big Farmer, a six-metre high single slab of granite. The local community raised $200,000 to commission and erect it. Wudinna is the southern gateway to a great South Australian secret: the fabulous Gawler Ranges. It is the heart of what they call 'granite country'. The population of the district, according to the ABS in 2009 was 1,333, with about 600 living in the town. The third community is the town of Cummins on the lower Eyre Peninsula, heart of some of the most productive agricultural land in South Australia. It is the service centre for 4,402 residents even though the town only has a population of a little over 700. It is very fertile farming area and the district is closely settled, and the majority of the population lives outside the town. It owns and controls the Port Lincoln airport, has a hospital, doctor, large school and is one of the most prosperous towns in the South Australian grain belt. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may well ask what the point is of telling the story of these three towns? Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, along with a number of similar communities in my electorate, they will miss out on the government's $50 billion National Broadband Network. Streaky Bay meets the minimum criteria of more than 1,000 residents-1,070-but it is conspicuously absent from the broadband maps. In fact, it is proposed that Streaky Bay will be serviced not by a wireless network but by satellite. Wudinna is below the 1,000-resident threshold but sits on top of two fibre optic cables, so there is no cost at all to build the associated backhaul, just the street rollout. As I said, both of these communities are to be serviced by satellite. Cummins, according to the NBN plan, will receive a wireless network but also sits on a fibre optic cable. I have raised repeatedly the poor deal for rural Australia under the NBN. In short, these Australians get to pay their full share of the $50 billion cost-around $2,500 a head or $6,000 a family-but they will not receive the service the rest of Australia will receive of 100 megabits per second, rising to 1,000 megabits per second. At best, many of them will only access 12 megabits by the satellite service. Increasingly communities are switching to wireless networks which they are establishing for themselves because, essentially, they do not want to wait the six to eight years for it to happen. As a resident of Grey, who has actually survived on a satellite internet connection, I would have to say that while it works quite well one way, a two-way conversation is pretty stilted because of the latency factor that operates with getting the signal up and down to the satellite. If the government is determined to push on with its $50 billion National Broadband Network it should take a responsible decision either to give regional Australia a comparable service or to take a serious look at the financial penalty it is inflicting on these smaller communities. Why should they? Because in the case of Streaky Bay, what is the deal? Can the government not do the numbers? There are 1,070 people who live there. And in the cases of MAIN COMMITTEE Wudinna, Cummins and a number of other communities in similar circumstances, let us have a common sense decision. Deakin Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program another BER opening in my electorate, at Blackburn Lake Primary School, which I attended on 10 June to open its new multipurpose hall. Blackburn Lake Primary is a school that I first visited in 2008, and I have seen it change in that time. The change has come about due to that capital investment. Like so many schools in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, it was built many decades ago and, although it has had some work done, it has not kept up with the local community nor has it kept up with the technological needs of the students in its classrooms. Looking at the figures for investment for 2009 shows that the Victorian state government put only $36,000 of investment into its own school for a whole year. This goes across both sides of politics in Victoria. Investment in government schools over many decades has simply not kept pace with the demands of growing populations. Blackburn Lake Primary School now has around 440 students. Similar to many schools in my electorate, those 440 students could not have an indoor assembly; it was simply impossible to fit them into the size of room that was provided, which was really just some old buildings bolted together. They now have a multipurpose hall that can fit all of the students in, where they can have performances and do indoor sports. It is a particularly valuable community asset as well. I know there are local basketball teams and others interested in using such a facility. This facility did not just happen by chance; it came about as part of the federal Labor government's stimulus program back in 2009. It is one of about 7,000 buildings across the country in our schools. It is the 13th project I have had the pleasure of opening in the electorate of Deakin. I have at least another 20 or so to open in new parts of the electorate as well, and many of those are coming up in the next few weeks. It is going to be a very exciting time for many of these schools as they get to use their new facilities. It has been such an important change for the area and especially for the students; they now have modern facilities and IT facilities that they were lacking, in many cases, and many of these are all in the one building. The school still needs more. WhilstI was there for the opening of the multipurpose centre, the school received more portable classrooms because it is growing. Rather than receiving fixed assets, proper classrooms, they are still in the phase of receiving more portables. While new portables are good, they are obviously not a long-term solution for a school like Blackburn Lake Primary. I would also like to say that on the day I was very well looked after by the school captains, Emily and James. I would like to thank them and the school vice captains, Thanushi and Andrew. They all did a great job not only in introducing me but in hosting a lot of the ceremony. The school's principal, who just started this year, Jason Walker, also did a particularly good job on the day of making sure that everyone was involved. I would also like to pay tribute to the school's former principal, David Jewell, who was principal for 17 years . He was a great driving force, especially when it came to talking about how good a government education could be in a state school. In recognition of David Jewell, MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Adjournment
201,Mr Symon (Deakin) (12:39,"TodayI would like to relate to the House the story of the school council actually named the centre after him. I think that is a great local recognition for someone that has had an impact on so many people in the local area. Blackburn Lake Primary also had an investment from the federal government under the National School Pride program into its old school hall-to call it a school hall is a bit much. As I said, it could not fit all the school there. It has now been turned into an arts centre and has many more specialist facilities than before. The school has gone ahead in leaps and bounds. It is very popular. It is not the easiest school to get into because of its popularity, but it has great results and it is well located. On the day of the opening I also got to plant a tree for the school. It is an acacia lightwood, indigenous to the local area, and I hope that tree grows into a magnificent specimen. The local nursery, Bungalook, tell me that it does suit the area. It will grow into a magnificent standalone specimen in the years to come. I hope that both the tree and Blackburn Lake Primary continue to grow and become even more valuable assets to the community. Swan Electorate: Financial Advisers the member for Deakin. I went to Blackburn High School and hearing him talk about Blackburn Primary School brings back memories of the time-Orchard Rise, Springfield Road and all those sorts of places. I rise to speak on behalf of the financial advisers in my electorate of Swan who are not happy with the government. They are not happy because this government is presiding over an absolutely shambolic policy process in its attempt to further regulate the finance industry which could cause considerable damage to an important sector. Firstly, I would like to thank one of my many constituents, Mr Phil Alvaro, for raising this issue and his continued advocacy on behalf of his industry. By way of background, the government felt it had to do something in the wake of the financial collapses of Storm, Westpoint and Trio. It commissioned a joint committee review chaired by the member for Oxley which became known as the Ripoll review. It may surprise you to hear this, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I do have some sympathy for the member for Oxley, who I know put a lot of effort into his review only for the government to completely ignore his recommendations. The member for Oxley must be wondering why he bothered at all. The government's new tack is outlined in their Future of Financial Advice proposals, which have caused widespread condemnation from the financial services industry. I have concerns with several of the measures in the multiple versions of the government's proposals we have seen and heard. I was listening to the shadow minister for small business in the chamber the other day when he condemned the government for its deregulation failures. Before the 2007 election, Labor promised a one-in one-out approach to regulation, yet the statistics on actual outcomes are damning and reveal abysmal performance. Between 2008 and 2010, the Commonwealth's own ComLaw register reveals that federal Labor introduced 12,835 new regulations while repealing only 58. This amounts to the Rudd-Gillard government imposing 220 new regulations for each one they have removed. The government's Future of Financial Advice proposals are another deregulatory failure. They will mean that investors who receive financial advice will face more red tape, increased costs and reduced choice if Labor's latest version of these proposals is passed in full. MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Adjournment
202,Mr Irons (Swan) (12:44,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was interesting to listen toThe opt-in proposal, Labor's push to force people to keep re-signing contracts with their financial advisers, is a classic example of this. Originally the Assistant Treasurer wanted contracts to be re-signed every year. It is worth noting that he has now backed down and revised his proposal to once every two years. However, we in the coalition still believe this is bad policy. It was revealed in the Senate estimates that an average small business financial advisory firm would face $50,000 per annum in additional costs as a result of the latest opt-in proposal. We propose ensuring financial fees are transparent and that consumers are able to opt out of financial advice arrangements or to change advisers without imposing such a regulatory burden. This would be more effective. Opt-in would not be worthwhile and I do not think even the minister is sure about the merits of his proposal. Perhaps the most controversial aspect among the industry is the proposed ban of commissions on risk insurance. We do not agree with Labor's assertion that commissions on risk insurance are in themselves a conflicted remuneration structure. Indeed, recent experience in the UK showed that banning of commissions on risk insurance does not work, which is why the UK reversed this decision. I know from a meeting I had with the finance industry in my office that their main complaint about the commissions restructure was that small investors would suffer the most under the restructuring because they would be paying on an hourly-rate basis for the financial investor's advice instead of paying a small commission fee on what may be a $1,000 investment. That was a worry for the end-user. This measure would increase costs for consumers, remove choice and leave many people worse off, particularly small business people who self-manage their super funds. In conclusion, we oppose key elements of the government's Future of Financial Advice proposals. We do support changes such as proposed statutory 'best interest' duty for financial advisers, subject to seeing the detail in the legislation. However, neither the proposed twoyear opt-in requirement nor the proposed ban of commissions on risk insurance inside super would have prevented the collapses of Trio, Storm or Westpoint, which the member for Oxley originally set out to prevent occurring again. The government does not seem to have a clear agenda, and the backflips and delays are causing great uncertainty within the financial sector. I condemn the government for allowing this to happen. As they often say in the other chamber, business needs certainty. I want to assure financial advisers in my electorate of Swan that the coalition will continue to examine all the proposed changes in close consultation with all stakeholders and make final decisions once the necessary detail on the proposed legislation is available. (Time expired) Housing Affordability Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (12:49): Affordable housing is a critical issue in Australia and the Gillard government, in partnership with the states and territories, is deeply committed to providing affordable, appropriate and flexible social housing. Given the relative affluence of Canberra, many in this place may not consider housing affordability and homelessness to be a particular problem here and I acknowledge that we are fortunate to be below the Australian average when it comes to homelessness. However, this does not mean we are immune from today's housing and homelessness challenges. Canberra has some of the highest rental prices in the country. We also have some of the lowest levels of rental availability. In fact, housing and housing affordability are by far the main issues on which I am contacted by MAIN COMMITTEE constituents in need of assistance-mainly by women. Each week my office helps many Canberrans who are struggling to find a place to live and build a life and a home. The 2006 census showed that there were 1,364 homeless people in the ACT, which equates to 42 homeless per 10,000. Of this figure, 22 per cent were aged between 12 and 18 and six per cent were sleeping rough. Irrespective of whether this is below the national average or not, I do not believe it is acceptable. Every Australian deserves a home and both the Gillard and the ACT governments are doing a commendable job on helping people with that. Having a home is something so basic and yet so powerful in determining your future, especially if you are a child and going through the formative stages of your life. The experiences of your early childhood form the prism through which you see the world. If you know that you have a safe, secure and inviting place to return to at the end of your day it makes everything seem more possible. Having access to secure, affordable housing is no less important in the later years of life. Being able to enjoy retirement and one's family in a suitable place to call home should be a great pleasure. Older members of the community should not be forced to worry or stress about a place to stay, nor should they feel they are a burden on their families. For this reason, I have been very pleased to be able to attend a number of openings in the ACT of new older-persons units. These are units that have been funded though the Gillard government's $5.6 billion Social Housing Initiative, in partnership with state and territory governments-the single largest investment in social housing ever undertaken by an Australian government. As part of this partnership in the ACT, building has begun on 421 approved dwellings, with over 280 of these already completed. The units provide age appropriate accommodation for older people in the community, and free up larger social houses for families. So it is win-win. The units mean older members of the Canberra community can continue to live independently and with dignity in a space they can call their own-usually around their social network in their former suburb and in six-star energy rated homes built to universal design principles. The most recent opening occurred in the suburb of Rivett in my electorate where I was fortunate to join with the ACT Minister for Housing and Community Services, Joy Burch, to open 60 units. I have also opened new units in complexes in Curtin, Conder and Bonython. Once complete, the Rivett complex will have 69 twoand three-bedroom units as well as a community centre and there are community centres in some of the other complexes as well, so it is about not just living spaces but also community space. The complex was funded jointly by a $10.7 million grant from the Gillard government, with the ACT government contributing the land as well as a further $5.1 million. I really enjoyed being able to see how these units had been turned into homes in a very short amount of time. In a matter of weeks, proud new resident Judith Young had made her new space her home. She had photos of family and loved ones on the wall and a fantastic garden with pots and outdoor art. Many of the other residents are using this opportunity to move from an older home into a brand-new home, to get new curtains and new furniture and to make a welcoming space. Judith's home was a place that looked like it had been lived in for years with comfort and love and family, even though it had only been a matter of weeks. Safety and shelter are the fundamentals that underpin self-esteem, confidence and achievement. I am extremely proud of the historically significant investment the Gillard MAIN COMMITTEE government has made to provide thousands of Australians with a home, and through it the opportunity to actively participate in society. Goldstein Electorate: Graffiti and Vandalism incidence of graffiti and vandalism in my electorate of Goldstein, a series of incidents which is increasingly common across many other parts of Melbourne. I cite as an example the very shopping strip in which my office is based in Centre Road in Bentleigh, one of the 17 suburbs in my electorate. It is a wonderful shopping strip but it has increasingly been confronted with endless graffiti: shopfront hits and tagged windows and advertisements on bus shelters and a host of other sites up and down that strip and the surrounding streets. All of the signs are being attacked and defaced by graffiti and it is dreadful. At a time when retail is hurting, and the last 12 months have been perhaps the worse in 20 years, it saps morale. It is ugly, it is a blight on the landscape and so many local residents and traders alike are fed up and are calling for action on graffiti. We have people reporting that while graffiti has always been around, it is increasingly becoming out of control. Centre Road has been made a most unattractive place to shop due to the extent of graffiti. President Tania Moss of the Bentleigh Traders Association, whom I have met with on a number of occasions, said the traders paid for the graffiti to be removed from shops on a weekly basis. Every week they have a person coming in for nearly one day to remove graffiti up and down the strip. It is costing literally thousands of dollars-no assistance from council-and all in an attempt to maintain the truly pleasant nature of that strip at a time when retail sales are really being hit all over the country. This is but one example. I could talk in equal terms about many other areas in my electorate including the shopping strip in Highett, Carnegie, Hampton Street, the Beaumaris Concourse, Ormond, Black Rock and Sandringham. It is very unfortunate that some of these sorts of local community issues could well have been dealt with in the last 12 months and, in fact, the voters and the members of my electorate have been denied effective action because, unfortunately, we were not able to get onto the government benches at the last election. We were taking to local electorates all over the country a very flexible and responsive program designed very much to tackle these sorts of issues of graffiti, vandalism and other unnecessary local violence. The program was intended to enable councils and local community groups to apply for funding for crime prevention projects and strategies to deal with crime prevention. It was to include CCTV systems for community hubs and shopping strips, security patrols, graffiti removal kits for traders associations and alarm systems for sporting clubs. It was to be a highly flexible and responsive program to deal with the fundamental concerns of Australians. At the moment Australians are deeply anxious about their circumstance. The government is offering no direction and no leadership, you have a leader with no authority and people are concerned. That is why savings rates have gone up dramatically. That is why retail sales are down. This sort of cost is being imposed on our retailers who can ill afford to be dealing with graffiti and other incidents and damage and vandalism. We need a government in place that can live within its means, focus on the issues that are of concern to our local communities and make sure that Australia heads in the right direction again.

He is always so negative and oppositional. He really reflects the opposition's policy of no, no, no. That is what the member for Goldstein is about. I am here to give you a positive picture. I am here to talk about some of the Building the Education Revolution projects that have been completed in my electorate of Shortland. Over $85 million has been spent on schools. This money would never have been spent. This money has delivered state-of-the-art classrooms, state-of-the-art libraries and state-of-the-art halls. Gorokan Public School, where I went on 7 June, has six fantastic new classrooms. I have spoken about the Budgewoi classrooms, and the ones at Gorokan are of the same quality. They really reflect the needs of the school. Nords Wharf Public School has a new library. Marks Point Public School have the school hall they have dreamt about for many years. I will be attending Swansea Public School on Tuesday for the opening of their Building the Education Revolution project. I attended Gwandalan Public School in the construction stages. They have got new classrooms. I was particularly impressed with what was happening there because they were employing apprentices who are in the government's Apprentice Kickstart program. That demonstrated how all these programs are coming together. On 30 JuneI will be visiting Mannering Park Public School and on 1 JulyI will be visiting St Patrick's at Swansea. Charlestown Public School are having their opening at the same time as Mannering Park, on 30 June. All these projects are welcomed by the school communities as they are very worthwhile projects. On8 JuneI was at Windale for the opening of 16 new one-bedroom units that have a sixstar energy rating. I was there with representatives from Compass Housing. That is a $3.8 million project. The thing I found so exciting about it was the fact that a number of the residents have been homeless and have had enormous insecurity about their housing. There were a number of Indigenous tenants and people with disabilities. They are getting not only the wonderful support of living in these new houses; they are also developing friendships with the other tenants in that complex. We had a morning tea. It was such a success that I have given those tenants an undertaking that, during the July-August break, I will be back there with my staff and Compass Housing to have a barbecue. We are going to encourage the friendships that are starting to develop in that complex. Around lunchtime on SaturdayI had two hours of free time, so my husband and I went for a wonderful ride on our bikes along the Fernleigh Track. The federal government put $2 million into that project under the national pathways program. It was the largest project that was funded under that program. Once again I enjoyed the investment and saw the Commonwealth's money working for the benefit of the community. There were hundreds of people on that track either riding their bikes or walking. It was a wonderful experience. (Time expired) Question agreed to.
