(2) Does section 70 of the Taxation Administration Act prescribe the keeping of records of indirect tax transactions for at least five years after the completing of the transactions or acts to which they relate, including the goods and services tax (GST). (3) Is he aware that, in light of the Government’s amendments to the taxation law and in particular the introduction of the goods and services tax, the volume of records required to be kept under the provisions of these Acts will increase significantly by imposing a substantial storage cost on individual taxpayers by virtue of the Acts’ record retention provisions. (4) In light of the increased personal financial burden of document storage costs on individual taxpayers through the introduction of the GST, will he amend the retention provisions of both Acts to reduce the retention periods from five years to three years; if not, why not. (1) Subsection 262A(4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 requires a person carrying on business to keep records relevant to their tax affairs. The retention period is whichever is the later of the end of five years after: the records were prepared or obtained; the completion of the transactions or acts to which the records relate; or if the assessment period has been extended, the end of that period. (2) Section 70 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 requires a business to retain records of indirect tax transactions and other acts relating to indirect taxes (such as importations) for at least 5 years after the completion of the transactions or acts to which they relate. Indirect taxes include the GST, wine tax and luxury car tax. These requirements are consistent with those for income tax. (3) It is expected that many of the records required to be kept for the purposes of the indirect tax laws, including the GST, will be records that are also relevant to the income tax affairs of the business. The Australian Taxation Office has provided an extensive assistance program to businesses in explaining the new tax system. This has included thousands of personal visits to small businesses to assist them in establishing proper records keeping systems. One of the benefits has been that many businesses now have better information available to them from proper record keeping systems that they are able to utilise to make better decisions in running their businesses. (4) The Government does not intend to amend the income tax or indirect tax laws to reduce the period for which records are required to be retained, as it would impair the ability of taxpayers and the Commissioner to provide evidence of overpayments or underpayments of tax if an assessment is revised. Both the income tax and indirect tax laws allow the Commissioner of Taxation a period of 4 years to increase liability in the case of avoidance of tax or to decrease liability when tax has been overpaid. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 46) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Will he provide details of the parent controlling interest of Airport Motorways Limited. (2) Will he provide details of the majority shareholders of Infrastructure Trust Australia (ITA). (3) Is Macquarie Bank one of the bidders for Sydney Airport.",123,Notices Ms O Byrne To Move
244,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Can the possibility that cross-industry of infrastructure associated with Sydney Airport, including road access to that airport, constitute monopolistic-like control of infrastructure to Sydney Airport. (1) Airport Motorway Limited is part of the Airport Motorway Group. The Airport Motorway Group (“AMG”) consists of the following entities: Airport Motorway Trust (“the Trust”); and, the Airport Motorway Holdings Group (“AMH Group”), comprising Airport Motorway Holdings Pty Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary, Airport Motorway Limited (“AML” or “the Company”). (2) Details of the major shareholders of Infrastructure Trust Australia are publicly available from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. (3) On 30 June 2002, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance and Administration announced the sale of Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (SACL) to the Southern Cross Airports Corporation. (4) No. Australian Taxation Office: Information Technology (Question No. 93) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Does the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) still have an Information Technology department; if so, (a) what is the cost of that department, (b) how many staff does it employ and (c) what is its function. (2) What is the total of the financial penalties levied upon EDS for non-achievement of service credits to date and over the first year of the contract. (3) Has the ATO hired a company to ascertain whether or not the ATO has achieved savings by outsourcing its IT department to EDS; if so, (a) what is the name of the company, (b) what is its brief, (c) what is the cost to the ATO of the review and (d) did the company have to win a tender to carry out this work. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Although the ATO outsourced the provision, maintenance and support of its information technology and telecommunications infrastructure, some components were excluded from the scope of the outsourcing initiative. Those components primarily remain under the management of the ATO’s ATO Technology Line. (a) The ATO Technology Line cost for the period 1 July 2001 to 31 January 2002 has been approximately $67 million. (b) At 31 January 2002, the ATO Technology Line employed full time equivalent staff numbering 305.28. Full time equivalent staff numbering 464.83 have moved to the ATO Production Line with the transfer of applications development functions. (c) The functions performed by the ATO Technology Line include contract management, capacity planning, new IT investigation, building new IT infrastructure capabilities, components of data capture such as imaging, IT Security and IT Training. (2) In general, EDS is meeting the Service Level requirements specified in the Services Agreement for IT&T Services and Industry Development. That comment notwithstanding, the ATO maintains a strong position regarding the documentation that EDS must submit to verify that services have been delivered to the contracted Service Levels. Where EDS is working towards satisfying verification requirements, the ATO and EDS have agreed that the associated Service Credits will remain interim until the required verification documentation has been signed off. The monetary value of interim Service Credits applied up to 30 June 2000 was $1.89 million. However, for the period from 24 June 1999 to 31 January 2002, the ATO has applied actual Service Credits of $1.954 million while interim Service Credits now total approximately $606,000. (3) Yes. (a) Deloitte Consulting.",125,Questions On Notice
245,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,126,Questions On Notice
246,Mr Costello,"The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has provided the follow(b) The engagement required Deloitte to review the original cost model and to identify, document and assess the impact of all financial, scoping and volume variations made since the original costing exercise and to determine the impact that those changes had on the original cost baseline projections and the anticipated savings. (c) $249,000. (d) Deloitte Consulting was selected on a single supplier basis as the company had previously worked with the ATO in developing the original cost baseline and had been part of the RFT financial evaluation team for the ATO’s IT&T outsourcing initiative. Furthermore, Deloitte Consulting had been the successful tenderer at the completion of the competitive process conducted to engage a supplier to assist in developing the original cost baseline. It was, therefore, expedient to utilise the company’s established and detailed ATO knowledge base for the savings realisation assessment rather than to conduct another competitive process with its associated costs and with which there was a potential for additional costs to be incurred in relation to an acquisition of knowledge period. Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd (Question No. 115) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Did the former Minister for Financial Services and Regulation direct that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), when assessing aeronautical charges at Sydney Airport, not take account of revenues generated by the airport operator for services other than aeronautical services; if so, (a) when did the Government make the decision to issue the direction to the ACCC and (b) on what date was the direction given to the ACCC. (2) When did the ACCC commence the process of assessing aeronautical charges at Sydney Airport and what was the date of final submissions. (3) During the course of the ACCC’s consultations relating to the Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd pricing proposal, did he issue any other direction or change any parameter for the review; if so, what was the nature of that direction or change and on which date was it issued or made. (4) Given that the Productivity Commission is considering arrangements for price regulation of airport services at all airports, should the direction given to the ACCC, in relation to Sydney Airport to not take account of revenues generated by the airport operators for services other than aeronautical services, also apply to the Productivity Commission review of aeronautical charges at all airports; if not, why not. (1) Yes. Direction No. 22 was provided to the ACCC pursuant to s.20 of the Prices Surveillance Act 1983 on 19 April 2001. (2) Sydney Airport Corporation Limited lodged its revised draft aeronautical pricing proposal with the ACCC on 3 October 2000. The deadline for submissions in response to the ACCC’s draft decision was 5 March 2001. However following the release of Direction No. 22 the ACCC allowed several weeks for the receipt of further submissions. (3) No. (4) In undertaking its review of prices regulation at Australian airports, the Productivity Commission was able to consider many matters, including the issue of pricing and the respective merits of dual till and single till approaches. Aviation: Airservices Australia (Question No. 333) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: (1) During the operation of Airservices Australia’s contingency plan for continuing air traffic control and aviation technical operations during recent industrial action by Airservices Australia staff, was there a near miss between two regular public transport jets allegedly caused by failure to adhere to, or lack of knowledge of, the contingency procedures.",126,Questions On Notice
247,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Did two jet aircraft enter controlled airspace from the Temporary Restricted Area (TRA) on converging courses, both on different radio frequencies, each apparently not aware of the other aircraft, and which were detected in time to prevent an accident. (3) Were there instances where there was not timely notification of procedures to adjacent air traffic control units to enable controllers to become familiar with the temporary procedures. (4) Where there instances of confusion of local time zones and universal coordinated time by the National Airways Contingency Coordinating Committee in position reports to air traffic control units adjacent to the TRA. (5) Were there instances of confusion as to what aircraft were in the TRA, particularly in non-radar areas and where aircraft were on routes that were not published in the contingency plans. (6) Were there situations where aircraft were operating on routes different to those advised to the adjacent air traffic control units. (7) Were there other incidents; if so, what are the details. (8) Was a safety case conducted into the contingency plan before it was implemented; if not, why not; if so, will he provide a copy. (9) Has he ordered an investigation into these incidents; if not, why not; if so, (a) when will it report and (b) who is undertaking the investigation. Airservices Australia (Airservices) has advised the following: (1) No. (2) Yes. A Qantas aircraft with approval to operate in the Temporary Restricted Area (TRA) and a corporate jet operating without approval in the TRA, inbound to Adelaide, were identified. Any potential conflict was resolved before separation standards were breached. (3) Two in-house confidential and anonymous reports were received alleging that inadequate notice of temporary procedures was provided to controllers. Airservices is satisfied that the notice was adequate for the purpose. (4) The National Airways Contingency Coordinating Committee (NACCC) has received no direct report about this issue. (5) No such confusion was brought to the notice of the NACCC. (6) The NACCC is aware of one situation where an approved flight was operating on other than the authorised route. (7) The following air safety incidents were reported: (i) VH-LMZ (General Aviation operation). This aircraft appeared in the TRA south of Maroochydore without prior approval. (ii) THA993 (Thai International) Bangkok– Sydney. This operation was not included in the list of aircraft notified in the hand over back to normal operations. The aircraft passed into Australian airspace about two minutes before normal operations were resumed. (iii) QFA93 (Qantas) Melbourne – Los Angeles. This aircraft claimed that, while holding in Melbourne airspace awaiting slot time into the TRA, it received an onwards clearance that differed with the issued clearance. The aircraft was originally cleared to proceed via (overflying) Sydney but claimed to have received clearance to go directly to the next waypoint. The situation was resolved. (iv) VH-TJP inbound to Adelaide via the usual inbound route for traffic from Brisbane to Adelaide. Another aircraft (VH-HVM) enroute from Bankstown to Adelaide did not have approval to operate in the TRA. The two routes being flown were convergent, however two way communications were established with both aircraft approximately 70 nautical miles from Adelaide and Air Traffic Control issued traffic information and clearances that provided vertical separation. (8) While no formal safety case was required to be provided for Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) consideration, the contingency plan included safety analysis of risks and prescription of mitigators to be applied by Airservices and airline operators. The plan was vetted and oversighted",127,Questions On Notice
248,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:by Airservices’ Directorate of Safety and Environment Assurance, and external review was undertaken by CASA. (9) The incidents have been the subject of investigation by Airservices Australia and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), with the following outcomes: Incident (i) was a violation of controlled airspace, and is being dealt with in the same manner as other violations. Incident (ii) was found to be a procedural error by the NACCC. The pilot is entitled to assume that an airways clearance includes approval to operate in contiguous restricted airspace. NACCC procedures have been changed to address this error. Incident (iii): Airservices’ internal investigation found that no authorised source issued the ‘amended’ clearance. The unauthorised clearance may have been the result of pilot confusion with a company message regarding possible flight planning amendments to assist in regaining the fuel lost during its delay in obtaining a clearance. However this has not been definitely established. Incident (iv) is subject to an ongoing ATSB investigation. Aviation: Airservices Australia (Question No. 334) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: (1) During the recent industrial action at Airservices Australia, did management redesignate the airspace surrounding Australia’s busiest general aviation airports, Archerfield, Moorabbin, and Bankstown to ClassG airspace, with mandatory broadcast zone procedures implemented instead of the mandated air traffic control services; if so, (a) who made the decision to not require air traffic control services in this airspace, (b) when was the decision made and (c) was a safety case conducted before the decision was made; if not, why not; if so, will he provide a copy of the safety case. (2) Did any accidents or incidents occur during this alteration to the normal operating arrangements; if so, (a) how many, (b) where did they occur, (c) what was the nature of those incidents or accidents and (d) are investigations being conducted; if so, (i) by whom and (ii) when will a report be presented. (3) If investigations are under way, will the reports include the impact of the decision to change the normal operating procedures during the industrial action. (4) Is he confident that all due care and attention was given to aviation safety during this period by Airservices Australia’s management. Airservices has advised: (1) Yes. (a) The National Airways Contingency Coordinating Committee (NACCC). (b) 72 hours prior to the commencement of the industrial action. (c) A Safety Analysis of risks and the identification and implementation of mitigators was undertaken. This was subject to internal reviews by Airservices Australia’s Directorate of Safety and Environment Assurance, and external review by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. A safety case document was not produced. It should be noted that the operations authorised by the NACCC were based on plans developed, and analysis conducted, over more than 2 years. (2) and (3) No accident or incident reports were submitted in relation to those locations. (4) The Board and Management of Airservices Australia give primacy to safety in every aspect of their operations.

The Department first became aware of the possible detention of Mr Habib by Pakistani authorities in early October 2001. At that time, representations were made on a number of occasions to Pakistani officials in Islamabad, seeking confirmation of Mr Habib’s detention and consular access to him. Consular access was denied by Pakistan. In November 2001 the Department became aware that Mr Habib was no longer in Pakistan and that he may have been transferred to Egypt. Between November 2001 and April 2002 numerous representations were made by the Australian Embassy in Cairo to the Egyptian government, including at Prime Ministerial level, seeking confirmation of Mr Habib’s detention in Egypt and consular access to him. Egyptian authorities consistently refused to confirm Mr Habib’s detention or to grant access to him. The Australian Embassy in Islamabad continued to make representations to Pakistani officials seeking information on Mr Habib until mid-January 2002. The Department is aware of media reports that Mr Habib has written to his wife making certain allegations about his treatment in Egypt. Egyptian authorities have refused to confirm that Mr Habib was ever in their custody. In April 2002 the Department became aware that Mr Habib was in the custody of coalition forces in Afghanistan. Representations were made by our Embassy in Washington to the government of the United States of America seeking confirmation of Mr Habib’s detention and status and seeking access to him for law enforcement, intelligence and welfare purposes. On 23 April 2002, our Embassy in Washington conveyed a request made by Mr Habib’s lawyer for access to him and reiterated earlier requests for confirmation of Mr Habib’s status and access to him. On6 May 2002 the Department was advised that Mr Habib had been transferred to the US military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. An officer from the Embassy in Washington accompanied Australian law enforcement and intelligence officials on a visit to Guantanamo Bay from 13-17 May 2002, where the officer was able to meet Mr Habib and assess his welfare. The Government is aware that Mr Habib has received medical treatment for a pre-existing condition while in US detention. Detainees at Guantanamo Bay have access to medical examinations and treatment, and Australian officials have requested that camp authorities continue to monitor Mr Habib’s health closely. Australian officials have been in regular contact with United States officials on the case of Mr Habib, both in Washington and Canberra. Disclosure of more detailed information regarding these contacts could conflict with national security requirements. Issues relating to the activities of law enforcement and intelligence authorities with regard to Mr Habib fall within the portfolio responsibility of the Attorney-General. Roads: Safety (Question No. 687) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 105 (Hansard, 24 June 2002, page 3599), what financial contribution has the Australian Bicycle Council (ABC) and the Commonwealth provided to the Cycling Promotion Fund and in what form is the support.

(1) The Australian Bicycling Council (the Council) does not make financial contributions to the Cycling Promotion Fund (CPF) although it has, where appropriate, indicated its support for the activities carried out by the CPF. In particular the Council has invited Rosemary Spiedel, the President of the CPF to attend two of its meetings which has enabled both organisations to exchange information on cycling issues and identify areas of common concern. (2) The Council membership includes representatives from the Bicycle Industries Australia and Retail Cycle Traders Australia who regularly participate in supporting the Bicycling Australia Show. The issue of the Bicycling Australia Show has also been discussed at the Council meetings in the past.

(4) Yes; The safety actions and follow-up actions arising from the ATSB investigations are as follows: The Maersk Pomor, City of Burnie, Waddens and Cape Kestrel investigation reports were referred to flag States; In light of the incidents involving City of Burnie, Waddens and Cape Kestrel, a paper on lifeboat safety was submitted to the IMO, and an ATSB Safety Bulletin on lifeboat safety was distributed to the maritime industry; and Following the incident involving the collision between Star Sea Bridge and SueM in June 2000, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) pursued several initiatives with the Australian Seafood Industry Council (ASIC) aimed at improving fishing vessel safety: ATSB distributed two safety bulletins, targeting the fishing industry and masters and watchkeepers on trading ships, highlighting the risks to fishing vessels from ships, limitations of radar detection, and the requirements of the international collision regulations; and AMSA reissued a Marine Notice, Safety of Fishing Vessels, in August 2000 updating advice on good seamanship, the international collision regulations and the need to officially report incidents at sea, and conducted a focussed ship inspection campaign on merchant ships between December 2000 and March 2001 targeting bridge visibility, radar and navigation lights functionality. With regard to the Nego Kim investigation, the company changed its procedures to take account of issues raised in the ATSB’s draft report, and the recently released final report makes the following recommendations: International Safety Management manuals should include clear instructions for all operations in enclosed spaces, including the hazards of any operations and instructions regarding the wearing of appropriate clothing and protective equipment. International Safety Management manuals should provide guidance on the conditions under which work in enclosed spaces should be undertaken. The Port of Dampier draft Emergency Response Plan should be reviewed to remove ambiguities and to ensure a consistent and appropriate approach to emergency situations within the port, including clear communications. ATSB investigations are still ongoing with respect to Star Sea Bridge/Sue M, CSL Pacific, Western Muse and Tahroa Express and some may result in additional safety actions. Aviation: Air Safety (Question No. 916) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 17 September 2002: (1) Has the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making stating its intention for safety reasons to maintain the crew to passenger ratio under Safety Regulation 121A concerning the number and composition of cabin crew. (2) If so, why does CASA not require foreign airlines flying into Australia to comply with the Australian standard when it has the legal authority to require them to do so. (3) Will he permit a New Zealand airline operating in the Australian domestic market to operate with less than the CASA crew to passenger safety ratio from December 2003 when mutual recognition of respective safety rules takes effect. (1) Yes. In April 2002, CASA released Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) Number 0211OS, in which rule 121A.990 details the number and composition of cabin crew. The NPRM invited comments from industry on the proposals. The time period for comments closed on 31 August 2002. CASA is currently evaluating the comments received. (2) Australia regulates aviation consistent with international agreements to which it is a party. States party to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (‘Chicago Convention’), including Australia, are responsible for regulating most matters pertaining to operators of their nationality including the number of cabin crew. Paragraph 12.1 of PartI of Annex6 to the Chicago Convention states: ‘An operator shall establish, to the satisfaction of the State of the Operator, the minimum number of cabin crew required for each type of aeroplane… in order to effect a safe and expeditious evacuation of the aeroplane…’ Australia reinforces the obligation of foreign operators to comply with the Chicago Convention under regulation 135 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988, which provides, inter alia, that: ‘…an aircraft, which possesses the nationality of a Contracting State, shall not fly within, or depart from, Australian territory unless it complies with… the requirements of the Convention in respect of: (c) the number and description of, and the holding of licences and ratings by, the operating crew;….’ Accordingly, under current Australian law, the minimum number of cabin crew required on an aircraft is the minimum number required by the State of the Operator. CASA regulates the minimum number and composition of cabin crew on Australian aircraft under Civil Aviation Order (CAO) 20.16.3.",147,Atsic Especially The Office Of Torres Strait Islander Affairs
265,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) A Memorandum of Understanding on ‘Open Skies’, signed by the Australian and New Zealand Transport Ministers in November 2000, provides for mutual recognition of aviation related certification to be achieved by December 2003. Officials of both countries are currently working together to review the respective safety rules and procedures to ensure that, under mutual recognition, an equivalent level of safety is achieved in both Australia and New Zealand.

Family and Community Services: Child Care (Question No. 927) Ms Roxon asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 17 September 2002: (1) What are the details of the funding arrangements for child care services in Tasmania with particular focus on those services on the neighbourhood model basis for occasional care. (2) How many services or sites operate on this model. (3) Where are these services located. (4) What sum is allocated to these services and on what basis is it allocated. (5) Are there any other services in the country which receive funding on this basis. (6) How does the existing funding model work in relation to the Child Care Benefit (CCB) program, including whether parents can claim CCB. (7) Has consideration been given to moving these services to a CCB funding model. (1) Neighbourhood Model services are funded jointly by the Commonwealth and state governments. Commonwealth funding is through recurrent block grants that are administered by the state governments. In Tasmania, the Commonwealth’s recurrent block grant is currently $213 325 per annum and is indexed annually. The Tasmanian State Government’s contribution matches the Commonwealth contribution. (2) Thirteen services are currently operating on this model of funding in Tasmania.",150,Atsic Especially The Office Of Torres Strait Islander Affairs
268,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Services are located in the following towns: Bagdad, Dodges Ferry, Dover, Flinders Island, Geeveston, Queenstown, Launceston, Richmond, St Mary’s, Triabunna, Taranna, Oatlands, and Burnie. (4) Current funding levels* for services are noted below. Grants have been determined based upon the hours of operation per day, the number of days operational per week, the number of children using the service and number of weeks each service is open. Bagdad $18 035 Richmond $29 453 Dodges Ferry $21 642 Taranna $43 667 Dover $13 883 St Mary’s $13 883 Flinders Island $15 959 Tasman $38 794 Geeveston $31 607 Oatlands $34 642 Queenstown $33 820 Burnie $80 208 Launceston $22 283 TOTAL $419 027 * Note: these figures include both Commonwealth and State contributions. (5) The Commonwealth funding for neighbourhood model occasional care is determined on this basis for all centres in Australia, through a recurrent block grant to the relevant state or territory government. However, each state or territory government is responsible for administering those funds and for determining how much they will contribute. The particular funding arrangements for occasional care services may therefore differ across Australia. (6) Neighbourhood occasional care services may be eligible to become registered carers. Parents who use a registered carer are eligible to claim the minimum rate of CCB for work-related reasons. (7) No specific consideration has been given to extending full CCB to all neighbourhood model occasional care services because they are funded by state and local governments. The way child care is funded is continually monitored to determine the best way to support services. Family and Community Services: Child Care (Question No. 928) Ms Roxon asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 17 September 2002: (1) What are the details of where child care funding has been spent, by electoral division, through the Disadvantaged Area Subsidy program since the inception of the program and on a financial year basis.

(3) To apply for Long Day Care (LDC) Disadvantaged Area Subsidy (DAS) funding, community based centres must be operated and managed by a community-based organisation incorporated under the relevant state or territory legislation. To be eligible for LDC DAS funding, a community-based centre must meet the following main criteria: the centre is located in a town in a rural or remote statistical local area; and the centre must be the sole provider of centre based care in that town. LDC DAS is paid on total approved places as follows: $25.95 per place per week (from 1 July 2002) for approved child care places for children 0 to 36 months; and $17.40 per place per week (from 1 July 2002) for approved child care places for children over 36 months. All services located in rural and remote Australia and some services located on the fringe of an urban area are eligible to receive Outside School Hours Care (OSHC) DAS funding. Funding provides a two tiered level of funding for before school, after school and vacation care services that have an average of 30 children or less in care. Services with more than 30 children in care are ineligible for DAS funding. The following table outlines the total funding available (from 1 July 2002) based on utilised places for each outside school hour care component: Before School After School Vacation Care1 to 20 children $5322 $7985 $7138 21 to 30 children $2660 $3992 $3569 Before School After School Vacation Care Over 30 children $0 $0 $0 Family and Community Services: Child Care (Question No. 929) Ms Roxon asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 17 September 2002: (1) Has he received numerous representations from parents and advocacy groups about the unfairness of the allowable absences policy within the child care program; if so, why is there no flexibility within the policy for parents, particularly teachers, who have more than 30 days of annual leave each year. (2) How is the allowable absences policy monitored and enforced by Government to ensure parents are not charged for holidays and sick days. (1) Charging for days when children are booked to attend care but do not attend care is a commercial decision made by child care services. The Government does not determine the fee charging practices of child care services. However, the Government recognises that there are occasions when a child is unable to attend a service for which he or she has been booked. The absence provisions were introduced as part of this Government’s commitment to assist families with these costs. Child Care Benefit is payable providing the requirements are met for either an allowable absence day or an approved absence day. These provisions are generous and flexible and support the needs of most families. Child Care Benefit is payable for up to 30 allowable absence days for each child per financial year. These absences can be taken for any reason, including school holidays. Child Care Benefit is not payable for any allowable absences in excess of 30 days. The number of allowable absence days is limited to 30 as a reasonable balance to provide an incentive to families to use the child care services they have booked for. In addition to the payment of Child Care Benefit for 30 allowable absence days, Child Care Benefit is payable for an unlimited number of approved absence days. Approved absence days can be taken for specific reasons such as illness with a medical certificate, public holidays, court ordered contact arrangements and for parents who work rotating shifts or who have rostered days off. The definition of what constitutes a rotating shift is specific and services have this information available to them in their handbooks. Parents are encouraged to talk to services about charging arrangements in cases where they know in advance that their child will be absent from care, especially for extended periods, such as during school holidays. This would be particularly the case with teachers. Many services are able to hold a place and resell it temporarily to another family thus reducing the time that a family needs to pay for care which is not being provided. (2) How is the allowable absences policy monitored and enforced by Government to ensure parents are not charged for holidays and sick days. Child care services determine whether to charge parents when a child is absent from care. The absence provisions do not control the charging practices of services and the Government has no role in this area. Families can access information about the absence provisions through Child Care Benefit information products such as the brochure ‘Things You Need to Know About Child Care Benefit’. The Family Assistance Office can also provide information on the absence provisions. The Department of Family and Community Services provide comprehensive handbooks to child care services that give guidance on how absence provisions operate and the obligations of services. Services are also encouraged to contact their Family Assistance Office payment teams or the Department of Family and Community Services to help with any further questions that they may have.",153,Atsic Especially The Office Of Torres Strait Islander Affairs
270,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:As part of outreach to services, the Department recently published an article in its publication Child Care News about absence provisions and reminding services where they can find out further information if they need it. War Memorial (Question No. 936) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 2002: (1) Has the design of the proposed Australian War Memorial in London been scrapped. (2) What has been the cost of design work to date, by whom was the design work undertaken and how was the designer selected. (3) What instructions were given to the designer by the Government and did those instructions conflict with the design that was scrapped. (4) What was the cost of selecting the original designer and what is the expected cost of calling tenders for a new design and a new design team. (5) When was work for the memorial originally intended for completion and what is the expected date of completion now. (6) Was there any conflict between the designs to date and the views of the Public Arts Advisory Panel of Westminster City Council. (7) Does the Office of War Graves face legal action relating to the work of the original design team; if so, what is the nature of the legal claims and what expenditure has been incurred on legal advice relating to those claims. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) In re-tendering for the design of the memorial, I can confirm that the original design can not be reused. (2) Total payments already made to design team members to June 2002 total $260,380 (GST inclusive). The design team members consisted of Robert Woodward from Sydney, selected as a fountain design specialist and a Melbourne team consisting of Les Kossatz, sculptor and architects Robert Sinclair and Robert Watson. Mr Woodward was invited to participate as a design team member because of his record as a fountain designer and the Melbourne members were chosen from a limited-entry design competition. (3) A detailed and comprehensive design brief was developed in consultation with London authorities which, along with the division of responsibilities between design team members, constituted the instructions issued by the Office of Australian War Graves on behalf of the Commonwealth. As the project developed, amendments were made to the design, to meet the requirements of London authorities. In consequence, the instructions given to the design team changed to take account of those amendments. The design that was approved by London authorities was consistent with those instructions. (4) The cost of selecting the original design team members was $15,000. Each of the four design teams currently competing for the Australian War Memorial in London will be paid $50,000 provided they each meet the comprehensive terms and conditions of the design competition. These figures can not be compared directly because the original design evolved over a twelve-month period at a substantially greater cost, whereas the design of the winning competitor will be in a format ready to submit to London authorities. (5) The memorial was originally scheduled for completion prior to ANZAC Day 2003. It will now be completed prior to Remembrance Day 2003, the 85th Anniversary of the Armistice. (6) There has been no conflict over design with the Public Arts Advisory Panel of Westminster City Council. (7) No legal action has been commenced in the courts in relation to the decision not to proceed with the original design team. The legal costs incurred to date for legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor on resolving claims from the original design team are $29,510.57. International Criminal Court (Question No. 958) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 September 2002: (1) Do nominations for the positions of Prosecutor and deputy prosecutors and judges to the International Criminal Court (ICC) close on 30 November 2002; if so, is he considering Australia’s nominations. (2) Must each country vote for at least six women and men and must there be at least nine women nominated. (3) Is he able to say whether, out of the ten countries who have already submitted nominations, only Switzerland has nominated a woman. (4) Is he considering nominating outstanding Australian women for the positions of Prosecutor and deputy prosecutors and judges to the ICC; if not, why not. (1) Nominations for the positions of Judges and the Prosecutor close on 30 November 2002. It is possible that the nomination period for Judges could be extended to 8 December 2002 (see answer to question no. 2). The elections for these positions will be held at the Assembly of States Parties meeting in February 2003. The Prosecutor, once elected, will nominate candidates for Deputy Prosecutor positions, to be elected at a subsequent meeting of the Assembly. The question of whether Australia might nominate a candidate is under consideration by the Government. (2) For the election of Judges, each country must vote for at least six women and at least six men on the first ballot. However, if the number of candidates from one gender is ten or less, the minimum voting requirements would be in accordance with paragraph 3(c) of the “Resolution on the procedure for the election of the judges for the International Criminal Court”, which was adopted at the First Meeting of the Assembly of States Parties in September 2002. If, as at 30 November 2002, there are less than 10 candidates from each gender for the Judges’ positions, then the nomination period is extended until 8 December 2002. The intention is for there to be at least ten women nominated for the Judges’ positions. However, the number of women nominated for Judges’ positions will be the number so nominated at the end of the nomination period. (3) As at 9 October 2002, six nominations for the Judges’ positions had been received and processed. Of these, only the candidate nominated by Switzerland is a woman. (4) As noted in the answer to question no. 1, the question of whether Australia might nominate a candidate is under consideration by the Government. Defence: Military Involvement in Iraq (Question No. 962) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) What will be the strategic objective of any military action against the current Iraqi regime. (2) In terms of discussions he has had with US and UN officials, is the potential military action against Iraq just targeting weapons producing installations or is it about a regime change through ground forces. (3) Has he sought any legal advice on the legality under international and humanitarian law of the proposed military action against the current Iraqi regime; if so, what advice has he received on the legality of the proposed action. (4) Has he held any discussions with US or UN officials on possible unilateral or multilateral alliances on the follow-up to a change of regime in Iraq following a military strike; if so, what are the proposed actions in terms of occupation. (5) Has he held any discussions with US or UN officials regarding potential military action against Iran and North Korea; if so, what was the substance and conclusions of the discussion.",157,Atsic Especially The Office Of Torres Strait Islander Affairs

272,Mr Downer,"The following is the answer to the honourable member’s question:(1), (2) and (3) It is premature to discuss the response to any non-compliance by Iraq including the possible use of force. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 contains a process by which Iraq can be disarmed of weapons of mass destruction peacefully. Australia fully supports this process. The onus is on Iraq to comply fully and unconditionally.

East Timor: Oil and Gas Fields (Question No. 981) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) What percentage of gas and oil royalties will the Republic of East Timor receive from the Timor Sea Treaty with Australia. (2) Will he supply a map or other descriptor of the positions of the lateral boundaries of the joint oil and gas field area which are the subject of the royalties. (3) Is the Greater Sunrise Oil and Gas Field included in the Timor Sea Treaty which will be included in the revenue sharing arrangement. (4) Is a Joint Standing Committee reviewing the Timor Sea Treaty and Timor Sea Agreement; if so, what is the Government position with respect to ensuring that the widely reported 90% of revenues being promised to the Republic of East Timor will be honoured.",160,Atsic Especially The Office Of Torres Strait Islander Affairs
274,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The Timor Sea Treaty provides for Australia to have title to 10% of the petroleum resources in the Joint Petroleum Development Area established in the Timor Sea Treaty and for East Timor to have title to 90% of those resources. Under this scheme East Timor will obtain 90% of the revenue from both First Tranche Petroleum (equivalent to an ad valorem royalty) and Profit Petroleum (analogous to a resources tax). (2) A map of the JPDA is attached. A description of its boundaries is included in AnnexA of the Timor Sea Treaty which was tabled in the House on 25 June 2002. (3) Yes. Under AnnexE of the Timor Sea Treaty Australia and East Timor have agreed to unitise the Greater Sunrise field on the basis that 20.1% of the resource lies within the JPDA. Production of the resource will be distributed on the basis that 20.1% is attributed to the JPDA – and thus subject to the revenue provisions of the Treaty– and 79.9% is attributed to Australia. (4) Yes. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has held hearings into the Timor Sea Treaty and a related Exchange of Notes of treaty status. East Timor’s share of the total revenues from petroleum activities in the JPDA will not, however, necessarily be exactly 90%. This is principally because, in addition to the royalties described under (1), each country will also apply its own income tax regime to its share of profits from petroleum activities. As a result, their actual shares of income tax will depend on their respective tax rates. If East Timor’s rate is higher than Australia’s, as is currently the case, its share of income taxes will be higher than 90%; if lower, it will be less than 90%, with a corresponding effect on their overall revenues. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Question No. 982) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) Further to the answer to parts (2) and (3) of question No. 881 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6816), to whom does (a) ABC Programming and (b) ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs reports in terms of governance of the ABC Board of Directors. (2) Who has ultimate power over the management of the decision making of ABC Programming and ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs. (3) Is the corporate governance of both ABC Programming and ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs in effect the same Board of Directors of the ABC; if not, why not. (4) Is it correct that the independence of the ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs from ABC Programming is compromised because the corporate heart and mind in terms of the governance of the ABC Board of Directors is one-and-the-same corporate personality; if not, why not. (5) Is the self-regulation of audience and programming standards by the ABC an anathema to true political accountability. (6) Are censorship and broadcasting standards now being directly administered by the ABC itself and demonstrates a classic conflict of interest against the public interest, denying the community any effective input into the standards of what is displayed on the ABC; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) to-(2) ABC programming areas, as well as Audience and Consumer Affairs, are accountable through the Managing Director to the ABC Board. It is the role of the Board to ensure the Corporation develops codes of practice relating to programming matters, to formulate policies and to monitor compliance with those policies and standards. It is the role of the Managing Director to act in accordance with Board policies in managing the activities of the Corporation. (3) Yes, as stated above, the ABC Programming areas and the Audience and Consumer Affairs unit are part of the Corporation and, like all parts of the Corporation, are accountable through the Managing Director to the ABC Board. (4) No, it is not correct to claim that the independence of the Audience and Consumer Affairs is compromised. The complaints handling process of the ABC includes aspects that are both internal and external to the Corporation. The ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs unit forms one part of the Corporation’s overall framework of quality review, complaints management and independent complaints review. A priority for the ABC has been to improve the rigour and timeliness of its handling of complaints. Audience and Consumer Affairs provide a Corporation-wide perspective on complaints, internally independent of ABC programming areas. Complainants who are not satisfied may still refer matters to the ABC’s Independent Complaints Review Panel and/or the government regulator, the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Both these forms of review are external and entirely independent of the ABC. (5) The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 provides for the editorial and administrative independence of the Corporation, thereby investing the ABC Board with particular responsibilities in relation to programming standards. Moreover the ABC is subject to close and ongoing scrutiny by the Parliament and through processes established by the Parliament. These processes require from the ABC a full, transparent account of performance, particularly in relation to the functions, powers, duties, privileges and resources approved by Parliament. Amongst other things, this requires disclosure to Parliament of the way in which the ABC exercises its independence and the initiatives that it takes to maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation, and fulfil its Charter and other obligations. (6) There has been no recent change in the way the ABC administers censorship and broadcasting standards. The ABC Board has a Code of Practice that outlines a range of program standards against which the ABC can be judged publicly. The Code of Practice has been provided formally to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which is able to investigate complaints that the ABC has not complied with the Code. ABC staff are also bound by comprehensive Editorial Policies in re-",161,Atsic Especially The Office Of Torres Strait Islander Affairs
275,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Artslation to programming standards, in accordance with the requirements set out in the ABC Act and ABC Charter. Insofar as censorship is concerned, the ABC’s Code of Practice applies the system of television program classification set out in the Guidelines for the Classification of Film and Video Tapes, which are issued by the Office of Film& Literature Classification. Communications: Media Ownership (Question No. 983) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) Further to the answer to part (2) of question No. 833 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6808), what will be the impact of media ownership in Australia in regional centres like Adelaide and Hobart on freedom of speech and democracy in a situation of monopolistic control of any two or more media outlets. (2) How will the proposed new cross media ownership laws benefit freedom of speech and democratic views being expressed in an environment where most media will be controlled by one media mogul in a particular geographic area. (3) Will the proposed cross media ownership changes result in enhancement of democracy and freedom of speech. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Bill retains existing safeguards for diversity of services, particularly in regional areas, and introduces new requirements for editorial independence. These safeguards include: In regional areas, cross-media ownership will be limited to two of the three types of media covered by the laws (that is, television, radio and newspapers) To be eligible for a cross-media exemption certificate, applicants must satisfy the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) that separate editorial decision-making responsibilities will be maintained for media organisations operating under the exemption certificate Media organisations subject to the exemption will be required to disclose a cross-media relationship in certain circumstances Limitations on the control of commercial television and radio broadcasting licence will continue to apply. These restrictions limit the number of licences a person may control in a single licence area (two radio licences; or subject only to subsections 38A and 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 dealing with single and two station markets, one commercial television licence in each licence area). The restrictions also prohibit a person from exercising control of commercial television broadcasting licences whose combined licence area population exceeds 75% of the population of Australia. (2) and (3) See answer to part (1). Approximately 90% of Australians reside in areas able to receive three separately owned commercial television stations, plus the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Most people in living in remote Australia are able to receive two commercial television stations (via satellite or terrestrial retransmission) plus the ABC and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). Therefore, when taken together with the regulatory restrictions outlined in the response to question one, the provisions of the Bill provide adequate protection for diversity of media throughout Australia. The Government is committed to reforming Australia’s cross-media ownership and foreign ownership laws in a manner that will both encourage competition and ensure that a diversity of opinion and information is maintained. Without reform, the current media ownership laws will limit the Australian media sector to an outdated structure with little or no capacity for new players, improved competition, or the ability to respond to a rapidly evolving and converging international environment.",163,Timor Sea Treaty Joint Petroleum Development Area

Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) (i) Environmental Site Assessment (May 2002) IT Environmental. Additional Environmental Investigations and Occupational Health and Safety Audit (August 2002) – IT Environmental. Lead has been detected in some soil samples. The lead contaminated soil will be removed and disposed of into a licensed landfill through remediation works due to commence shortly. Some Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon contamination was present in the groundwater. Further groundwater monitoring was recommended. Hazardous Building Materials Audit (February 2002) Kilpatrick and Associates Pty Ltd. Asbestos, synthetic mineral fibres and polychlorinated biphenyl oils were detected. The report recommends that removal of the substances found if demolition or works were conducted. (ii) Flora and Fauna assessment (December 2001) Brett Lane& Associates. The flora found was largely exotic. Seven indigenous vascular plant species were recorded, one of regional significance. No indigenous vegetation communities remain on the site. The report recommends retention of indigenous tree species. A number of trees at the former entrance and driveway to Mornington Park on Camp Road are in the Hume City Council’s Heritage Overlay. Fauna habitats are entirely artificial and support limited native fauna being mostly birds characteristic of farmland and urban areas. (iii) Built Heritage Appraisal of Selected Buildings (July 2002) HLA Envirosciences. The report states that the site meets two criteria for significance – A4 (through associations with the site, rather than by virtue of physical evidence) and H (through association with 1st Australian Imperial Force and in particular, Leslie Maygar VC). As a group, the buildings at Maygar were said to meet criterion D2 by representing the principal characteristics of World War II warehouses and associated buildings. However, it was stated that they are not unique, as there are numerous sites of this nature across Australia. As such the level of significance is assessed at ‘Regional’. Maygar Barracks is not listed on the Register of National Estate, nor on the Victorian Heritage Inventory. Cultural Heritage Values (January 2002) – TerraCulture Pty Ltd The report concludes that areas of the barracks adjacent to the Merlynston Creek are likely to contain Aboriginal archaeological material. With regard to European heritage, there were no archaeological sites or features relating to the former rural use of the land and current military use of the barracks. (b) (i) Contaminated Land Assessment (May 2002) – Parsons Brinckerhoff. Investigations have identified surface contamination of expended ammunition. A number of localised waste disposal sites have also been identified on the site. These areas require further assessment and will be remediated prior to any future use of a more sensitive nature. Hazardous Materials Assessment (March 2002) Parsons Brinckerhoff. A large number of the magazine buildings located on the site were constructed using various types of asbestos. Depending on the final end use for the site, these buildings and the asbestos materials should be removed in order to minimise the ongoing liability with respect to the upkeep and maintenance of the buildings. Explosive Ordinance Report (March 2002) Enterra Pty Ltd. Explosive Ordinance burn residue and components from small explosive ordnance has been found on site and will require remediation. Remediation options are presently being investigated. (ii) Flora and Fauna Survey (January 2002) Brett Lane& Associates Pty Ltd. The native flora and fauna of the site are highly degraded due to the history of use at the site and the current vigorous weed invasion. Small populations of common reptiles are likely to exist in the areas of remnant native grassland and rocky granite slopes. The tussock grassland along the Yuroke Creek drainage line, the adjacent escarpment areas and the stone walls are other habitats that may support native fauna and could be considered of at least local significance for flora and fauna. The remnant native vegetation communities have regionally significant species, and these are recommended for inclusion in the open space and managed for conservation purposes. Nine flora species of regional conservation significance have been identified. It is important to note that all remnant areas occur within the catchment area for the Greenvale Reservoir, which is the more constrained portion of the site for urban development and will be reserved as a non-access area for water catchment. The north-eastern section of the site is free of flora and fauna constraints for urban development. (iii) Cultural Heritage Assessment (February 2002) Tardis Enterprises. The report identified the Yuroke Creek Valley and escarpment and an area within the Greenvale Reservoir catchment as being of low to moderate potential for Aboriginal archaeological sites. Heritage Assessment (January 2002) Heritage Alliance. The report concludes that the site, in particular the munitions magazines and explosive stores are of historical importance. The site appears to meet the threshold for listing on the Register of the National Estate. Prime Minister and Cabinet: Consultancies (Question No. 1004)",165,Appea Limited Marine Protected Areas

Information prior to 1999 is not readily available because it was stored on the Department’s previous financial system. It can be extracted by a manual search of paper records but this would be time consuming and entail significant administrative effort. The profile of payments for prior years is unlikely to vary significantly from that for the period 1999 to 2002.",188,Kesab Waterwatch

Communications: Media Ownership (Question No. 1033) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 21 October 2002: (1) Further to the Minister’s replies to questions No. 673 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 7073), No, 674 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 7073), No. 675 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 7074), No. 676 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 7074) and No. 833 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 7078) is the Minister aware that the Member for Calare, when speaking in the House on 26 September 2002 on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002, declared that, when he worked for Channel 9, Mr Kerry Packer exerted a direct and at times hands-on influence on the content of news bulletins, particularly at politically sensitive times which were almost invariably sensitive to conservative political interests. (2) Did the Minister also see where the Member for Calare further declared that he could remember several occasions when Mr Packer exercised a direct influence over editorial policy and that it would be a nonsense to suggest that that sort of influence would not be exerted across a stable of media interests. (3) Did the Minister also see where the Member for Calare further declared that, when he joined Channel8 Orange, it was only after this station was subsumed into the Prime Network that management interference from head office in Sydney became a common feature in both editorial and the production components. (4) Did the Minister also see where the Member for Calare further declared that, in relation to the envisaged role of the Australian Broadcasting Authority under the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002, there is no way unless there is a forensic license renewal hearing process, that editorial processes which would arise from a relaxation of cross-media ownership in regional towns could be traced. (5) Is the Minister also aware that, when speaking in the House on the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 (Hansard, 3 June 1998, page 4565) the Member for Calare responded to an interjection by the Member for North Sydney concerning his comments about politicians being preoccupied with trying to serve the best interests of powerful media barons. (6) Is the Minister aware that the Member for Calare, through the Chair, advised the Member for North Sydney and the House that he had been rung by Mr Packer during a news broadcast, questioning the line-up of his bulletin and further stating that this still goes on. (7) How does the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 stop powerful media owners interfering with the news and information broadcasted and published and which affects the way the people of Australia think and vote. (8) Will the Minister abandon the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) to (6) The Minister is aware of the Member for Calare’s statements as recorded in Hansard. (7) The Bill empowers the ABA to grant ‘exemption certificates’ to applicants seeking to acquire media organisations that would otherwise represent a breach of the cross-media rules. Exemptions will be subject to applicants continuously meeting requirements to maintain separate editorial de-",195,Total 100 Total All Payments 61 597

Meeting the objective of editorial separation will also become a condition of licence for media organisations subject to the certificate. The Bill also imposes a general obligation to disclose a cross-media relationship on media outlets subject to the same exemption certificate. Newspapers and commercial television broadcasters subject to a cross-media exemption certificate will be required to disclose a cross-media relationship when reporting on the business affairs of a media organisations covered by the same certificate. Commercial radio broadcasters will also have the option of a regular disclosure model that will require them to adequately bring a cross-media relationship to the attention of the regular prime-time audience.
