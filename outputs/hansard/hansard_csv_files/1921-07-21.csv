I am now able to furnish [419] [21 JULY , 1921.] Milk. , 10423. the honourable member with the following information : -' The institution of a second shift at the Government Woollen Mills, North Geelong, is impracticable, for the reason that the looms are operated by female labour, which is not available for other than a day shift. The honourable member said, "" Last year some 40,000 yards of tweed were supplied from the mills,"" and I wish to correct the erroneous impression which this statement is likely to make. Up to thc 30th June, 1921, the mills supplied tweed to the Keturned Soldiers League at the rate of 40,000 yards per month. As from the 1st July last, the quantity which the mill has undertaken to supply is 14i.000 yards per month. It is hoped that it will be found practicable to issue from 15,000 to 20,000 yards per month, but the Department accepts noobligation beyond 14,000 yards por month.

MrM c WILLIAMS ( F r a n k l in) [3.17]. I do not intend to deal to-day with the administration of the War Service Homes Department. It would be ridiculous for the Committee to attempt on the eve of an adjournment of the Housef o r some weeks to deal 'with what is, perhaps, the biggest question before the people of Australiaat the present time. The state-. ment made yesterday by the Minister( Mr Rodgers) showed careful preparation, and it would be quite impossible at this stage to analyze the -figures submitted by him to the Committee. Speaking entirely for myself, I prefer to discuss the administration of the War Service Homes Department after the period of immunity from attack granted by the Country party to the Government has passed, so that we shall be free to deal with it on its merits. tration of the War Service Homes Department is concerned, I personally claim no immunity, and have not asked for it . MrM c WILLIAMS T h a t is so; but the honourable gentleman is aware that the Country party, rightly or wrongly, agreed to grant the Government i m munity from attack for a certain period-. I intend to honour that agreement in letter and in spirit. In a political experience extending over nearly a quarter of a century, this is the first time that I 1921-22. have granted immunity to a Government, and it will be the last. It was the promise of immunity given by this party that tied our hands last night. I do not think any honourable member w ill accuse me of lack of fairness and candour, and I say, therefore, that the amendment want of confidence in the Government. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will himself admit that when a proviso is sought to be added to a Supply mor it must be accepted as a challenge. the honourable member admit that the subject-matter of the amendment was.

45,Mr Ryan,"If I admit so much, w i l lrepresent Australia, it would be blackfellow's politics to tomahawk him. cannot be accused of undue sympathy with or liking for the right honourable gentleman, but, having agreed tp the giving of this pledge, I am bound to keep it. I wish to draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to a matter which has interested me for a considerable time -the scandal of permitting the firm of Henry Jones and Company to be the agents at Hobart of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. It is the policy of the Government to which effect has been' given everywhere else that no agent for the Conference lines of steamers should be an agent for the Commonwealth Line. Por years past the firm I have mentioned has practically monopolized the shipping space on the steamers carrying f r u it from Tasmania to England, and recently the manager of a co-operative company that has been started complained that Sir Henry Jones, the largest shipper of f r u it from Tasmania, was Chairman of the Overseas Shipping Committee, which regulated space during the war, and is also agent for the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. If one is not satisfied with the results of an interview with him as the Chairman of the Overseas Committee, he is referred to the agent for the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and meets the same man again. This has placed a terrible shackle on the co-operative company, which, notwithstanding, has succeeded so far. I recognise the assistance which the Treasurer has given to the enterprise. The monopolists had reduced the price of small f r u it below what it cost for picking, when the co-operative company offered 3d. per l b . , which was more than twice as much as had been previously offered, and saved the industry. operative company is in the proud position of being able to repay the Treasurer the assistance that he so generously advanced to it . I do not ask t h a t ' the agency of the Commonwealth Lino of steamers be given to any other individual, firm, or co-operative society; but I ask that it be placed in the hands of the Tasmanian Government, which has a line of steamers of its own. If this be done, all shipperswill be treated alike. This is a matter of great importance to men who have only their orchards to rely on for their living. The attempt to break down [419]2 the monopoly which has existed is, I am I glad to say, succeeding to some extent, and it is not too much to ask the Government to remove a serious obstacle to its further advance. We merely ask that 'those who p u t their produce into this co-operative concern shall not have to go cap in hand to a rival exporter to obtain space for the f r u it which they wish to ship to England. The Sea Carriage of Goods Committee inquired into this matter. It was composed of four Nationalists, two members of the Labour party, and myself, and, though it differed on many points, it unanimously recommended thab the agency of the Commonwealth Line of Steamersi n Hobart should be transferred to the Tasmanian Government. presentatives support the Government, they should be able to bring pressure to bear on it . MrM c WILLIAMS I think that a l l that is needed is just a plain, straightforward statement of the case. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to attend to this matter at once. The manager of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers gave the Committee to understand that he was strongly in favour of what I suggest being done, and he told me that it would be done before the f r u it season commenced. Thatf r u it season has now passed, and another is _ about to commence. It is not right that the chief exporter of f r u it from Tasmania should be able to say what space other exporters may use. Every grower, every dealer, and every exporter should start from scratch, and be treated alike in the matter of space. There is always a shortage of space, and last year we were not able to secure space for more than oneNow, after five months, the cothird of the f r u it that we could have exported. This leads to a l l sorts of fraudulent arrangements. A man who wishes to export 1,000 cases will get the t'p that he will be allotted only one-third of the space for which he asks, and that, therefore, he should apply for space for 3,000 cases. The Ministerf or the Navy( Mr Laird Smith) knows all about these matters, and I am sure that in private conversation with the Acting PrimeM in ister he will g've him more information on the subject, if he needs it . I wish to have the matter dealt with before tha",28,Settlement In Tion Agaiust The Will Of The Governmenb
46,Mr Gabb,"As all the Tasmanian renegotiations connected with, the new season's operations commence. willing to move the adjournment of the House to have the subject discussed, and therefore I have taken this opportunity to deal with it. The present arrangement is a positive scandal, and the Government should appoint an independent agent. In ""my view, the recommendation of the Committee that the agency be transferred to the Tasmanian Government should be given effect. are one or two matters to which I desire to draw attention. Under the Navigation Act, which is to come into operation on the 1st October, every vessel carrying twelve or more passengers must he equipped with wireless, a necessary provision. But recently the owner of a private yacht, who desired to travel round the coast, wished to install wireless, in order that he might keep in touch with the land, and he was told that, if he did, it would be necessary for him to carry a first class wireless operator. My view is 'that if any one desires to install wireless tended. I refer to the installation of on, a vessel carrying less than twelve passengers, or on a private yacht, no '.obstacle should he put in his way. I would like the Department concerned .to consider this matter. Recently the rates chargeable upon Inter-State telegrams were raised to a minimum of. Is. 4d. .to-day in respect of the supply of change . when payment is made for these messages. Seeing that the public are charged Is. 4d. minimum for a telegram of sixteen words, .care is taken in almost every instance to send the whole of the sixteen words, in order to get f u l l value for the money spent. messages were made Id. per word, the minimum being Is., there would be considerable saving in staff, at any rate. . A senior officer in the Postmaster-General's Department has informed me that he could handle the central ofiice traffic with half his present staff owing to the relief which would be afforded in giving change. statement! it could be borne out. I have personally -observed the conditions in the Sydney office. I have seen a customer hand over I was una florin in payment for a Is. 4d. message. The attendant has had to draw from three different portions of the till in order to get change. With that kind of thing repeated all day long and every day a vast amount of time is wasted. was made on State telegrams a similar amount was added to Inter-State messages. In another place, however, an honourable senator suggested that if the minimum were made. Is. 4d. the public mind would be relieved of confusion, since it would be perceived that the rate was equivalent to Id. per word. As the proposal involved an increase of revenue the Government did not oppose it, and it was agreed to. able savings could be effected if a minimum of Is. were adopted, the rate being Id. per word. One successful innovation has been made in the Postmaster-General's Department which I would like to see exadding machines in receiving offices. These machines have relieved counter attendants from the old procedure of tearing off stamps and placing them on telegrams. However, more machines of the kind should be installed. Every telegram is now put into a machine, and the cost of the message stamped upon it, and Confusion exists the number of words added. Theni t is sent up to the operating room for despatch. In that branch, at the Sydney General Post Office, there are ten clerks employed to do nothing but check the adding of the wordsa work which could be done by the installation of one machine. While expense and much labour If the charge for Inter-State have been curtailed in the receiving offices, there are still those ten clerks in the operating-room. Eveni f the machine cost £400 it would more than pay for it self within six months. I desire to refer briefly to the duplication of work between the PostmasterGeheral's Department and the Department of Works and Railways. In the former there are as good engineers as in any branch of the Commonwealth Public Service. I know one man who has served the Department as an engineer for thirty-eight years.

That amendment, it w ill be recalled, had for its object the granting of assistance, by the Commonwealth Government in respect of the continuation of the Wheat Pool system, and it included the suggestion that the Government should enter into negotiations w it h the different States. It is a lamentable state of affairs that, because the Prime Minister happens to be away from Australia, the Government of which he is the head must be considered free to do exactly what they like without any fear of being turned out of office, or, indeed, of censure. I know of no similar circumstance in the history of Australia, or of any part of the Empire. It is, in my opinion, quite unconstitutional, and it is certainly contrary to the desires of the large majority of the people of Australia. A state of affairs whereby the Government may do as they like, or omit' to do what they like, u n t i l the re* t u r n of the Prime Minister, is one deserving of condemnation; and I trust that there will never be a repetition of it in this Parliament. Prior to the departure forth of the Prime Minister, a declaration was made in this chamber by the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), tliat he was not going to be bluffed, .JThe honourable carried out for 10s. in one member took a. stand which now turns TheVe is room to cut down exout to have been make-believe. He was merely a lath painted to look like iron, The unpalatable truth is that the Primd Minister had a definite understanding with the Country party that that party I would do nothing in the nature of censuring his Government, or anything, indeed, which could possibly lead to their removal from office during his absence. The Leader of the Country party would have the people of the Commonwealth believe that he was not going to be bluffed by the Prime Minister; that he was not going to make any arrangement; and that, in fact, I have put the facts bethere was no arrangement. B ut honourable members have now heard a definite statement by a member of the Countryp a r t y I refer to the honourable member for Franklin-that , on account of an arrangement which was made with the Prime Minister, he cast his vote last night The honourable member frankly in a direction different from that which, otherwise, it would have taken. There can be no doubt now that an arrangement was made whereby, during the absence of the Prime Minister, nothing waste be done to interfere with the Government. No matter how deeply the welfare)of the people might be involved, the Government were to remain and retainoffice. for Cowper and the honourable member for Franklin must both be right. with the practice of the Country party that, when the Government find themselves in danger, some members in the Corner are to vote one way and the remainder in the opposite direction. Something of that nature would appear to have been decided upon in order to insure that the Government should be in no danger.",30,Settlement In Tion Agaiust The Will Of The Governmenb

I desire to draw public attention to the existing state of affairs, which becomes the more reprehensible when one examines the nature of the Imperial Conference and the means by which it was .brought about. Jbers discussed this matter originally, the undoubted impression in their minds was -that the Imperial Government had, of their own volition, decided upon a Conference, and had cabled urging the attendance of Dominion representatives in -London. That impression was permitted to remain until the Prime Minister was making his final remarks in reply to a -certain amendment which I had moved. Then, on the eve of his departure, the ""House was informed that the Prime Minister of Australia was the individual who 'had asked for the Conference, that the British Government had not suggested it at all, but that the Commonwealth Prime .Minister had cabled London in October last urging that a Conference should be called since he considered that such a ^gathering was very necessary. member think the right honourable gentle.xnan should be given credit for his suggestion ? ister credit for doing things according to his own sweet will when they suit his own .sweet purposes. .

Moreover, to make believe that something is being, and is to be, done, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has suggested that the Pacific Conference should be held in London, although public opinion is emphatically against him in that regard. Without doubt, the'Prime Minister asked that the Imperial Conference should be' convened, and then he manipulated one of the parties in this Parliament in order to secure immunity for his Government during his absence. Possibly the right honourable gentleman may be able to manipulate the Country party again so as to achieve further immunity. This observation reminds me of a cablegram read by the Acting Prime Minister in this House yesterday from the Prime Minister in London.

The cablegram from the Prime Minister is entirely out of accord with the speech made by him in this House before he l e ft for London. He said in his cablegram, in reply to the Acting Prime Minister's secret despatchI stated in most definite and unambiguous terms in Parliament that the Commonwealth would not be committed to any scheme of naval or foreign policy or involved in any expenditure by any act of mine, but that all (after explanation by me and full discussion by the Legislature) should be subject to the ratification of Parliament. Although we have not seen the Acting Prime Minister's cablegram to the Prime Minister containing the suggestions made from this end, we have the Prime Minister's speech in this House. He said in his cablegram that any scheme of naval or foreign policy, or any expenditure, will be subject to the ratification of this Parliament. Ths is what he said in Parlia,ment about the continuance of the AngloJapanese TreatyLong before the Australian people could approve .or disapprove, the Treaty will be renewed I have not done so. or else allowed to lapse.

But the practical conse^ quences will remain, and Australia will have to face them. That is an entirely different statement from that in the cablegram to the effect that anything he does at the Conference will be subject to ratification by this Parliament.

76,Mr Ryan',"We have from the Primedaily last:London, Friday. The Australian Press Association is authoritatively assured that, when reviewing the Conference dispassionately in retrospect, one realizes tliat it undesignedly but inevitably fell into three divisions. hostile, but were mutually helpful, even when apparently antagonistic. The first division included the British Ministers, who adopted a receptive rather than a prescriptive attitude. They were anxious to learn the views of the Dominions rather than to impose their own. Nevertheless they were insistent on requiring the renewal of the Treaty, and persistent in representing their inis accurate with respect to the views of ability any"" longer to bear the whole burden of the defence of the Empire, in which all the Dominions must share in the future. The second division was comprised of Mr Canada and. South Africa were entirely Meighen and General Smuts. The former differed from tlio British Ministers regarding both the Treaty and defence, hut was predisposed to support the Treaty. In the third division were Mr Hughes and Mr Massey. The former approved of thc Treaty provided it was rendered inoffensive to the United States. Mr Massey whole-heartedly supported the renewal. Both Mr Hughes and Mr Massey regarded naval defence as a matter of life and death to Australia and New Zealand. . Mr Meighen's reasons for opposing a renewal of the Japanese Treaty were threefold. First, the conditions which necessitated the Treaty in 1911 did not now exist. Second, the renewal would be regarded with disfavour by the United States. Third, the formation of sueh alliances was antagonistic to the spirit of post-war times. v Failing to secure a denunciation, ' Mr really echoes of Downing-street. They Meighen would propose an insertion of thc clause exempting Canada until the Dominion Parliament approved. . General Smuts concurred in the principles of Mr Meighen's arguments, but if assured it was Imperially necessary he would support a renewal of the Treaty. Mr Meighen also opposed the Conference dealing with Naval Defence, and pointed out that the Canadian Government and Parliament refused to deal with Admiral Jellicoe's report two sessions ago, because naval defence involved questions of foreign policy and constitutional control affecting Admiralty authority on the one hand and Dominion authority on the other. . He advocated that they should suspend action until thc Conference decided to precise mechanism, under which the Dominions could give effect to their views on foreign affairs. General Smuts arrived at a similar conclusion by'a different line of reasoning, and emphatically opposed any new defence commitments as a contravention of the spirit of the League of Nations.

I have no reason to doubtand I am sure no one else has-that it Downing-street and the PrimeMinisters of Canada and South Africa. It is quite clear to me that the Prime Ministers of in. favour of the Disarmament Conference that is proposed to be held in Washington; and, in regard to defence, General Smuts said that he was emphatically opposed to any new defence commitments, because they would be a contravention of the spirit of the League of Nations. .His attitude is diametrically opposed to the attitude"" of the Prime Minister of Ausr tralia. Fortunately, the decision does not rest with the Prime Minister of Australia; but the only conclusion to which we can come after reading that summary is-and it is a corroboration of a view I have held for some time-that the Prime Minister and his Government are advocate whatever Downing-street wants. regard to conscription. that newspaper summary one finds the Prime Minister advocating just what the British Government want, quite irrespective of the requirements of Australia.

115,Mr Bell (Darling) [4.15],"There istherefore, honourable members must curtail their remarks. I shall not refer now to the War Service Homes administration, because I hope to have an opportunity to do that later in the evening. At present, I desire only-to call attention to the great necessity for postal and telephone facilities in the outlying portions of the Commonwealth. It will be remembered that last year the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) gave an assurance that, so far as post-offices were concerned, there would be no reduction of the Estimates. That assurance was appreciated and approved by honourable members on both sides of the House. I fully, realize the necessity for a close scrutiny of the Estimates of every Department, and the Treasurer has told us that it will be necessary to use the pruning knife. I hope, however, that the policy announced last year with regard to post-offices will be carried out, despite the fact that the pruning knife may be necessary in regard to public expenditure generally. The Post Office provides facilities that are absolutely necessary, especially in the outlying districts. I commend the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) for his administration in the past; he has done work that has been commended by honourable members and the country generally, and there is very little to complain of. Now that we are assured that telephone material is coming to hand, we may look for some extension of lines. But the main point I wish to emphasize is that a one day-a-week mail is of very little use in the country districts far removed from towns and the more populous centres. The business done at the existing post offices in these districts affords a very poor indication of the correspondence received and despatched. know, where there is a one-day-a-week mail service, the people are compelled to use other means of transport for their letters, only a small percentage of which pass through the post-offices. I have pointed out to the people concerned, that if they supply their own facilities they will not get the improved facilities they deserve, but they find the one-day-a-week mail absolutely insufficient, and have to use traders' carts and any other means . available for transit. Help in this direction is given by the traders and business people from neighbouring towns; and my contention is that, if any place warrants the post-office, there should be.at least a tri-weekly mail. We may assume, I think, that with telephone material available many proposed iines that have been held up will now be constructed. H> should be realized that when a telephone line is carried into an outlying district^ it does not benefit only the peoplo-H-vmg in the immediate neighbourhood. There is no doubt that these pioneers in the back country are doing, perhaps, a greater service to the Commonwealth than any done by Tiny other section of the community, and they deserve every consideration that can be extended to them. But, as I say, it must not be concluded that they, and' they only, benefit by. the telephone extension ; every business man in the neighbouring towns, every one, indeed, connected with the telephone, benefits equally.. We should remember that it is not only the individual but the general community that benefits by the granting of improvedi telephone and telegraph facilities. Again, with regard to telephone services in the. outlying districts, I would urge the necessity of extending the hours so that town, residents may be able to communicate' by telephone with farming districts be-tween 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. I brought, this matter before the Postmaster-General some months ago, and the reply that he gave me was that the business transacted in the district offices to which I specifically referred would not warrant the suggested extension. I pointed out then, and I repeat the statement now, that between 6 and 8 o'clock every evening there would be more telephone business than at any other time of the day. Farmers and other people in country districts work long hours. Many of them are out in the fields during the day, but in the evening town residents would be sure of In districts which I getting into communication with them. The extension of hours for which I ask would be a boon to country districts, and the additional business would be much greater than the Postal authorities anticipate. very fully inquired into all over Australia. My own experience impresses me with the force of the honourable member's, contention. honourable gentleman's assurance. I desire now to draw his attention to what is being done in the small town of Somerset, on the north-west coast of Tasmania. It has been arranged that the postmistress^",36,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable
116,Mr Wise,I am having that matter,37,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable
117,Mr Bell,"I am pleased with thethere shall be on duty for exchange work between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., but while private subscribers may thus get into telephone communication with other towns during those hours, the post-office is not open for the transaction of general business. Tbe postmistress receives £6 per annum, or, approximately, Sid. per hour, for working these two additional hours per day. In all probability the business transacted would not warrant the Department paying what might"" be considered an adequate payment for the work performed, but where officials are called upon to be in attendance during extra hours, they should receive a reasonable reward. If the post-office at Somerset were open for the transaction of general business during these hours, the additional revenue that would be forthcoming would enable the Department to pay this lady a considerable increase. I ask the Postmaster-General to consider the wisdom of allowing general' postal and telegraphic business to be transacted during the extra hours in respect of whicli postal officials have to be in attendance for telephone purposes. I regret that I have to bring, forward at this stage what are relatively minor matters, but they are of considerable importance to the people of my constituency. I also draw attention to the overloading of the main trunk telephone line between Burnie and Launceston. We have recently had the assurance that other main trunk telephone lines within the Commonwealth are to be duplicated. The necessary material is now at hand, and I would Strongly urge the Postmaster General to duplicate the line between Burnie and Launceston, since, under present conditions, people have to wait sometimes from three hours to six hours in order to make a call. I trust that the Treasurer will not feel called upon to curtail the estimates of the Postmaster General's Department. To whatever extent he may find it necessary to use the pruning knife on the estimates of other Departments, I hope he will not cut down the vote for the Postal Department, since it provides one of the most important services of the Commonwealth. Improvements in means of communication and transit are of the utmost importance if we are to develop this Commonwealth and give those who live out-back the facilities to which they are entitled. Mr Bel/'. I draw the attention of the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to the doings of an unmitigated scoundrel who is preying upon old-age pensioners. I refer to the notorious criminal Paddy Hill, who organized a conspiracy to which the Reverend J. B. Ronald fell a victim. The Reverend Mr Ronald secured for this scoundrel a pension. In return, the man organized a conspiracy against him in the Harper case, and for y engaging in that conspiracy or committing' perjury, all the witnesses in the case with two exceptions had to "" serve time."". PaddyH ill ako had to "" serve time."" I find that this unmitigated scoundrel is preying upon old-age pensioners, and,I hope that action will be taken to punish this man. An old lady while going to Mass at 6 o'clock one morning was stopped by Hill. She says that he was very courteous and was well-dressedconfidence men generally are. He told her in the course of conversation that he' was in great difficulties, and that if he could only obtain a loan of £30 he would, be able to buy bags for his wheat in the Mallee.

He induced her to lend him £30, for which he gave her a promissory note, which was payable in April last. She still holds the note, but has been unable to obtain payment.

118,'Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [4.28],"I am glad that the Deputy Speaker is present, because I desire now to refer to the case of a l if t attendant named Denholm, who until recently was employed in this building. Denholm was a temporary employee here for ten years, but by some misapplication of justice his appointment was not made permanent. to understand why he was not permanently appointed to the Service. We all found him active, earnest, intelligent, and polite. during the pneumonic influenza scare, he was ordered to be inoculated. He at first, under advice, refused, but Dr. Stephens, who examined h i m and for whom I have great respect, told h i m that he need not fear any ill result. He then submitted to inoculation. The serum had a bad effect upon h i m , however, and Dr. Stephens refrained from ino.culating him a second time. properly recovered the use of the arm in which the serum was injected, w i th the result that since his unjust dismissal from the service of the Joint House Committee, he has not been able to obtain a position. that lad, and put h i m in some other position if the authorities w ill not restore h i m to his old job. able member for Oxley( Mr Bayley), in words worthy of Shakespeare, put his case in a nut-shell when he said, "" This young man has been unjustly dismissed, and justice shrieks to the skies."" Questions were addressed to the Deputy Speaker( Mr Chanter) on the subject, and later on the honourable gentleman read a statment supplied to h i m by the President of the Senate (Senator Givens) setting out that Denholm's services were terminated in accordance witl i the requirements of the Public Service Act, to which the attention of the head of the Joint House Committee had been called by the Auditor-General. Mr Israel, the Auditor-General, in the course of sworn evidence given before the Select Committee of the Senate, has denied that statement. Kooyong, who, like the rest of ns, has taken an interest in this case, sent . to Denholm a statement obtained, I think, by Mr Deputy Speaker from Senator Givens, to the effect that Mr Israel had refused to sanction the payment of any' further funds to that lad. The Auditor General, on oath, says that he did not refuse to sanction these payments, and that there was no foundation for the statement. ""*"""" mother, for whom I have a great regard, has written to me about the case.

My remarks shall be concentrated upon the crisis between the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth authorities owing to the failure of the Acting Prime Minister( Sir Joseph Cook) to live up to his promise to pay New South Wales £3,500,000 for the purpose of soldier settlement.

Acting Prime Minister had a good case he would not hesitate to make it known. facts public quite a number of times. Federal case must be a very bad one. The Acting Prime Minister has not replied to the New South Wales Treasurer ( Mr. Lang), and the situation is serious for two sets of people, the one being those who have sold land to the New South Wales Government, and cannot get their money, and the other being those returned men who are waiting for land. The NeI could South Wales Treasurer has made publio his case through the medium of the Svdney press, and neither the Acting Prime Minister nor the Minister for Repatriation I (SenatorE . D .

Wales, had acknowledged the promised assistanceWe cannot let you down, because we have been privy to the arrangements, but they .ought to be, and' must be, tightened up a little in the future. And, at the same time, the Acting Prinie Minister condemned the late Nationalist Government of New South Wales for. their actions. That condemnation, however, does not concern'me at the moment: that I know of. ing. Prime Minister did'reflect upon the late Holman Government for not having carried out their part of the contract. On the 13th of this month a long statement was published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph from Mr Lang, in which the State Treasurer said that the Commonwealth Treasurer and Assistant Minister for Repatriation had complained that the New South Wales authorities had not tendered certified accounts of the money spent. That is the crux of the whole trouble. The obligation of making payment is not denied by the Federal authorities. solemn contract was entered into, but the only reason which has been given for non-payment is that tlie State has not rendered certified accounts for the money said to be due. If those were the facts, the Commonwealth authorities would be standing on solid ground; but the New South Wales Treasurer gave the Sydney press specific sums, and mentioned the dates on which the accounts had been certified, and sent on to the Commonwealth. Mr Lang saidThe list of certified accounts of expenditure forwarded by us to the Commonwealth Government, but for which we have not been recouped, is as foliows :Then he gave f u l l particulars of more than a dozen items, of which I shall quote only the first to indicate how complete was his case. It is this : "" £6,630 Os. 6d., forwarded to Commonwealth Government, 19th January, 1921."" Notwithstanding these specific details, the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers), in his last statement forwarded to the New.South Wales Treasurer, intimated that those accounts had not come to hand. Sir fact, New South Wales has an advance now of about £270,000, in respect of which the State Treasurer has not ye.t sent us a certified account. to understand that the Federal Government have paid only £270,000, and that there still remains nearly £3,250,000 unpaid ? had £4,250,000 last year. a different matter altogether. Waleswill get all I can spare it this year. may not amount to much. The Federal authorities should keep their word in respect of the £3,500,000. The Acting Prime Minister said that, when the State accounts were forwarded, New South Wales would be recouped. They have been forwarded, but the Acting Prime Minister has not kept his word. South Wales send in certified accounts in respect of the settlement of more than 8,000 men, when less than 6,000 have been settled so f a r t Federal authorities should pay the acA counts for the expenditure incurred. better than the honourable member does. ing Prime Minister's trouble with Mr. Lang is that he cannot answer his arguments. I can only say that if a transaction of this character were carried out in private life it would be stigmatized as a> confidence trick. If the Acting Prime Minister is prepared to look upon a solemn contract as a scrap of paper, he must not mind some candid criticism. word upon this matter? State' Treasurer. last word is the man who has the money. Acting Prime Minister had a good answer he would make it the last word. But, since he has not replied, I take it that the case of New South Wales cannot be answered. When the Acting Prime Minister has a good case he always makes the most of it . not, he does so. true, too; but when his case is very bad he says nothing, as in this matter.

175,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [5.15],"they are very unsatisfactory. The Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers) stated last night that if the applicants, for homes at Cessnock were dissatisfied they would be permitted to apply for other homes, and their applications would be granted. That, on the face of it, appears a fair proposal, but 1 doubt whether it will be satisfactory, because if new homes are built for these people in some other part of the district, the Commission will have to dispose of the homes which have been already, built, and it is possible that, bethese houses. It is claimed that houses cause of their inferior character, purchasers will acquire' them at less than the cost of construction. A better procedure would have been to adopt the recommendation by the Public Accounts Committee. We recommended that the soldiers should be given the privilege of requesting the Government nock properties. Some competent person pointed to carry out the valuations, : and if it was found that a house, because of inferior workmanship or the use of \inferior material, was defective, then, whatever value was placed on the house -by the ofiicers the soldiers should pay, and nothing more. To me that appears a fair proposition, especially in view of the fact that most of the soldiers and their families have been for some considerable time occupying the homes. When a man and his family have moved into a house with their furniture and effects, and thereby incurred considerable expense, it does not seem to me quite just that, because of some defect, he should be told he may apply for another house and move into it. A removal of this kind means anything from £10 to £20 expenditure on labour, fitting cloth coverings, and so forth. In such cases, the householder should have the right to a re-valuation; and, if it be shown that the house which cost £700 is worth only £600, the householder should get it at the latter price, and the difference be borne Iby the Government. If the Government are responsible for defective work, I should say .they, and not the soldier, ought to bear any additional cost; and I ask the Minister to look into the matter. altogether satisfied with the house. Mr Charlton. the chance of going out, at no loss individually. I now wish to refer to the statement made by the Minister last night in regard to the future policy of the Department. We were informed that, in future, all work is to be carried out by contract. Of course, the Government are perfectly justified in carrying out their own policy, though, personally, I do not regard that policy as in the best interests of the soldiers who have to occupy built by means of day labour cost £97 more than do houses built under the contract system by the Commonwealth ""Bank; but I remind honourable members that many factors have to be taken into consideration in making comparisons of the kind. The statement made by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation will be to revalue their Cesssent broadcast throughout Australia, and' it will be taken for granted that under or persons should be apday labour we do not get the same amount of work done as under the contract system. 1 venture to' say that, if two' or three competent men, who thoroughly understand the building business, were to investigate the matter, they would find that relatively there is not the difference in cost that was claimed last night. When War Service Homes were contemplated, negotiations were entered into with Sir DenisorL,Miller, of the Commonwealth Bank, with a view to undertaking the work, but no finality was reached. Sir Denison Miller went on a visit to the Old Country, and the Savings Banks of the various States were consulted with a view to intrusting the business to them. When Sir Denison Miller returned, and became aware of this, he, as representing the Bank, undertook the work, and the Savings Banks authorities were, very properly, apprised accordingly. At that time, it must be remembered, building material was very much cheaper than it became twelve months later, and that is one of the factors to be taken into consideration in making any comparison between the cost under day labour and the cost under contract; indeed, as between 1918-19 and 1920-21, it would otherwise be impossible to arrive tion. We know that during the latter",43,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable

These facts are not taken into consideration in the statement made by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation. But this is only on a par with every thing done by the Department in recent years. does the honourable member refer? honourable gentleman made as to the future policy of the Department. honourable member enunciates is sound enough, but we must consider every phase of day labour and the effect of it. It is not only the actual work we have to consider, but the principle of day labour as applied to houses built under the provision of the Act which lays it down that the houses must be completed at a fixed price. other factors to be taken into consideration, as I shall show. For instance, the Commissioner is working on a group system, and the Bank is building individual houses. allotment of land, and apply for a house to be built on it ; and I would not be surimpossible to give effect to the specific prised if , on inquiry, we did not find that, in estimating the cost of the house, the value of the land in such cases is not taken into consideration. Honourable members will see that this would make a vast difference in the comparison. night in regard to costs, inclusive and exclusive of land, for homes built both by the Bank and by the Commissioner. suggesting that in cases where a man already owns land, the cost of that land is not taken into computation, but only the cost of the building. eost, exclusive and inclusive of land. let us suppose that there are 100 houses to be built by the Bank, and that, amongst those 100 houses there are ten in regard to which it is not necessary to purchase One contractor land, then the total cost is divided by the number of houses, without taking into consideration the land already owned by the soldiers. In the case of the grouping system under the Commissioner, the same thing occurs; and if the facts be sifted, a great deal will be found in my contention. Assistant Minister has to be guided in these matters by his officers. turns of the Department. dissatisfaction with the administration, I would not take for granted anything received from the officers, some of whom are not fit for the positions they occupy. Personally, I do not favour the grouping system, though, of course, there are other people who do; and it is a matter that will probably be dealt with in the general report of the Public Accounts Committee. If a large area of land has to be purchased and subdivided, the streets made, and drains formed to the satisfaction of the municipality or the shire, the cost is considerably increased; and it is quite a different proposition from buying isolated allotments. able member, and say that it is almost terms of the Act under the grouping system. of that difficulty, the soldiers suffer in very many cases. diers will not suffer, though individuals may. that all the soldiera will suffer; but, under the group system, a man may get for £800 a house that is really worth £900, whilst some one else, in the same group, gets, one for £700, making the average price £800 -That is very unsatisfactory, and not fair to the soldiers.

It is unfair that it should he spread broadcast that the contract system has proved much cheaper than the day-labour system. rick has been ""flying his kite"" pretty high in New South Wales, with statements in every newspaper alleging the failure of day labour and claiming that he has built the houses under contract cheaper by £200 each. told me the other day that he thought the average would come out at about £650 a house, plus land. point. We are told by the Assistant Minister that the houses cost £686, and now we are informed that Sir Denison Miller says the cost will be £650 .per house, plus land, a difference of £36. It is impossible to buy a block of land in any of the suburbs of Sydney for £36, so that we have evidence in this later statement that the comparison is not correct. the average cost of these houses would be over £700; but for all that, good work has been done in the building of them.

The honourable member cannot doubt them. sive evidence that the comparison is misleading, and I am satisfied to leave the matter there. Many of the houses built under the contract system by the Commonwealth Bank are among the most defective that we have seen.

The Committee found that inferior material had been used in the construction of the homes at Goulburn, and although Mr Kirkpatrick said that he would not give his final certificate until he was satisfied that everything was satisfactory, the fact remains that the buildings had practically been completed when the Committee inspected them. I did not go with the Committee to Goulburn, but members of it have told me that they found the buildings were almost complete, and that plaster was being used to cover up' bad material.

Sir supervision will prevent roguery. son of a contractor is appointed as architect to see that he does good work. At Cessnock there are two War Service Homes in which inferior material has been used. On the occasion of our visit one could put one's fingers into the cracks in the walls, and the so-called paint with which they had been painted could be rubbed off. built under contract? these cases only to show what may happen if the Minister goes on with the contract in preference to the day-labour system. The Public Accounts Committee found that houses which had been built by day labour were far superior to those which had been constructed under the contract system. I went with the Committee to Newcastle, and it was impossible to find fault with any of the homes that had been built there by day labour. under the day-labour system to scamp work. homes that we saw at Newcastle had been well and faithfully built, and in my estimation the cost was reasonable. The construction of these houses was supervised by capable men. At the head of a gang under the day-labour system there is a recognised builder, who acts as supervisor and sees to it that first-class material is used, and that good work is done. T should not have mentioned this matter had not the question of day labour .versus contract been raised by the statement of the Minister, that the Government intend, in future, to build all War Service Homes under the contract system. If that policy is to be pursued, it will be necessary for the Department to exercise the greatest care in the appointment of supervisors, otherwise much of the work will be scamped, and our returned men will suffer. If I were purchasing a house to-morrow, I would prefer one that had been built by day labour, even if I had to pay more for it, rather than one that had been built under contract. If I bought a house that had been built , by day labour, I would be sure of getting awould not require almost immediately to be repaired. ber know that some of these homes have cost £400 more than the estimated price? thing will have to be done by the Government to relieve the men from these unnecessary additional costs.

The soldier does not know what alterations and repairs will be necessary to a War Service Home that has been built for him under the contract system.

I do not know that it will be wise to discontinue that policy. The average man is a good judge of a house.

A man might be able to obtain for £600 a house which, if built for him, would cost £800. The additional cost is a serious toll on his earnings. my electorate which returned men were prepared to purchase for £600 or £700, although they were not really worth £200. some people have been trying to exploit our returned men. If a man could purchase a house for £600, instead of having to pay £800 for a house built specially for him, it would lighten the burden of his repayments. men who are applying for homes are young men, who have married since their return from the war, and four or five years hence they may have two or three children to maintain. Some of them will find it difficult to keep up their instalments and at the same time rear a family in reasonable conditions of comfort. I speak from experience. In my younger days, as a working man, I set about getting a home for myself, and I well remember the difficulties with which the wife and I had to contend in meeting the payments for our house and at the same time keeping the home going. It should ibe our endeavour to keep down these costs. Where the estimates are exceeded the burden on oUr returned men is intensified; and if we are not careful many of them may not be able a few years hence, should we fall upon bad times, to meet their payments. In that event, we shall have to come to their rescue^ or allow them to forfeit and lose their homes. I do not want to see those who fought for us brought to such a position. My desire is that everything shall be made as reasonable as possible for them; and that is why I am inclined to think that they should be allowed to purchase a house already built, where they can do so to advantage, Then, again, I do not know whether the Minister is going to continue the policy of isolated building. My impression is that it is intended to build in groups under the contract system. TheI n the interests of the grouping system leads to injustice. If a returned man has a block of his own, or is offered an allotment by a friend, why should he not be allowed to build his home upon it? Why should he be compelled to buy a house built under the grouping system on a site which is, perhaps, some distance from tramway facilities? be compelled to build in the cities ? Newcastle district land much better than fchat bought by the Commission was offered to it, and declined. That land could have been obtained more cheaply than some that was bought. It is situated in the middle of the district, and those living there could travel easily from it to places of business. Yet the Commission has gone Most of the returned further afield, and taken up large blocks for the building of grouped houses, quite beyond the living area. Much of this land will be useless as' a site for soldiers' homes, and 8 acres of one estate which was bought has had to be discarded as unsuitable because it cannot be built on. The Government have bought too much land,. They are ahead of their requirements. If they spend only £4,000,000 a year on the erection of soldiers' homes, they cannot for many years to come utilize, in New South Wales, at any rate, all the land that they now hold. been purchased in New South Wales has .not been paid for. of the land purchased during the last twelve months has been paid for. has -been owing to some widows for nearly two years past on account of land purchased from them, and they are being allowed only 4£ per cent, interest on the money. allowed to purchase homes already built, and the vendors, in many cases, have given them possession, understanding that they would be paid immediately.

What happens seems to be this: An officer goes to a land jobber in a town, and asks him if there is any land for sale in the district. He is told, "" Oh yes, I have such and such a piece of land which I will sell for so much."" That land is accepted, perhaps, without regard to the opinion of other persons who know something of values in the district, and subsequently it is found that a mistake has been made. Those responsible for recommending land for purchase, the offioers on whom the Minister depends, should explore every avenue of information.

Those who made the valuations and recommendations grossly erred, in my judgment. Department? have we against this thing happening again in the future? I understand that a director-general is to be appointed under the new policy, and let us hope that he may be a thoroughly qualified man. But the Minister should take care that the country does not, in the future, find itself in the same predicament as it has been in in the past. No Minister can examine for himself all the land offered, to the Commission in the various States. get valuations free of cost in any district in Australia from councils and other local governing bodies. that could be done; but care must always be taken to ascertain that the in formation supplied is not that of in terested persons. would be supplied on behalf of district councils would be less interested than that now obtained. time, the evidence of a valuator as to the worth of a property depends largely upon the side for which his services are enlisted, and thus -one set of valuers-auc tioneers and land agents-wil l give one valuation, and another set, acting for the opposite party, w ill give another valuation, and sometimes there w ill be great disparity between the two. merely estimates. a good guide is the statements of, sales recorded in the books of council and shire clerks, because nowadays whenever a sale of land is made, the local council or shire has to be informed of the price at which the land was sold.

We have paid away a lot of money which' should not have been spent, because of the muddled way in which our purchases of land have been conducted. The 108 acres in Piatt's estate, in the Newcastle District, is over a mile from a tram, and a mile and a quarter from a railway Btation, and if houses are built on that land without the assurance that a tramway will be taken close to it , the expenW h a t protection diture will be wasted, because soldiers will find that they cannot alford to live there.

However, my point is that such money as was granted was spent by the Commissionerin five or six months in the endeavour to give effect to the speeding up of soldiers' home construction. The money went in securing huge supplies of timber and in buying up land, aud, of course, in actual construction of homes to cope with, as far as posjjfble, the overwhelming volume of applications. How are we going to get along now with £4,000,000 for the current nnancial year to deal with activities over the whole of Australia ? gotten that, of last year's amount which was made available, approximately £3,000,000 was used in the purchase by the Commissioner of already erected homes, and another £295,000 or more was spent-in the same direction by the Commonwealth Bank. not recur during this nnancial year. understood that the Department spent only about £3,500,000 last year in the actual construction of homes.

302,Mr West (East Sydney) [S.0],"It deal of regret the statement of the Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr soldiers have shown a fine spirit. It was Rodgers) last night; indeed, I do not remember in all my experience any speech by a Minister that has caused me so much uneasiness. A t the outset, I desire to say that, in mating these remarks, I shall not avail myself of any information -that has come to me as a member of the Public Accounts Committee; my desire is to take a broad view of the question. I do not think that any member of the Government will deny that they have received the most liberal support from the Opposition for any proposals that have been made in the interests of thc returned soldiers. The Government, therefore, 1 cannot put down their failure in the matter of the War Service Homes to any action of honourable members on this side. Never during my life-long experience of various Governments, both State and Pederal, have I seen so much incompetence displayed as by the present Administration, in its efforts to carry out the wishes of Parliament The Government have been given the utmost freedom by this Parliament, perhaps too much freedom, i After all, it is the duty of the Government to carry out the wishes of Parliament, and to see that competent Ministers are selected to that end. I have on more than one occasion pointed out that a Coalition Government, like the present, cannot be expected to submit such concrete plans as are possible with a Government composed of members of a solid political party; and here, perhaps, may bo found the reason for the lack of ability shown in regard to the War Service Homes. There is no doubt that at all recent elections the party in power have done their utmost to induce the returned soldier and the people to believe that they are the friends of the soldiers, and to that end have made all sorts of conceivable promises. There is no excuse for the position in which the Government now find themselves. like other members, represent constituencies, and they must have had brought before them the necessity of providing homes for our soldiers who marry here, or may have brought wives from the other side of the world. When a man marries, his first duty is to "" find a cage for the canary ""-to make a home for his partner Mr West. Homes. in life; and in this regard the returned well known, when the return of our soldiers became imminent, that there were not homes available for them. As a representative of the industrial workers, and as an old worker myself, I can enter into their feelings, and fully appreciate the position of a man and wife, with two or three children, trailing the streets and looking for a place in which they can live with a little comfort. The Labour party shows by its platform that one of its objects is to insure that the men aud women of Australia shall be able to live as human beings should iu a civilized community. That is not possible at the present time, and the Government are not taking the proper steps towards a remedy. As I said, I do not intend to use information that has been laid before me as a inember of the Public Accounts Committee, but that Committee has presented four reports in each of which is sufficient material to justify any Parliament which is watching the interests of the people to remove a Government like the present from office, and install another capable of conducting the affairs of the country without the mismanagement of which we have been witnesses. Every newspaper should chronicle, and every comic paper should ridicule, the Government's failure, and help to bring about a change; but as matters are to-day, the press sees only with ""one eye,"" and there is no channel, whether in the State or Federal arena, by which the public may be informed of the true state of affairs. The Assistant Minister, last night, after he had told us how the Government had done all the things they ought not, and had left undone those things that ought to have been done, wound up by announcing that they had changed their policy in regard to War Service Homes. I take it that it is now tlie intention to remove officials who have been employed in the War Service Homes Department Ministers, for the last five years, and to select others from amongst the particular friends of the Government to fill their places. It k is evident that the Government are now beginning to-realize the ""-misfits"" they appointed in the first place, and are now going to change their methods. net staff the Department-that is done by the Commissioner.",53,Joseph Cook N O System Of More Satisfactory Home And One Which
303,Mr Rodgers,"The Government doa young man in politics, or he would know that a Minister is responsible for the acts of his ofiicers, and must suffer if they make mistakes. The idea of the Assistant Minister seems to be to appoint as chief of the Department some person connected with building and construction work i u the States, w i th deputies s i m i larly selected. The muddle is bad enough now, and if the Assistant Minister carries out what I take to be his intention, he will satisfy neither the soldiers nor the public. It is propcsed by the Department to adopt the contract system in preference to day labour. I can only say that even if the Assistant Minister knows how to 'make two blades of grass grow where only one grew before, he knows very little about the purchase of land and the -building of homes; indeed, one of the troubles from the start has been that persons with littl e knowledge have had control of the business. to hi m the fact that an ordinary building contractor, if he be an honest man, will not have anything to do w i th the building of single cottages, for the reason that such contracts are not sufficiently remunerative. The labour and the material for such work is very, small, and so many different trades go to the construction of a cottage from start to finish that, as I say, the work is unremunerative. A contractor must have work elsewhere on which to employ his men, or cottages must be constructed in groups before he finds it worthwhile to tender. Even w i th -the best of supervision the Government will not be able to build separate cottages and meet all the requirements of the case according to the wishes of Parliament. . Under the contract system the cost of supervision will be enormously increased. One man can supervise the construction of only a few buildings, and where homes are being erected all over the country, an army of supervisors wil l be necessary to insure that they are f a it h f u l ly built. A contractor builds cottages, not from philanthropic motives, but to make money. Homes built under contract will not compare w i th those constructed by day labour. quarter per cent, of the buildings in Auspayments, the Government will have a . tralia have been built under contract. the members of this Parliament at one time were said to be brainy men, b u t it does not follow that 99 per cent, of the members to-day are men of brains. Reference has been made during the debate to the great cost of War Service Homes. Apart from the mistakes that have been made by the Department itself, the cost of construction has not been unduly high. It is mismanagement on the part of the Department that has led to the piling up of costs. We shall always be able to look w it h pride on the homes that have been b u i lt by day labour. They are faithfully constructed, and are fitted with conveniences such as the well-to-do at one time could alone afford. It should be our endeavour to provide the working classes generally with such cottages. A man who poses as a friend of the returned soldiers said the other day that he could build a fourroomed cottage for £400 . What sort of a cottage would it be? He might build I may point out for such a price a cottage of rough sawn timber, and line the walls and ceiling with sugar-bags which, when papered, would look presentable, but would really be a breeding ground for vermin and disease. The War Service Homes built by day labour have been well constructed of sound material. The walls are plastered and floated with Keen's cement, so that they present an absolutely smooth surface, and offer no harbour for vermin. These houses have also been painted with pure white lead and boiled oil instead of with a composition such as has been used for painting some of the contract-built houses. Our desire should be to supply our men with homes which are as comfortable as those which hitherto only the well-to-do have been able to obtain. We were told that we should emerge from the war a new world. Let us start out by giving our returned men and the workers generally well-constructed. sanitary homes. In building these War Service Homes the Government are studying the health of the people. It is said that the cost is too high, but it must not be forgotten that the repayments w ill extend over thirt y years, and that, therefore, the homes should be so constructed that at the end of that period they will still be sound. If that is done, then should any substantial asset. If the Government decide that for the f u t u re all War Service",54,Joseph Cook N O System Of More Satisfactory Home And One Which

Parliament promised that every soldier would be able to obtain a substantially built home on easy terms, and it is our duty to see that that promise is carried out. Some honourable members opposite , are never tired of talking of the great resources of Australia, and of urging that we should encourage immigration. read in tlie press the other day a statement by an ex-member that, when dining w it h the Governor General, he expressed the hope that, before H is Excellency's term of office had expired of at least 10,000,000 immigrants. As a matter of fact, we have not increased our population by 1,000,000 in ten years. If honourable members opposite are sincerely anxious to encourage immigration they should advocate as a first step the provision of houses in which immigrants may live. Asi t is, there is an acute . shortage, of housing accommodation in all our big cities, and the position in country districts is even worse. . An immigrant who gets work in the country has very often to live in a shed at the rear of a public-house, leaving his wife and family in a room in one of our cities. Isi t any wonder that, in such circumstances, people prefer city to country life? housing accommodation were available in country districts more people would be encouraged to settle there. councils should bestir themselves, since with an increased population they would be better able to carry out their responsibilities. I can tell at a glance whether or not a house has been properly built. member of the Public Accounts tee I visited Tasmania a few days ago, and saw in one district there five cottages, built by day labour, which for faithful construction are not to be surpassed. the other hand, we got a shock when we looked at some of the War Service Homes that had been built under contract. urge the Government to reconsider their decision to adopt the contract There certainly has been on the part of the Department, is still hope of salvation if the remaining homes are built under day labour. homes should be thoroughly Jlfr West. and free from any cause of complaint. The heavy cost of some of the houses that have been constructed has been due to This bungling in administration. In the case of two cottages that I know of I should have been glad to put in the foundations for £ 3 0 . The Department charged to one of these jobs eighty-six bags of cement, although only four had been used, and to another fifty-eight bags, and I in it about the same quantity had been used. Honourable members can understand why, under a costing system like that) soldiers have come to think that the houses are too expensive. It would, however, be possible to make out proper bills we should have an influx of quantities. The cubing system of costing is not applicable to cottage building, because the more you keep down height, the greater the cubical cost; but with proper bills of quantities, and proper charging, of labour costs, you can get at the actual expenditure on a building to within £5 or £6. Of course, estimates are often exceeded, because, when a man brings his wife to .see the partly-finished building, she wants a cupboard here, or a wardrobe there, or a larger sink in the kitchen; and the husband, being a good fellow, says, "" Darling, you shall have a l l these things,"" and he asks for them to ba supplied. It is right that the men should If better have houses in which they and their wives can take a pride. The time has gone by when itoan be considered good enough The shire for any Australian to give him a cottage built of rough timber, lined w it h hessian, on which a cheap wall paper has been pasted.

Men having a few pounds in their These pockets tried to become contractors, and well built, many of them could not carry out their contracts. The ordinary builder will not undertake the erection of cottages, because it does not pay. .1 have urged the creation of a Department for the proper carrying out of these building operations, nnd tbe employment of men who would t do good work, so that satisfaction might reign in the community instead of discontent. No member is pleased with what the War Service Homes Commission has done. Week after week, and month after month, complaints come to us from soldiers. We hear, from men who have been eight and nine months trying to get a home. In a case that I know of, a man had to shift his wife and bairns from one . house to another until he had been in four lodgings before the home which the Department had contracted to provide for him was ready. Every member gets these complaints, though, as I represent & city constituency, and am known from one end of Sydney to the other, I may get more than my share of them. We must improve matters. posals of the Government, if adopted, will lead to further trouble and discontent. When the War Ser-vice Homes Act was passed Parliament hoped to provide habitations for its returned men, and it thought that if there should be an oversupply the surplus could be used by ordinary citizens. Now it is found that it may be ten years before the Department can satisfy the demand for soldiers' homes. the wishes of Parliament in this matter, and has displayed an incapacity such as has been shown by no other Administration, Federal or State. I am not saying this to catch' votes, because I have no need to do that. My desire is to remove the present discontent, and to help the soldiers who desire to get homes of their own. I should be a traitor to my country if I did not give to the Government the benefit of my knowledge, and point out the errors into which Ministers have been led. The statement made by the Minister last night caused me considerable regret, because I felt that he is following the wrong path, and that his policy will make things worse than they are. Eveni f it were to add 5 per cent, to the cost of administration it would be better to adopt the day-labour system, because, under that system, our soldiers will get homes fit to live in, and the Government will have a real and proper asset for its expenditure. Such homes will be built as will make those who live in them happier and better citizens-. I rise, not to condemn the administration of the War Service Homes Commission, but rather to praise what has been done .by it, especially since our highly-esteemed friend, the member for Wannon, has been Assistant Minister for Repatriation. Last night, however, in a somewhat chastened spirit, he asked n6t for destructive, but for helpful criticism, and it is to make such helpful criticism that I now address myself to the House. For what the Department has done in the direction of building homes for soldiers generally I have nothing but praise to offer, that is as regards their activities in the principal metropolitan cities of Australia and their suburbs. So far as I am aware, however, very little has been done for soldiers desirBut the proing to have homes erected for them, or to be assisted in purchasing homes in country districts. I have been endeavouring to ascertain if there is a single War Service Home in the electorate of Grampians, but my investigations hitherto have been of a negative character. Perhaps other country electorates have been more signally favoured. In this mild criticism of policy I am not directing censure upon the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers). Indeed, since he has taken The Government has ignored over control of the Department some inquiries, at any rate, have been made with respect to country homes for returned men; and I have sufficient faith in the Minister to believe that, in course of time, some War Service Homes will be. erected outside of metropolitan areas and their suburbs. Meanwhile some of our returned heroes have undertaken to buy country pror>erties, and. under the terms of the Act, they have sought financial assistance from the Federal Government. prepared concerning the homes built in every electorate in the Commonwealth. The honourable member will be able to see how soldiers and their dependants in Grampians have'fared, and he will be able to make comparisons. Incidentally, I might mention that the returned men in his electorate appear to be well satisfied",55,Joseph Cook N O System Of More Satisfactory Home And One Which

That may or may not be a fact, but my own impression is that, with a competent staff of architects and clerks of works and Government purchases in large quantities of timber, cement, nails, and paint, and, if necessary, manufacturing their own bricks, tlie Department can build cheaper than can any contractor. Yet, after having involved the country in an expenditure of £500,000 on account of timber alone, and further immense sums for the purchase of land, and probably contracts for iron, paint, and nails, and after having got together a huge organization, the Government propose to abandon the whole system of Departmental construction.

If the Government wish to go the whole hog, and save money, the proper thing to do is to abolish the Department and arrange with the Commonwealth Bank or private banks to iinance any soldier who desires to build a ""home. Apparently, the Ministry of Repatriation will be still in existence, and the Minister will certainly have a staff; but the whole of the actual business will be done by private architects and contractors; all the Department will have to do will be to provide the money.

No Minister could supervise in every State what was taking place, but the condemnation of the day-labour system, because of the failure of the Department, is a slander upon the Workmen engaged in the building trade. The Assistant Minister stated last night that Lieut -Colonel Walker had given preference to returned soldiers. That is ouite right so far as it goes.

I resent that statement. -I have been on many of these jobs, I have seen the men at work, and their labours were a credit to them. The War Service Homes scheme was a fine idea if properly carried out, and I regret that because it has been a failure in 'some respects, the Government are rushing to the opposite extreme.

The Government are doing a great injustice in blaming day labour for the failure of the War Service Homes policy. It must be remembered that the cost of living, and building materials, and wages have increased at least 30 per cent., but to-day the price of timber is falling, bricks are cheaper than they were, and the price of paints is decreasing. On the eve of this decline in material costs the Government are about to adopt the contract system, I do not blame the Minand next year we shall have a report that so many houses were built under that system so much cheaper than by day labour. the prices of materials are falling now. too, will fall in some trades.

It is only fair to Lieut -Colonel Walker to say that he may have been handicapped when he first started operations by the fact that the Timber Combine and the Brick Combine tried to raise their prices against him. They thought that because t i e Commonwealth Government were embarking upon this big policy of house construction there would be a scarcity of building materials, and so they refused to come to the aid of the Commissioner and held back materials with the object of getting bigger prices. Inasmuch as Lieut -Colonel Walker may have had to pay higher prices than were just, he is entitled to sympathy. I inspected a number of the War Service Homes cottages built in New South Wales under the group system. I saw some of the houses absolutely complete, but not occupied, although returned soldiers were anxious, to take them. When I asked the reason, I was told that the Department was deferring occupancy until the whole group was complete. As soonas a cottage was finished, a soldier should have been put into it .

If six houses out of eighteen are finished those six houses ought to be occupied, and thus reduce the cost of the others. To keep all the houses waiting until all are completed in order to strike an average is a course without justification. justed afterwards I may say that the homes I have seen in New South Wales are of a"" very good, high-class type, which I do not think the soldiers will regret purchasing. I am sorry the Government are abandoning the policy they have hitherto pursued. Sawmills have been purchased, and other arrangements made for the supply of cheaptimber, and now it is proposed to hand the. business over to the contractors. The Minister ought to have put his "" back up"" and insist on a new*staff, and then have, held the Commissioner responsible for the completion of the cottages at a certain price.

Act the Government are morally bound to appoint a Commissioner clothed with the powers the Act gives him to carry out the work. The substitution for that officer of a Minister, and without the authority of Parliament, would be a serious invasion of the rights of the House. sary legislative changes. suppose that such a thing as I have suggested is contemplated. As to the past defects of administration, I think it is unnecessary to say anything; they are so obvious, and have been so repeatedly placed before Parliament and the country that any good purpose that would be served by a review has already been achieved. But we should be lacking in our duty if we permitted a new system to come into being without applying to it the results of our past experience. wish, first of all, to challenge the attitude which has been taken up by successive administrators of War Service Homes, whether they be the Commonwealth Bank, the Commissioner, or the Minister with reference to the question of purchasing homes already in existence, and the closely allied question of allowing the soldier to build his own home' as he himself wishes, and then having his mortgage taken over, as the Act contemplates. I believe the most satisfactory settlement is that of soldiers in homes of their own selection. The soldier does not desire to go into group settlements away from his own people and industrial centre; he wishes to be like other men, free to choose the home apparently best suited to his conditions and his social life. Parliament set out first with the idea of enabling soldiers to get homes; and the principle of the organization should be, not the ideas of some gentleman as to how garden cities should be created, or how people should be grouped in this or that way, but to allow the soldier to do what he himself wishes to do, and not something that somebody else thinks he ought to do. The initial blunder in the organization has been that too many people who have touched it have done so with the desire to graft on to it some fad of their own-hav e forgotten that the soldier has just the same rights and desires as any other member of the community. To-day he is not a soldier, but a civilian who has earned the right to special consideration, which will take the best form if it enables him, in his own way, to select his home where he pleases. Much of the financial troubles which have worried the Treasurer considerably arise from the wide departure from that principle in the beginning. Had the money that has' been devoted to those fanciful schemes of future homes been devoted to securing homes already in existence, or erected under the supervision of. the soldier, we should not now be confronted -with the difficulties arising from shortage of funds. The timber scheme in Queensland was discussed by this House. I have no doubt that if the object is to look forward to a building scheme enduring for ten, fifteen or twenty years, that, probably, was a very wise investment, but, in my judgment, the money would have been much better applied to the purchase I of houses already in existence, or to enabling the soldier to make his own contract according to his own plans. Thousands of men would then have been doing the same thing at one time, and this would not only have relieved the Department of the anxiety of supervision and so forth, but would have immensely aided in the speedy completion of the job. stand by the policy of homes as provided by section 20, with the exception that, as to already-built homes, the purchase is restricted considerably. should the Department say to the soldier that he should not purchase the house he is living in, but should take a Government house ? A case has come under my notice in which a soldier was threatened with penalties if he did not take a house that he did not like that had been erected by the Commission, although there was another house that he preferred.",61,Joseph Cook N O System Of More Satisfactory Home And One Which

There are many cases' within my own knowledge where a soldier was living in a house before he went to the war, and, on his return, wished to remain in it. The owners were willing to sell, and, as occurred within my own circle of soldier friends, were prepared to concede conditions that they would not give to any outside purchaser. One of the first cases brought under my notice was that of a young friend who returned, and, after looking round, found a house to suit him. He was about to be married, and was glowing with satisfaction that he had got the kind of house which he desired, aud which the proprietor was prepared to sell as a bargain. Four months later I met him in the depths of despair; the Department had turned clown his application after keeping him waiting for months, and within seven days of that occurring the property was purchased by one of the shrewdest friendly societies in Sydney for a member at a price .very much in excess of that offered to the soldier. Who can say that the interests of the soldier were conserved by the Department, which forced him to pay £100 more for a house thc Department wished him to buy than he would have had to pay for a house that he himself desired? Then, again, there is the case of a soldier who buys a block of land, has his own plans prepared, arranges with a contractor on mortgage, and then applies to the Department. Such a man is met with no encouragement. In one case the business with the Department commenced nearly two years ago, and it is only two months since the man got his mortgage transferred. The Department should have said to the soldiers, ""Find the house you want and we will help,you; if you erect,-a house that you desire, we will finance you to the same extent, and take over the mortgage."" If that had been done, we should have had thousands of houses erected without any trouble about day labour oi contract, and erected under the best of superintendence, namely, that of the men who were going to live in them. diture of £7,500,000 for homes last financial year, the conditions the honourable member suggests in regard to the soldiers' own wishes were observed to the extent of £3,268,000 worth of homes. was so much antagonism shown to the idea last night? I undertake to say that there have been no complaints from the soldiers thustreated. definite complaint and a very real experience. It was found we were hoisting the value of real estate and helping speculators to buy or erect homes, and get soldiers to hurry into them, rather than buy the more substantial buildings of the Department. sistant Minister went around and saw the homes to which I refer, he would find that that is the attitude of interested persons in regard to the proposition. No doubt, a lot of jerry-builders set out to provide homes; but if we have a Department capable of supervising the erection of £6,000,000 worth of homes' a year, we could surely have a small Department capable of seeing that homes purchased are of a proper kind before taking them over. My experience may be different from that of other honourable members.

In future every house built by the Commission, whether built under contract or otherwise, will be in response to the application of an individual soldier. be very much better. I hope also that some check will be put upon the acquisition of large areas of land. I am satisfied that some large areas have been acquired, not because it was thought that they were wanted by soldiers, but because some one has had a good "" cut"" out of the money so expended. In that, regard we have been altogether too free in allowing .subordinate officers to make large purchases without reference to the local Repatriation Committees or the Minister: These are faults that can be remedied. I turn now, briefly, to another phase of this question, which to me. is of very great importance. ago a. statement made at the time the War Service Homes Bill was before the House that it . was anticipated that the average, cost of settling a soldier on the land would be £1,500. I heard in the course ""of the debate yesterday that the Treasurer regarded almost with equanimity thc suggestion that it was going to cost us £3,000 for every soldier settled on the land. dal. surer would render a great service to the Commonwealth if he put his pruning knife as deeply into that side of the expenditure as he proposes to do in so far as the building of War Service Homes is concerned. The Commonwealth should not provide another penny for the settlement of soldiers on the land by the States unless it first knows that that settleland settlement, our obligation is limited"" ment is being conducted in the interests of the soldiers themselves, and not in the interests of either the States or the land speculators. My view in regard to this matter is unchanged. When the original Bill was before us I urged that we should not allow one penny to be spent on soldier settlement by the States on behalf of the Commonwealth unless we had our own officers supervising tliat expenditure. I still hold that opinion. lar as recently as February last to all the State GovernmentsI had to take this action for my own protection-tell ing them that they must, not incur any more obligations of any kind with respect to soldier settlement without reference to the Commonwealth Treasury. necessary because the system is open to abuse. If a State desires to resume an estate of, say, 100,000 acres, it can resume it ostensibly for soldier settlement, and yet not put a soldier on it . In my State we have not that confidence in some of the officials connected with these resumptions that may be entertained by people who have had nothing to do with them. which Victorian representatives have of* throwing bouquets at qne another is not t of much use to those in this Parliament I read a few days who have practical work to do. The idea that the Commonwealth can provide anything in the region of £3,000 for every returned soldier'who wants to make a living on the land is absurd. It is most unfair that the money we are able to raise for repatriation services should bei used in that way. The £3,000 expended in settling one man on the land would provide homes for four returned soldiers and their families. I hope, before we meet again, there will be a very careful examination of the result of the expenditure on soldier settlement, and that an attempt will be made to ascertain what the. settlement of each soldier has actually cost. I hope also that there will be an examination to determine whether the money we are spending on soldier settlement could not be better diverted, for a time at all events, to the establishment of soldiers in their own homes. to £1,000 per soldier.",63,Joseph Cook N O System Of More Satisfactory Home And One Which

400,Mr Fenton,"Yes. The Commisbricks and other materials, and, with a little better organization and supervision, it might have been expected to get good results. It was operating when the buying of building materials was a veritable gamble, and was driven to lengths to which it should not have had to go because private individuals dealt unfairly with it. Those who had been waving the flag and pumping out patriotic sentiment tried to extort the last penny from the Commission, charging it more than they were charging private individuals. The Commissioner complained to Senator E. D. Millen, who was a private-enterprise man from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. That Minister, speaking of houses erected by day labour at Bell, referred to the splendid work that had been put into them. out as was expected, he would have had justification for his statements, but, on completion, the buildings cost approximately £135 more than they should have cost. ing to the Minister's own testimony, the day-labdur system has not had a fair trial, as any jury or Court would say. night that I should be pleased if my statetinue it? ment caused the matter to be threshed out here, so that we .might have a clear understanding of the views of honourable members on the subject. told us that he had discarded the day labour system in favour of the contract system. built by day labour were in excess-of the statutory cost, the total expenditure on them being £130,000.

422,Mr Rodgers,"We would immediatelyhave to buy business. Under the War Service Homes scheme we get that insurance business automatically. business which the Government would get without risk if they were to enter the insurance business. Treasury is in urgent need of money today; and there is no reason, seeing that' the Constitution does not prevent it , why an insurance Department should not be inaugurated. It would, injure nobody in particular, and would prove a great boon to the public. I trust that the Government wilj not, for the future, place the whole business of building homes for soldiers into the hands of contractors. contract system in regard to time, material, and workmanship, keeping in mind the objective of turning . out soldiers' homes of a first-class character. make the contracts as binding as he likes; and the specifications as clear as possible; but, unless a keen eye is kept upon the contractors themselves in the actual carrying out of the work, the soldiers will get no such homes as the Minister has just pictured. ing a contractor profits. The Department will supply a lot of the .material, and it will be competent for workmen themselves, and for returned soldier builders, to secure contracts. I repeat that the Government will be in aposition to provide the bulk of the material. sition. member knows, we have huge quantities on hand. We can schedule them at costs which will permit soldier builders and small contractors to secure contracts without requiring to be backed by considerable capital. but I warn the Minister---if he needs to be warned-that the ordinary contractor is always on the lookout for as big a dividend as he can make. There is no need for the middleman in this great public project at all. three of the members of the Public Accounts Committee came to certain conclusions, and set them forth in a dissenting report. We did not believe, .either in respect of the softwoods proposition in Queensland or of the hardwoods purchases in Victoria, that private individuals should be allowed to step in. We suggested that the middleman should be The Commonwealth cut out altogether. In order to conserve the interests of the Commonwealth, and to save returned soldiers' money, we recommended that the Government should work those timber areas themselves, and cut out the middleman. There is a tendency, and it is a most immoral one, to regard the Government as fair game at all times. Because Government money is to be spent, there are people who are always keenly on the lookout for pickings. A man who would rob the Government of his country is a more despicable thief than a pickpocket. The one merely robs an individual, but the other, who puts his hand into the pockets of the State, robs everybody. An individual who would stoop so low as to filch from a returned soldier is the worse of all kinds of thieves. The day-labour system has not had a fair show. Under proper supervision it can be guaranteed to beat the contracting system every time,'for the reason that it is not looking for profits. The Assistant Minister has stated that houses erected under the day-labour system cost, on an average, £97 each more than .those erected by contract. I do not -think the Minister could have drawn a fair comparison. It is impossible to make a convincing comparison between tha two systems unless the houses have been built in the same locality, upon an exactly similar type of land, with building costs honourable identical, and employing the same material. I wish to know whether the Savings Banks of the various States are now to be invited to come in? There was good reason for the Commonwealth B'ank taking up the building of soldiers' homes. After the Government had decided to hand over the work to the 'Savings Banks of the various States, and when the proposal was first made to the Commissioners of those institutions, the first thing they pointed out was that they would require I might mention that to be paid certain fees.

428,Mr Rodgebs,As the,68,Joseph Cook N O System Of More Satisfactory Home And One Which
429,Mr Fenton,"That sounds well;was that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank pointed out that his institution was operating throughout the Commonwealth, and was prepared to take on the work without requiring any fees to be paid. Sir Denison Miller said, "" All we propose to charge is such sums as may be fairly and .reasonably ""chargeable for our services."" that, by linking up with .the Commonwealth Bank and abandoning negotiations with the 'State Savings Banks, they would be saving some thousands of pounds per annum in fees alone. Now that the Savings Bank Commissioners are to be invited to come in again, it may be presumed that these fees will have to be paid. in respect of certain applications which I am afraid that the Government are likely to be fleeced in future operations, as they have been in the past, by contractract, well nigh two years had passed, and tors I say with regret and humiliation that there are contractors who have had the effrontery and the knavery to put bricks into soldiers' homes which could bo crumbled with one's hands, and who have used timber which has not been up to specification.. Such revelations are sufficient to turn one against the contract system for all time. I do not. say, of course, that every contractor has been dispolicy is submitted no doubt with the honest ; but fraudulent practices were disidea of covering up some of their precovered in contract jobs which were never revealed in houses built under the day labour system. houses, I am bound to say, have been faithfully reared; one can express nothing but praise for the work put into them. But, with respect to the day-labour system, there is no_ inducement to cheat the Government or the soldier, while there is every inducement to put the best material and the finest workmanship into, the job. In certain contract-built houses the soldiers and their dependants have not been in residence for twelve months before the services of plasterers and carpenters have had to be requisitioned. Considering the money involved in the whole gigantic scheme, the men for whom the work is being done, and the financial state of the Commonwealth to-day, the very closest scrutiny of every penny of expenditure is demanded of the Government. I do not see how the Government and the returned soldier can get full value for their money under the contract system. I admit that the Minister( Mr Rodgers) has put up a good case from his own point of view; but if he intends to rely solely on contractors hie will not achieve the best results for the men who fought for us .and have returned. If there is one public Department to which exception can be taken in respect of its administration it is the War Service The Government perceived Homes'branch. Almost from its inauguration there have been evidences of great dissatisfaction because of its incompetence and administrative ineptitude. The experience in South Australia has been such as, I trust, will never he repeated. Early this year I paid special visits oto Melbourne in the effort to secure finality had been in the hands of the Department for many months. Concerning one conthe matter had not even then reached the stage of signing the contract. The scathing ' indictment of the Government's administration of this Department is amply justified and cannot be effectively answered. We have now the spectacle of the Government, who acknowledge their incompetence and admit that they have been on the wrong track, and a further vious mistakes. But, in my opinion, Some contract-built this change will lead to even worse blundering than has happened in the past. These men of business acumen! These heaven-born administrators! bench. And the affairs of this country will never be placed on a true business basis and the best interests of the people conserved until the party now in Opposition is intrusted with the responsibility of Government. I have risen mainly to protest against the existing condition of the saw-mills purchased by the Oommonwealth Government in Queensland in September last. For the last four or five months these mills have been at a standstill, whilst, all the neighbouring saw-mills have"" been working at their full capacity. I feel sure that had Mr !Lahey continued to be the owner of the saw-mills which the Government purchased from him, they would have been working continuously during the last nine or ten months, and there would have been no",68,Joseph Cook N O System Of More Satisfactory Home And One Which

Experiments had to be made, and Lahey, it is incumbent upon the Minister to explain why work at those mills has not been proceeding. It is quite evident that the interests of the Commonwealth have been subordinated to private business interests, and the statement made by the Minister( Mr Rodgers) last night that the day-labour system of house construction is to give plaoe to the contract system orable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector is evidence of the fact that business interests have made their representations, and their dictation is to be obeyed by the loyal servants who now represent them on the Treasury bench. The statement that the failure of the day-labour system is reService Homes Commission should be insponsible for this complete change of policy is a mean and paltry excuse. It appears to be the policy of the Government to, at all times, disparage the working man, and throw upon his shoulders 'the responsibility for any blunders in public Departments. The working men will amply justify their part in this scheme, but it will be difficult for the Government to defend theirs. Their change of policy is evidence that the Government desire to conserve, not so much the interests of the soldiers and the people generally, but rather the interests of private enterprise. They have again shown their incompetence, and that they have not sufficient acumen to control the destinies of the Commonwealth and promote the best interests of its citizens. During the time. I have been a member of this House no Government activity has been more frequently debated than that of repatriation in all its phases, including War Service Homes, land settlement, and so forth. I have always held the opinion that the petty activities of in a debate relating to the welfare of the returned soldiers, and I feel sure that that opinion would be endorsed unanimously by the House and the country. I awaited anxiously the statement made by the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers) last night, and I now feel confident that better times are in store for soldiers reMr Lahey was asked by quiring homes. The Minister stated quite clearly what the future programme of the Government will be. I remind the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin), that in regard to repatriation As the Governthere were no blazed trails and no precedents. That is a fact we should not overmistakes were also made. There have been deplorable instances of bungling in carrying into effect the efforts of a grateful nation on behalf of its sons who served overseas and their dependants. As other honourable members desire to take part in the debate I will not detain the House, beyond endorsing the remarks of the honLamond) in regard to land settlement. I wish to impress upon the Government that it is just as necessary that an investigation should be held into soldier settlements as it was that the work of the War quired into. There is no doubt that whilst there have been successes in some soldier settlements, there have been also failures and a great deal of disappointment, and I trust that the Government will take the earliest opportunity of consulting with the various State Governments to see if anything can be done to improve the conditions of soldier settlers. Whatever else we may do, we may very well congratulate the Assistant Minister( Mr Rodgers) upon all that he has done for soldiers since the outbreak of war. There is not a hamlet in the whole of his district in which he has not formed a committee and established a fund for the benefit of local soldiers on their return from the Front. I do not think that any country has ever done so much for its soldiers as has Australia.

I have yet to meet the man who makesLno mistakes. I have a little faul t to find with the Department in regard to the making of 'valuations. Local Committees have been appointed in all towns, but their valuations have been absolutely ignored. I heard one honourable member say that it was difficult to trust them. But, if the Local Committees cannot be trusted, I do not know who can. There are District Committees throughout South Australia whose ex-' perience and knowledge are available to the Department, and I am sorry that their assistance is not availed of as it should be. I hope that in future the District Committees w ill be asked for their valuations of land. Fortunately, in my own district, the valuations of cottages have been 'all right, and, in some cases, the committee have recommended the purchase of estates that were both good and cheap.

TurningA to another phase of the question, I do nofc see why a soldier should not be able to buy his own house if he desires to, and I believe he could do so much more cheaply than by waiting u n t i l , perhaps, a larger hojise is built for him. I congratulate the Assistant Minister on the stand he has taken in regard to the contract system, because it is eminently desirable that the soldier should know exactly how much he has to pay. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr. Charlton), who is an honest and reliable man, has told us that in the case of houses built under the contract system he has known the bricks used to crumble in the hand, and that, of course, is extremely unfair to the soldier. I am certain that if such a thing occurred, the Assistant Minister did not know of it or he would have quickly put things right. The honourable gentleman is very much in earnest in his work, and is visiting all the States with a view to seeing that the fair thing is done. We are all extremely, proud of our soldiers for paying up as fchey are doing for their homes; and my opinion is fchafc, long before fche time has expired, no money w ill be owing. In any case, if the soldiers do get backward in their payments, I hope they will not be harassed in any way, for they cannot run away with the land, and even if they do I do nofc know not pay for it , they will improve it and prove themselves valuable citizens.

I know of only two Ministers associated with the Department during the period over which his remarks had reference, and those are the Ministeri n another place and himself. That was the impression on my mind, and I regarded it as a kind of speech which can only be criticised as a candid statement of one who found the administration faulty, and ' ' stood up "" to the fact. But what I complain of is that the Assistant Minister tried to r i d himself of responsibilities by throwing the blame for the bungling on a system which he described as the day-labour system. It is characteristic of some Governments, when they find themselves in a position of this kind, to blame their opponents; and we of the Labour party often find people attempting to throw responsibilities for their own wrong-doing on this side of the House. -The Assistant Minister complained of the day-labour system, b u t I may tell him that his remarks were diametrically opposed to those made by the Minister, SenatorE . D . Millen himself at tbe opening of the cottages in the Coburg district. I happen to have with me the copy of the A r a m , in which there is a report of the remarks of SenatorE . D . Millen, who contrasted the day-labour system with the contract system; and I wish to put those remarks on record as an arswer to those made by .the Assistant Minister last night. According to the ArgusReferring to the system' of day labour as against contract labour, Senator Millen said that he had always been against day labour, and when the Commonwealth scheme was launched the one idea was that the contract system should be adopted. The contractors, however; were not willing to tender within the price fixed by the Act, and the Commission undertook the work. The average eost of the cottages' at Bell was £695 l is . 5d. each, including the land. Originally tenders were called fbr the erection of the homes, and the prices offered ranged from £720' to £900, exclusive of the cost of the land. The actual cost of the. homes included land, fencing, reticulation, wiring, and the provision of ail necessary accessories. The frontages were from 46 to 69 feet, with an average depth of 111 feet, and the soldiers who were fortunate enough to take possession. would pay a rent up to 18s. 6d. weekly, including Hates and insurance. situated 1 statement was made at the opening of the cottages at Bell, to which tlie honourable member for Grampians and other honourable .members were invited. It is a complete answer to the statement made by the Assistant Minister when he endeavoured to throw the responsibility for the shortcomings of his Department on to the day-labour system. The correct thing for the Assistant Minister to do would be to accept the responsibility for the bungling that has been going on. He could not say that a Labour Government was to blame, and so he sought to prove that the difficulty had arisen in consequence of effect being given to one of the planks of the platform of the Labour party. As a rule the Assistant Minister is very fair, but in his speech last night he blamed the system,, which was unjust. The Minister for Repatriation, in the speech which I quoted, proves conclusively that the statement made by the Assistant Minister last night was incorrect. patriation used figures supplied to h i m . The weakening came in January, when the completed cost was £ 8 3 5 . figures I have quoted were for completed cottages,.'including the land. It is only fair to compare completed cottages, including land. Those constructed under -the contract system did not include the land, and showed a margin of £200 in favour of the day-labour system. is very gratifying to have a statement from the Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers) concerning the administration of the Department. The statements I made, when. Parliament first assembled, have proved to be correct, as the costs have proved to be much higher than were anticipated.

450,Mr Erancis ( H E N T Y ) [10.43],"I tbeen found very difficult to proceed as we desire. The conditions which have prevailed recently have hampered the Department to a great extent; but notwithstanding the difficulties, I believe the Department could have rendered better service. As a result of the unusual circumstances, many honourable members have been placed in a difficult position in endeavouring to make a satisfactory explanation to their constituents. The Assistant Minister has said that it is now considered necessary to call in.the assistance of outsiders in order to place the work of the Department on a sound basis. So far as my experience goes, I believe that the rank and file of the Department have rendered good servioe, all of them earnestly desiring to assist those with whom they fought on the other side of the world. are houses in my district that have taken twelve months to construct, and if soldiers have to wait for an unreasonable time before their requests are complied with, dissatisfaction will continue. introduction of the contract system may be a means of expediting the work, but I cannot understand why the Department decline to purchase' unoccupied houses already constructed-that is, if they have been buil t by reputable contractors. prepared to operate on this basis, and the Department should institute a method of purchasing on a similar system, provided that the houses are valued by experts. I do not agree with the Assistant Minister when he says that houses can be built cheaper under the contract system, because dwellings built under the day labour system, if properly supervised, 'are better than those built by contract. As I understand the Government wish to bring forward new business, I shall not discuss the general administration of the Department f u r t h e r ; but I trust the new programme will prove of benefit to the large number of men who are still waiting for homes. Question resolved in the affirmative. ' POST ANDTELEGRAPHBIL L (1921). That leave be given to bring in a Bill for ties were empowered to devise a scale l an Act to: amend tbe Post, and Telegraph Act which would apportion this £275,000 JflOJ-lfllG. B ill presented, and read a first time. General) [10.51] -(by leave) I move That this BiU be now read a second time. This is a B ill to make two amendments in section 18 of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901-16. Section 17 of the principal Act provides thatThe principal railway official of every State, or the owner, controller or manager of any railway or tramway in any State, shall carry mails on any train run upon the railways or tramways' under his control if required by the Postmoster-Ueneral so to do, and shall provide all usual facilities for the receipt, carriage and delivery of all mails that he is required to carry. Section 18 provides thatThere The Postmaster-General shall pay to the principal railway ofticial of each State, or to the owner, controller or manager of any railway or tramway in any State, as the ease may be, sueh annual sum for the receipt, carriage and delivery of mails and for all facilities proThe vided in connection therewith as may be agreed upon and in default of agreement as may be settled by arbitration . . . Unfortunately, that provision does not lay down the basis upon which payment is to be made. Prior to Federation both Departments were controlled by the Financial institutions are States, and it was merely a case of taking the money out .of one pocket and putting it into the other, and, therefore, the amount debited to the Post Office by the Railwaysf o r the carriage of mails was upon a purely arbitrary basis. No particular care was taken in determining the amount that should actually be so debited. W it h the inauguration of Federation it was agreed that the amount to be paid the State Railway Departments should be equal to the total amount that had been paid by the individual States. Between 1901 and 1907, the Railways pressed for increased payment for carriage of mails, but their requests were not based on any evidence of cost of service, and the Postal Department strongly resisted their demands. In 1907, however, as the result of a conference between the parties, it was agreed that the Post Office should make payment of a lump sum of £275,000 per annum for conveyance of mails by railway.

451,Motion (By Mr Wise ) Agreed To,,73,Second Reading
452,Mr Wise (Gippsland,"Postmasteroriginal £234,000. was on a line-mileage scale. In 1908, an agreement was entered into to cover a period of eight years, payment to be computed on the scale to which I have referred. That agreement terminated in 1916. A conference was then held between the Railway authorities and the Postmaster-General, w it h a view to the preparation of a fresh arrangement. Agreement was reached on practically all the points at issue except the rate of payment. The Railways insisted that in any negotiation the amount then paid should be taken as the minimum basis. The Postal Department, however, contended that the then existing rate was excessive. Failing agreement the matter was submitted to arbitration under section 18 of the Post and Telegraph Act, and it was mutually agreed that the InterState Commission should act as arbitrator. The Department contended before the Commission that payment for carriage of mails should be in relation to cost of service. The Commission, in a majority report, awarded that the annual sum to be paid by the Postmaster-General to the principal railway official in each State should be. 50 per cent, of the scheduled State railway rates for parcels, intra and Inter-State, in force on 1st January, 1917. In other words, it was decided that the highest rate for the carriage of goods by the Railway Departments should be adopted. The reason why 50 per cent, of the rates was fixed upon was that, in handling parcels, the railways were involved in services such as booking, & c , which did not apply to-mails. The award was made binding for only one year. The Chief Commissioner, in a minority report, disagreed with this finding, contending that the payment to the railways should represent the amount incurred in giving the service. He concluded his finding, as follows(1) The State Governments would be acting in contravention of law iF they taxed the mails by classifying them as commodities in their schedules of railway rates. (2) That the Arbitrators ought not to do inI t is also proposed to insert after the directly for the States what it would be illegal word "" arbitration "" in section 18 the for the States to do directly. (3) That it was contemplated by Parliament that the State railways should perform witli the Federal Post Office the joint service of mail carriage on the basis of being recouped for expense. W --. Wise. The apportionment (4) That the only evidence before the Arbitrators by whichthey can evaluate the expense of carrying the mails is that of the ton-mile cost on all traffic, which must therefore be taken as a basis. I u order to determine the amount of payment to be made to the Railway Departments in accordance w it h the award, the weights of mails consigned by rail were taken in March, 1918. On tliese weights, payment was computed at the rate of £184,296 per annum. The State Railways were paid at this rate from 1st January, 1917, to 31st .December, 1920, plus £7,500 per annum, for conveyance of second class overseas mail matter. In October, 1.920, the mails were again weighed. The weights taken, computed at half parcels rates operating on 1st January, 1917, would involve payment at the rate of £230,683 per annum, an increase of £46,387 per annum. The railways declined to accept payment as from 1st January, 1921, on the basis of the parcels rate3 operating on 1st January, 1917, demanding that it should be computed on the parcels rates operating on 1st January last. If payment were so made, on the weighings of October, 1920, an amount of £352,956 per annum would be involved The Postal Department, therefore, would have to pay £168,660 ' per annum more than the amount determined under the award-a n increase of approximately 91 per cent. In addition to that, we would be at the entire mercy of the Railway Departments of the various States, since they could determine from time to time what increase in their railway charges should be made. It is not possible for a mutual agreement to be arrived at, and it is necessary, therefore, to go to arbitration again. In order that there may be laid down a basis upon which the arbitrators shall act, we propose to amend section 18 of the principal Act by omitting therefrom the words "" the receipt, carriage, and delivery of mails, and for all facilities provided in connection therewith,"" and inserting in their stead the words "" rendering any service required in pursuance of the last preceding section."" words ' ' on the basis of the actual expense estimated to have been incurred in rendering such service."" I hope the motion will be agreed to. Mt. OHABXTON (Hunter) [10.59] This is a very necessary measure. We have beeu paying large sums to the State Railway Departments for the carriage of our mail-matter, and this Bill merely proposes to amend the principal Act in order that a definite _ basis may be laid down for the guidance of the arbitrators. I know of no better way of settling a dispute between the States and the Commonwealth than by referenoe to arbitration, and, that being eo, I shall not discuss the question further. AlthoughI am pleased to' facilitate the passage of a Bill of this character, it seems rather strange that the Postmaster General should be prepared to submit the question of what the Government should pay for the carriage of its mails to arbitration, but at the same time desire to lay down the conditions under which the arbitrators shall bring in their, verdict. Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) speaking the other night advocated the charging of a profit of 20 per cent, on importaresolution. tions; but are we to understand that the States are to be reimbursed only the actual expenditure that they incur in the carriage of mails, and are to be allowed no profit? That strikes me as unfair.
