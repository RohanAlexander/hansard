275,Mr Costello,The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the,91,Questions On Notice
276,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Transport And Regional Services, Upon Notice, On","(3) Have the failure rates of the Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS) equipment increased in the period July 1999 to May 2000; if so, why. (4) What are the failure rates for the TAAATS equipment for June and July 2000. (5) Has he had discussions with Airservices Australia about the concerns of the Civil Air union published in the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 July 2000; if so, what was the substance of the discussions and how does Airservices Australia plan to deal with the concerns. Airservices has advised the following in response to Questions (1) to (4): (1) A response to this question would require an inefficient use of resources as it would be very difficult, costly and would take considerable time to provide an exact number of operational changes that would have affected the management of air traffic at Sydney Airport over such an extended period. Operational changes at Sydney Airport from April 1996, range from minor to very significant and encompasses changes in the extent of traffic management and other responsibilities at Sydney Airport, including moving sections to Melbourne and Brisbane en-route, deletion of Airways Data Systems Officer (ADSO) positions and changes to Flight Services. The period also includes the introduction of the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP), new modes of operation, curfew operations, and the introduction of TAAATS. Details of changes affecting air traffic management are promulgated in a number of forms including a Request for Change, amendments to the Manual of Air Traffic Services (MATS), Aeronautical Information Publication Supplementary (AIP SUP), changes and in Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs). While a number of these are permanent many are temporary and apply for only short periods and pertain to certain situations or circumstances. (2) No major initiatives have been programmed within the defined period. Ongoing routine changes to documentation occurred as part of normal business, and in support of the Olympics. A number of enabling activities for the Olympics were carried out, mostly affecting Sydney. These included facilities changes to enable better traffic management and coordination at Bankstown and Hoxton Park. A TAAATS Data upgrade was undertaken in early September – this was a routine activity. Some preplanned air route changes and temporary restricted areas came into effect during the Olympic period. (3) TAAATS employs high levels of equipment redundancy and duplication, however, a fault does not usually imply a loss of service to the controllers. Within the TAAATS system the Voice Switch Control System and Eurocat fault data does show a moderate increase in the fault rate during this period. The increase is primarily due to three causes: an increase in the number of systems deployed the proactive, short-term mitigation activities which address an equipment deficiency are recorded as faults; and an increased focus, over the last two months, on accurately capturing fault information. (4) The Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) for the TAAATS Equipment was 2900 Hours in June 2000 and 3000 Hours in July 2000. In terms of significant failure notifications, there were 3 for June and 4 for July in respect of the Voice Switch Control System, and 12 for June and 17 for July in respect of Eurocat. The July Eurocat data were impacted by the introduction of tactical flow control software, with the figure for August reducing to 2. (5) The Deputy Prime Minister holds frequent discussions with Airservices Australia on a wide range of issues. It would have an adverse effect on the provision of full and frank advice to the Minister if the details of such discussions were disclosed.

Aviation and Maritime Services: Board Expenses (Question No. 1861) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 28 August 2000: What was the total sum, on an itemised basis, spent by (a) Airservices Australia (b) the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and (c) the Australian Maritime Safety Authority on Board expenses including remuneration, travel, accommodation, provision of laptop computers, facsimile machines or other office equipment, reimbursements for other Board member expenses and any hospitality in each year since 1995. Airservices Australia has advised the following: Itemised Board expenses for Airservices Australia are provided at Attachment A. (Copies of the Attachment are available from the House of Representatives Table Office) Airservices’ Board may consist of not more than nine members. The Board operates four sub committees being, the Audit Sub Committee, the Safety and Environment Sub Committee, the Remuneration Sub Committee and the Olympics Security Sub Committee. In 1999/2000 there were thirty three meetings of the Board and its Committees. Remuneration costs will vary with the number of appointees on the Board in any year. The Remuneration Tribunal set remuneration levels for Board members. Administrative costs in 1995/1996 and 1999/2000 include CEO search costs. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has advised the following: Itemised Board expenses for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is provided at Attachment B.

One other Board Committee, the Board Safety Committee operated in",92,Questions On Notice
278,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:previous financial years. The Committee met once early in the period 1999/2000 before being disbanded with its responsibilities passing to the Executive Safety Committee. Remuneration costs will vary with the number of appointees in the Board in any year. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has advised the following: The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) advises that its accounting system does not detail expenditure on travel, accommodation, office equipment, expenses and hospitality for Board members for the complete period. The provision of annual totals for expenditure of Board members could only be extracted by examination of individual records. AMSA advises that the expenditure figures in 1999-2000 would be indicative of the relative level of expenditure in preceding years as both policy and practice has not changed over the period. Remuneration Section 15 of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 provides that AMSA Board members’ remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. The Remuneration Tribunal’s Determination 1999/03 consolidated as at 18 May 1999 provided the following annual rate of fees for AMSA Board members for 1999-2000: The Chairman: $38,000 The Deputy Chairman $25,000 Board Members: $16,600 Board members who are members of the Audit Committee received an additional fee of $5,000 per annum. The Deputy Chairman and two members of the Board are members of AMSA’s Audit Committee. The total remuneration to non-executive Board members for each financial year since 1995 is as follows: 1994-1995: $108,894 1995-1996: $96,141 1996-1997: $99,614 1997-1998: $114,766 1998-1999: $138,331 1999-2000: $134,024 Travel and Accommodation AMSA provides Business Class air travel and a taxi hire car as required by Board members to attend AMSA Board meetings and conduct Board business. The Remuneration Tribunal’s Determination 1999/03 consolidated as at 18 May 1999 provided that AMSA Board members were entitled to receive a Travelling Allowance during 1999-2000 per overnight stay of $350 in Sydney, $290 in other capital cities and $200 in other than a capital city. The total expenditure on travel and accommodation for Board members in 1999-2000 was $86,927. Office Equipment AMSA provides Board members with telephone, facsimile and computer facilities to assist in conducting Board business if these facilities are not otherwise available to them. In 1999-2000, one Board member was provided with a computer and modem connection to facilitate the transfer of messages and documents electronically. Expenditure Reimbursement and Hospitality Hospitality is not provided to Board members except in circumstances where other stakeholders are involved. AMSA may arrange hospitality if an activity is associated with progressing AMSA’s interests such as engagements with national or regional industry representatives. It would not be possible to distinguish expenditure on hospitality for Board members from other guests. Fuel Grants Scheme: Expenditure (Question No. 1893) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 30 August 2000: (1) What proportion of the Government’s Fuel Grant Scheme was paid to (a) BP, (b) Shell, (c) Caltex and (d) Mobil in July 2000.

(1) This information is not available due to the privacy restrictions of Section 47 of the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000. (2) These estimates are not published. Estimates of annual excise revenue from petrol, and total GST revenue are published in the Commonwealth Budget Papers and in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Small Business: Research Funding (Question No. 1894) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 30 August 2000: What sum was allocated for small business research in the 2000-2001 Budget.

Roads: West Shepparton Bypass (Question No. 1988) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: Further to question No. 1805 ( Hansard, 2 November 2000, page P19577) concerning the proposed Goulburn Valley Shepparton Highway bypass, has the Government undertaken work on all the by-pass options; if so, what is the nature of the work undertaken and the associated costings of the road work. Prior to the Victorian Government’s current review of environmental factors on the Western route, the initial Environmental Effects Statement (EES), undertaken by the Victorian Government, assessed in detail the economic, social, heritage and environmental impacts of central, western and eastern alignments for the proposed bypass. The EES estimated construction costs of the alignments are: the western route at $246 million; the eastern route at $251 million; and the central route at $291 million.

Perth Airport: Flight Paths (Question No. 1990) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) How many flights per week are made by Fokker F27 aircraft in and out of Perth airport. (2) What rules or regulations determine the flight paths followed by these aircraft.

(4) Would the use by these aircraft of the jet flight paths reduce the noise for residents. (5) What steps is the Government taking to reduce the impact of Fokker 27 noise on Perth residents. (1) Airservices Australia has advised that 5 arrivals and 5 departures per week by Fokker F27 take place at Perth Airport on a regular basis, plus an occasional non-scheduled flight. (2) Airservices advises that non-jet aircraft with a maximum take off weight greater than 5,700kgs, including the Fokker F27, would normally be required to follow standard arrival and departure procedures as set out in Airservices’ ‘Aeronautical Information Publication’ (AIP) section for Perth Airport.",96,Questions On Notice
282,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,97,Questions On Notice
283,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) and (4) I am advised that, while in some circumstances the mixing of slower propeller aircraft, such as the Fokker F27 with faster jet aircraft is not practicable to achieve separation assurance, Fokker F27 aircraft generally do use established arrival and departure procedures set out in the AIP, when operating at Perth Airport. For example, Airservices advises that when departing from runway 21, the preferred main runway at Perth Airport for takeoffs, Fokker F27 aircraft use the Standard Instrument Departure (SID) flight path used by jet aircraft, until the aircraft is above 6,000 feet, or is clear of populated areas and east of the Darling Escarpment. Fokker F27 departures from runway 06 follow the same flight track as used by jet aircraft, to the Parkerville locator, about 9 nautical miles from the Airport, where the aircraft would normally be over 3,000 feet, before taking up their assigned track. Departures from runway 03 turn right after passing 1,000 feet, and track direct to the Parkerville locator. This flight path is consistent with that followed by jet aircraft departing from runway 06. Airservices advises that inbound Fokker F27 aircraft generally utilise the same Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) as jet aircraft. However, on the infrequent occasions when Fokker F27 aircraft are not able to use STAR procedures, F27s are radar vectored to join the pattern of arriving aircraft. (5) Perth Airport management has established a Noise Management Committee (NMC) which has industry, community and government bodies represented. The NMC has developed a noise management strategy for Perth Airport and meets regularly to implement the strategy, and to address specific concerns of the community over matters such as aircraft noise.

(4) What days and hours is on line access available at each Job Network provider. (5) What proportion of Job Network providers have more than one internet access computer or touch screen. (1) All Centrelink Customer Service Centres and Youth Servicing Units (not co-located with their Customer Service Centre Branch) are provided with touch screen units; in all 321 sites. The number of units allocated range from single units in smaller offices to over fifteen in some of the larger sites.

287,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The reported underspend is not significant in terms of the overall appropriations available to the portfolio. The reported underspend is less than 1% of the total appropriation of just over $11 billion. Attaining an outcome which is over 99% accurate is an achievement which would be well regarded against any international benchmark. (2) Programme Title Underspend Reason (a) Support for New Ap$71.5m The primary reason for the actual expense being prenticeships less than the estimated expense is that employers are not taking up, to the extent anticipated, the financial incentives available to them through the New Apprenticeships Incentive Programme. The Department is working with the New Apprenticeships Centre Network to ensure that employers are aware of their entitlements. (b) Quality Outcomes $17.1m The primary reason for the actual expense being less than the estimated expense is due to a six month delay in the implementation of the Quality Teacher programme as a result of longer than expected negotiations with the relevant jurisdictions. A carry over of $16.4m to 2000-01 has been approved by the Department of Finance and Administration. (c) Tasmanian Tourism $3.2m Longer than anticipated negotiations with the and Training Initiative Tasmanian Department of Education resulted in a delay in the commencement of payments under this programme. A carry over of $3.2m to 2000-01 has been approved by the Department of Finance and Administration. (d) Jobs Pathway $6.9m Funding allocated to the Jobs Pathway Programme has been fully committed. The apparent underspend is due to these commitments being expensed over both 1999-2000 and 2000-01 in accordance with the agreements’ payments schedules. A carry over of $6.3m to 2000-01 has been approved by the Department of Finance and Administration. (e) Literacy and Nu$30.3m Referral activity and training commencements meracy were lower than anticipated in 1999-00 despite a significant increase over those in 1998-99.
