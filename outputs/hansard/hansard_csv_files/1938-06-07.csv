If so, will ho correct the statement '< and I can only suppose that the newspaper must have :hecn under some misunderstanding in publishingsuch a statement. Even ut the worse period of the depression, according to the census returns, .the number of persons in mid1933, who had incomes of £4 a week and over, was considerably in excess of 500,000. The economic conditions are now immensely better than they were in 1933, and the total number of persons whose incomes arc not under £4 must be well over 500.000. The misunderstanding may have ariscu because of an unjustified assumption that federal taxpayers are the only persons with incomes of £4 a week and over, but that is a different matter, because, for federal taxation purposes, the statutory deductions and various other deduction?, such as those for wives and children, are made from the income -before the, taxable amount is determined.

Question not answered. the House a copy of an informative memorandum that has been published at my direction 'by the Commissioner for Taxation regarding rates of Commonwealth and State Taxation. AIR MAIL . I have received from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely "" The Empire airmail service, and the distribution of the mails to the States of the Commonwealth "". Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion, movingThat tlie House do now adjourn, I desire to direct attention to a matter of urgent public importance namely "" Empire air-mail services, and the distribution of such mail to the States of the Commonwealth"". I think it will be acknowledged by honourable members generally that, notwithstanding a series of interrogations, and the replies which they have elicited, there still exists a great deal of uncertainty, and a good deal of confusion, regarding the manner in which the Empire air-mail service is to be operated, and the extent to which the inland mail services of Australia will be affected when the overseas service is inaugurated. The Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) has said that a preliminary service will begin to operate in July, and that the full service will probably be operating in August. Thus, there is to be initiated -within approximately four weeks, an air-mail service which is to be the subject of an agreement between the Government of tlie Commonwealth and the Government of the United Kingdom, and yet, notwithstanding repeated assurances by the previous Minister for Defence, the Parliament has not yet been given any details regarding what the service will involve, and the conditions under which it will operate. I direct attention to the fact that this is no new thing. In May, 1937, the Acting Prime Minister( Sir Earle Page) sta tedI am gratified tliat the long negotiations between the Governments of tlie United Kingdom and Australia, regarding the Empire nir mail, liave resulted in agreement on all points which had originally been at issue. The scheme to be put into operation in the time taken in the transmission of mail by air, and the cost thereof to the sender. These results w ill be achieved without interfering w i th air mail development in Australia or reducing that measure of control by Australia over the Singapore-Sydney section, which the Commonwealth Government regards as essential. At that time, I asked the then Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) when it was intended that Parliament would have an opportunity to study the agreement between the Commonwealth and the Government of the United Kingdom, and he replied as followsThere are certain matters of detail outstanding, but I believe I am entitled to say that the investigation .and the consideration of the proposals is approaching finality. When that stage is reached, a f u l l statement will be made on it at the earliest possible date, I think I was entitled to construe that reply to mean that the statement would be made to this Parliament, but yesterday the present Minister for Defence evidently made certain statements to newspaper",17,Undesirable Literatur E Embargo

76,Mr Curtin (Fremantle) [3.33],"I nreporters. Whether those statements were in fact accurate or not, it is at least true that the Minister must have discussed the matter yesterday with reporters, and must have had in mind the fact that the service was to commence in about four weeks; and this, notwithstanding the fact that frequent questions in this House have failed to elicit so much information, and that even to-day a further series of questions failed to clear up important and fundamental matters incidental to the inauguration of the service. with it. They referred to the internal distribution of mails. tion of mails is an integral feature of the overseas mail service, and I decline to accept the suggestion tliat the Empire air-mail service consists merely in delivering mails to Darwin and Sydney. There is far more in the inauguration of this service than the department has yet provided for. In 1935, the then Minister for External Affairs( Sir George Pearce), in a statement made at Perth, said that meteorological data would have to be collected, landing places prepared, and a ground organization created before the service could be put into operation. I accepted that statement, believing those things to be an essential feature of the service. In July of last year, in Record Series No. 11, issued by the Government Publicity Officer, the achievements of the Lyons Government were set out in these terms:In the forefront of the achievements is tlie establishment of a direct air-rnail connection between Australia and England, by means of an Australian-controlled and operated service between Brisbane and Singapore, the terminal of the Imperial Airways Service, of London. At the same time, it was decided to re-organize forwarded from London to Sydney by and develop internal subsidized air services to connect them to the main trunk services. That statement, I repeat, was issued in July last. To-day the Minister for Defence says that arrangements have been made for the Western Australian mail to go from Darwin to Perth, and the South Australian mail from Darwin to Adelaide. I ask him will these mails carry a surcharge, in addition to the ordinary air-mail charges from London? The people of Australia and this Parliament should be told definitely what is involved in the agreement. The honourable gentleman is silent; he will not reply to my direct question. has nothing to do with the Empire airmail agreement. it has; but I am saying that delivery of the overseas air mail to the various States is part of the programme for which, last year, the Government claimed credit when it entered into the agreement with Imperial Airways. We were told that the Government had decided to reorganize and develop internal subsidized air services to connect 'them with the main trunk services. services besides the two which the honourable gentleman has mentioned. it a fact that the air mail to Perth will involve two mail charges-on e from London to Darwin, and a surcharge from Darwin to Perth? be made at the proper time, but not to suit the Leader of the Opposition or anybody else. obliged to suit me, but he has an obligation to the people.

90,Mr Curtin,"No w we know that the man knows nothing of the kind. think either that I am very thick in the head, or that I am capable of reading more than one meaning to a plain statement of fact. If the internal distribution of air mails from overseas is not provided for in the agreement, that explains why a letter for Perth, after having been sorted at Darwin and sent iby an internal airmail service, would carry two stamps-on e from London to Darwin and the other from Darwin to Perth. But we must be consistent. Why should letters addressed to citizens of Sydney or Brisbane be delivered as part of the Empire air-mail service without surcharge from Darwin, whilst letters addressed to citizens of Perth, Melbourne, Adelaide or Hobart carry a surcharge? The Government is giving us a piebald air-mail service. We on this side anticipated that this unsatisin a position to say what are the details factory feature would result from the negotiations and that is why we urged repeatedly that Parliament should be given an opportunity to review the agreement before the negotiations were completed. The present Minister for Defence was an Assistant Minister in the previous Administration, so he must be well aware that the former Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) repeatedly assured us that, before the service w-as inaugurated, Parliament would be taken into the confidence of the Government. Yet, to-day, a committee is meeting in Melbourne to decide, among other things, the date'for the inauguration of the service, notwithstanding that the Minister has not yet made to this Parliament a complete statement of what is involved for the Commonwealth and the various States. Furthermore, we do not know what contribution the Government contemplates making by way of subsidy either to the Empire mail service or to the internal services as a relevant part of the general scheme. I remind the honourable gentleman that, in the early stages of the negotiations, there was a conflict of opinion between the former Minister for Defence and overseas interests, due to that Minister's insistence that the developvices.

I see no reason why a satisfactory agreement should not be reached. I am not of the agreement, because the Minister has not taken Parliament into his confidence; but I would be satisfied with an Empire air-mail service that radiated from Darwin and ensured the delivery of Australian internal mails by Australian air services. Such an arrangement would render the greatest possible service to people in the various States. The honourable gentleman has himself to thank for this situation. I had hoped that there would be no occasion to do more than ask for a statement setting out the general position of the Empire air-mail services; but when I read in the files on the subject a letter signed by the then Minister for Defence in which he made specific statements about the Government's intentions, and realized that Parliament had not yet been informed of the arrangements made, I feel amply justified in the action which I have taken to-day. The Minister might think it sufficient for the Government to make the agreement. I remind him that this is a democracy, and that Parliament should be consulted in respect of any agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the United Kingdom with regard to Empire air-mail sertell us precisely what is in the agreement, what will be the cost involved in delivering the mails to the various States, or",19,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

I do not expect that the Government should refer to Parliament the details of the agreement for the Empire air-mail service before that agreement is completed. Necessarily the details must be hammered out by the Government before it can be submitted to Parliament. But, now that the agreement has been completedI assume that it has been from the fact that the service is soon to commence-Parliamen t should have the details in order that it should have opportunity to express any views that it might feel disposed to express in respect of the work that the Government has done. which the Commonwealth is a party is legal until it has been ratified by Parliament. complaint is that the agreement has not been put before Parliament up to the present and that it seems that, as with many other agreements, it will be thrown on the table on the last day of the sitting when there will be no opportunity for discussion in detail. My purpose in speaking, however, is to discuss, not so much the general question of reference of the agreement to Parliament, as the report that the distributions of the mails from Darwin will not begin for about twelve months. The announcement that arrangements would be made for the mails to be distributed from Darwin to the several States was satisfactory to the whole of Australia, but the statement that there will be twelve months' delay is far from satisfactory. ment? made in the press. i responsible for what appears in the press. he is not responsible for statements in newspapers is the only reply that we can get from -the Minister. I mentioned this matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Eriday. Before doing so I informed the Minister of my intentions. For business reasons, or otherwise, the Minister left the House almost immediately. In a further effort to Obtain information as to whether the report had any foundation, I put a question on the notice-paper and asked the Minister to make a statement. To-day he came into the House and said that he had not seen the question. Previously, in his replies to two or three skirmishing questions touching on the same subject, he did not touch on the main issue, which is whether there is any substance in the newspaper reports. I feel sure that, if the Minister did not see my question, he did see the reports in the press and that he should at least have given some consideration to a matter in which the people are interested. I now ask whether there is anything in the report that the distribution of mails from Darwin is not likely to commence for another twelve months? We have some good ground for asking for an assurance from the Minister that there will be no such inordinate delay. The official side of the Postmaster-General's Department has raised obstacles because it wants the distribution to be made from -Sydney and I concede that that difficulty has to be overcome. Nevetheless, the public of Australia, that is the people outside of New South Wales, want to know how long it will be before Darwin will become the centre from which the mails will be distributed? The Minister could have obviated the need for this motion and could even now bring the discussion to a close if he gave honourable members the best assurance that he can give that the establishment of Darwin as the base will be delayed no longer than is absolutely necessary. [3.55] I regret that the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) should have to sit at the table like a glorified postmaster and listen to the debate, but that he has to do so is due to the fact that he has far too much work on his hands. As I have said before in this House, so long as he elects to hold all of the positions that he holds to-day, he must expect his time, which shou-ld be occupied in dealing with far more important issues, to be taken up as it is being taken up to-day.",20,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

I say that without hesitation. the party room, and has nothing to do with the motion. great deal of sympathy with the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). It is fifteen months since I left the Ministry and even when I was a MinisterI was heartily ashamed of the delay in the inauguration of the overseas air-mail service. Since then that delay of which I was ashamed has gone on for another fifteen months. The Minister for Defence is not responsible for all of it, but the matter seems to be dragging on as hopelessly to-day as it was two years ago. I cannot for a moment understand why there should be delay in the .making of a plain statement as to how the mails will be distributed after they arrive at Darwin. Provided the machines are available, the problem of making the distribution from Darwin could be settled in two or three hours'. sary is available and could be put into operation now. not announce what the arrangements are to be ? Why all this deferring from hour to hour and from day to day? Why not tell us at question time that which we want to know? I shall put the question simply once more to the Minister. I understand that the mails are to be taken direct from Darwin to Perth and Adelaide. We want to know whether there is to be any surcharge for thecarriage .of the mails from Darwin to those two cities? We are left in the dark as to whether the mails are to be taken by air direct from Sydney to Melbourne and Hobart. In a statement to-day the Minister said that the carriage of the mails from Sydney to Melbourne and Hobart would depend on the time of arrival at Sydney. Are we to depend the honourable solely on day flying? Aerodrome after aerodrome is being prepared for night landing, and beacon after beacon is being erected to make night flying safe. Does the Minister tell me that mails which arrive in Sydney at 5 o'clock on a winter's night are not to go on to their destination in Melbourne that night for distribution in the early morning? Surely the whole purpose of the overseas air-mail service is to save every hour between the writer of letters in this country and the receiver in the United Kingdom and vice versa. If the arrangements are that mails are to lie in the Sydney post office and then dawdle on to Melbourne by train, a great deal of the expenditure on this air-mail service has been in vain. I advance this further aspect of the matter: Mails that go straight from Darwin to Adelaide will reach Adelaide before the seaplane arrives in Sydney. about the same time! On the next day they will dawdle into Melbourne and some hours later into Hobart. The Minister's reply to-day shows that although the whole affair is in a most chaotic condition, it could be cleared up by two or three hours of clear thinking. [4.0] I support the motion. The House is discussing a matter of urgent public importance which affects, I think, everybody in Australia, including my constituents who have a great deal to expect from the development of the overseas air servioes. There is a lot more to be considered in this matter than the mere question of pounds, shillings and pence, because Darwin is all-British and must be maintained as an airport. ""As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has pointed out, the arrangements seem to be in a state of flux, and I am fearful that, if we do not take care, we shall soon have to contend with the rivalry of an American air-mail service from San Francisco to Australia via New Zealand which will put our service to shame. It seems to me that the immediate job ahead is to arrange for the delivery of the overseas mails by the internal air ""routes.",21,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

115,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"I understand that the British Government, in March, 1937, adopted an Imperial air-mail policy under which mail3 are carried to any part of the Empire, except Australia, for l d . per half-ounce. A At the present time, the air-mail routes from London to Hong Kong, and from London to Cape Town, are so served, but the rate charged on letters destined for Australia is twelve times that on letters sent from London to other dominions which are now, and will be, aerially connected, when the Atlantic service is in operation. lumbering service is to be reduced shortly, but even then it will cost four times as much to send a letter from London to Darwin as from London to Singapore. Now, our graspiug Postal Department proposes to add an internal charge of 3d., I presume, for internal air carriage air services would be used to ensure that of overseas mails. In view of the surplus of the Postal Department, and its extortionate charges, which aro heavier in respect of letters carried across the street Sydney to Melbourne, there will be a in Sydney or Darwin than they are for letters conveyed by air from London to Hong Kong, I consider that the present position is disgraceful. I support this motion, because it gives the Parliament an opportunity to deal with the Government in an appropriate manner. The Parliament should show our profit-hunting Post Office what it thinks of a policy which is the worse kind of advertisement for Australia overseas, and inflicts a burden on the taxpayers whom the department is supposed to serve. motion indicates how ignorant this Parliament is, on the whole, of a national service which is to come into operation loss than a month hence. The Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) stated this afternoon that the Government would announce its policy at the proper time in regard to certain aspects of the overseas air-mail service. If a time less than a month from the commencement of a service of this importance is too early a period for the House and the public to be informed definitely regarding it, I should like to know when the proper time will come. We may reasonably infer from the replies furnished to questions that there is every prospect that business men in some of the capital cities will be expected to pay a surcharge if these mails are carried by air from the point at which they are unshipped from the flying boats. The Minister has given us to understand that, if Melbourne mails are sent from Sydney by air, an additional charge will be imposed. Commercial circles in Melbourne were informed recently that the air mails would be forwarded via Sydney and not by way of Adelaide as had previously been stated. A reply to the protests which they registered was made by the Prime Minister. The rate under our slow, My recollection is that his reply was that a decision had not been reached at that time, but that the matter was still receiving the consideration of the Government, and, if it were found necessary to send the Melbourne mails via Sydney, the internal they would be forwarded with a minimum of ' delay. Tbe latest announcement indicates that even if the mails arc sent by air from surcharge in addition to tliat imposed on mails delivered at Sydney, Brisbane or Darwin. If that is so, it cuts across the principle accepted by post offices throughout the world, of uniformity in postal rates. We do not now charge an additional rate on internal deliveries. delivered by air. mally charged for internal deliveries. We now impose a surcharge on air mails from London to Australia, but, on reaching this country, some of these mails are to be sent to their destination without further charge by the quickest possible . method of transmission, whilst others are to be dispatched to other capital cities at an additional charge. My inference is based on statements made by the Minister for Defence, and if I am wrong, I hope that the Minister will take an immediate opportunity to clear up all doubt on the' matter. If my inference is correct, the extra charge will cause tremendous dissatisfaction in commercial circles through the Commonwealth, with the possible exceptions of Darwin, Brisbane and Sydney. It is thoroughly inequitable if, because flying boats will call at Darwin, Brisbane, and Sydney, the",22,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

It is not entirely the fault of the department that night flying arrangements are not yet complete; I understand that the air companies have not yet installed the necessary equipment on their pi*anes. support what has been said by Victorian members that, even if it is not possible to face tlie cost of night flying between all the capital cities, there is a strong case for carrying mails by night between Sydney and Melbourne. As a representative of one of the smaller States, I recognize that that is the most important mail route in Australia. It is important also from a defence point of view. If otherwise, Melbourne and Hobart are to be the last places in Australia to get overseas air mail, there is a strong case for establishing a night flying link between Sydney and Melbourne ahead of other night flying arrangements between the other capital cities. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) referred to a possible surcharge on letters to Hobart. In my opinion it is inconceivable that any government would increase the charge. Such a suggestion is preposterous. I hope that the Minister will clear up these misunderstandings forthwith, so that the House will be able to get on with the business on the notice-paper. Defence) [4.20] -There is no justification whatever for certain statements made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). Obviously his mind is confused as to the inauguration of the Empire air-mail service, because he repeatedly referred to the internal airmail agreements as if they were part of the Empire air-mail agreement. agreement has nothing whatever to do with the internal distribution of mails within the Commonwealth of Australia. That is a matter entirely in our own hands, and is quite independent of the agreement which has been dra\vn up, but has not yet been signed becaise one or two minor points are still outstanding. Copies of the agreement are in Australia, and are now being considered with a vie""* to finality being reached. A t the proper time, it will be submitted to the Parliament for ratification. The Leader of the Opposition was critical of the delay which he said had taken place in inaugurating this service. It is difficult to say definitely that there has been delay. It is true that as far back as two years ago the Government stated I that it hoped that the air-mail service would be inaugurated in January, 1938, but that statement was made without any definite knowledge of the detailed work that had to be performed before the service could begin. The flying-boats which were under construction when that statement was made, have not long been completed. Several of them are already in Australia, and crews have been trained to handle them. Accommodation for them has had to be provided at the various bases from Darwin to Sydney. The construction of some of these air bases, which are in little known places, such as Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria, is not a simple matter. Karumba, also, is an isolated place at which a complete base has had to be established. 'Before any action could be taken to establish a base at Groote Eylandt it was necessary, first, to carry out an aerial survey to discover whether a suitable base could be found, and then to send naval craft there to make a complete survey of the waters. After considerable investigation, all of which took time, an excellent site .was found at Langdon Inlet, on the north-west corner of the island. ""When the site had been determined, the construction of the base was commenced-, and it is now well advanced. The work was of a difficult nature; all the materials required had to be transported by ship under special charter, there being no established line of steamers running to the island. MoreThat over, no facilities existed there, nor was there any white man resident in the locality. All these difficulties had to be overcome, and a survey of the adjacent areas made, in order to see what would be required to make the base capable of meeting the needs of a flying-boat service. Meteorological investigations have been",24,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

Similar work has been done in connection with all the bases between Darwin and Sydney-a t Groote Eylandt, Karuniba, Townsville, Gladstone and Brisbane, with emergency landing places at other points Considerable clelay was occasioned in securing 'a suitable site in Sydney Harbour for a terminal base. As honourable members know, there was great public agitation-supporte d by some of those persons and sections of the press which to-day criticize the Government for the clelay that has taken place. However, when all these obstacles were overcome, tenders were called for the construction of the slip-way. Everything possible has been done to expedite its construction. After tenders had been called and accepted I even went so far as to offer to the contractor a bonus for every week that he could save in the time of construction, so that the service could be inaugurated with the least possible delay. Whatever delay has occurred, it bas not been in Australia. working to schedule. I am assured that the company is in a position to commence at an early date the preliminary service which the Leader of the Opposition appeared to ridicule. MT. THORBY -The honourable meonber spoke slightingly of the preliminary service to be commenced in' July. On the advice of its expert officers, the company has decided to run a preliminary service for several weeks. The regular mail service will be continued, so that for a time, there will be a little overlapping, but that is necessary in order to prevent any risk of dislocation of the air-mail services of the Commonwealth. Listening to honourable members discussing this subject, an impartial person might have thought that no air-mail service to Australia existed, and that Australia lagged behind the other dominions in this connection. I have been accused of neglecting my responsibility, and of depriving Australia of something which other dominions have. The honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) said tliat I was too busy to pay attention to all the duties of my office. There is no delay in either the Defence Departmentor the Civil Aviation Department. Minister of delay. first time that the honourable member for Henty has accused the department of neglect. I have a fairly difficult task in hand, but the Defence Department has been so well re-organized that I have been relieved of many duties which previously were the responsibility of the Minister for Defence. Technical matters are now entrusted to an increased staff of competent men. The flying boat service will take over the existing air-mail service carried out by land 'planes, but it will run to a faster and more frequent schedule and will provide greater carrying capacity than is possible with land 'planes. The intention is not that every town and hamlet in Australia, or even every capital city, shall be part of. the Empire air-mail service, but that overseas mail shall be expeditiously carried between the United Kingdom and the We are Commonwealth of Australia. Moreover, the original intention was that the mail, having reached the terminus of the overseas service, would be carried to its destination in the ordinary way. Whether the air mail is surcharged or not it will be carried by mail-train, horse, coach or camel, and delivered in the usual way. We have made a substantial saving in the time occupied on the long journey from Europe to Australia. That is where the great loss of time occurred, not in Australia. to making Darwin the terminal. point and having radiating air services from there ? ment has decided that the flying boat service should go to Sydney. If honourable members will look a little more closely at the matter they will discover that Sydney will not be the ultimate terminal. Eventually the service will go on to New Zealand.

Special facilities are being provided in Sydney Harbour to meet the requirements, not only of the Empire flying boat service, but also of the New Zealand flying boat service to be inaugurated probably early next year. The honorahle member for Henty said in the first place that he was ashamed of the delay that had taken place. What delay has taken place ? Australia is being served with an air-mail service at present. What will the new service do? It will provide an improvement, but to hear honourable members on both sides of the House one might think that a saving of two hours in the delivery of the mails is a matter of life and death. One cannot help coming to the conclusion that* various members have only a parochial outlook. Each member seems to speak of his own city, forgetting that there is no human agency that we can employ to deliver the mails to every part of Australia at the same time. With all due respect to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) he cannot put Melbourne any closer to London than it is. I cannot think of any means, except those I have under consideration, to avoid delivering the mails a few hours earlier to some parts than to other parts of Australia. If the honourable member Avere in a position to see the proposals on my table he would probably' appreciate tbe work that has been done, not only by me, but also by every member of the staff associated with me.

147,Mr Thorby,"It involved expendiSydney. We have also carried out a complete survey of the whole of the internal air services of the Commonwealth, and in doiDg that we have agreed to provide a direct service from Darwin to Perth, aud from Darwin to Adelaide, with provision for picking up and setting down mails en route. In doing that we have met the wishes of the Western Australian and South Australian people, by giving them a faster service, and by giving them direct distribution from Darwin to their respective states. In reply to those members who have raised the question of Melbourne, I would point out that under the original arrangement mails are distributed from Sydney in the ordinary way. When the new agreement comes into force, instead of paying the present rates of air-mail postage a very substantial reduction will be brought about. That is known to every honourable member. If the air mail were delivered in Sydney late in the afternoon, very little time would be saved by sending it by air to Melbourne. A matter of only a few hours might be involved. The fact is overlooked that business people posting letters in the afternoon in Sydney liave them delivered in Melbourne at midday next day. It is of no use becoming hysterical over the idea of saving two or three hours. This is not the first time that the air-mail question has been discussed in Parliament, and members are merely making a mountain out of a molehill. There is not much sense in spending large sums of money or asking flying organizations to fly at night to deliver mails that will have to lie in the Melbourne Post Office until the following morning. [Leave to continue given.] The Government does not intend to vary the agreement drawn up between the British authorities, the operating companies, and the Commonwealth Government in the direction of altering the arrangement for the delivery of mails in Sydney. The method of distribution from Darwin, Brisbane and Sydney is ""under consideration at the present time, and a statement will he made by the Government setting out the details of distribution. I am not going to forestall that statement. I refuse to be drawn on the matter of Government policy at this juncture to suit the Leader of the Opposition or anybody else. All reasonable honourable members will admit that it is unreasonable to ask me what is going to happen to the mails for"" Melbourne, or for any ""other capital city or any country town, until I am able to say, "" There is the complete scheme; there ds the complete re-organization; there is the timetable of times of arrival; and there is the basis on which the internal services will co-operate in the closest possible way "". Minister's view of the surcharge? tion of the internal services is complete I shall not be in the position to make any pronouncement on behalf of the Government. It is not a vital matter. Some members have suggested that letters posted in London in the next few days will come out by the Empire air-mail service. They will be delivered in the ordinary way, as at present. There will be no dislocation or confusion. The new system will come in automatically, and whatever advantages are given will be given at a specific date to be announced. [4.42] -This question is another link in the chain of actions of the Government in the last few years which people outside are beginning to talk of a3 Executive government. Parliament is not taken into consideration before decisions are arrived at. Very often members of Parliament are asked in the street about questions that have not come before them in Parliament, but about which they may have read in the press. The motion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) represents a real complaint that Parliament has not been properly consulted. I feel sure that when the people of Australia realize that they are not all part and parcel of the Anglo-Australian air-mail service, and that only those on the eastern coastline are directly associated with it, there will be many confused minds. I always thought that the intention was to give equal service as nearly as possible to at least all capital cities. To-day the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) has said, though not quite definitely that only that portion of Australia from",27,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

150,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Porta),"Darwin to Sydney will be really associated witb the direct service, and that the Government has no responsibility to cater for the rest of Australia. Many of us believed that Darwin would be the first port of call. ""We believed then that the mails would be carried across Australia by air services which would help to improve communications to the outbaek places. When we found that it was not to be so, every one was disappointed. Then it was decided that the mails were to be carried from England in flying boats, touching at Darwin, and proceeding down the east coast. Probably there were sufficient reasons for this, but at least every one thought that the flying boats would be met at Darwin by aeroplanes which would distribute the mails to all the capitals of the Commonwealth, these subsidiary services being part and parcel of the main service, and would distribute simultaneously the mails to all parts of Australia without further charge. Now we are told that this will not be so, that the Government believes that its responsibility will end when the mails are delivered to Sydney. Thus it is possible that the mail from England may be delivered in Dunedin before mail which arrives in Darwin by the same flying boat is delivered to some parts of Australia. every one 'believed and hoped. It will be a further disappointment to the people if it is found that those who are fortunate enough to live on the eastern side of the continent will have their overseas mail delivered to them at a cheaper rate than those living in Perth, Adelaide or Melbourne. At least the people have a right to expect that mail shall be delivered all over Australia at the same cost. At the present time, costs are pooled fantastic and absurd. To read some so that those living in remote districts pay no more for their mail services than do the people in the cities, and that prinaeroplanes at Darwin, and handicap ciple should not be departed from. This Government is gradually but surely developing a method of ruling Australia by Executive action, and ignoring Parliament more and more. I would not go so far as to say that this Government is a dictatorship. That would not be right, but all students of international politics are agreed that the first cousin of a dicthe present, there has been no surcharge tatorship is government by Executive Mr HoUoway. authority. If this Parliament does not assert its rights it may not be very long before we really have a dictatorship here. MT. FAIRBAIRN (Flinders) [4.50] I do not propose to criticize the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby), because I recognize the splendid work he has done in organizing and co-ordinating the work of five separate branches. I am confident that, in so far as the organization of mail services is in his hands, it will be well done. Neither do I propose to criticize the air-mail arrangements, for the simple reason that I have not the faintest idea what they are. I desire to point out, however, that this air-mail service is one of the matters in regard to which Parliament has been kept unnecessarily in the dark, and has been given very little opportunity to offer assistance and advice. That Parliament could have helped to negotiate the agreement with the United KingdomI do not believe. The details of such an agreement are too intricate for parliamentary consideration, but the arrangements that would have to be made for distribution within Australia must have heen apparent for a considerable time-subject , of course, to minor arrangements with the United Kingdom, and subsidiary aTrangements with the Government of New Zealand. That is contrary to what The Government might very well have put forward some time ago a tentative scheme for consideration by Parliament. Members from every State could have made helpful suggestions regarding such a scheme if there had been one before us for discussion. Many people seem to think that the overseas mails should be delivered simultaneously in all six capitals. That is newspaper comments one would think that the Government should provide six them like horses in the Melbourne Cup, so that they would all arrive simultaneously at their respective destinations. It should be possible, however, for the Minister to assure Parliament and the people that there will be no surcharge on the delivery of overseas mail matter, particularly to Perth and Adelaide. Up to in respect to such deliveries, and it is unthinkable that, as the service is developed, it should become more retrogressive. In my opinion, it is time that a night air-mail service was established between Sydney and Melbourne. More than two years ago the Postmaster-General's Department led us to believe that an intercapital night mail service would be inaugurated in the near future. Why it has been delayed I do not know, but it is high time the promise was honoured. The first night service should be between Sydney and Melbourne, because it is only by a night air Service that any appreciable saving of time can be effected in the carriage of mails between those two cities. I understand that the Empire flying boat will probably reach Sydney at an hour too late to permit of the mails being carried on to Melbourne by a day service. Therefore, it would be almost as well to send them on by train as by aeroplane next morning. In either case, the people in the suburbs of Melbourne would not get their mail until 5 o'clock' in the evening, whereas, if it were sent on by aeroplane at night it would be distributed by the first delivery in the morning, and country districts would receive it the same day, instead of the following day, as would be the case if it were sent on from Sydney by train or by the day air service. The difficulty with which the Minister is confronted is that, although he knows quite well what his department has done, and can do, with the flying facilities availFlinders( Mr Fairbairn) seems to think able, he is possibly in the dark regarding the intentions of the Postmaster-General's Department. This brings me to the point that civil aviation should be under the control of the Postmaster-General rather than the Minister for Defence. A t the present time, civil aviation is engaged primarily in the service of the Postmaster-General's Department. fact, except for a little passenger traffic, and some private aviation, which is still insignificant, practically the whole of the civil aviation in Australia is employed in the service of the Postmaster General's Department. The inauguration of a night service between Sydney and Melbourne would be definitely economic, and might tend to reduce the subsidy which, sooner or later, must be paid to the companies operating between those two cities. Operators have told me that a substantial subsidy is needed because their aircraft are not at present being used to capacity. If they were engaged in operating a night service, this would be largely overcome. To sum up then, I believe that. Parliament should at an earlier date have been taken into the confidence of the Government regarding overseas air-mail services. I believe that night air-mail services should be inaugurated between Sydney and Melbourne, and that this is an opportuue time to begin. Finally, I think that civil aviation should be under the control of the Postmaster-General rather than the Minister for Defence. It has been argued, I know, that the aerodromes used by civil aviation will also be used by the Defence Department. That is equally true of the harbours used by merchant shipping. They are used by the navy, yet no one has ever suggested that they should be under the control of thu Defence; Department. support the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) to whom the House is indebted for his action in bringing this matter forward. The Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) seems to believe that his responsibility will end when the overseas mails are brought to Sydney. The honourable member for that it will end when a night air service is inaugurated between Sydney and Melbourne. This is another instance of the injustice which small States have to suffer. It shows just how much federation is worth to the smaller States. It is clear that no attempt is to be made to develop Tasmania, which will always be In in difficulies under federation, and this Government tries to make things as hard as possible for that State. It will take seven days to bring the mails from England to Sydney, and then it may take another three days to carry them from Sydney to Hobart. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) said that Tasmania enjoyed privileges which the other States did not in that there was no surcharge on air mail to that State. But that is not always our experience.",28,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both
151,Mr Frost (Franklin) [4.59],"IThere is no surcharge on first-class mail matter carried by air from Hobart to Melbourne, but not long ago an addressee in Sydney was compelled to pay a fine of 6d. on a letter which was carried by air mail from Melbourne to Sydney, whereas it should have been despatched by the ordinary mail. The Minister has told us that Sydney is a convenient point from which future air services may radiate and that it will be the jumpingoff place for the proposed extension of the air mail to New Zealand. Some time ago there was considerable opposition to Rose Bay, Sydney, being chosen as the terminal port for the Empire air mail, but acting on the advice of its experts, the Government decided to establish it there. We would have no objection to the In fact, we would welcome such an arrangement for the simple reason that a speedier air-mail service would enable Tasmanian producers and shippers to fill their orders to the greater satisfaction of their overseas clients. The Minister for Defence does not appear to be worrying about the position of the other States. He tells us that his responsibility ends when the Empire seaplanes arrive at Rose Bay. certainly conveyed that impression to honourable to think that New South Wales is the only State that matters. I hope, however, that the Government will heed the protests that have been made this afternoon and consider the requests of the smaller States for improved air-mail facilities. Under the present arrangement for the distribution of overseas airmail, merchants in Melbourne will receive letters ten or twelve hours later than their Sydney competitors. Business people in Hobart are in a much worse plight. If the Government does not give more consideration to the proposals for the distribution of overseas air mail for the various States, the new service will not benefit equally the whole of Australia. I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister lor Defence( Mr Thorby), who has been obliged to listen to protests from honourable members on both sides of the House in connection with the Empire air-mail agreement on the charge, which, it is understood, will be made on mails delivered by internal air services from DdYwin to some of the States. I remind the House that all protests in connection with this matter should be addressed through the Minister for Defence to the Postmaster-General (Senator A. J. McLachlan). Unfortunately, some honourable members are making some features of the agreement a personal issue between the Minister and themselves. charge? to believe that there will be, although terminal toeing in Hobart. there has not been a. definite statement from the Minister to this effect. My contention is that any criticism in this connection should be directed to the Postmaster-General, whose department has been co-operating with the Defence Department in the negotiations to inaugurate the Empire air-mail service. The honbairn) raised an important point which, I think, should be considered by the Government, namely, that as a matter of policy, civil aviation should be dissociated from the Defence Department and placed under the control of the Postmaster General. We should then have a clear-cut members. He seems issue upon which -we could state our case for the distribution of overseas air mails. Some honourable members appear to be under misapprehension as to the reasons actuating those who were opposed to Rose Bay being the terminal for the Empire air-mail service. It was not that we did not want Sydney to be the terminal port. . The opposition was purely local. There would have been a much greater outcry if the Ministry had fixed on any other city for the terminal port, hecause Sydney is the pivotal point in Commonwealth commercial relations and is an excellent jumping-off place for a continuance of the Empire air-mail service to New Zealand as well as for the distribution of overseas mails to southern capital cities. I have some sympathy for the Minister, hecause, as we know, in this matter he has merely taken over a legacy from his predecessor, and it is not his department which is responsible",30,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

157,Orable Member For Flinders ( Mr Fair,"for the proposed surcharge. appears to be some inconsistency in the Government's policy as related to air-mail services. At present first-class mail matter is carried between Darwin and Perth, and between Tasmania and the mainland without surcharge, but, under the new service, we believe there will be a surcharge on all overseas letters to be delivered by internal air services from Darwin to Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Hobart, and no surcharge on letters for Brisbane and Sydney. Many business firms in Sydney have important commercial connexions in all capital cities, and naturally they will expect equal treatment as regards air-mail charges for the whole of their branches. The tendency at the moment .seems to be to regard the Postal Department as a revenue producer instead of one to render essential services for the people at a minimum cost. We have become accustomed to read of its huge surpluses from year to year, and notwithstanding frequent representations from time to time, it is being conducted on lines altogether different from the declared policy of other dominions as regards air-mail services. South Africa the rate for air mails is a fractional part of the charge in Australia. New Zealand also is providing air-mail services much below Australian rates. Although the Postal Department will make a huge profit this year it intends, so we believe, to impose a surcharge for the delivery of overseas air mail to the capital cities of the States. I am not blaming the Minister for Defence because I know that he has had no hand in the fixing of the surcharge. that there will be a surcharge on that portion of tlie overseas mail. Mt. HAKBISON"" I know, but it is generally understood that there will be, and I think we should direct our criticism against the department of the Postmaster General. I for one would not tolerate this iniquitous surcharge merely because the department is extending its essential services. I hope that the Minister will convey to his colleague in Cabinet the protests that have been levelled in this House against, the proposal. The Postmaster-General would be well advised to giv«e this matter his careful consideration. [5.14] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has rendered a distinct service to honourable members. His motion for the adjournment of the House giv«3 us an opportunity to criticize the Empire air-mail agreement and also to offer some useful suggestions. We protest against the attitude of the Government in withholding information in connection with this matter. So far we do not know whether or not there is to.be a surcharge on letters that will be sorted at Darwin and delivered by internal air services to certain of the States, or whether an arrangement will be made for immediate delivery to the southern States after the arrival of the air mail in Sydney. The Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) charged honourable members who live in the southern and western States with being parochially-minded in bringing before this House the needs of those States in respect of the delivery of the overseas air mails. If the Minister were himself a representative of an electorate in a southern State he would be among the first to protest if he thought In that the interests of his State and elee-. torate were being submerged. I cannot understand his resentment. no advantage from the inauguration of this air-mail service, apart from the general advantage which will accrue to the Commonwealth of Australia. New South Wales is well looked after in the agreement. In my electorate there are many big business enterprises and I have frequently been asked by them if I could supply any details as to what was likely to occur when the new service was established. I have always been confronted with the need to tell them that, although many questions had been asked in Parliament about the matter, I had never been able to elicit any definite information from the Minister. same reduction as will be enjoyed by the people in Sydney, Darwin and Brisbane. out by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Fairbairn) that nightflying services would enable Victoria to",31,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

If the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders were adopted, it would be a great convenience to Melbourne business firms, both in the city and suburbs, and would enable the aeroplanes to be used in a much more satisfactory manner than at the present time. It was suggested recently that the needs of Western Australia and South Australia would be met by -a direct service from Darwin to Perth and Adelaide as soon as the Empire mail planes arrived at Darwin, but, as that has not yet been officially confirmed, we do not even know for certain if that service is to be given. It is an intolerable situation for honourable members to find that the Minister cannot give them satisfaction on matters in regard to which honourable members should have information. I join with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) in protesting against Pai liament being kept in ignorance in respect of not only this matter, but also other matters. The Minister would meet with a better spirit of appreciation from honourable members if he were to take them more into his confidence. the Minister to tell us of the work that is being performed and of the difficulties under which he is labouring.

Every time criticism is levelled against the Government or himself, his quills rise and his attitude is, "" I am not to be touched "". job of work, and is one of the best MinisBy adopting that attitude, the Minister does not do himself justice. Every man who has to do with the Defence Department knows that its administration in the present circumstances is a big job. We all admit that the Minister is doing his best to cope with it, but he appears to grow impatient in the process. Mr Drakeford. neurasthenia. , that neurasthenia would make the Minister rise as he does every time there is some criticism of the Government. Victorian members believe that some assurance should be given that mails from overseas will be delivered in Victoria at the earliest possible moment, and that that State will not be placed at any disadvantage as compared with any other State. The Government should take heed of the debate that has occurred on this matter. Unlessi t adopts a different attitude, I venture to say that this will not be the last of the protests made, not only from the Opposition, but also from all sides of the House, by honourable members who are anxious to do justice to their constituents. The Minister for Defence delivers punches when no punches are needed and the position is not relieved to the slightest extent. The Minister, having heard this debate, should go to the Government and say that the House is determined to get early information as to what is to be done. If the situation to-day is due to the fact that there is a lack of co-operation between the Postmaster-General's Department and the Defence Department, the sooner that state of affairs is mended, the better. Any further delay in acquainting the House of what is proposed to be done will meet with further criticism. I hope that the motion will have the desired effect. It is of no purpose for it to be clearly understood that, in speaking to this motion, it is not my intention to embarrass the Government. I speak only with the desire to elicit information, and it was for that purpose that I asked a question earlier in the day. Unflattering remarks concerning the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) have been made, but I believe that he is doing an excellent ters that we have had in the Defence Department for some time. One fact that has emerged from this debate is that in the near future, the Minister intends to bring down an agreement in connection with the internal arrangements for the distribution of the mail in Australia. cover the Empire mail service to Sydney.",32,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

There has been a great deal of talk, but to me, the proposition is very simple. The flying boats will arrive at Darwin from England, and all that needs to be done is to establish at Darwin a sorting office. in London. is needed is an office at Darwin from which the mails will be distributed to their destinations. It appears that mails destined for Sydney will reach there in good time, but what honourable members desire to ensure is that mails destined for capacity, nor experience to this work, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Hobart will reach their destinations not only as soon as possible, but about as soon as the Sydney mail reaches Sydney. To advance with the times, as we are proposing to do in establishing this overseas air-mail serHouse should be consulted before, not vice, we must meet situations as they arise. This situation could be very easily met by the establishment, as I have suggested, of a sorting office at Darwin, as the focal point for the distribution of the practice that does not gain anything in mails to the various capital cities. I am disturbed to hear that there is to be a surcharge. have received from the debate is that there is to be a surcharge of 3d. It has not been denied. What we need is a Minister to tell us what is the actual position. I was very much concerned when I saw the headlines on the article in the newspaper. I should prefer to receive my information, not from the press, but from the responsible Minister in this House, and, on future occasions, Ministers should take care to give honourable members the fullest information. When the Minister for Defence (Mir. Thorby) started to replyI understand that he did not start to reply until he thought everybody on this side had spoken -h e stated that there had been disclosed a considerable amount of confusion in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) as to the difference between the distribution of the mails that had reached Australia and the special contract for the conveyance of mails by air to Australia. It was noticeable that I could charge when the Leader of the Opposition came into the House. No such confusion, of course, was manifested by the Leader of the Opposition. He is perfectly clear that an agreement is in prospect, and he is perfectly aware that honourable members of this House and members of the public have not been taken into the Government's confidence as to what this country is to be committed to. I go to the foundation of this matter, and I say that it is intolerable that a querulous, inexperienced Minister like the Minister for Defence, who brings neither knowledge, should inform the House that he does not propose to take the House into his confidence as to what this country is to be committed to in regard, to international air mails. This after, an agreement has been reached. I know that the evil practice of committing this country and consulting it afterwards has been followed in the past, but it is a respectability by repetition, and one which ought to be discontinued. The present de'bate gives point to that contention. It has shown us that we have a Minister, a neophyte in postal administration, who is impatient of criticism and unwilling to take advice. When he is either criticized or apologized for from behind as well as in front, and when inquiries such as that made by the Leader of the Opposition are made, this leader of a would be totalitarian state is personally affronted. I do not admit his right to take the stand that he takes. It is suggested by the Minister when we speak of the special claims of the city of Hobart, the city of Melbourne, or any other part of this vast continent, we are influenced by petty parochial motives. My answer to the Minister is that as he takes it upon himself to be the only person envisaging the saving involved in this international air-mail contract, it is his duty, as soon as the arrangements for the contract are completed, even if the details are not completed-w e were led to suppose that they were-to see that the arrangements for the distribution of the mails in Australia are in harmony with",33,Formalmotion Fob Adjournment January 1938 W I L L Materially Reduce Both

About that the Minister has done nothing whatever. As a matter of fact, it is a question on which he has no opinions whatever. He has given us to understand that it is not his concern at all. 1 entirely agree with the honourable member for Elinders( Mr Fairbairn) when he says that it would be far better if postal concerns were left in the hands of the Postmaster-General's Department, aud not in the hands of the Defence Department. The fact that the Defence Department is playing such an important part in it arises from the fact that defence is made predominant iii the consideration of all the claims of all departments. It is that fact which has caused this postal question to be removed from the department which is trained in and is capable of administering it to a department which has no knowledge of the matter, whatever, and is, at the moment, unhappily presided over by a Minister who is specially misuiteo It may be that some honourable members would disagree with me on this point, but the Director-General of Postal Services is paid a handsome salary, and, in my opinion, he is a very competent officer. He understands the postal needs of Australia, and realizes that an overseas airmail service of the character contemplated reqiiires an efficient service within Australia to make the whole scheme effective. Yet, when questions are addressed to the Minister for Defence, he regards honourable members as suspicious, and, if we press for an answer, we are regarded as impudent. Order!

I make no special claim on behalf of Victoria, but, as the representative of a Victorian electorate, it is my bounden duty, as it is of every other honourable member, to direct attention to the matter. realize that the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) has been working at high pressure for a long time, but, if an additional surcharge is to be imposed on overseas mail matter carried over the inland routes, I mu3t associate myself with the strong protest lodged against « the suggested charge.

The principle at stake is of first-class significance to the deliberative competence of Parliament, for only so far as the Constitution may limit the Parliament, is the discretion of members of this chamber affected. The provision of the Constitution dealing with this point is in section 56, which readsA vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys sliall not be passed unless the purpose of appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originated. That really means that for any bill which involves an appropriation of revenue to be valid, a message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending an appropriation for that purpose must be received at some stage before it is finally passed.

193,Mr Buennan,"I rise to a point ofsidered that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) would connect his remarks with the present debate, but he will not be allowed to continue at any length his reference to the previous debate. up to the second message that has reached this chamber. It deals with amendments, to be moved by a member of the Government, which would have the effect of increasing the burden on the budget over and above that imposed by the bill as originally introduced. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has referred to ""section 56 of the Constitution. The purpose of the second message is to ensure an appropriation sufficient to cover the Government's amendments. necessary after all, despite what was said previously.. to honourable members that the business of the country' cannot be carried oi. unless the government of the day is iu charge of its finances. In every parliament of the British Empire provision is made in the standing orders as well as in the constitution, where there is one, whereby the government of the day is protected from the obligation to appropriate money at the instance of the Opposition. That is inherent in section 56 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. -A point that is not expressly stated in . that section is that only a member of the Government may pause to be originated a message of appropriation from the Governor General. The StandingOrders control the business of this chamber, unless the House itself decides otherwise. I direct attention to Standing Order 171No amendment for the imposition or for the increase of a tax rate or duty shall bo proposed by any non-official member in any committee on any bill. and to Standing Order 247No amendment whereby the charge upon the people will be increased may be made to any such resolution, unless such charge so increased shall not exceed the charge already existing by virtue of any act of the Parliament. AgainI draw attention to Standing Order No. 1 of this House, which readsIn all cases not provided for hereinafter, or by Sessional or other Orders, resort shall be had to the rules, forms, and practice of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland in force at the time of the adoption of these Orders, which shall be followed as far as they can be applied to tlie proceedings of the House of Representatives. If the two Standing OrdersI have quoted, No. 171 and No. 247, should for any reason be considered inadequate for the purpose I have mentioned, I rest my case on Standing Order No. 1. On page 505 of the 13th edition of May's Parliamentary Practice, which in all cases not determined by the Standing Orders governs the proceedings of this committee, reference is made, among other things, to Standing Order No. 66 of the House of Commons. That Standing Order reads:This House will receive no petition for any sum relating to public service, or proceed upon"" any motion for a grant or charge upon the public revenue, whether payable out of the consolidated fund or out of money to be provided by Parliament, unless recommended from the Crown. Our own two Standing Orders 171 and 247, taken in conjunction with No. 1, and Standing Order No. 66 of the British House of Commons, are all in line with what I have maintained, namely, that a message has to be brought down from the Governor General covering any appropriation of money. That message has been brought down. It can be brought down only by a Minister of the Crown. Nothing that I have done or could do in this connection can affect the rights of honourable members one way or the other. I cannot increase or decrease their rights, which are fixed by the Conr stitution. I venture, with great respect, to draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to that fact. He has set out again to-day, in extension of the debate that took place earlier in this chamber, to attempt to establish the contention that by bringing in the previous message I , in some indefinite way, attempted to curtail the rights of honourable members. The Government has to have control of any amendment that would increase the charge upon the budget. There has been cited one instance, and one only, in the whole history of this Parliament, when the message was not brought down at the beginning of tHfe committee stage of a bill. That was when",37,Nation Al Healthan D Pensions Insurance Bill 1938

Therefore, it is not before it is not necessary to continue it for me to be hound by what some one did now, and if it was wrong before, it is 25 years ago. What was done then or since wrong now.

BEASLEY -The argument of those who support the present procedure is that a n y departure from it would be unconstitutional. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m. moved that a message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation of revenue be taken into consideration, the purpose being to enable amendments to be moved by the Treasurer to be incorporated in the bill. this motion the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has moved that the words "" and otlier members"" be added, so that the appropriation may cover amendments moved, not only by the Treasurer, but also by other honourable members. You, sir,have declared that the amendment to the motion is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution in that, if agreed to, it would increase the appropriation; you have, therefore, ruled it eut of order. The Leader of the Opposition discussed fully the bearing of the Constitution upon the amendment, and I do not think that you, as Chairman, are any more competent that he is to give a decision upon that point. I cannot accept your ruling that tlie amendment to the motion would have the effect of extending the appropriation. No one can say whether or not that w ill be the case until the amendments to the bill are moved in committee. It is not desirable that honourable members should be prevented from moving amendments. Every honourable member should be able to move as he thinks fit, say what he thinks necessary, and have his opinions duly recorded. A t this stage, it is pure assumption on your part that amendments which have not yet heen moved w ill increase the appropriation. The purpose of the Government, supported by your ruling, seems to be to prevent Parliament from considering the bill deliberatively, and to stifle the free expression of opinion. If this ruling be allowed tostand, Parliament will exist only as an instrument for recording the opinions, and carrying out the wishes, of the Treasurer. I can hardly imagine the the framers of the Constitution, however anxious they may have been to keep the control of the finances in the Government's hands, ever intended that private members should be denied the right to express and record their views on financial matters in a free and democratic way. Honourable members who feel that they owe a duty to their constituents should support the Treasurer has amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, even to the extent of dissenting from tbe ruling of the Chairman, so that the widest possible discussion may be permitted. ' If the Treasurer may arrange for a new message from the GovernorTo General recommending a further appropriation, so that he may introduce amendments, the Chairman should be generous enough to allow other honourable members to move such amendments to the bill as they think desirable. The Leader of the Opposition merely asks that, under cover of the Governor General's further message, private members, as well as the Treasurer, may be permitted to move amendments. No one can reasonably object to that. It is desirable that private members should be given every opportunit y to express their opinions on so important a measure as this. opportunity now. way.

In that classical repository of that message, the following motion has parliamentary procedure, May's Parliabeen moved by the Treasurermentary Practice, Tenth edition, at page 580, the following passage occursThe constitutional principle which vests in the Crown the sole responsibility over national expenditure, and which forbids the Commons to increase the sums demanded by the Crown for the service of the State (see page 532). is strictly enforced in the committees of supply, aud ways and means. In a later work, An Introduction to the Procedure of the House of Commons, by Campion, at page 232, the writer, under the heading ""Principles of Financial Procedure "" statesThe main effect on financial procedure of tlie principles governing the relations between the Crown and Parliament (see pp. 23-29) and the rules by which the House of Commons regulates its own practice (S. Os. Nos. 06 to 7IB) may be summarized as follows:1. Allfinancialbusiness is originated by the Crown alone. No member other than a Minister acting on behalf of the Crown may make a motion or move an amendment which has the effect of imposing a new "" charge"" or increasing an existing or proposed ""charge"" whether ""upon* the Consolidated Fund"" (expenditure) or ""upon the people"" (taxation). Those principles have been clearly laid down and recognized for centuries. The honourable member for ""West Sydney( Mr sage from the Administrator, but also Beasley) said that we should not be bound slavishly by custom, but he, as a parliamentarian of some standing and experience, should be aware of the battle which the English people fought through the exercise sole control over the financial expenditure of the Government, and, without any desire to reflect unduly upon him, I suggest that he was not quite sincere when he expressed the view that there ought to he a change in our constitutional practice,. I have cited to honourable members the practice of the House of Commons which we have followed in Australia. We have included in the ComA vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended House in which the proposal originated.

While we might applaud the solo, we cannot be expected to extend our approval io the duet.

There can be no question as to the validity of the ruling of the Chair. for all members on this side when I say that we listened with interest to the homily which has just been delivered by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt)', who also took occasion to challenge the honesty and sincerity of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr marks to the question before the Chair.

Perhaps it would be more appropriate if, instead of following the lines indicated by the honourable member for Fawkner, who very graciously indicated to the grandmothers that are not to be found on this side of the committee how eggs may ibe sucked, we addressed ourselves to the merits of the motion moved by the Treasurer and the amendment moved by my leader.

229,. Mr Brennan,"Very well. You, sir,The amendment was ruled out of order because it is outside the scope of the Administrator's message. mit, with great confidence, that when you gave that ruling, you, sir, in the language of the street, jumped a bit too soon. There is nothing in the amendment to indicate that it will do what you say it will do. It might conceivably leave untouched, or at least unsettled, a question which might arise in committee, as to whether a particular amendment would have the effect of increasing the appropriation. I submit that the amendment as it stands, to the motion as it stands, is a perfectly good amendment; and with the greatest respect I say that you had no right whatever to anticipate what some honourable member might do in committee if the amendment were accepted. It does not follow that any amendment to the hill will necessarily increase the appropriation. The motion does not say how the money is to be used; it merely says that an appropriation of money shall be made. Undoubtedly it envisages the expenditure of money. I admit that it might be much more difficult for me if I were called upon at a later stage iu committee, to argue that some of the amendments which I know we have in view could properly be submitted by a private member. But I have no knowledge of the terms in which those amendments may be moved, so I am guessing more or less. I do say that because, apparently, you haveI am sure you will acquit me of any desire to be in the slightest degree offensive-capture d rhe atmosphere of the debate and know what honourable members are thinking orable member must not criticize the attitude of the Chair. order if I examine the terms of your ruling and draw conclusions as to the reasons which moved you to your decision. That is what I have been endeavouring to do, and I was suggesting as one reason for your ruling, that there was a widespread feeling among honourable members who desire to move amendments orable member must know that it is distinctly out of order to reflect upon the Chair. If he continues, I shall ask him to resume his seat. Prowse, that you have misunderstood me. I repudiate absolutely any intention to reflect upon the Chair. I cannot understand how my words have -been so misconstrued, but I assure you that I had no intention whatever to reflect upon your ruling further than to contend that it was wrong. In saying this, I would have the committee understand that I am not in any way reflecting upon the good faith of the Chair. I have no desire other than to examine the question before the committee entirely on its merits and without heat. I want to examine your ruling and to discover., if possible, the reasons for vour decision. able member is entitled to consider the ruling of the Chair as given, but not necessarily the point of view disclosed in the ruling. it is necessary for me to do so. I hope that you are impressed by what I have said. It may be that on consideration of what I have said you will desire to reverse your ruling. Whether that be so or not, it may be that the Treasurer, if he were here, would seefitto withdraw his opposition to the amendment. I submit that you, sir, have given a wrong ruling, and that if your objection is to be successfully made at all, it must be made in the committee stage, when some honourable member moves an amendment, which in the view of the Treasurer, will increase the appropriation. able member's time has expired. moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) and the subsequent motion of dissent from the Chairman's ruling, betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the powers of Parliament in respect of the control of the public purse.

There is no doubt whatever that section 56 of the Constitution accepts f u l l y and unconditionally that principle that there shall be no appropriation of revenue by Parliament except upon the recommendation of the Governor General.

This is the back-door which the Treasurer has opened to them! Not only is this a way of escape for honourable members opposite; it is also a means for the Treasurer to save himself from his friends. The honourable gentleman knows 'that, if the amendment moved by my leader were accepted by the Government, amendments might be moved in accordance with the declarations of ministerial members at the second-reading stage, which amendments he would be forced to consent to put into the bill. If the Treasurer yielded to opinion in this committee and inserted certain amendments, the Government, not honourable members, would be increasing the appropriation. Unless my leader's amendment be accepted, any amendments proposed by honourable mem""bers, if they he allowed to come before the committee at all, will be ruled out of order. frightened that if amendments of the sort foreshadowed in the second-reading debate were allowed to come before the committee, so many honourable members opposite would support them that he would be forced to accept them. So the honourable the Treasurer is not only opening a back-door for his own supporters, but is also saving himself from them. Mr Chairman, I submit that your ruling is bad. In fact, it is the worse ruling that I have heard delivered since I have been a member of this Parliament. It would not stand a critical examination. majority can uphold it. majority or an ordinary majority. I submit that, even if the majority of honourable members of this committee uphold your ruling, it will not stand before the bar of public opinion, because it is not sound. If this measure is to receive the consideration in committee that it should have, the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition must be carried. It should not be ruled out of order because the Government has a majority in this committee; it should be allowed to go on its merits. Half of the rulings dissented from are upheld, not because they are in conformity with the Standing Orders, but because there is a majority to uphold them. that your ruling is good. Further, I submit that if the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) were on this side of the House, in a position of ministerial responsibility, they would take precisely the same attitude towards an amendment of this kind as we' are taking. The amendment which the Chair has ruled out of order strikes deep. It goes down to fundamentals. It concerns the initiation of financial legislation, not merely the control of the public purse. Expressing it far more vividly, it aims to give to every member in this committee the right The honourable gentleman is to increase the taxation of the people. Sir HENRY GULLETT -No, the right to increase. What is the difference? The British parliamentary system is based on the curtailment of the power to tax the people and on the curbing of the unbridled disposition of those in authority to tax the people. That power has been narrowed down through the centuries, starting with the combat against King John and continuing through the reigns of King Edward III . and King CharlesI . down to the present time. In the ParliaOf course, a brutal ment of to-day, it is narrowed down first to the party which comes to Parliament with the support of the majority of the electors behind it. It is then narrowed down again and handed to the leader, who has to form a government, and to that government which he forms and to the Ministers who are concerned in observing, amongst other things, loyalty to the Constitution.. This amendment slashes right across and violates the Constitution. It also violates the Standing Orders. It would reduce parliamentary government to chaos, and lead to reckless' and irresponsible taxation. It has been submitted merely as a stone-walling trick.",44,Lawson I T May Be An Particularly Because It Has Such

The honourable member for Henty tries, at times, to make us believe that he takss an independent stand, but he evidently attended the caucus meeting of the Government parties this morning, when honourable members opposite were Avhipped into line. The Treasurer has moved that it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of amendments to be moved by him in a bill for an act to provide for insurance against certain contingencies affecting employees, and the wives, children, widoAvs and orphans of employees, and for other purposes. Surely the Leader of I submit that the honorthe Opposition, having listened tp numerous speeches by members opposite, Avho said that they felt certain that the Government would give every opportunity for consideration in committee member must confine his remarks to reasons for disagreement Avith the Chairman's ruling.

That Avas to give other members the right to submit amendments to the bill, but you, sir, ruled the amendment out of order on the ground that it Avas beyond the scope of the Administrator's recommendation. I say, with great reluctance, Mr Chairman, that that was one of the worse rulings I have ever heard you give. I make that statement with very.great respect, and without wishing to cast any reflection on the Chair. Surely the Leader of the Opposition has the right to submit an amendment to enable honourable members generally to have the same freedom as the Treasurer is to have in submitting amendments for the consideration of the committee. It is mere balderdash to say that the amendment would give to honourable members the right to increase taxation. I dot not believe that the honourable member for Henty seriously holds that view. The Parliament alone can impose taxes. Without a majority in the Parliament iu favour of an increase of taxes, the increase cannot be imposed.

274,Mr Fobde,"The Leader of the Opporuling infringes the rights of honourable members, and I hope that, even at this la to hour, you will overlook any criticism that has come from members of the Opposition, and re-consider your decision. If honourable members are to be prevented from exercising their right to submit amendments, we shall be wasting the time of Parliament by discussing this measure in committee. I have never had previous experience of a bill which has aroused such wide interest as this has. I have a vivid recollection of a vote last Thursday in which five or six members crossed over from the Government side and voted with the Opposition. The CHAIBMAN -The importance of this bill has nothing to do' with the motion before the Chair. us take your ruling all the more seriously. Certainly the ruling will enable Government supporters to escape from an awkward situation, because it will stifle disfavour of it. Among the many anomalies cussion and allow honourable members opposite to avoid giving effect to views expressed in their second-reading speeches. his ruling is in question, and to rule out of The Opposition is strongly opposed to your ruling, ibecause it was told that in committee every opportunity would be given to members to liberalize the measure. The Government is now going back on its promise in this regard. should be discussed at this stage is whether the Chairman's ruling should be upheld. The Administrator has recommended that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of amendments to be moved by the Treasurer, and the Leader of the Opposition has submitted an amendment which, if agreed to, would enable amendments to be moved by private members also. This would clearly extend the scope of the message from the Administrator. Section 56 of the Constitution stipulates that no measure for the appropriation of revenue shall be passed unless the appropriation has, in the same session, been recommended by the Governor General. If an attempt were made to impose a charge not recommended by the Administrator, there would be a clear breach of the Constitution. The control of the national purse is in the hands of the Government, and that control cannot corstitutionally be taken from it. Standing Orders Nos. 171 and 232 prohibit private members from submitting measures which would increase the burden on the people. The position is beyond doubt. I support your ruling, Mr Chairman. one gives to this matter, the more one is convinced that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) was right in moving his amendment. But had I any doubt on the subject, the speech of the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) would have dispelled it. It is common knowledge, even among school children, that by a process of evolution, power -has been taken from the Crown and given to the Parliament. The carrying of the amendment would not give to any Minister the power to increase taxes; it would only authorize him to move amendments which would have that effect, only if a majority of members were in in our Standing Orders is the right of the Chairman to remain in the Chair when order any argument which he decides conflicts with the Standing Orders. The CHAIEMAN -Order! The Standing Orders, not the Chairman, determine these things. that you must carry out the Standing Orders. It has been argued that your ruling is in accordance with the Constitution, but I maintain that it is not the province of the Chairman of Committees to decide that point. If it were so, at an earlier stage in the discussion of this bill the Chair would have been called upon to decide whether or not the measure was constitutional. I remind the Committee that, in addition to honourable members on this side of the chamber, the legal luminary on the other side has expressed doubt as to the constitutionality of the bill. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has concentrated largely upon Standing Order 247, but I point out that that Standing Order applies only to the Committee of ""Ways and Means and the Committee of Supply. As it has nothing to do with the ordinary Committee of the whole House it does not apply at this juncture. Standing Order 171? -",46,Lawson I T May Be An Particularly Because It Has Such

The message from His Excellency does not mention any sum of money, and, in the circumstances, I cannot see how it can .bp said that the amendment would increase the appropriation. increase an unnamed amount. I suggest, that you, sir, reconsider your ruling in the light of the convincing arguments that have been put forward. The Government should not take a paltry political advantage of members, including many of its own supporters. sion like this, it is well to go back to the mentary debates, you, sir, immediately time when members of the party now in Opposition occupied the Treasury Bench for a short period. A study of the discussions in Parliament at that time will show that the Chairman's ruling was challenged on several occasions. One instance occurred during the discussion on a bill dealing with a bounty on wheat. A member of the party to which I belong moved an amendment which would have had the effect of paying a little extra to the poor, down-trodden wheat-farmers of this country. It was, however, ruled out of order. Committees? The proposed amendment was ruled out of order on the ground that it would, increase the appropriation of money required under the bill. On the same page of Votes and Proceedings it is recorded that Mr Latham moved "" That the chairman do report progress and ask leave to sit again "". That sounds a simple motion, but the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), who at that time was doing his best to act up to the responsibilities of Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, took strong exception to a member of the Opposition attempting to take the business out of the hands of the Government. The honourable member was so grievously concerned that Mr Latham should exercise the rights of a private member, that he voted against him in the division which subsequently took place. On another occasion the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr the representative of the Crown should Forde), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, introduced a bill to provide for the payment of a bounty on the production of crude shale oil. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) proposed that the words "" crude shale o i l "" be omitted with a view to inserting It is impossible to in lieu thereof the word "" gold "". On tliat occasion also, the amendment was ruled out of order, the reason given being that it would alter the purpose for which the Governor General had recommended tlie appropriation. When honourable members on this side endeavoured to quote from the parliastopped them. orable member has not raised a point of order. Mr .ARCHIE CAMERON -The Votes and Proceedings for that period will show that when honourable members of tbe party opposite were conducting the affairs of the country they objected to private members attempting to increase the appropriation, or to add to the burden of the taxpayers. Perhaps it was because they excelled at piling up taxes that they did not want any one to assist them. When in office, the Labour party objected to members of the Opposition exercising the rights of private members to decide which of two industries-crud e shale oil, which is not prominent in this country, or goldmining, which is prominent-shoul d lie assisted by this Parliament'. ister must confine his remarks to the subject before the Chair. these references are unpalatable to honourable members opposite. If the Opposition knows anything at all of tbe Standing Orders of this Parliament, it knows that no chairman would rule that any private member could move an amendment which would increase the burden of taxation to be borne by the people. The case of the Opposition falls down for another reason. I cannot remember having ever read of a proposal by a member of the Opposition that a message from be changed by a vote of the Parliament.",47,Lawson I T May Be An Particularly Because It Has Such

Terms are used in the bill that do not explain themselves, such as "" contribution year "" and "" employee contributors "". 'Clause postponed. Clauses5 and 6 agreed to. Clause 7Each commissioner shall be' .paid such remuneration as the Governor General from time to time determines. is quite reasonable that the Governor General should determine the remuneration of each of the commissioners, but I submit that at this stage the Treasurer ought to indicate approximately how much it is intended to pay. do not know whether it is intended to pay the commissioners £1,000, £2,000, or £5,000 a year each. ""We ought to have some iudication of the contemplated liability. [9.30] -The three commissioners have been tentatively appointed to certain positions pending the passage of the bill. Each will be paid a different amount. In respect of the second and third commissioners, at any rate, no determination has been made as to their salaries. The practice of the Government is to consult the Public Service Board on such matters, and unless there is any good reason to the contraryI do not think there will be-to accept its advice. Until this measure becomes law, the Government will be unable to give the information required by the honourable member. I am entirely dissatisfied Avith the explanation of the Treasurer. The contributions Avhich are to be paid by the employers and employees, and the approximate amounts which the Government itself will contribute to this fund, are specified in various clauses of the bill, but no indication of how much the commissioners are to be paid is given. I have no desire to limit the clause, but it appears to me that the committee should have some information regarding the remunerations that it is intended to give to each of the commissioners. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has said that no decision regarding the payments to the second and third commissioners has been reached. Apparently he has some figure in mind for the chief commissioner. At this stage, I think that we should limit the liability of the Treasury in this connection, more particularly as the Treasurer refuses to give us any indication at all of the sums to be paid. Will the chief commissioner be paid as much as the Commonwealth Director of Posts and Telegraphs, or the Secretary to the Treasury? chairman's salary already been fixed? asked to be informed of the approximate amounts which it is intended shall be paid to the three commissioners. the salaries of the three commissioners is approximately £4,800.

It appears to me to be a very great injustice that legislation which proposes to confer the benefits of a national insurance scheme upon all aliens, irrespective of their age on arrival in Australia, or of their country of birth, should exclude Australian regardless of the conditions under which they may live or of what educational qualifications they may have attained. I am aware that under the invalid and old age pensions act, and maternity allowance legislation, persons of mixed blood, in whom the white blood predominates, are treated as Australian citizens. I am also aware, from experience, that in cases where the aboriginal bloo.d predominates, persons of mixed blood are treated as if they had no right to Commonwealth social services at all. I know personally of an aboriginal native who was employed in a position of trust at a wheat stack as a buyer for one of tbe great wheat-buying firms. He was living as an Australian citizen, and was trustworthy, efficient, and sensible in the way in which he handled his own property; yet his wife was excluded, by a provision apparently similar to this, from obtaining a maternity allowance. I know of another man in whom aboriginal blood predominates, who is in charge of livestock, water improvements, and other valuable property on a station in which I am personally interested. Under the State law, that man is entitled to a vote-the State law does recognize him as a human being-but under the federal law, as it stands to-day, he would not be entitled to an invalid or old-age pension, nor will he be eligible to insure under this hill. That state of affairs con-' stitutes a very grave injustice which, I am sure, every member of this committee, including the Treasurer, desires to have removed. Only recently there was a discussion about the provision of more adequate representation for Australian aborigines in the government of the country. mainly by newspaper reports, that the Treasurer himself said that the Government was contemplating giving to educated aborigines, and aborigines with other suitable qualifications, full rights of Mr JIanoker. citizenship. I suggest that this is a proper occasion on which to make a beginning with such a policy. I fully realize that the great majority of Australian aborigines live under conditions in which the social services provided for white citizens would be of no value to them, and that upon them such social services would even have a demoralizing aborigines, influence, but such cases can be provided for under the schedule of exemptions. If the provision for the total exclusion of aborigines', just because they are aborigines, be removed from this clause of the bill, I shall certainly vote for an amendment to the schedule to empower the Protector of Aborigines to exempt from the operations of this legislation aborigines working on stations in the bush, and in other places where they are still living under semi-tribal conditions, and where civilized social services, instead of .being of value to them, might actually be detrimental. The fate of the original inhabitants of Australia is a tragedy which Australian people find most difficult to justify. There are all sorts of physical difficulties to be considered in meeting the needs for protection and medical attention which stone-age people require when they are brought into contact with modern civilization. The fact that, up to the present, the problem of doing justice to the aborigines has not met with a satisfactory solution, is not due to any want of goodwill on the part of Australians. It is due to physical causes, but the perpetuation of distinctions of this kind tends to give to Australia a far worse name than it deserves. The attitude of our people in grappling with the very difficult, concrete problems with which they are faced, is one of sincerity and good intention. If my amendment is not in order, I appeal to the Treasurer to include in this legislation the natives of the Pacific islands and Australian aborigines who are not specially exempted by the commission. I have been led to believe, the proposed amendment seeks to include another class of contributors; if that is so, it is out of order. definitely whether the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wakefield was ruled out of order on the",50,Lawson I T May Be An Particularly Because It Has Such

[9.46] -The Government has considered the subject raised by the honourable member for Wakefield, and, with the honourable member's permission, I shall move an amendment more far-reaching in character than the one submitted by him. I now move That the words "" (not being aboriginal natives of Australia or of tlie Islands of the perhaps, a plug of tobacco. I'acifiu) "" be omitted. The Government is impressed by the arguments of the honourable member for Wakefield in respect of certain individuals amongst the aboriginal inhabitants of the Commonwealth and of the islands of the Pacific. My amendment, if carried, will render necessary an amendment of the first schedule. It is not considered desirable that all aboriginal natives of Australia or all Pacific islanders resident in Australia shall be compulsorily brought under the provisions of the bill. My amendment, therefore, will exempt certain individuals. squatters who are exploiting the Australian aborigines. commission, after consultation with the Protector of Aborigines or some other competent authority, shall have power to exclude certain of those persons to whom this scheme would be clearly inapplicable. that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wakefield is out of order. that it would increase the contributions and therefore the amount of appropriation. It is not competent for a private member to submit an amendment having tHcit effect. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker)., whose amendment has [«7] just been ruled out of order, has told us that his desire is to include in the scheme Australian aboriginal natives and natives of the islands of the Pacific. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey), who has moved an amendment in similar terms, has stated that the first schedulo will' have to be amended in order to give the commission power to exempt certain persons. (Corio-Treasurer ) In principle, this may be all right, but I protest against the possibility of the "" squatocracy "" of this country-thos e employers who have been exploiting the aboriginal natives for so many yearsbeing exempted. For a great number of years they have sweated the unfortunate aborigines, who have had to work on stations for a few shillings a week and, If the Treasurer's amendment means that this class of employer will be exempted, it will confer no benefiton the majority of the employed aborigines. If , however, it will include in the scheme all those aboriginal natives and Pacific islanders who are working on outback wool stations, I commend the honourable member for Wakefield, and I shall support the amendment. Should the purpose of the later amendment to be submitted by the Treasurer be the exemption of those employers who are exploiting Australian aboriginal natives on wool stations, or employers who are sweating Pacific island natives on plantations, I hope that the honourable member for Wakefield will insist upou reasonable safeguards being inserted to protect those unfortunate people. I congratulate the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) upon having submitted the amendment which the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has adopted and moved, in wider terms, as a Government amendment. It establishes a very desirable precedent in our legislation. I have a lively recollection of protests that Australian aborigines were overlooked in earlier legislation and, in common with the honourable member for Wakefield, I have had brought to my notice several glaring anomalies which should be rectified. Aborigines who served overseas with the Australian Imperial Force have been denied benefits under the Repatriation Act,",51,Lawson I T May Be An Particularly Because It Has Such

I agree that it is advisable that there should be some recognition of the Australian aboriginal, and that he should be given the right, if he is employed, to pardefinitely exclude them. ticipate in the benefits of national insurance. I commend the proposal that the commission to be set up under this bill should be guided, in deciding as to whether aborigines shall or shall not be exempted, by the recommendation of the Protector of Aborigines. Those who have knowledge of the conditions obtaining on big stations which employ aborigines as cattle men, are aware that it is characteristic of the natives to go periodically on ""walkabout."" Honorahle members know full well that although an aboriginal may be employed for a certain period of the year there is an irresistible urge for him to go back to the tribe. When he does go back there is always the risk that he may suffer in a tribal war some hurt that will cause him to claim the benefits of this legislation. My opinion is that it is advisable that the Protector of Aborigines should be the arbitrator .to decide whether the disability was brought about naturally or in the pursuit of his vocation and not by tribal warfare. this matter is to be discussed on its merits we should vote on this question with our the Minister should postpone this clause eyes open.

The honourable gentleman and I do not see eye to eye on most things. I consider that if the aborigines are to be brought within the scope of this bill they should be treated under precisely the same conditions as are the white people. The tax on their employer vrill be the same and the tax on themselves will be the same, and I suppose that the rate of benefits will be the same as will apply to whites. No restriction should be placed on an aboriginal, if after being employed for a time, he decides to go away for a period. No provision is made for the exemption of white men who after working for a period either voluntarily or compulsorily leave their employment.

If we postpone this clause, it will not be easy to proceed with consideration of the remainder of the bill. The amendment moved by the Treasurer will mean that all employed persons, whether they Ibe of British race, alien white race, aborigines, or Pacific islanders, shall come under the bill on an equal footing. The committee, at a much later stage, will have an opportunity to consider the exemptions which the Treasurer has suggested. The committee may not adopt the proposal that aboriginal natives of Australia or of the islands of the Pacific who .are employed persons shall be brought within the scope of the bill. I suggest that the proper thing for the committee to do is to examine the Treasurer's proposal on its merits. I am satisfied with it because it removes the unnatural and inhumane distinction between classes of workers in this country. I suggest that we carry this amendment; the proposed modification of it will come before us for consideration later. The clause, as it is proposed to be amended, should not be modified in any way, but, if any modification is inserted, it should Half-castes will be be' under strict conditions, and exemption should be granted only on the recommendation of officers responsible for the urge that the welfare of the aboriginal.

This is the executive clause, under which all employed persons will be brought within the scope of the measure; but later, when the schedule is reached, the committee will have the opportunity to consider what persons may be excluded or exempted by the commission. I suggest to the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) that he should not press his amendment, because the points raised by him can be considered at a later stage.

The adult male aborigine who is a good worker receives at least £2 a week. The police officer in the district where he is employed sees that his wages are paid to his credit at tbe bank, and generally supervises his financial transactions. I hope that the Government will endeavour to ensure that the benefit of this legislation is never taken from the aborigines. I join in the general expressions of appreciation of the Government's action in this matter. ' The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) and the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) have taken a great interest in the welfare of the aborigines, and I am glad to have co-operated with them at all times. I appreciate the opportunity now presented to ensure to this section of the community the further protection which this bill provides. Before an aboriginal can c-ome under the scheme he must be a worker, and he must be employed. If ho is willing to contribute to the insurance fund, his employer, should also be ready to do so. The aboriginal contributor and his dependants should be entitled to all the benefits under this bill I am glad that the scope of the bill is The State Protectors of Aborigines should be asked commission regarding the difficult' problem of dealing with the aboriginal and half-caste problem. It is important to know how many of the natives are likely to remain steadily at work. If the benefits of the scheme were extended only to those aborigines who earn reasonable wages and will seek continuity of employment, it would be of advantage to white employees on outback stations. If overseas owners of large stations knew that they had to pay contributions to national insurance in respect of white employees and not in respect of aborigines, they might try to give preference to the latter. I hope that the principle which the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has now accepted will Ibe adopted in connection with other measures of a similar character, and, where practicable, extended, because assistance to the aboriginal population has been too long delayed. I am glad that the party to which I belong has taken the lead in this matter. grateful to the Treasurer ( Mr Casey; for the action he has taken in this matter. As one who has been associated with the Aborigines Protection Board in New South Wales for many years, I regard the amendment as a step in the right direction. Many of thoaborigines employed on mission stations are well educated, as school teachers are provided by the Education Department. In the western and north-western districts of New South Wales, many of the aborigines are highly intelligent, and are in permanent employment. Thsy are regarded as highly-skilled workers, and give entire satisfaction to their employers. Many of them are well able to discuss the problems of the day, and their rights should be fully recognized. Their exclusion, in the first place, from the benefits of this bill was a gratuitous insult to a section of the community to whom we owe more than many of us are willing to acknowledge. I . regret the slurs cast upon them from time to time regarding their habits of life. The secular education which they receive has an elevating influence upon them. to be widened to include every employed to advise the person, in Australia. The question as to the conditions under which aborigines or any other class shall be -enabled to participate in the scheme can be considered when the schedules are before us. I consider it entirely unnecessary to exclude natives of the islands of the Pacific from the benefits of this measure. The only Kanakas left in my district are very old and decrepit, and I do not know one who is fit to work. They are a negligible number, and I do not believe that half a dozen of them could qualify for inclusion iu the insurance scheme. dants? up with Professor Brigden.

If the conditions are as suggested by the honourable member for Moreton, the position will be unsatisfactory. is not a solution. would be more satisfactory because it would enable the drafting of a sub-clause to clause 17 so that the whole provisions relating to aborigines would be confined to one clause instead of being set out in different places in the bill. I am not particularly concerned whether the amendment goes to a division or not. It is ridiculous to say in this clause that all employed persons over sixteen years of age are within the scope of the bill, and then to say later in the bill that some of them are outside it. I should not have risen a second time except for the remarks of the honvear), which I find difficult to underput itself in a ridiculous position by just opening the door to all aboriginal employees, and afterwards excluding some of them. Exactly the same procedure is adopted with white employees. The bill says they may all come in as insured persons, but Part II . of the first schedule deals with excepted employment, and with those classes of white employees who will be excluded from the operation of the bill. The proposed procedure will not affect aborigines or those who are partly aboriginal differently from white employees. They are all allowed in by this clause and exceptions are made later in the bill. If the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) had closed the door first and had given the committee an assurance that later he would open it to some extent, then I could understand the reasoning of the honourable member for Dalley.

360,Orable Member For Dalley ( Mr Rose,"is wide open, and as He wants it open, he should be satisfied. [10.43] I wholeheartedly support the clause and for more than one reason. While I have criticism to offer on many provisions in 'the bill, I consider that this, clause embodies one of the . finest principles contained in any legislation in this country. I , and others, have approached the Treasurer ( Mr Case^) and other Ministers with requests to remove from Australian democracy the blot which prevents some citizens from enjoying the benefits of social legislation. The clause removes one blot, and I regard it as one of the finest features of the bill. There was objection to it when it appeared to keep out aborigines, but the amendment puts them on the same footing as other persons. The clause will exclude many aborigines, hut it will not exclude some men that I know who are highly respected tradesmen, sportsmen, and broadcasters at Wesley Church, and other places. The suggestion of the Treasurer is excellent. J want to emphasize how pleased I am that the amendment will enable Chinese or other foreigners, of whatever nationality, creed, or caste, to share in the benereceived. fits that other citizens of Australia enjoy. tived.

Why were all Australian architects throughout the world, as well 'as Australian stone and allied Australian workmanship, excluded? honourable member's questions are as follows:I . Yes. 2. The Scullin Government in 1031 decided t(» abandon the proposal to construct n memorial on the lines originally intended. Tho varioxis steps which led to the decision are as follows:In 1020, the Commonwealth Government approved of the erection of a national memorial at Villers Bretonneux not to exceed £100,000 (inclusive of approximately £20,000 at the disposal of the Imperial War Graves Commission). In 1927, as the result of a competition limited to Australian architects and designers who had enlisted or whose sons or daughters had enlisted for service in the Great War, the design of Mr William Lucas, of Melbourne, was selected. After consultation with the Imperial War'Graves Commission, Mr Lucas completed his plans and these were then submitted to the Bureau of Fine Arts, Paris, whose approval was necessary before the work of construction could proceed. This approval was obtained in 1929, but, owing to the financial situation, construction was postponed and in 1931 the scheme was abandoned. Subsequently, the Imperial War Graves Commission drew attention to the fact that the constructional programme foi treating graves overseas of the fallen of the British Army had been completed aiul memorials to the missing (except at Vimy) erected, whilst the names of some 11,000 Western Front had not been commemorated. The commission urged that action was necessary to proceed with the national memorial on which the missing were to be commemorated or, alternatively, to proceed with the memorial to the missing from the funds at their disposal for this purpose (approximately £20,000). In 1935, the Commonwealth Government asked the Imperial War Graves Commission to submit for approval a design for a memorial at Villers Bretonneux to commemorate the 11,000 missing and incorporating tablets indicating the names of places where the remaining 8,000 missing were commemorated. The total cost of the scheme was not to exceed '£30,000 (subsequently increased to £36,000). In February, 1930, the scheme submitted by the War Graves Commission was approved by the Commonwealth : Government and the commission was requested to proceed with the work. The design approved was prepared by the eminent British architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens. This architect had designed the entrance to the cemetery at Villers Bretonneux and, as this entrance also leads to the memorial site, it was appropriate answers to the that he should have been selected by the commission to design the memorial. . In view of the fact that most of the funds to be expended on the memorial have been provided by the Imperial'War Graves Commission, it was reasonable that the construction of the memorial should bo left in the hands of that body. 3..See ansvfer to question 2. Mr Lucas was reimbursed financially for the services he had rendered. 4 and 5. bee answer to question 2. Defence, upon notice1. Has his attention been directed to press reports that the distribution of air mails from Darwin would not come into operation for about twelve months? 2.

I have 'seen statements in tbe press that the arrangements for the distribution of overseas air mail arriving at Darwin would not come into operation for about twelve months after the commencement of the flying boat service. I am not aware from what source this report emanated, but it certainly has no authoritative basis. 2. As the Government has not yet made its decision on a ll details in connection with the Australians missing on the distribution of overseas mails arriving by the flying boat service, I am unable to make a f u l l statement on the matter yet; such a statement w i ll be made, howovcr, as soon as possible.",59,Australian National War Memoria L
