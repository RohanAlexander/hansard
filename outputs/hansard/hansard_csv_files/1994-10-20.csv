We did that both to persons presenting at Social Security, DEET, assist the government to focus on the issues a CES office or a youth access centre would and also for the community and agencies to be treated equally whether they were applying respond. Those issues involve the differences, for Austudy or the youth training allowance. to some degree, between the youth training That appears to be where we are going, and allowance and Austudy. the interchangeability of the two departments One needs to understand that there will still is apparently developing also. be two separate systems.

But I point out However, what happens after the legislation, that, in our investigations and inspections to with the application and the processes which date, we have talked to a number of young are involved, is equally important. Having a people, and many of the stories we have separate set of criteria is a vital first step. It heard have been both tragic and disturbing. is an extremely important signal to those Certainly, the idea that the government makes applying. But there is not much point in life more difficult and more confusing for having a single set of criteria if the processes people who have been so severely traumatised are grossly different. What we suggested in is one that I am sure all members of this the discussion paper, which followed the House would not support. hearings we have been having and discussions Another issue we raise in the discussion which include the department, was that young paper that has been picked up and incorporated in the legislation is the question of appeals worker.

Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2563 Thursday, 20 October 1994 Consideration resumed from 13 October. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. This bill presents amendments necessary to implement the remaining part of the budget package for the veterans' affairs portfolio. Honourable members will recall that the first part of the package was dealt with by the parliament in the winter sittings. In developing this package extensive, constructive and valuable consultations with the ex-service community were held by me and my predecessor, Senator Faulkner. These consultations were welcomed by both the government and the ex-service community and it is my hope that we may continue to work together in the future to provide the best possible care and recognition for veterans and their dependants. The budget package was developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-servicemen and women, war widows and widowers and their dependants. It responded to issues raised by Professor Peter Baume, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Bomball and Ms Robyn Layton in their report entitled A Fair Go. It also responded to issues raised by other groups in respect of the ageing of veterans of the world wars, and the different set of difficulties facing younger veterans. I will now tum to the specific measures included in this bill. The first initiative will affect service pensioners and income support supplement recipients. The treatment of their compensation payments, such as accident, sickness and workers compensation payments, will be aligned with the way in which compensation payments received by recipients of comparable social security payments are treated under the Social Security Act. This will ensure equitable assessment of income support payments made by both departments. Without going into detail, receipt of compensation payments may affect the rate and payability of service pension and income support supplement. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent double dipping. They only apply where a person receives a compensation payment which includes a component for loss of earnings or loss of the capacity to earn, and then only if the service pension or income support supplement recipient is under pension age. The new arrangements will only apply to compensation payments received on or after 1 January 1995. Pensions that are not for income support are not included in these new arrangements. Already a person in receipt of disability pension or war widows or widowers pension may have the rate of that pension reduced if the compensation payments are paid in respect of the same injury or disease for which the pension is being paid. Thus, in the case of a person who receives both a disability pension and service pension, any compensation payments which have been used to reduce the payment of the disability pension will not be taken into account again",135,Auditor General S Reports

395,Mr Sciacca (Bowman,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (10.00 a.m.)-I move:2564 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 to affect the payment of a person's service pension. Similar arrangements will also apply to a person in receipt of both a war widows or widowers pension and income support supplement. The next initiative provides automatic eligibility for a funeral benefit to be paid to the estate of a veteran who, at the time of death, was receiving extreme disablement adjustment or was a former prisoner of war. In a large percentage of such cases a funeral benefit would be paid under the existing rules, but not automatically. In many cases these veterans leave behind a grieving partner, who will no longer need to forward an application in that time of grief, nor will the partner suffer any anxiety about the availability of the benefit. Automatic eligibility for funeral benefit already applies to certain other groups of pensioners. The addition of these new groups will provide uniformity by granting a funeral benefit in all cases in which an automatic grant of war widows or widowers pension applies. Another initiative in this bill will be of benefit to applicants to the Veterans Review Board. Until now they may have had to meet certain costs of obtaining medical evidence to submit to the board out of their own pocket. Now they will be reimbursed those costs. They will be entitled to payment of an amount up to $425 for each condition subject to review, as well as an allowance for associated travelling expenses. Already the cost of certain medical evidence obtained at the primary determining level may be reimbursed. The introduction of this change is in response to a recommendation of the Baume committee. I expect that it will encourage applicants to present their supporting evidence as soon as they can. Currently some applicants appear to withhold evidence until it can be presented at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because in some cases such costs can be met through legal aid grants. By meeting some or all of the costs involved in obtaining this evidence at an earlier stage, it is possible that a decision in favour of the applicant may be recorded earlier. This would avoid the need for many applicants to pursue an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A further initiative will allow for the payment of an education entry payment to partner and carer service pensioners and to income support supplement recipients. Education entry payments are paid annually to meet some of the costs of enrolling in a course of study. They assist pensioners under pension age to further their education, thereby improving their employment prospects. The next initiative is of particular benefit to refugees. It will remove the waiting period for service pension for those Commonwealth veterans, allied veterans and allied mariners who were given permanent resident status as refugees. They will no longer need to have been Australian residents for a continuous period of 10 years nor will they need to meet the rules for non-continuous periods. These requirements are being eased because refugees, unlike other migrants, do not have a choice when leaving their home countries. They also experience greater resettlement difficulties and are less likely to obtain a pension from their countries of origin. I am informed that this initiative has been warmly received within those segments of our multicultural society where refugees are represented. Another initiative will mean that pharmaceutical allowance will be paid only to a person who is in Australia. Short-term absences, however, will not be taken into account. Pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in 1990 to compensate pensioners for the cost of prescription items supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and later the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. These prescription items had previously been free of charge. Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMfITEE 2565 A further proposal in this bill affects membership of the Veterans Review Board. The requirement that a proportion of the members of the Veterans Review Board be registered or licensed medical practitioners will be removed. This is consequential upon the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Specialist Medical Review Council under the first part of the budget measures package. The Repatriation Medical Authority determines questions of medical causation and prepares statements of principle. These are based on sound medical scientific evidence and exclusively state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and service. A right of appeal against certain determinations of the Repatriation Medical Authority is available to the Specialist Medical Review Council. The proposal does not affect the terms of appointment of the current medical members nor will it alter the total number of members. Persons with medical qualifications could still be appointed as ordinary members. This bill also contains consequential amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and other acts relating to matters dealt with in the first Act of the package. The consequential amendments relate to the payment of income support supplement, the payment of 'single' rate service pension to widows, widowers and non-illness separated spouses, and the integration of Australian mariners with veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In summary, I believe that the measures presented in this Bill represent major initiatives which will help to ensure the fair and equitable delivery of repatriation benefits to veterans and their dependants. I commend the bill to the House. Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill, but I must express disappointment again as to the period of time made available to me for consultation as the opposition's representative of veterans and other people affected by these decisions. It was our understanding, just a few days ago, that this bill would come on for debate in November, and we were informing the various veterans' organisations accordingly. It does create problems, which I do not think are necessary, considering that most of these measures will not be implemented until next calendar year anyway. I see my role in representing the interests of veterans in this place as one of advocacy and of achieving the best result wherever possible by negotiation with the government. I think we have already proved our credentials in that regard. However, in legislation of this type there are aspects that could require reading by people of considerable experience in veterans' affairs. For example, it could be that tucked away in one of these bills is something that a person with a long experience in negotiating with the government would recognise as an issue that had been opposed in the past. I know that I need the help of people who have spent decades, in some cases, representing the interests of veterans. In the context of the excellent relationship we have had on these issues to date, I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Sciacca) that I would appreciate more time. I rushed into my party room on Monday before I had even put the matter to the shadow ministry. The party room took the attitude that we would reserve our right to introduce further amendments to this legislation in the Senate if some specific issue arose. I am not contemplating that this situation need occur but we are of the view that we must take that particular position. I have had a chance since then to talk with the various interest groups. This is the problem when bills are introduced one week and debated the next.",139,Representatives Main Commitiee
396,Mr Tuckey (O'connor) (10.09 A.m.),"The coalition is not opposed to the Veterans'2566 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 This is my first time in the Main Committee. I argued quite passionately for its establishment because I expected that the Main Committee would avoid the outcome of guillotines and legislative log jams at the end of session. As I have said time and again, I can cop the cut in speaking time but, as a frontbencher, I cannot support a concept of being given insufficient time to consult with interest groups outside this parliament. I want to put that on the record. I advise the Main Committee that we do have one amendment which I will refer to later. This has been circulated in my name. I point out to the minister that we were only able to fax that amendment to him last night for the simple reason that we did not have adequate time. If the minister wants us to advise him of our intentions in adequate time for him to provide a response, he should recognise that more time is necessary. In my view, the minister has given a fair interpretation of this legislation in his second reading speech. I make some remarks in that regard. It is a sensible proposition that the alignment of compensation payments-where they apply on an income related basis-is practical and fair. As the minister has pointed out, it is already in effect in other areas. It does not affect disability payments directly or people over the pension age. That is an attractive and proper situation. It is a little complex in some cases. Disability payments will be affected but there will be no effect on pensions. On most occasions, I would expect the opposite to apply. As a consequence, I hope the department makes sure that veterans are properly informed as to how this measure will apply to them. It is quite proper that, if somebody is getting compensation on the basis of another injury, they should not be able to double dip, as the minister says. I welcome the introduction of automatic payments of funeral benefits to the estate of a veteran who is receiving extreme disablement adjustment or who was a former prisoner of war. Over time, I hope that this assistance can be expanded further. I certainly welcome the fact that it has been made automatic. It is easy to say that something is automatic but there must be some process by which the funeral director or whoever can seek this assistance. I would like the minister to explain this in his response so we can tell people the process. 'Automatic' is an interesting word. If the department is not aware of someone's death, I am not sure how it can make an automatic payment. The department might not happen to read about it in the papers. The process is probably covered by administrative arrangements. I would like to know what these arrangements are so the matter can be well and truly circulated. I now turn to the issue of reimbursement of costs for applicants obtaining medical evidence to present to the Veterans Review Board-a maximum amount of $425 for each condition. We welcome the government's decision. It is not a great cost. My recollection is that the estimated cost to government is about $40,000. That is very small beer when one considers that it will assist veterans who would not otherwise have the financial resources to do it. I support the minister's view that, if these matters can be resolved at the level of the VRB, that is preferable to going to the AAT, with all the associated costs of legal representation. Members of the veterans community still have grave doubts because many of their appeal processes do not involve legal representation. We have to have faith that the VRB, the Specialist Medical Review Council and other bodies are going to be generous to veterans because they do not have legal representation in these areas. The reduction in cost, both to individual veterans and to the department, is a matter which I think should be avoided. Provided the veteran appellant is in a position to be guaranteed a fair deal, it is much better that we go down that road. I am quite willing to try to convince concerned veterans that it Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2567 is an appropriate process. My efforts will be substantiated if the government ensures that if there is a doubt it comes down on the side of the veteran. That is the area of concern. In making what is a quite proper decision, and for reasons that the minister has announced, I feel-and I hope that I am correct-that the government overlooked the newly established Specialist Medical Review Council, which would probably be used a lot less often than the VRB. The amendment that I have circulated in my name today seeks to give the same financial assistance to people seeking or having to obtain medical evidence to go before that Specialist Medical Review Council as to those to go before the VRB. Quite clearly, that is what the provision is there for and medical evidence would obviously be the determinant. It could be that because of the significant nature of it-we are talking about something that could consequently affect a lot of other veterans-that $425 would be a minimal amount because the veteran would probably have to mount an even more substantial case in terms of arguing for an additional SOP, for instance. There may be some argument that the amount should be more, but we have suggested that whilst people appealing to the VRB would now have this financial assistance, it should be extended to those appealing to the Specialist Medical Review Council. It may be that, under the new rules of the VRB, medical evidence may not be so necessary, simply because the SOPs are binding on the VRB-and there will be less medical debate, quite obviously. I do not actually understand how much medical evidence a veteran might still have to put before the VRB, but obviously there will be some, and it will cost the individual veteran money to obtain that advice and that report. It is an excellent idea to give some financial assistance, both in terms of paying for the medical advice and for any travel associated with that medical advice. As I have informed the minister, we will only move these amendments in this House. They are amendments to the act-as is the rest of this bill-and they have been inserted in the appropriate section dealing with the Specialist Medical Review Council. I might point out to the minister that, whilst an opposition generally cannot commit a government to expenditure, he has a one-line item in his budget of $4.671 million-which is to be found in Appropriation Bill (No.1), under the schedule for Veterans' Affairs, division 195, item 4-03-which clearly could be applied to this purpose. So we are not asking the government to alter its budget-just to find what might be a very small amount of money when one looks at $120 billion of expenditure, to extend the government's generosity, in terms of the VRB, to applicants to the SMRC. It might be that the government is able to announce, prior to this matter being debated in the Senate, or even today, that it will accept our amendments and have them passed with the support of all members of the House of Representatives and/or the Senate. I foreshadow that I will move our amendments in the consideration in detail stage. That is a matter of importance. I note the government's intention to introduce an education entry payment to partner and carer service pensioners and income support supplement recipients. That is, as we interpret it, about $200. I am not sure that that is going to be a great help. I wholeheartedly support the concept of giving financial assistance to people to educate themselves so they can re-enter the work force. I am wondering just how much encouragement $200 might be, but it is a step in the right direction, so we are not opposing it. 2568 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 I might add, in the context of educating people and getting them back into the work force, that the government, some time ago, invited here two people from Massachusetts in America. They were employees of one-time presidential aspirant Mr Michael Dukakis, in his position as governor of Massachusetts. In our terminology, the male was head of the social security department and the female, who also happened to be his wife, was head of the CES. They were brought out here to give advice on getting single parents back into the work force. I was fortunate enough to attend a briefing they gave to interested members and staff. I was extremely disappointed, although I predicted it at the time, that the real grounds for their success-and they are internationally recognised for it-were ignored by this government. Basically, they are still ignored, notwithstanding the move to case management and things that appear in the white paper. It is something the minister, having an interest as declared here under this announcement, might like to lead his party on. When the husband took over social security, he realised that he was paying a large number of people who, in fact, had university qualifications and all sorts of things but had got sidelined as single parents and could not get back into the work force, and that he had a responsibility to do something about that. What he did was ring up his wife, and a number of private agencies, and say, 'I have a deal for you.' It is quite typical of the way Americans, even in a bureaucracy, manage to do business. The deal was simply this: he put a price on getting those people back into the work force in permanent employment. Whether it was his wife's department-the CES, as we would know it here-or certain approved private agencies, people would say, 'Yes, I will take Joe Blow on. I will re-educate him and brush up his present qualifications, find him a job and keep him in it for whatever is the agreed period. Then you will pay me the money, as a lump sum.' It is the incentive of that that has made that scheme work. All the bits and pieces that went around the periphery of that were listened to by the government. But the government ignored that fundamental: that people-even other government departments-were given a financial incentive only if they succeeded. Whether we like it or not, it is a fundamental of human nature and it is working in Massachusetts. Nevertheless, the $200 is a step in the right direction. I think it is also fair and reasonable to remove the waiting period for service pensions for refugees. The minister's arguments are quite clear there. It is a specialist area and we are presuming people are refugees who have fought in their own country, and possibly fought on our side in some particular conflict, and they should get the recognition they deserve. The cessation of payments for pharmaceutical allowances for veterans who are absent from Australia for a period of 12 months or more is also supported. We are talking about $2.60 per individual or $5.20 per married couple that was provided by the government when it commenced the ever growing process of charging up-front fees on medical prescriptions that previously were issued absolutely free of charge. This fortnightly payment is aimed at compensating pensioners, on an averaging basis, for that additional cost. We see that as quite an appropriate measure and in fact we do not see why people who are living in another country and dealing with the pharmaceutical system that applies in that country should be receiving benefits from Australia. So we support the government in removing that benefit from people who no longer go into our pharmacies and who are acquiring pharmaceutical prescriptions anyway. ·Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 2569 Other than the consequential amendments, the final major issue is the removal of the requirement that a proportion of the members of the Veterans Review Board be registered or licensed medical practitioners. This makes sense. We now have the Repatriation Medical Authority. We have the binding of the VRB to its statement of principles. The idea of certain members of the board turning to someone else and saying, 'Well, has that medical evidence got any standing', because they as lay persons would not know, is no longer necessary. They are tied to the SOPs and we hope by the time they have passed the parliament they will be concise and reasonably understandable, so there is no reason to have specialist type people on the VRB. I note that the minister points out some will probably remain as ordinary members and that makes sense, but over the years if we do not need these people and others can do the job equally well, then why not have them there. We have not got any serious concerns that I am aware of in any of those issues. Having a few minutes left, I might point out to the minister that he may at some time in the future-and the recent Agent Orange arrangement highlights this-find that he is very grateful to the coalition for putting forward the amendment to which he agreed, to create an appeal provision in the Specialist Medical Review Council. I say that because we have a classic example here of evidence coming forward to the minister of a change in medical opinion on the effects of herbicides, in this case Agent Orange, for causal effects in terms of a present medical condition of veterans, and in this case, those who were in the Vietnam war. The simple fact is that by creating the Repatriation Medical Authority the minister is no longer able to make a commitment to veterans to the effect that he will fix it. All he or any future minister can do is refer that medical evidence to the RMA and ask it to make a decision. I cannot see how else it will work because it has to come down with a statement of principle and, if the minister is going to overrule it on those sorts of things, then we might ask what it is doing. Why not just write the statement of principles in the minister's office. There might be some little legal remedy there that gets around it but I doubt that the minister should use it if he is going to stand by what he did. The simple fact is that a person has the right to appeal to the Specialist Medical Review Council that we created. As I see it, one could probably put the two professors who wrote the report on that particular Specialist Medical Review Council because that is wide open to appointments from time to time. As I said to the minister at the time, we might be just saving him from himself. I am quite happy to repeat that remark but I am also prepared to say that the minister and his office gave us the maximum cooperation in considering that matter and it was resolved in the proper way in the interests of veterans. I say to the minister, in concluding, that I want to take this opportunity to mention representations I received recently. I do not want to mention the person's name, but I will naturally provide it to the minister. I have had drawn to my attention the psychological effect that PTSD has on veterans. The problems associated with it are a matter that the minister is concerned about. I am concerned about it. I am also concerned about the attitudes of others whom I consulted this week about how we should deal with people with psychological problems. The out-sourcing that has gone on in recent times, particularly at state level, has gone too far. I cannot stand up as an expert with solutions, but institutionalisation has received a lot of criticism. On the other hand, to throw some of these people out on the street without proper support is equally bad, in my mind. When I had this case drawn to my attention, it really did worry me. 2570 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 The person I am talking about enlisted in World War II at the age of 14. He then went away as a soldier, and later served in Korea and Vietnam. He is now in an advanced stage of all sorts of illnesses, including Huntington's syndrome, but is required to continue living at home, presumably with the assistance of his daughter. He has organic brain disease, renal failure and PTSD muscle spasms, and is being harassed by the police. According to my advice, he is a prisoner in his own home because when he walks outside he worries people. He possibly does do violent things on the street. He has had restraining orders put upon him. His neighbours belittle him and, apparently, have told him to go back in the house and die. It is a pretty sad case. I want to put it on the record, not in any form of criticism, but because something has got to be done. I will hand his name and address to the minister. He has been in and out of the courts and I am not saying he did not do something that the broader community would say is wrong. Apparently he is seriously ill, having given service in all the areas I have mentioned. He is now aged 67, and I think we need to investigate the matter in order to help this person in what might be his remaining months. I thank the minister for taking note of this matter. I know I will get a response. I think it is sufficiently serious to raise in this place. When the information was put before me, it really got me down. We do not oppose this legislation. We would welcome the government's supporting us in what we think is something it possibly overlooked in its proposals to give financial assistance to people making appeals to the VRB, assistance which is also needed on the occasions when they go to the Specialist Medical Review Council. have this opportunity to rise in support of the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). Issues of importance to our veterans community are about to gain an added impetus at the Australian remembrance campaign next year when matters of concern to veterans will be highlighted. It is timely that we are talking about veterans issues with this particular bill. The bill proposes a number of amendments necessary to implement the second stage of the budget package for the veterans' affairs portfolio. Members will be well acquainted with the broad range of measures which the budget brought down to improve things for veterans. The initiatives contained in the budget, and in this bill, have been developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-servicemen and women, war widows and widowers, and their dependants. The package responds in a real way to the issues raised by the Baume committee and other groups with respect to problems of older veterans of the two world wars, and the problems of younger veterans of more recent conflicts. Following the budget, the RSL National President, Major General 'Digger' James, endorsed the Veterans' Affairs package. It is fair to say that the RSL and Labor governments have not always seen eye-to-eye in the past-and still do not, on certain issues-but the reception of the budget package is due in no small way to the role of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Sciacca) in gaining the support of the veterans community and its peak bodies. I congratulate him on his efforts since becoming minister. He was actually in my electorate on business on Friday of last week, and he visited the Amberley RAAF base to have a look around there. He spoke about some things for the Australian remembrance campaign next year. He was good enough to give up his time to meet with three of my veteran constituents-very important people in our community. I would like to say something about these three particular",141,Representatives Main Committee
397,Mr Les Scott (Oxley) (10.34 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am particularly pleased toThursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2571 people. They are actually from the Veterans Support and Advocacy Service, which is located in Inala, in the electorate of the honourable member for Rankin( Mr Beddall). They come from three different areas and I will speak of them in a minute. The secretary, of course, is from my own electorate. I would like to take the opportunity to formally place on the record my appreciation to the minister for giving up his time last week to meet with these three veterans, who are actually Vietnam veterans, and with the other Ipswich veterans he met earlier this year when he visited the electorate not long after being given the portfolio. I understand that the Goodna RSL Club was the first place that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs actually visited after becoming minister. He went over particularly well, and sat and spoke with members of our veteran community, and they were very pleased. The three gentlemen to whom I referred a moment ago as having spoken to the minister last week are Brian Evans, who lives in Ipswich in my electorate; Paul McPhee, who lives in the electorate of the honourable member for Fadden( Mr Jull); and Brett Kriewaldt, the president of the association, who lives in the electorate of the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch), who is the honourable member for Dickson. All three gentlemen are very keen to get involved in the Australian remembrance campaign next year, and I look forward to their contribution. Brian will certainly be involved in my own local electorate, and Paul and Brett in the electorates of the members. I referred to before. The Veterans Support and Advocacy Service has been centralised very much on the needs of Vietnam veterans. I remember that Brian Evans came to see me some time ago, before he was involved with this particular service. He was certainly someone who was very severely affected by the stress of the war. It is only since he has become involved with the service that he has come out of that. It has been a great transformation to see Brian become such a great worker for his fellow veterans. He is doing a tremendous job. I would like to put that on the record, because it really goes to show how the support that people can get from one another helps so much, and his is a real case in point. During the minister's visit to my electorate last week, he discussed a range of issues with the members from the Veterans Support and Advocacy Service, issues which are important to all members of the veterans community and not just to the Vietnam veterans. They do not distinguish between them: a veteran is a veteran, as far as the service is concerned, no matter what conflict the veteran was involved in. The service provides a much-needed focal point for veterans in the whole Ipswich-Inala region. It is particularly the younger veterans that these people concentrate on. They have already gained much from the budget measures, and that is why I mentioned Brian Evans's own stress related problems before. The post-traumatic stress disorder package introduced earlier this year was covered by the Baume committee. It was certainly welcomed very much by the whole veterans community, and was an innovative package that I was particularly pleased about, since there are quite a number of Vietnam veterans in my own electorate who will benefit from that $20.6 million over four years. Anyone who has been dealing with sufferers of this condition knows how demoralising it can be, both to the sufferer and to his or her family. That is something that we all, as members of parliament, can look at with very much a bipartisan attitude. I am sure that most members of the House have dealings with the whole range of veterans, including Vietnam veterans, and that they see these problems for themselves. I welcome the initiative, which includes funding for the PTSD treatment centres, more resources for the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, and money for research into the specific health 2572 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 problems of younger veterans-such as the Agent Orange problem which the honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) talked about before. This bill adds to that excellent package of reform measures. It is certainly wide in its scope, but I would like to concentrate on a few areas in the time allocated to me today. Firstly, the bill will amend the act to align the treatment of compensation payments received by service pensioners with the way in which compensation payment recipients of comparable social security payments are treated under the Social Security Act. At the moment, compensation payments to service pensioners are treated in a number of ways. Periodic payments of compensation are treated as income for the purposes of the ordinary income test. Lump sum compensation payments are held as an asset of the person, and any income derived from that asset is then treated as ordinary income for the purposes of the ordinary income test. If people receive compensation and part of that compensation is made for loss of earnings or loss of capacity to earn, they are not entitled to a service pension in addition to the compensation payment they have already received. The important thing to note here is that veterans are not looking for handouts or special charity provisions. I can safely say that the veterans in my electorate, and in the broader community, are the sort of people who like to think of themselves as members of the community who pull their weight in our society. They are people who have reaIly pulled their weight more than many others in our community, so I do not think too many of them would disagree with this amendment which rationalises and streamlines the veterans entitlements process. One of the other amendments deals with the income support supplement, known as ISS, which was also introduced with the budget measures this year. The bill aims to extend the ISS to war widows or widowers who are caring for severely handicapped persons. This is another compassionate and worthwhile initiative for veterans and their dependants. We should remember that wars are fought not only on the battlefields but also in the homes of Australiaby the wives and families who are left behind. That is something that we will remember very much, I believe, in 1995 in the Australia Remembers program. It is really the families who are very severely affected. The wives, families and children are all very much affected by war and need to have a lot of assistance and compassion afforded to them. Those who were left behind when their loved ones served their country overseas are those important people we speak about, and I do not think there are too many people in this country who have not been affected in some small way by those sorts of situations. The majority of voluntary caring work in our society is done by women-I think we all know that-and it is something that should always be acknowledged whenever possible in this place. This extension of income support supplement is targeted at them, and rightly so. Caring for a handicapped or elderly person is one of the most selfless tasks one human being can perform for another, but it is also one of the most demanding. When we talk to people who are affected in this way, when we see an older couple where a male veteran is deteriorating in his later years, it is very often the wife who is giving a lot of that support that he needs. Women are the unsung heroes of many of our conflicts. Their physical and emotional reserves are called upon every day to face the challenge of caring for people who are sometimes terribly afflicted. I am very pleased that this initiative is being introduced in National Carers Week. The ISS itself was another of the excellent reforming initiatives contained in the original legislation earlier this year. As members may remember, it will be introduced in March next Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 2573 year. The change will affect widows and widowers who, in addition to their war widows or widowers pension, also receive additional income support payments from the Department of Social Security. Before the legislation was introduced, widows and widowers have had to collect this pension through DSS, but under new plans introduced by the minister they will receive the income support supplement directly from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This wiII no doubt make life a lot easier for recipients, and it will certainly make life simpler for the group of people who will be regarded as eligible for the ISS. The payment will be paid at the same rate as the social security payment, and veterans entitled to the payment who wish to continue to receive their payment through the Department of Social Security may elect to do so. The ISS initiative has been warmly received by the ex-service community in general and the War Widows Guild in particular. It is estimated that nearly 54,000 war widows and widowers will elect to transfer this payment from DSS to Veterans' Affairs, and I am sure life will be a lot easier and simpler for them as a result of that. This bill also seeks to extend the education entry payment to ISS recipients. Education entry payments are made to some pensioners to help them further their education and thus enhance their job prospects. The payment is an annual grant made to assist with the costs of enrolling in a course of study. The amendments provide that partner and carer service pensioners may be paid an education entry payment in certain circumstances, namely, if they are below pension age and if they are qualified to receive pensioner education supplement under the Austudy scheme. I think it is important to realise that education is becoming a commodity more valuable than anyone could have imagined even 20 years ago and that it is not restricted to younger people; older people can benefit from the new technologies as well and that is something we really should focus a lot more on. In today's world of rapidly changing technology everyone should have access to the means to stay well informed and up to date. Education is the best way to do this, and that goes for the veteran community as well as everyone else. It is not always elderly people either but people around the age of the minister and me-we do not really call ourselves elderly at this stage but it certainly affects a lot of us. Many elderly people would have been denied opportunities that the present generation of tertiary students has come to take for granted. One of the best ways of encouraging a healthy retirement is to have an interest that exercises the body and the mind. The number of mature age students at universities these days is proof of that and should be very welcome. However, many older veterans and dependants would encounter some difficulty in enrolling in tertiary courses because of the cost factor. This amendment will help this group of people and should be welcomed. The amendment is timely, coming as it does two days after the Creative Nation statement presented by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) earlier this week, which has been well received across the nation. It contained many initiatives in the field of technological education. We all realise the importance of having access to, and an understanding of, the technology that is already transforming our world and will change it further in the years to come. It should not be seen as merely a young person's preserve. The elderly need to know about community services, government programs and anything else that the information highway will contain, so they will need to know how to use this sort of technology as well as their grandchildren do. It is amazing how people can respond to that new technology. 2574 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 I am pleased to have had the opportunity to support this legislation today this Main Committee room with its closeness and friendliness. I support the bill and commend it to the House. the shadow minister, the honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) and hope that, sensible as it is, it will be acceptable to the government. It is entirely consistent with the main thrust of the legislation and therefore should not be objectionable. A number of matters in the legislation are commendable and seem to be raising no objections from the veterans community. The only overall objection-that I assume the honourable member has referred to in his speech, which I, unfortunately, was not here for-is that the legislation has been brought in too quickly. I hesitate to suggest that it is being rushed through because there is no apparent reason to rush it through for the sake of hiding anything. In the end, the benefits for veterans ought to be in place as soon as possible and, after all, the legislation implements some of the budget decisions. The shadow minister would have made it clear that we may see fit to move some further amendments in the Senate in due course. It is intended that compensation recovery payments such as accident, sickness and workers compensation payments received by service pensioners and income support supplement recipients be aligned with the way in which compensation payments received by recipients of comparable social security payments are treated under the Social Security Act. This matter raises some general concerns about the treatment of veterans. I have not heard the Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Sciacca) speak about this particular case but I have heard him argue on other occasions for this sort of treatment. In my view, this raises the spectre of a constant attempt to break down the special status of veterans as a distinct group of people. Whilst in this case it may be unobjectionable, and there may well be some arguments for doing it, I make the general statement that this is a concern and that it has happened consistently. I argued against it most recently when the government brought in legislation, not so long ago, to bring the treatment of shares that were owned by pensioners into line with the treatment of shares that were owned by social security beneficiaries. I make the point again that over time we are increasingly seeing this alignment. There is a concern in the veterans community, which the minister will be aware of, because I know that it is widely expressed, that over time the status of veterans will be diminished. There will come a time-and it may well be that the time when it does come will be the right timewhen veterans' entitlements may be totally consumed into the wider social security network. I am not by any means advocating that this should occur, although, realistically, some decades down the track the movement to do that will gather momentum. But in the meantime there is a very strong view among those in the veterans community that their affairs ought to be separate; that their benefits are always to be seen as compensation, not welfare; and that therefore the attempt, at every opportunity, to align veterans benefits with social security benefits per se is a concern, even though it may be supported by equity, or by some other arguments. I make this point because whenever veterans affairs are debated in this parliament, I make a plea for those in the veterans community that their entitlements and benefits be seen in that very special light, and that their special status in the community be safeguarded, and in no way downgraded. I only do that because there are widely held suspicions, despite the current",146,Representatives Main Committee
398,Mr Bradford (Mcpherson) (10.48 A.m.),"I support the amendment foreshadowed byThursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2575 minister's obvious commitment to his role. Perhaps veterans become a little irrational about their concerns-but they do so with some justification, because over the years there have been furphies about scrapping the Department of Veterans' Affairs and about lots of other things that would be of great concern to veterans. The commitment to maintain a ministry of veterans' affairs is very important. In practice, that means that ultimately there is a very high level of commitment by governments of both persuasions to veterans' affairs, by the maintenance of that distinct department. It will be a sad day-and, as I say, it will probably come many years down the track-when there will not be the definite need for a separate department, but there is a need at present, and there will be for a long period of time to come. In particular, in relation to compensation recovery, there were a couple of questions that the minister might address. The answers may be evident, but I am not aware of them. I assume that when compensation recovery happens, any compensation payments received subsequently would be affected by the new mechanism. I am not sure whether there is any retrospective element to this. If people have received compensation payments in the past and they are receiving benefits, I would assume that arrangement is not affected at all, but maybe that is part of the alignment. Perhaps the answer to that question lies in the way that those sorts of awards are treated by the Department of Social Security. The question about the actual timing of all of this obviously would be of concern to veterans and I think needs to be answered. I did receive, and I draw it to the minister's attention, a magazine article headed 'A thorny problem attacked: section 74 Veteran's Entitlements Act'. It reads: Since 1972 the Regular Serviceman has had the right to claim benefits under both the Commonwealth's compensation legislation and the Veteran's Entitlements legislation for the same service caused impairment/disability or incapacity to work. How this curious state of affairs came about is another subject. Where a serviceman has exercised rights and received benefits under both pieces of legislation for the same injury. one or the other benefit must be repaid. Section 74 VE Act provides the mechanism and it does not do a brilliant job. This raises the spectre of how confusing a lot of these entitlements and the interpretation of these entitlements have become. In all of these schemes, not only those for veterans and social security, it is instructive to hear the Minister for Social Security( Mr Baldwin) in the parliament trying to explain some of the government's so-called initiatives and to deal with the anomalies and the unintended consequences. I will not get too side-tracked, but the general principle is that everything seems so complicated. This article goes on to say: The compensatory principles differ. Commonwealth Compensation compensates by periodic (fortnightly) payments for incapacity to work, or by lump sum award for impairment/disablement. or both. Veterans' Entitlements compensates by DVA pension (fortnightly) which is generally for impairment/disability up to 100 per cent General Rate and incapacity to work at Intermediate and Special (TPI) rates. The number of combinations that can arise are many and complicated. The article outlined one situation: The serviceman was granted a DVA pension in 1982 and then in 1984 he was awarded lump sum compensation. Section 74(3) 'deemed' that the 1984 lump sum award was to be treated as if it were paid in fortnightly payments over the actuarial life (life expectancy) of the man as determined by the Australian Government Actuary. The 1984 award was also 'deemed' to have been paid to him in 1982 when the grant of DVA pension was made. The man's actuarial life was calculated on his age in 1982 giving his life expectancy to the year 2003 inclusive. 2576 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 In the result, the lump sum award was spread out as fortnightly 'deemed' payments from 1982 to 2003 inclusive and deducted from his pension payments. When the lump sum was awarded in 1984 the sum of the 'deemed' payments from 1982 pension date to 1984 award date was deducted from the award. The balance of the award or the 'over-payment' was paid over to the man with the intention of being recovered by deduction of the 'deemed' payments from future fortnightly pension. On a doJlar-for-doJlar basis though complicated this sounds fair enough but, it was not on such basis. Section 74(3) said more. The Actuary also had to make the sum of all the 'deemed' payments equivalent to (not equal to) the 1984 award 'deemed' made in 1982. This required the Actuary to employ present value principles and the problem gets sticky. That just illustrates the complications which are faced by people. I assume that that sort of scenario is something that is being addressed in part by this legislation. But all of this deeming that we went through and all the problems that it created, all the unintended consequences, really make life difficult for veterans and their spouses. I make that point because I feel strongly that their lives ought to be uncomplicated, particularly those of the older veterans. By and large, younger veterans are still able to take care of themselves, but many of the older veterans cannot. They come to see me. They sit in front of me-and some of them are in their 80s-and they tell me how they are being harassed, or how they have concerns. Some of those concerns are rational, some perhaps are not so rational. However, my heart goes out to them every time. It is easy for me to say, 'The government or the department or whatever should leave you alone to get on with your life.' Their life expectancy is not very long when we are talking about veterans of the Second World War or even the Korean war. They are getting old. They ought not be harassed. They ought not have their lives made difficult. Sometimes a cost is involved in making those decisions. I do not want to get into an argument about whether the mechanisms are reasonable or not. The point is, once veterans have reached a certain age, it is unrealistic and unreasonable to fight them to the nth degree and to complicate their lives. I assume that that will be the result of this. The existing situation that I have just outlined is complicated enough. It will continue to be so, and yet I do not believe it should be. The government spends heaps of money on all sorts of things. Every day in the parliament we hear members of the government talking about a million dollars for this and a few million dollars for that. gets up to answer a question, millions of dollars are mentioned-$2 million for this, $1 million or whatever. However, when it comes to a poor veteran fighting over next to nothing, it seems to be the biggest deal of all time. The government goes to all sorts of lengths to make sure everything is deemed. It makes lots of calculations to make sure that the veteran does not get one cent more than he is entitled to. I just throw my hands up in the air, and in the end I come down on the side of, in particular, the older veterans. At some point in time they should be given everything they are entitled to-using that term fairly loosely. We should be saving money in the areas of government waste, extravagance and vote buying exercises. We see them every day of the week in the parliament, and yet the government wants to be hard on veterans. It does not make sense. The point was raised about expenses incurred by applicants to the VRB. Although the cost of medical evidence is reimbursed, under the provisions of the VEA and at the AAT those costs can be met through legal aid grants. I am sure the minister is aware-and I do not know",150,Representatives Main Committee

400,Mr Bradford,"That is a new one. Money seems to come easy. Every time a ministerThursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2577 what his reaction to this will be-that there are many ex-service advocates who do a wonderful job for veterans. I assume that most of the time they are not paid, and apparently the same facility is not available to them if they are advocating for someone to have medical costs reimbursed in the same way as they are through legal aid. I suppose there is a technical problem there. Legal aid can be quantified more easily, but there would be no cost to the government in looking at that sort of facility. In fact, there would be savings in legal aid where these people are being represented by ex-service advocates. I had discussions with a number of veterans' organisations about most of these issues, as I said at the outset. I am sure the shadow minister has said it quite properly, and we support his statements. I reiterate my support for the amendment and hope that it will be accepted by the government. the honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). When it comes to the question of veterans, in a bipartisan way, we are always prepared to acknowledge that they are a special group of people and, as such, they should be treated specially. Everything we have done-and certainly everything that I have done since I have been the minister-has been with that overall thought in mind. I take the point of the shadow minister, the honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey), when he says that we did not give him enough time. I think that was as a result of our ignorance of the procedures in this particular place. This is my first time in the Main Committee and I did not really know how it worked. I understood that the whips got together and, if they worked out there was no controversy involved, the legislation came here. I presumed that appropriate notice would be given. At the end of the day, there are specific measures in this bill-for instance, the compensation measure, which was mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for McPherson( Mr Bradford)-that are not retrospective; the bill comes into effect from 1 January 1995. The other chamber needs to have these measures before it in order to consider them by a certain time. This lack of time was more to do with those procedures than with any intention on my part not to give my friend the chance to have a look at it. I certainly say to the honourable member for O'Connor that, if there is a way of giving him more time with the legislation, I would be more than happy to do that. In future, we will try to give him extra time. It was not an intended constraint. This bill is part of a package of measures that we announced in the budget. This did not go through in the first budget measures bill simply because we were not able to get everything up and ready in time. These provisions are mostly beneficial provisions and they were part of a package which was absolutely and exhaustively gone through with the ex-service communities. The honourable member for O'Connor also talked about the automatic payment of the funeral benefits. At the moment, the class of person covered has to apply for that funeral benefit. Such people will no longer have to apply; we will pay it automatically. There are administrative procedures in place. For instance, the ex-service community always looks at the death notices and these sorts of things. The ex-service community is very good when it comes to this. In most cases, particularly if people are receiving an extreme disabled adjustment and if they are in the other class as well, the ex-prisoner of war class, everyone knows who they are and someone is on to us very quickly. In the event that we miss one,",152,Representatives Main Commfitee
401,Mr Sciacca (Bowman,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (11.05 a.m.)-in reply-I thank2578 MAIN COMMI'ITEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 people are chased until we are finally notified. I take the point that the honourable member makes and I understand what he is saying. With respect to appeals, I am concerned that there are too many appeals which, at the end, are granted anyway. One of the major reasons that we brought this in as part of the package of measures was to make sure that we get people to bring their medical evidence not only at Veterans Review Board level but also at the primary level. The way it works now is that those who go to the primary level usually do not think they have got a chance anyway so they tum up without appropriate information. They then go to the Veterans Review Board and do the same thing because, if they win, they get something for their medical reports-and we all know medical reports can be very expensive. If they lose, they get nothing. Normally, they keep the powder dry, so to speak, until they go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where a veteran can get automatic legal aid for these matters. They wait for that. What happens? My colleagues the lawyers make plenty of money out of it. Frankly, I would prefer to spend that money that my department is spending at the AAT on the veterans themselves rather than on lawyers, and I say that as a lawyer myself. We now say that, whenever veterans go to the Veterans Review Board, we will give them up to $425 for each medical report on a separate condition. I believe that will mean that the advocates will come forward with that report. Hopefully, if it is going to be accepted, it is accepted there and then. It cuts out delays; it cuts out costs. Probably delay is the major thing. At the end of the day, if a veteran wins, he or she wins and gets paid from the date of making the application. I want to say a few things about the Specialist Medical Review Council and the amendment that has been proposed by the honourable member for O'Connor. As far as today is concerned, I am ruling it out; I am not prepared to accept it and I will tell him why. I have very good reasons for that. The point is that the Specialist Medical Review Council will not be hearing individual cases. I do not expect that there will be that many appeals to the Specialist Medical Review Council. When I discussed this quite cooperatively with the shadow spokesman I took into consideration the fact that this would not happen often. Nevertheless, I was happy to acknowledge that that could be the case, that there would be certain times when there would be medical conditions when the Repatriation Medical Authority would say, 'No, we are not prepared to put it into a statement of principle'. Therefore, we would give the opportunity to an individual or an ex-service organisation to go to the Specialist Medical Review Council. But that basically is a medical thing. The council is not going to handle individual cases; it is looking at causations, it is looking at medical principlesthey would have to get will be different from what this sort of payment is being introduced for. The rationale behind this payment is to make sure that we cut down delays to veterans, to make sure that they come with all the appropriate information to the Veterans Review Board so that we can cut down delays and cut down costs. I would envisage that for those who do appeal to the Specialist Medical Review Counciland I would expect that that would be a very limited number of cases-it would be more of a doctor and doctor sort of thing. For instance, an ex-service organisation might take up the case on behalf of a veteran. I would see that that would be the way it would work. Someone",153,Representatives Main Committee
402,Mr Tuckey,They have to get medical advice though.,154,Representatives Main Committee
403,Mr Sciacca,"Yes, they have to get medical advice but the sort of medical advice thatThursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2579 would take up the case because it is really a class of people that is appealing against a particular medical principle. I would expect that that sort of case would be such that paying $425 for a medical report would neither be here nor there in the sense that it really would not be of any great assistance. This $425 is specifically meant to help the individual veteran who has to be able to prove that he has a case, that he has a particular disease. It will not really matter as long as the statement of principle says, for instance, that smoking causes lung cancer. All that individual has to prove is that, firstly, he has got lung cancer and, secondly, that he has smoked. He has got to get a doctor to say that in his opinion he has got lung cancer because he smoked. It is not that the doctor's report wiIl be in terms of a statement of principle referring it back to that; it is connecting the disease or the injury to the particular principle. I understand the good intentions of the honourable member for O'Connor in suggesting this but I just do not believe that it is anything that is going to be of any real benefit and perhaps we might leave this to the Senate later on to discuss. I certainly will not accept it now, not because I am against the principle of it but because I just do not think it is necessary. I want to make another point which I think is very important. The honourable member for O'Connor mentioned that we should thank members of the opposition because of the fact that they asked us to agree to a Specialist Medical Review Council in the event that there were statements of principles that come out of the Medical Review Authority which we did not agree on. I think, if I remember correctly, that he put out a press release shortly after I made the announcement on the Agent Orange extension range of cancers. I thought about it. I was tempted to whip one out and say, 'Wrong, Mr Tuckey', but I said, 'No'. I considered that the honourable member for O'Connor and I have been getting on well when it comes to cooperating on these bills and so I decided that I do not particularly want to stick it into him. But I want to tell him now, given that he mentioned it-I was not going to mention it-that one of the major reasons why I baulked originally about the setting up of the Specialist Medical Review Council was that there already is in the act-it was part of my bill-a section that there would always be that residual power of the Repatriation Commission to overrule any statement of principle of the Repatriation Medical Authority provided that that overruling procedure would be in favour of the veteran. In this case, the Repatriation Commission has referred to the Repatriation Medical Authority, for the compiling of statement of principles, these extensions of the five new cancers that we are now going to accept as a result of the reports from Professors MacLennan and Smith. In the event, that the Repatriation Medical Authority says, 'No, we do not agree'-and I think that is quite unlikely but it is a possibility-we do not have to wait. I have already made the commitment on behalf of the government that we are going to do this quickly. There is no way in the world that we are going to wait until someone arranges to appeal this to the Specialist Medical Review Council. It will go straight back to the Repatriation Commission. It was the one that had accepted that extension and referred it to the RMA. It has the power immediately to say, 'In this case, because it is such an important groundbreaking issue, as far as we are concerned it is in favour of the veteran. We have the power to do that.' I think it is in section 108A of the act-or certainly of the last bill that I brought in which set up the Repatriation Medical Authority. The point I am making to my honourable friend is that it is already there. I hope he has more regard for my ability than to think I was going to get up and make a public statement 2580 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 knowing full well that there was some chance that I was going to get knocked back by the Repatriation Medical Authority. I can assure him that that will not be the case. I did not want to make an issue of it. I thought it was a bit complicated. I said, 'We are getting on well with these matters' and I said, 'I do not think we will do that'. I appreciate that we are at one when it comes to looking after the general interests of the veterans. It is my belief that I should do the best I can. It is his belief that he should be the advocate. I accept that. I think that is the proper role when dealing with a portfolio like this. There is no politics in veterans affairs. They deserve, I think, a bit better than that. The honourable member mentioned a particular PTSD case. I thank him for referring that case to me. I have the details in my pocket and I will certainly take it up. I appreciate his doing that. That is an area which I am very interested in. It is an area in which we are spending a lot of money. Only recently, I officially opened a PTSD specialist centre at Heidelberg Hospital under the directorship of Professor Philip Morris. We are getting treatment protocols from the United States and other places. We are getting as much information as we can. PTSD is real. It is something which cannot be cured. It can only be treated. What we are trying to do is organise treatment protocols. We are going to diffuse those throughout the states through the St John of God Hospital in New South Wales and through our veterans advice networks and Vietnam veterans counselling services. The honourable member for O'Connor mentioned how Vietnam veterans in particular have this problem and end up with all sorts of social problems as a result. That is something which we are not only going to look at, but do something about. It took a long time for the Australian public to realise the specific problems suffered by people involved in that conflict. I did a television interview yesterday in which it was suggested to me that perhaps the government was being generous in extending the benefits in terms of Agent Orange to five new sets of cancers. This particular interviewer suggested that in real terms there is no conclusive link between exposure to herbicides and certain cancers. I said to him, 'Look, the report that I received from Professors MacLennan and Smith said that in their opinion there was, but that in any event the government should give them the benefit of the doubt. In the context of the generous nature of the repatriation system in this country' -and it is one of the best in the world, and there are a lot of people trying to get on board from allied countries who cannot-Owe have given them the benefit of the doubt.' I continued, 'If you think about it, we sent 50,000 people over to that conflict. When they returned, the majority of the people over here were against the war' -and I was one of them, and I have said as much publicly-'and they were brought back in the middle of the night. They were asked to take off their uniforms and to go out through the crowds in pairs, dressed in civvies, so that they were not regardedveterans. It probably did not happen to you, and I accept that but I did say 'in some cases'. That sort of thing is something which would have taken them a long time to forget. I told the interviewer that if at the end of the day we could do something to ease their minds and let them know that we were thinking of them, so be it; I was prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt. I do not think honourable members would disagree with that action that we took.",154,Representatives Main Committee
404,Mr Bradford,I don't think that that's true.,156,Representatives Main Committee
405,Mr Sciacca,"In some cases, evidently, it was true. I have been told this by VietnamThursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITfEE 2581 The honourable member for McPherson mentioned the hassles that older veterans have, and I accept that. There are some rules that have to be abided by but I am looking at seeing whether there is a way to restructure the department to have a greater customer focus so that we can look at those points. I also assure the honourable member for McPherson that there is certainly no thought by this government of getting rid of, or in any way dissolving, the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is quite the contrary. In fact, everything we are doing is the other way around. We are taking away from Social Security the war widow income supplement; DVA is going to pay it as of and from 30 March next year. The single rate of pension to service pension widows will now come over to our department whereas, in the past, if they stayed with our department they got only half the married rate. All these sorts of things are being looked at. The other day I set up a task force with the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to look at the aged care needs of veterans. That certainly is not indicative of wanting to get rid of Veterans' Affairs or a diminishing of veterans' entitlements. I appreciate the points that have been put forward, and I accept them in the spirit in which they were intended. Whenever there are good suggestions from the opposition or from anyone I will always take them up. I commend the bill to the House. I will keep an open mind in terms of the Senate, but I am inclined to say at this stage that there is no necessity for the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for O'Connor and that I am not prepared to accept it.

I remind the Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Sciacca) that we always understood that this was a matter of notice in this chamber rather than one of lengthy debate and one of division. We expected that it should be on notice here so that it could be further considered in the Senate. Accepting the point he makes that there is a difference, it probably only highlights the fact that $425 is not enough. As to whether the resources of the RSL should be diminished by taking a proper action before the Specialist Medical Review Council, having had the submission that veterans need some financial assistance to prepare medical evidence for the VRB, I support the rationale the minister has proposed. The simple fact is that, whilst I accept it could be a class action, it could be all sorts of other things. The actual decision will be totally built around medical evidence. I assume that the applicant will be arguing either that the RMA has excluded a particular causal condition that should have been included in the statements of principles, or that one of them is wrong. In those circumstances, substantial medical evidence has got to be brought together and collected, and that is going to cost. It might be that an individual is the applicant, and, in that case, is not defined as a group. It could be an individual veteran, notwithstanding the broader outcome, or else it could be an organisation or a group of veterans. In each case, having accepted the principle that there is reason to assist people with the costs associated with gaining medical evidence, and having accepted that, as in the VRB, there are no legal costs before the Specialist Medical Review Council-we agreed on that and made sure that people did not have that worry, since this is all about medical evidence-there is a very good case to give them some money. By the time the bill gets to the Senate, the minister may have considered just how much money that might be, in terms of an individual case. I agree with the minister entirely, but I do not think there will be many cases. Therefore, whilst we might be generous in terms of a particular application, we would not be imposing any great cost on the taxpayer. I point out that the minister's estimate of $425 associated with appeals to the VRB is expected to cost $40,000. I would not be surprised if, over time, the average cost for our proposal were half that. It is not a lot of money for government but for individuals trying to get before the Specialist Medical Review Council it could be a fortune-and a fortune they may not have. As I said, it might be a sub-branch of the RSL that feels very strongly on behalf of a member in this regard and, as we would know, RSLs generally do not have any substantial resources. However, we are certainly not going to the barricades in this place on this particular matter. We are not surprised that, with the short notice, the minister wants to think about it, but it is a gesture that is needed and one that reflects the government's intention in the other area of the VRB. With that, I ask that we proceed with these matters on the understanding that they can be further debated in the Senate. honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) says. I certainly will take it on board. I have no wish to in any way cause possible financial problems to RSLs or anyone else. Quite the contrary. That is the reason I am bringing in the question of the $425 now.

407,Mr Sciacca (Bowman,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (11.28 a.m.)-I accept what the2584 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 attached to RSLs or ex-service organisations. The honourable member is correct. We only received notice of his amendment this morning, and that is obviously because he only received the other material yesterday. I will look at it, but I am not prepared to accept it today. I have to give it some more serious thought. We may be able to come to some arrangement. I do not know. For the number of appeals that will go forward, we are talking really small beans. I accept that. At the end of the day, it was not meant for that sort of appeal, if you like. It was meant to hasten things through the VRB and make sure that veterans got their case together earlier and got their money earlier. In any event, I cannot accept the amendment today, but I am prepared to talk to the honourable member about it. Amendment negatived. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill agreed to without amendment. the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Consideration resumed from 13 October. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. This small portfolio bill contains three amendments to Veterans' Affairs benefits. Its major purpose is to increase the age at which female veterans can qualify for age service pension. The bill also contains two other minor measures-an increase in the maximum rate of the dependent child add-on which is payable to service pensioners for children under the age of 16 years, and the reintroduction of advance pharmaceutical allowance. The decision to increase the qualifying age for women receiving age pension from the Department of Social Security and age service pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs was part of the government's 1993 Budget. Legislation giving effect to this proposal for Social Security age pensions has already been passed. The increase in the qualifying age will be slowly phased in with the first adjustment occurring on 1 July 1995. This bill proposes that from 1 July 1995 the qualifying age for age service pension for female veterans will be 55 1h years. Thereafter, the qualifying age will increase by six months every two years. It will not be until the year 2014 that the age service pension age for women will be 60 years. The qualifying age for women will then be the same as the existing qualifying age for men. The second initiative is also part of the 1993 Budget. The maximum rate of additional family payment paid by Social Security was increased by $1 per week for each child under 16 years of age. This decision was part of a package to assist low income earners and unemployed persons to offset increases in the wholesale tax announced in that year.",159,Representatives Main Committee

409,Mr Sciacca (Bowman,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (11.30 a.m.)-I move:Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMfITEE 2585 Child related payments paid to service pensioners are matched to the rate of Social Security additional family payment. This measure will ensure that the rates continue to be matched by providing that a similar increase will apply to service pensioners with dependent children. The final initiative relates to the reinstatement of the payment of advance pharmaceutical allowance. Advance pharmaceutical allowance was paid to chronically ill pensioners with a high volume of prescription drug use. The advance payment was made from 1991 to 1993. Payments ceased from 1 January 1994 as a result of the operation of a sunset clause. A proposal was included in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993 to extend the sunset clause for a further year. This bill failed to become operative due to the Senate's refusal to pass the bill in its original form. The disagreement of the Senate was not related to advance pharmaceutical allowance. The initiative in the current bill is to re-introduce advance pharmaceutical allowance payments from 1 January 1995 without the inclusion of a sunset clause. This will ensure that the availability of the advance will be an ongoing benefit to veterans and their dependants. I commend the bill to the House. of the measures outlined in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), and I will not repeat my remarks about the time we had to consider them, we will naturally reserve our position in the Senate later on. They are very specific measures for which I do not anticipate any opposition. Nevertheless, having said that and having been very moderate in my earlier remarks, I have to point out to the chamber some of the politics associated with these particular measures because they do the government no credit. The bill could almost be called the bill of broken promises. In particular, I want to talk about the government's hypocrisy in bringing again to the parliament its arrangements to increase the retirement age at which women become eligible for, in this case, the service pension. I note that the government has maintained the differential between service pensioners and normal public pensioners of five years. I endorse that, naturally, but we have to look at the history of this matter. It stems from the 1993 Budget when the House was informed that women generally live longer than men and that their participation in the labour force and level of wages could be expected to further increase. We were told that raising the pension age would reduce the likelihood of women being forced to retire at 60 as there would no longer be an expectation that women could claim the age pension at this age. That is, of course, something that we did not oppose because, in the context of everything we did at the last election, we put it on the table. We let the voters know what our position was. They rejected us on some of those matters and this, no doubt, was one of them, particularly when we look at what the government had to say about our position prior to the last election. This is the sort of thing that was said, in this case by the then Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett: The lower pension age for women is due recognition of the fact that many older women devoted most of their lives to their families and sacrificed employment, savings and superannuation in the process. When women of pension age have had similar opportunities to their male counterparts, that will be the time to equalise pension ages, not before. That was the government's position before the election. I have just read what it said in the first budget after the election. But it is worse than that because Dr Blewett went on with the",160,Representatives Main Committee

What did he say? Dr Blewett described the coalition's policies as 'premature, ill considered, extremely harsh and unfair'. I know he has gone, but how can we be dealing with this matter? It was brought in by this government, not ours? We stated our position; we are clear. That is why we are not opposing the bill; we are not going to be hypocrites. But it is time that it was drawn to the attention of those opposite how they played that election and how they played the people-not us. It is nice to say, 'We beat you again.' It is not a cricket match; it is not a footy match. It is a case of the people who got dealt to and the people were very put out about it. opinion polls say that people think the government was honest in the last election? No, they do not. When Jim Short, the then opposition finance spokesman, claimed that the government had a similar policy, Dr Blewett denied this emphatically. He went on to claim that this policy-our policy, the policy that the government is implementing here today-would see women in their 40s and 50s having to alter their retirement plans drastically. For many, it would mean a substantial loss of income and late age entry into the unemployment queues. If that was the case then, those opposite should tell us what is different today. The government has had some embarrassment about this and its solution was to form a caucus committee. I would not be at all surprised if the member for Bass( Mrs Silvia Smith) is a member of it. It was set up to investigate the possibility of reversing this decision. That was the first one, when the government brought in its social security measures. If that caucus committee wants a message from government, from the executive, it has it today. But what hypocrisy to be running a caucus committee that is supposed to be considering the reversal of the original piece of legislation when, here today, we have a piece of legislation that extends that age determination to people in receipt of veterans pensions. I hope that the member for Bass does not get up and say how she is still fighting for these people, because, obviously, she is not. If she had a personal commitment, she has been rolled. The simple fact is that we do not want any of that hypocrisy, and this is an exercise in hypocrisy. The honourable member can say, 'Go look at the polls,' but it does not change the simple fact that I stand here as a representative of the people you are affecting too. Those opposite sold them a bill of goods. We did not, and we are not going to reverse our position and be hypocrites in taking the political opportunities that would arise from going out and kicking hell out of members of the government on this issue, as they kicked hell out of us on that occasion. The difference is that we can both sleep at night but for different reasons. The government has no sense, no feeling. It is an outrageous situation that a government could go to the people, as it did, on this and other issues and, in fact, reverse its position immediately. The third item in this particular area increases the maximum rate of additional family payment by $1 a week. Why did the government do that? Because it broke another promise: the no tax promise; the I-a-w promise. The government dumped a substantial amount of cost of living increases on the community. It realised it put certain lower income groups in such poverty that it had to do something about it. The government increased the additional family payment by $1 to try to compensate at least some of the community. The government then",161,Representatives Main Committee

Do theThursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2587 dumped 5c a litre petrol increase on this group of people as most of them were still driving cars using leaded fuel. We do not oppose what the government is doing. Both of those issues that have been addressed today are compensation for a broken promise. This was a promise that many Australians did not receive and many Australians just had to pay the money. One of these compensations may appear generous-it is a gift. If everybody was compensated, the budget would have to be balanced and the money so desperately needed before the election would not be there. That is another part of this outrageous situation. Historically, oppositions have come to power and broken promises simply because they could claim-and do so honestly from either side of politics-that they did not know the full state of affairs; they had not seen the government's accounts. When you are in government, all the figures are there. It is totally dishonest to say, 'We have had to impose all these taxes. We have had to break all these promises because we did not know the gun was loaded.' Of course the government knew the gun was loaded. More importantly, on the issue of extending the age for the eligibility of the aged pension for women, the government blatantly attacked our proposition. It clearly indicated to the people of Australia that the government did not intend doing what is being done here today. It brings the government no credit. I do not give a dash how the government's circumstances stand in the opinion polls. It does not change the fact that the people of Australia were misled on this particular issue by the government's side of politics. It is no good. In the House the other day, I pointed out how frequently we have supported the government on the basis of our philosophy and how we allowed it to achieve economic reform. I pointed out how easy it might have been for us to have prevented the sale of portions of the Commonwealth Bank. It was an icon. The government knows very well how it would have dealt with the matter-it would have found its instructions in its little black book-if we had been in government and had announced an intention to sell part of the Commonwealth Bank. The government can give us a lesson in politics, if it likes. For goodness sake! It is all a matter of hypocrisy. We are supporting the government todaya bet on it-if you want me to give you a linkage. On all of these issues, we could have stopped the government from doing things but, if we had stopped the government, it would not have been good for Australia. So we did not. It is not a bad lesson to learn from time to time. There can often be a sound reason to change the pension age, but the government played politics with it until it was re-elected. Today, we find ourselves passing legislation which the government said would not happen under its administration. As I said, it becomes high farce when a caucus committee is formed to reverse it and when, having formed the committee, and while it is still in existence, the government runs around and passes additional legislation to achieve the same result. opportunity from time to time to remind a lot of female veterans about what happened and how they were misled at the time.

We understand what happened there. It is possibly a good question as to why it has taken this long to get it reinstated, considering it all fell over on 1 January 1994, but it is being done, on this occasion without a sunset clause. So we will not confront this problem again and we do not object to that-we welcome it. They are the only issues covered in this particular legislation. The minister has clearly enunciated how we will move from the present age eligibility to the new arrangement by increasing the age threshold by six months every two years, and that also is quite acceptable. We do not have any opposition to this legislation, but we put on the record that it does represent a substantial misleading of the Australian people at the last election. It brings no credit to any government that on such a fundamental issue where such clear, precise statements were made about the position, it was the next best thing to another 'l-a-w, law' statement, and it was a misleading of the people. That brings no credit to anyone. We have no other remarks to make on this legislation and we do not oppose it. O'Connor( Mr Tuckey). I was listening to him earlier today as well. I thought we had a bipartisan approach in this Main Committee where non-controversial legislation has the support of both sides of the parliament. The member for O'Connor can always make something that is non-controversial into something quite controversial. I am sure the other speakers on this side will respond in a lot more detail than I have the time to do this morning. The member for O'Connor did make particular reference to the qualifying age changes that are proposed, which brings this legislation in line with the social security legislation. The minister also mentioned that in his second reading speech. I wish to raise the matter of the advanced pharmaceutical allowance. That is a very important issue amongst the veteran community. I consider the bill's proposal to address the problem we have with the pharmaceutical allowance as a major amendment. This legislation actually allows for the re-introduction of the advanced pharmaceutical allowance which was previously cut off due to a sunset clause in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No.2). I am really pleased that this is being addressed here today. This bill provides for the reintroduction of that allowance starting from 1 January next year. No doubt that will be a very welcome new year present to our veteran community. All of us, as members, are in constant contact with our veteran community. Given the advanced age of many of our veterans, this initiative is a very worthy one and deserves the support of all members of this place. The advance pharmaceutical allowance was originally made available to chronically ill pensioners with a high volume of prescription drug use. When the date in the sunset clause was reached before amending legislation was dealt with by the parliament the allowance was cancelled, and that has been a concern. This bill will now not only reintroduce the advanced allowance for this category of pensioners, but also ensure that the scheme is not subject to any other sunset clauses. That is a real plus and a good initiative for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Sciacca) to take. I am particularly happy to support this aspect of the bill.

We have stopped the clock so you are not being counted out. Sitting suspended from 11.49 to 11.50 a.m. It is quite interesting. The honourable member for O'Connor just walked out on me! That was a major impact. I was supporting the legislation, though not in the same terms as he was. I am pleased to support it. I was just making reference to return of the advance pharmaceutical allowance through this bill, which I really welcome. I am particularly happy to support this aspect of the bill, as I have many veterans in my community who have raised this issue with me. Many of those veterans, whom I am pleased to call my friends, support the initiatives that this government has introduced on behalf of the veterans community. The age of many of our veterans places them in the category of those who will be more susceptible to chronic illness. They deserve all the help that we can give them and this government has responded to their need. Also, their chronic illness may have some connection to their wartime experience. I, like other members of the government, have a moral obligation to help those veterans with their pharmaceutical costs. I am very pleased that this is happening here. Indeed, this bill is another innovative plank in the government's reforms on behalf of veterans. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Sciacca) is to be congratulated for his ongoing commitment to our veterans, as are previous veterans' affairs ministers. I make particular reference to Senator Faulkner and the member for Griffith( Mr Humphreys), who, in this government, certainly had that long-term commitment. In this context, I mention someone in my electorate whom the minister at the table has actually met before, a gentlemen called Bill Langford, a veteran from the Second World War. Bill was in the Middle East during the war and he is a tremendous fellow. I mentioned earlier, when speaking on another bill, that the minister visited the Goodwin RSL Club; it was the first RSL club that he visited after becoming the minister. Bill came in from Laidley, which is in the western part of my electorate, to share the day with us and managed to get his photo in the paper with the minister. Bill was certainly very pleased to participate in that event. Bill is one of those to benefit from the government's changes in regard to hospital treatment, because it means that now he can get a bus or train from Laidley into Ipswich, which is a 45minute trip, and be treated at a private hospital in Ipswich, instead of having to go to Greenslopes in Brisbane. This is a great help to his wife, Margaret, who does not drive a car; she would have to travel for three hours to see him at Greenslopes Hospital. But now she can come into Ipswich, which is just down the road from my electoral office. When she visits Ipswich, she drops into my office, at my invitation, to have a cup of tea at my office. They are lovely people. Their situation is an example of how we have helped our veterans in that area. I do not want wish to speak for too long, because we want to get this bill through, and others as well. I just want to indicate my support for that particular aspect of this bill, and for the advance pharmaceutical allowance. I commend the bill to the House.",164,Representatives Main Commiitee

419,Mr Les Scott,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is certainly a learning experience.2590 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 Affairs' Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) of 1994. This bill will bring the veterans pensions into line with the aged pension by increasing the qualifying age at which women can apply for the aged service pension from 55 to 65 years, over a lO-year period. The bill will also reintroduce the advance pharmaceutical allowance from January next year. This is a measure that is welcome. Thirdly, the bill will increase the maximum rate of the dependent child add-on by $52 a year for service pensioners with children under 16 years of age. This change to the pension entitlements for women is a reflection of the change that was included in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) of 1994. The reason for this is simple. The original distinction between the pension ages for men and women was based on the fact that, in the past, there was a much lower labour force participation rate for women. I stand here today, as a particularly happy and proud woman, to say that this is one of the areas where women are definitely making inroads. The statistics bear those inroads out. It is because of that increased participation rate in the work force for women that the pension age for women will slowly be increased from the current level of 55 years to 60 years. The first increment will take place on 1 July 1995. The phasing in will be entirely equitable, and will take place over an extended period of time. This method of implementation recognises the remaining labour force disadvantages incurred over the years by the older women affected by these measures. I must stress, however, that the great bulk of female veterans will not be affected by these measures, because they are already older than 63 and in receipt of the service pension. The small number of women who would have qualified at 55, and who now, under this new system, will not, will have access to labour force programs and supporting measures like the jobsearch allowance. We are not leaving them behind at any time. Women veterans who have a permanent incapacity which prevents them from working will continue to have access to the invalid service pension at any age. As I have already stated, these changes will be implemented over a long period of time. Every two years the pension age for women will increase by six months. Increments will occur progressively on this basis until 1 January 2014. At this time, the pensionable age will be 60 years. A woman will attain pensionable age only once. Once a woman attains the age where she can claim a pension, she is eligible for that pension from then on. This is the case even if she does not claim the pension at that particular time. The reason for this is that, under the strictest possible application of the formula for the pension, it is possible for a woman to obtain pensionable age and then lose it. This bill makes sure that once pensionable age is attained it is maintained. The second major provision of this bill is the reintroduction of provisions for the payment of the advance pharmaceutical allowance, which will take effect from 1 January 1995. From1 November 1990, provision was made for chronically ill pensioners who constantly used a high volume of drugs to have access to the advance pharmaceutical allowance. This was initially introduced for a period of one year, and was later extended for a further two years. These provisions were later removed. The bill we have before us today will reintroduce access to that facility. With the passage of this bill, from 1 January 1995 the advance pharmaceutical allowance will again be paid. As well as the fact that this facility will be reintroduced, it will also no longer be subject to sunset provisions. The ability to gain payment of the advance pharmaceutical allowance is back, and it is here to stay.",165,Representatives Main Commitiee
420,Mrs Silvia Smith (Bass) (11.56 A.m.),"I rise here today to speak on the VeteransThursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 2591 The third major provision of this bill is to increase the level of dependent child add-on for service pensioners with children who have not yet turned 16. This rate will be increased by $52 per year. This measure essentially stems from the 1993 budget process. The decision was taken at that time that, from 1 January 1995, the highest rate of additional family payment should be raised by $1 per week for every child under 16. The basis for this measure was to help low income earners and the unemployed to offset the 1993 budget increase in the wholesale tax. This bill proposes that $52 per year be added to the under-13 and the over-13 but under-16 add-on rates for dependent children, and will take effect from 1 January 1995. In reality, this provision really brings service pensioners into line with additional family payments under the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act has already been amended to increase that additional family payment. This bill will pass those changes on to service pensioners with dependent children that come under the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlement Act. This is essentially a small bill, and it represents a very small part of this government's plans and program for Australian veterans. The Australian government has an overall veterans program which is the envy of many governments and many individual veterans throughout the world. Make no mistake: this government looks after its veteran community very, very well. There are some governments which have been involved in some of the same conflicts as Australia but do not even have a federal department of veterans' affairs. We as a nation are also very lucky to have a minister for veterans' affairs who is as dedicated and as enthusiastic as the one we have in the honourable member for Bowman( Mr Sciacca). His 'Australia Remembers' program is excellent, and has generated a huge amount of interest nationally, and especially within my own electorate of Bass. In fact, the minister was very recently in my electorate to promote his veterans program. We conducted an afternoon tea at the Launceston RSL, and it was attended by some 110 members of the local veterans community. It was a fantastic function. pretty improper! veterans on a one-to-one basis. There is no mistaking the fact that our current minister for veterans' affairs is a grassroots minister and that the programs which he promotes are grassroots programs which the veterans actually want. The minister received a wonderful reception at the Launceston RSL, and many in the veteran community whom I know personally and have constant dealings with are already asking me when he is coming back to northern Tasmania. It cannot be too soon, as far as I am concerned. We have a very strong veteran community in northern Tasmania. This is a community which is close-knit and supportive of its own. I cannot sing too highly the praises of those veterans who devote almost all of their time to the service of their mates. One such individual I would like to mention-and the minister himself has met with this gentleman, and I am sure will reiterate what I am about to say-is a man called Bob Fitz. He is not only a man to respect and admire for his tireless service to the veteran community of northern Tasmania, but also a man whom I am pleased and proud to be able to call a very close friend. Bob Fitz is constantly helping veterans, in the formal sense. He helps them with applications, and he appears as an advocate for them before panels of review; but that is not where it stops: Bob is also a counsellor to his mates.

422,Mrs Silvia Smith,"Wrong! The minister and I spent a couple of hours talking to the2592 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 Tasmania has veterans who are on the edge. For some veterans, the pressure is still too great: the memories are still too real, and the horror is still too close. The people in this place should never forget that fact, and they should never forget the sacrifice that these people have made and are still making. Bob Fitz helps these veterans. He talks with them at all hours of the day or night. He visits them. He has a drink with them, and he supports them. These people turn to Bob Fitz when they will not turn to anyone else, and they do so because he is one of them. He has been through what they have been through. He has experienced what they have experienced, and he has dealt with it. There are very few professional counsellors with that sort of experience, and I will bet there are very few who are as effective. The work of people such as Bob Fitz is one way in which the veteran community of northern Tasmania is served. A former Deputy Prime Minister, Lance Barnard, also serves the veteran community. I am in the particularly lucky position of having Lance Barnard still serving the communityespecially the veteran community-through my office. For those members and others here today who do not know Lance Barnard, he held the seat of Bass for 21 years and became Deputy Prime Minister under Gough Whitlam in 1972. He was Minister for Defence from 1972 to 1975, when he retired. It is because of that position, and the fact that he is a World War II veteran and has held the position of Director of the Office of Australian War Graves, that Lance Barnard has such a great interest in the veteran community of northern Tasmania. Gough Whitlam once described Lance as one of the bravest men he knew. This was because Lance had fought at El Alamein, and had, as Minister for Defence, actually flown the F111-a brave thing to do, I am thinking! Lance Barnard works out of my office. He gives his time freely and he works as tirelessly now as when he was still the member for Bass. I might add that Lance Barnard turned 75 on May1 this year. He has never retired. affairs caseload that comes through my office, and he gets results. I have to say that I find it quite amusing that officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs tend to snap to their task pretty quickly when they find that a query is from Lance Barnard. He is tireless in his work in this area. He is constantly helping veterans make applications and he is constantly appearing before various review boards on their behalf. Most of the veterans community of northern Tasmania would know Lance Barnard and most of them would have been helped by him directly or indirectly at some time. I pay tribute to Lance Barnard. He is indeed a rare individual. I think honourable members would find that most people, after a lengthy career in public life, would like to drop out totaIly or relax at home. Lance Barnard is not like that. The work Lance does now in his retirement shows that he was not like many politicians. He entered politics for the right reason. He genuinely wanted to serve the community. Even in his retirement, Lance Barnard is serving the community. I cannot pay him any greater tribute than to say, 'Thank you, Lance, for that commitment.' He is someone that I genuinely aspire to be like as a politician and as a person. I have spoken today of two individuals who have worked tirelessly for the veterans community of northern Tasmania. These people are an example of how importantly the veterans community is regarded by the general community. The bill which we debate today is just a small part of that commitment of this government. We should never forget the role",167,Representatives Main Committee

424,Mrs Silvia Smith,"Thank you. Lance Barnard takes the vast percentage of the veterans'Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 2593 that veterans have played for this nation and the international esteem which they brought to this country. We should never forget the veterans. I commend the bill to the House. Ms DEAHM (Macquarie) (12.08 p.m.)-It is always a privilege to speak on a veterans' affairs bill. I think I have spoken on most of them since I have been in this place because, as the honourable member for Bass( Mrs Silvia Smith) has already said, veterans are very important people in our life. I think, when we talk about veterans' affairs, that we need to take an historical perspective on Australia's involvement in war. Australia is a small nation and, even before it became a nation, its people were sending troops to war. From the Sudan through to Vietnam we have sent our troops to wars, mostly wars that were not our own. I would make an exception with that part of the Second World War when the Japanese came into the war and our country was definitely under threat. So, for the most part, we have been generous in war. We have given our troops, our services, to other nations. Of course, in the beginning we were part of what was then known as the 'mother country' and we are a part of the Commonwealth. I am sure all honourable members will, if they did not see it in person, certainly have seen replayed many times the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, saying that, as a consequence of Britain being at war, Australia was also at war. In lots of cases we had no choice and we sent our personnel, mostly our men, to those wars. Ninety-four thousand men-mostly men-have died in those wars, starting with the Sudan, the Boxer rebellion and the Boer War. They were wars that are mostly forgotten now except for the two world wars, Korea and Vietnam. We have made an enormous sacrifice, one that is totally out of proportion to our population and to our strategic position in the world. We also need to be aware of the profound effects that war has had, not only on those who took part in those encounters but on their families, and here I speak very much from personal experience. My father was in the navy practically all his working life so, as a child, I was used to his being away. Of course, during the war he was away virtually all the time so I never saw him very much then. I did not really get to know him until I was in my teens, and shortly after that he died. He died at the age of 58 from a heart disease but it was considered to have been due to war service. He was a TPI. So the toll on the families has been enormous and it is something we often forget. There was a TV program recently about women in war and it showed families where the children were scared of their fathers. I have to say that I was one of those. I was to rejoice when my father came home and all I knew was that this man in a uniform came in and within five minutes had me in tears because he was trying to run the family as he thought it ought to be run. It was not his fault, it was not my mother's fault, it was the fault of the fact that he was at war. After the war he spent a considerable time in New Guinea and northern Australia on minesweepers, so once again he was absent. I think that profound effect on the families is something we ought to remember. For that reason the measures that we have brought in for veterans and for their families are very worthwhile, and an organisation like Legacy does a tremendous job in working with those people. Several of the previous speakers have talked about the heroes of war, people from their own electorates. I made a speech in this place some time ago about two particular men I met last ANZAC Day, Dr Jim Thorp and Mr John Robinson. They were both in their 90s and both had served in both world wars. Dr ThorpI alluded to in particular because unfortunately he died shortly after I met him on ANZAC Day. He was 98 or 99 at that stage. He had gone to the First 2594 MAIN COMMIITEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 World War as a medical orderly. During the interim he trained as a doctor and he went back as a medical officer. Those people have made an enormous contribution and they are deserving of everything we can give them. The member for Bass alluded to the kinds of things that Australia does for its veterans compared with other countries. I was very much aware as a child of men coming back from war and receiving an opportunity to study; their fees were paid if they wanted to undertake a course of study. They were given grants of land if they wanted to start a smallholding or a farm and also were given assistance with their house payments to buy a house. When my father died, my mother then took over the war service home loan, which was at a very low rate. I think we have done and we continue to do a lot for our veterans, particularly in the area of health, and also in counselling. That is something that is fairly new. Unfortunately, there are still some people in the ADF who think that counselling is a bit wussy and something that only soft people need. The traumas of war, I think, are something we have overlooked for too long. In the First World War people were shot for deserting, for cowardice, and really they were suffering from what we now know as stress syndrome. Fortunately we have now recognised this with our Vietnam veterans, who had a doubly bad time because not only did they suffer from all those things that they saw and were engaged in but also they suffered to a great extent from rejection by a lot of people in their own community. I have spoken of this before but I am very proud that there is a post-traumatic stress syndrome program at the St John of God Hospital in Richmond in my electorate which is going extremely well. Only last week it received an award from the Private Hospitals Association of New South Wales, and I will be writing to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Sciacca) about that shortly. I hope he will write a letter congratulating the hospital on that success. I was fortunate to go and talk to some of the men who were engaged in its first program and they told me about some of the trauma they were going through in that program just recalling things that had happened to them and feeling as though they wanted to run away and get out of there. However, their comrades-they did not know each other before they went in but they were soon comrades because they had been in the same engagement-helped by saying, 'No, hang in. It is going to be worthwhile.' NowI am getting feedback from those people saying what a benefit it was. One particular case which I cannot resist mentioning, and I have sent a letter to the minister about this, was mentioned in a letter from one of the participants in that program who lives on the north coast of New South Wales. He wrote to the hospital and said that one of his fellow participants had come to see him recently for a cup of coffee. Not very sensational. But it was sensational because that man had driven from Sydney to the north coast and that is the first time he had been out on his own, virtually since he had left Vietnam, except to go to and from hospital. That was a big thing for him to get over that phobia, get in the car and drive and then sit down to talk with a mate. Those programs are definitely worthwhile and they are provided under our veterans' affairs programs. I lived in the UK for some years from the early 1960s and it was not so long since the end of the war that people did not still talk about the situation. Their expression was, 'All they gave us was a cardboard suit and our train fare home.' I think that is probably a rather extreme view of it. Of course, Britain was not in a position to be as generous as Australia was, because we had our own natural wealth on which to call; whereas Britain, of course, was devastated during the war, so her people did not do as well. Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 2595 To come to the thrust of the bill, I need not go over it. It is a small bill, with three main issues. The one I want to talk about is the situation of women. Women played an extremely vital part in war. I am very conscious of this fact because I have in my electorate in the Blue Mountains a very strong ex-service women's group. The minister is to meet them fairly soon and he will have a long schedule there. These women are very active: they keep together and support each other. They come to me when one of their members is having trouble getting into hospital for an operation or is having any problem at all, and I am very glad to help them. Wales. But women did playa very vital part in war and they will continue to do so. I have mixed feelings about this particular issue. The honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) has taken us to task for doing exactly what the opposition had promised to do before the election. We are bringing it in over 20 years. security measures, it is being applied to veterans. As my colleague the honourable member for Bass has said, this will affect very few women who have served in past wars, because most of them are over that age now. I have to say that the age equalisation issue has been a vexed one and, as a matter of principle, as women strive for equality, this is one of the measures that we need to take. Of course, we have to acknowledge that it is going to affect some women, particularly older women and, in the case of the social security pension, the women who are now in their late 50s. For that reason, the Minister for Social Security( Mr Baldwin) has set up a working group, which I coordinate, to look at ways of implementing this measure-which comes in next July-in order to minimise its effect on such women. One of those particular women is in my electorate. She is now 58. She is a very modem woman who believes in equality. She is still working. She was a person who suffered from what we would call the old regimes. She was in the Commonwealth Public Service and, at that time, women had to leave the Service when they got married. We all agree that that was a pretty antiquated law, and it does not apply now. Nevertheless, women who were caught up in that system are now reaching retirement age and they wish to have their pension at the time that they expected they would. After this particular woman got married, she had children and then went back into the work force. Now she is being squeezed out of her job at the age of 58, because her employer thinks it is time she moved over for someone younger.

Like all the other social2596 MAIN COMMI'ITEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), as a woman, I acknowledge that it is a difficult issue and one that we have to handle very carefully. For that reason, I am glad that it is not going to have too much of an effect on the women veterans. However, we are looking in a caring way at the issue for women in civilian life. We are working to minimise the effect on the most affected group of women. The women who will have to work until they are 65 know that. They are in their 40s now. They are mostly women who are in the work force. Many of them have superannuation, so the effect on them will not be so profound. I sincerely hope that women who are now in their 40s and who have to wait until they are 60 will not have to go to war and will not have to apply for a veterans pensionsimply because I hope this country never has to enter those sorts of engagements again. This veterans bill reflects issues in the social security legislation. The bill that was debated earlier was to bring in more measures to help veterans. Like my colleague the honourable member for Bass, I commend the current minister and his predecessor. They have done a fantastic job. Next year will be the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Veterans will be very visible. I think most members will also be very visible and will be out there supporting the veterans who play such an important role in our community. I commend the bill to the House. those who have contributed to the debate, and in particular you, Mr Deputy Speaker, who had a second bite of the cherry this morning. I especially thank our two female colleagues-if we can call them thatMs Deahm-What do you mean, 'call'? given a different perspective to the debate, particularly the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) who talked about her experiences as a young girl when her father returned from war. She mentioned the Australia Remembers program. I am not going to say much about that because if I did I would go on all day and my colleague in the chair would not be happy. However, I want to say that we will not forget the women who stayed at home. We will not forget the people who worked in the factories and on the fanus while the present veterans were overseas. They will all be part of the Australia Remembers program. The opposition spokesman, the honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey), mentioned that he will take particular delight in talking to the female veterans who are going to be affected by this legislation. I interjected and asked, 'Where are you going to meet them-in a phone box?' My point was that in effect there are only a very small number of them. I will put this on the record. The female veterans who are likely to claim service pensions will mainly come from two conflicts. The first one was Korea and Malaya. The Australian involvement in Korea and Malaya finished in 1963. A female veteran would have had to be at least 23 before being sent to the operational area, but it could be expected that she would be older. At the minimum possible age, those women would be 55 years old in 1995. Recent grants of service pension to female veterans are as follows: 1991, four; 1992, two; 1993, two; 1994, one. None of these was born any later than 6 January 1937. That is, the youngest is already 57 years of age. Any further grants are not expected to be affected by the age equalisation provisions. The other place of conflict was Vietnam. Records of participants in that conflict have been examined very closely. The number of female veterans with qualifying service from that",171,Representatives Main Commitiee

436,Mr Sciacca,"You are colleagues. I especially thank them in the sense that they haveThursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2597 conflict totals only 52. Of those, 19 are either pensioners already or have passed away. One lives in New Zealand and could apply for service pension only if she returns to live in Australia. Of the remaining 32 who would be affected by the age equalisation provisions, if they wish to claim a service pension at the minimum age, the number affected and the ages they would need to attain are as follows: three at 55; six at 55.5; three at 56; nine at 56.5; eight at 57; one at 57.5; and two at 58. The point I am trying to make here-and I will not comment on all the extraneous things that the opposition spokesman talked about-is that there are not a lot of people who are going to be affected in the veterans' affairs portfolio. At the end of the day, I feel quite comfortable with the provision and I do not think, as I say, that there will be too many people who will be too worried about it. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Administrator recommending appropriation announced. That the bill be reported to the House without amendment. BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 19 September. Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 will amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SI(S) Act) and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. Those acts formed the centrepiece of a package of superannuation legislation which received royal assent on 30 November 1993 and which gave effect to the new prudential arrangements for superannuation that the Treasurer announced on 21 October 1992. This bill makes a number of amendments, many of a technical nature, to the above mentioned acts aimed at further enhancing and refining the operation of those acts. I tum to the main provisions outlined in these amendments. Allowing certain non-bank financial institutions to otTer 'approved guarantees' The bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow certain non-bank financial institutions to offer guarantees required under the SI(S) Act. Currently, only approved banks and the Commonwealth, states or territories can offer the guarantees required under the SI(S) Act. Building societies, credit unions and similar organisations which are subject to supervision under the various state financial institutions codes are considered to be institutions which should also be able to offer the guarantees required under the SI(S) Act and this bill amends the SI(S) Act accordingly.",172,Representatives Main Committee
437,Motion (By Mr Sciacca),by leave-agreed to:,173,Representatives Main Committee
438,Mr Elliott (Parramatta,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (12.25 p.m.)-I move:2598 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 Allowing 'in-house' investments in certain non-bank financial institutions An 'in-house asset' is essentially a loan to, or investment in, a standard employer sponsor of the fund-or an associate of such an employer sponsor-and the SI(S) Act places restrictions, for prudential reasons, on the level of such investments. The bill amends the SI(S) Act to treat deposits in certain non-bank financial institutionswhich are subject to prudential supervision-in the same manner as deposits in an approved bank with regard to determining if they are 'in-house assets'. Applications for the issue of a superannuation interest and application to become a standard employer-sponsor The bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that the trustee cannot accept a person as a member of a public offer entity unless that person has applied in the appropriate manner and has received relevant information-determined by the Commissioner-regarding the entity before doing so. Acquisition of certain assets from members of regulated superannuation funds The SI(S) Act imposes a general prohibition on the acquisition of assets from members, subject to a limited exception in relation to funds with less than five members-excluded superannuation funds-provided the asset acquired is business real property. The bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that an excluded superannuation fund can only acquire business real property from a member-or relative of a member-if the property is business real property in the member's-or relative's-principal business. This ensures that the right balance is struck between allowing the acquisition of business real property from members of excluded funds and recognising the dangers-from a prudential, retirement incomes and taxation revenue perspective-in such an approach. Public otTer superannuation funds and equal representation The SI(S) Act currently requires a standard employer sponsored fund which is a public offer fund to have an independent trustee. The bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow such funds the option of either having an independent trustee or having equal numbers of employer and member representatives involved in the trusteeship of the fund. This provides funds with greater flexibility in organising their trusteeship while at the same time ensuring that members are protected-in the first instance by having a trustee who is independent and in the second by having direct involvement in the fund via equal representation. Existing trustee may give notice of retirement A fundamental principle of the SI(S) Act is that superannuation entities should be in the control of a single party-the trustees-who take full responsibility for the fund. However, the Corporations Law currently requires that superannuation entities which are public offer entities have dual responsible parties-the trustee and the management company. The SI(S) Act enables these public offer entities to change to have a single party in control of the fund. In many cases this will involve the trustee retiring and the management company taking over the role of trustee. The effective and smooth operation of this changeover may be hampered if the existing trustee is required to hold a meeting of beneficiaries before retiring-as the governing rules of some superannuation entities may require. To overcome this problem, and therefore to Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 2599 ensure a smooth changeover, the bill amends the SI(S) Act to provide that such a requirement in the governing rules of a fund has no effect. Secrecy provisions The bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow the minister to approve disclosure of protected information-if it is in the public interest to do so-to the public at large, rather than just to particular members of the public. At the same time the bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that appropriate protection is provided to an individual by only allowing disclosure of information that relates to the private affairs of an individual where such disclosure would not be unreasonable in the circumstances. Allowing the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to provide protected information to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal The bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow officers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC, to provide protected information to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Protected information is information relating to the affairs of a fund which the ISC has obtained in the course of carrying out its supervisory duties. While the ISC is allowed to provide such information to bodies such as the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Taxation Office there is no allowance to provide such information to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal commenced operation on 1 July 1994 and provides a quick and fair mechanism, which previously did not exist, for dealing with member complaints regarding superannuation. The restriction on the provision of protected information, where that information is directly relevant to a particular complaint, is hampering the effective operation of the complaints tribunal. The amendment allows the ISC to provide such relevant information to the complaints tribunal. Approved purposes of, and payments to beneficiaries in, an approved deposit fund The bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure consistency between related provisions in the act which deal with the purposes for which an approved deposit fund may be maintained and payments to beneficiaries. This clarifies the existing obligations. Disqualified persons not to be custodians The SI(S) Act currently restricts disqualified persons from being trustees or investment managers of superannuation entities. There is however no similar requirement on custodians. The bill amends the SI(S) Act to address this problem and ensure that custodians are subject to similar 'eligibility' requirements to those applying to trustees and investment managers. Removal of trustees of public otTer entities The bill inserts a new requirement into the SI(S) Act to prevent another party from trying to exert undue influence on a trustee by threatening to remove the trustee unless the trustee complies with that party's requests. The amendment ensures that no other party would have the power to exercise such influence by ensuring that, unless the regulations provide otherwise, no person, other than the Commissioner, can remove a trustee of a public offer entity. Allowing exempt public sector superannuation schemes to become subject to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 The bill amends the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, termed the SRC Act, to allow exempt public sector superannuation schemes to become subject to the act. 2600 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 Currently only regulated superannuation funds, and approved deposit funds, are subject to the SRC Act and thus only members of those funds can make use of the superannuation complaints tribunal. Many public sector superannuation schemes will not be regulated funds. Instead they will be exempt public sector superannuation schemes and members of such schemes will not therefore be able to use the complaints tribunal. In some cases this is acceptable as there are other appropriate complaints mechanisms available for members of such schemes. However some schemes believe their members should have and need access to the complaints tribunal. The amendment enables such schemes to become subject to the SRC Act and so have such access to the tribunal. Other provisions More detailed information on the amendments made by this bill and an explanation of those amendments is contained in the explanatory memorandum. The amendments made by this bill have no revenue implications. I commend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 to the House. referring to procedures which have been adopted at the same time as, but not in any way related to, the establishment of this committee. Whereas before the opposition was able to consider a minister's remarks adequately because we had prior notification, the second reading speech having been given at the time the legislation was introduced, we are now in no position to do that and that is an impediment on debate in this place. A consequence in the context of this legislation is that I am, with my prepared remarks, now going to repeat a great deal of what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer ( Mr Elliott) has just had to say, which I would not have had to do under the former arrangements. I think that tends to waste people's time. Not knowing what the parliamentary secretary was going to say in his second reading speech, I naturally set out to put my comments in the context of the legislation. Had the parliamentary secretary not done as he did, it would not have been a matter of great concern. On those two grounds I must say I regret the abandonment of the old procedure because the opposition is not in a position to respond to the second reading speech. Remember that ministers, or parliamentary secretaries, as the case may be, always have the resources of government to help them get their words together and to get their thoughts in some sort of logical sequence, and that is not available to the opposition, in this case the coalition. I think it does have the effect of stifling debate as well as causing me, on this occasion anyway, to indulge in some tedious repetition which probably will be in breach of standing orders, Mr Deputy Speaker. This bill, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, was introduced into the House on 19 September after passing through the Senate on 30 August. It sets out to amend the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993, known as the SI(S) Act, and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, or the SRC Act. The SI(S) Act effectively began operating on 1 July of this year. The principal act provides the legislative framework for the prudent management of certain superannuation funds, particularly the security of members' moneys, and for certain minimum standards. The",173,Representatives Main Committee
439,Mr Rocher (Curtin) (12.34 P.m.),"In the context of this debate I want to open byThursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2601 principal act has already been amended once this year by the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. Amendments to the SI(S) Act and to the SRC Act currently before us are aimed at enhancing the operations of those acts. The coalition does not oppose this bill because the amendments represent primarily housekeeping measures. As the parliamentary secretary has already pointed out, there is no financial impact arising from these measures. The amendment bill before us is largely the result of the willingness of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the ISC, to listen to the concerns and recommendations of the superannuation industry. The performance of the ISC can be largely measured by the degree to which the industry can work with it. Also, according to Senator Watson, who is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the ISC has developed a good working relationship with the select committee and with his office. The ISC should be commended on its performance to date and I sincerely hope that other agencies, such as the Australian Taxation Office, can take its example and be less confrontational. One matter that relates to the operation of the ISC and the need for amendment bills is that under part 29 of the SI(S) Act the ISC has the power to modify provisions of the act, either temporarily or permanently. Modifications of a permanent nature are of concern. They effectively have the potential to change the intention of the act. Of course, modification orders are gazetted, but they are not subject to the scrutiny that amendment bills or regulations would receive in the normal course of events. Parliament, by allowing modifications, is delegating its legislative role to a government agency in circumstances where there is no form of legislated requirement for review. To the best of my knowledge, to date the ISC has used its power to modify the SI(S) Act in a responsible manner, so I am anticipating a concern. I believe this is an issue to which members of the House should give consideration. Should we be prepared to delegate our legislative role in this way or should we take a more active position in protecting the legislative workings of the parliament? That is the question I want honourable members to consider. It would be preferable for permanent modifications to the SI(S) Act to be achieved by legislative change, with the ISC modifications being used only as a temporary measure. A majority of the amendments made by this bill affect the SI(S) Act. The bill, as it was originally introduced into the Senate, has already been amended. Many of the amendments are of a minor and technical nature. WhereI mention in the course of my remarks the relevant division of the bill, it should be assumed that I am referring to those divisions in part 2 that are amendments to the SI(S) Act, unless I indicate otherwise. Division3 allows certain non-bank financial institutions to offer what are known as approved guarantees. This measure relates to the standard of investments. The bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow certain non-bank financial institutions to offer guarantees required under the SI(S) Act. Currently, only approved banks, and the Commonwealth, states or territories, can offer guarantees required under the SI(S) Act. The bill also amends the SI(S) Act to enable building societies, credit unions and similar organisations, which are subject to supervision under the various state financial institutions codes, to also be able to offer such guarantees. As well, division 3 allows 'in-house' investments in certain non-bank financial institutions. 2602 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 An 'in-house asset' is essentially a loan to, or an investment in, a standard employer sponsor of the fund, or an associate of such an employer sponsor, and the SI(S) Act places restrictions, for prudential reasons, on the level of such investments. The bill amends the SI(S) Act to treat deposits in certain non-bank financial institutions, which are subject to prudential supervision, in the same manner as deposits in an approved bank, with the objective of determining whether they are in-house assets. The effect of this amendment is significant, as the SI(S) Act restricts the in-house assets of regulated superannuation funds to 10 per cent of the total assets in most cases. What it does is rope in the non-bank institutions, such as building societies and the like. Division7 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that a trustee cannot accept a person as a member of a public offer entity, unless that person has applied in the appropriate manner and has received relevant information, of a calibre determined by the commissioner, about the entity beforehand. Division 11 amends section 66 of the SI(S) Act. The SI(S) Act imposes a general prohibition on the acquisition of assets from members, subject to a limited exception for funds with less than five members, known as excluded superannuation funds, provided the asset acquired is business real property. The bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that an excluded superannuation fund can only acquire business real property from a member, or relative of a member, if the property is business real property in the member's or relative's principal business. The SI(S) Act currently requires a standard employer sponsored fund, which is a public offer fund, to have an independent trustee. Division 12 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow such funds the option of either having an independent trustee, or having equal numbers of employer and member representatives, involved in the trusteeship of the fund. This provides funds with greater flexibility in organising their trusteeship, while at the same time ensuring that members are protected in the first instance by having a trustee who is independent, and, in the second, by having direct involvement in the fund via equal representation. Employee representatives need not necessarily be members of the superannuation fund. They are usually representatives nominated by the members of a fund, a trade union or other organisation representing the interests of those members. There is much merit in having employee trustees. Even where the option of an independent trustee is taken up, it would be useful if funds were required to have at least one representative from the fund membership who is, in the vernacular, from the shop floor. Such a fund member representative would benefit the prudential protection of the fund and reassure workers that the fund is sound. It is a matter I believe the ISC should give serious consideration to. It is also a matter that Senator Watson has been pursuing for some time with no response from the government so far. Overall, this amendment to sections 91 to 93 of the SI(S) Act will undoubtedly provide funds with much greater flexibility in organising their trusteeship. It will also ensure that members are protected by having a trustee who is independent and by having direct involvement in the fund by means of equal representation. Division 13 allows for existing trustees to give a notice of retirement without a need to call a meeting of beneficiaries. A fundamental principle of the SI(S) Act is that superannuation entities should be in control of a single party-the trustees who take full responsibility for the fund. However, corporations law currently requires that superannuation entities which are public offer entities have dually responsible parties comprising the trustees and the Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2603 management company. The SI(S) Act enables these public offer entities to change to a single party in control of the fund. In many cases this will involve the trustee retiring and the management company taking over the role of trustee. The effective and smooth operation of this changeover may be hampered if the existing trustee is required to hold a meeting of beneficiaries before retiring, as the governing rules of some superannuation entities may in fact require. To overcome that problem and therefore to ensure a smoother changeover, the bill amends the SI(S) Act to provide that such a requirement in the governing rules of the fund will have no effect. This is a common sense measure. It will eliminate the unnecessary expense to superannuation funds where an existing trustee retires as a result of provisions in the SI(S) Act. Division 14 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow the minister to approve disclosure of otherwise protected information, if it is in the public interest to do so, to the public at large rather than to particular members of the public. How the public interest is defined is always interesting. I have no doubt it will be the same in this case. Naturally enough, the public interest as perceived by the minister could be very different from that of an impartial observer. Where such disclosure does occur, I hope it is only undertaken on the advice of the ISC. It is essential that political chicanery not be correlated with the public interest. At the same time, the bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that appropriate protection is provided to an individual by only allowing disclosure of information that relates to the private affairs of an individual where such disclosure would not be unreasonable in the circumstances. The ISC is currently able to disclose information to the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Securities Commission. These amendments will allow the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to receive information obtained by the ISC. The effective operation of the tribunal which also commenced on 1 July 1994 can only be improved by these amendments. Keeping in mind the Privacy Act and the need to ensure individual privacy, where the ISC does hand information over to the tribunal this should only occur where the person concerned has given the ISC written authorisation. The disclosure of information to the tribunal should only be done where authority to do so has been given because it protects the privacy of the person concerned and it protects the ISC against any possible future dispute as to whether it was reasonable to disclose the information. Division 15 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure consistency between related provisions in the act which deal with the purposes for which an approved deposit fund may be maintained, and payments to beneficiaries also. This clarifies the existing obligation. The SI(S) Act currently restricts disqualified persons from being trustees or investment managers of superannuation entities. There is, however, no similar requirement on custodians. Division 17 of the bill amends the SI(S) Act to address this problem and ensure that custodians are subject to similar eligibility requirements to those applying to trustees and to investment managers. Naturally, custodians play an important role in safeguarding the assets of their clients in their contractual relationships with a trustee or an investment manager. It is more important that these sorts of prudential controls extend to custodians. Division 18 deals with the removal of trustees of public offer entities in section 60A. The bill inserts a new requirement into this SI(S) Act to prevent another party from trying to exert undue influence on a trustee by threatening to remove the trustee unless the trustee complies with that party's requests. This should serve to reinforce the perceived and intended real 2604 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 independence of trustees by requiring that the government rules of public offer funds allow a trustee to be removed only by the commissioner, unless the removal is of a kind to be specified in later regulations. Division 18A requires the trustees of an exempt public sector superannuation scheme that is subject to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act to set up arrangements for dealing with inquiries or complaints. Clauses 50 to 52 enable regulations to be made bringing currently exempt public sector superannuation schemes within the operation of the S(RC) Act. This also is a welcome measure. It will increase the accessibility of the tribunal by public sector fund members and ensure that those funds that elect to become subject to the SI(S) Act have an internal resolution mechanism. This latest amendment rectifies an earlier problem. Previously, if a fund did not have an internal resolution mechanism a member could not go to the tribunal. Clauses 50 to 52 allow state and territory governments to legislate to subject their public superannuation schemes to the operations of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Ultimately, the decision to do so rests with the states, although to date I believe only Victoria and New South Wales have opted to stay out. Mr Deputy Speaker, superannuation policy under Labor has been a litany of wasted opportunities. The very rapidity of legislative changes to superannuation policy has created uncertainty where stability should exist. Superannuation is not as widely accepted as it should be as the preferred vehicle for retirement saving. Management fees, taxes levied on moneys going into and out of funds, the legislative uncertainty and the lack of choice of superannuation schemes have led to many people challenging the worth of superannuation as it is now constituted. The superannuation guarantee charge, the SGC, continues to be a major concern for employers. Imposing the costs of the SGC predominantly on employers is an impost that cannot be afforded. For every employer, the SGC is another hefty payroll tax that discourages investment in Australia and impacts negatively on possible future job creation. If the SGC exists to fund the retirement of an employer's employees, why should the employer foot the retirement bill? It is a social matter. Employees should also bear responsibility for their own superannuation contributions. Only by contributing towards the cost of their own retirement will employees realise the cost involved and gain an appreciation of the ownership of their future retirement income. Of course, there is the additional impost of complying with the SGC. This is just another cost that is added to the already long list of costs incurred over and above the total wages hill. Superannuation provides one method by which Australians can maximise our national savings. The government is in total disarray when it comes to a savings policy. The FitzGerald report on national savings advocated several necessary changes to government policy on superannuation that would assist in increasing the rate of savings. FitzGerald recommended, amongst other things, superannuation savings accounts and increased competition between the current players and, of course, future players. At the last election, the coalition advocated the establishment of retirement savings accounts. These accounts would have enjoyed the same superannuation tax concessions that we were advocating for superannuation policies. Our objective in advocating retirement savings accounts was twofold: to expand the range of choice available to individuals and to allow banks and other financial institutions to compete with superannuation funds in the provision of Thursday, 20 October 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 2605 superannuation schemes. These savings accounts would also have been available to low income and seasonal workers, thereby maintaining the tax office as the collector of government revenue, not as the manager of superannuation accounts. Greater competition in the provision of superannuation is anathema to Labor and the reasons are crystal clear: Labor is looking after its mates. Rather than introducing greater competition to the provision of superannuation, the government has closed the door on greater competition in order to protect existing super funds and, particularly, the role of the ACTU in occupational superannuation. The ACTU has been a constant opponent of greater competition and seems, once again, to have exercised its veto. To date, the ACTU has won all the battles, leaving the community as the loser. To the ACTU and this government, it seems superannuation has little to do with retirement income policy, and more to do with industrial relations and taxation. The drive for award based superannuation has taken little, if any, account of productivity. It takes no account of a firm's capacity to pay, and it denies individuals the right to best decide where their superannuation contributions should go. Nearly all award based superannuation contributions are paid into union dominated superannuation funds. The award based superannuation system is made worse because of the number of awards that cover many occupational groupings. These numerous superannuation schemes all have different conditions and obligations which must be met by employers. This makes the cost of complying with the superannuation guarantee all that much higher. Prior to Labor coming to power in March 1983, there were no taxes on contributions and fund earnings, and tax was only payable on five per cent of an individual's lump sum entitlement at the individual's marginal rate. There are now six taxes on superannuation that tax employer contributions, super fund investment income, the lump sums of those individuals under 55 years, ad infinitum. Superannuation has become Labor's milch cow. Labor's approach is simple: if it moves, tax it. This approach to retirement incomes has discouraged and confused many people about the benefits of superannuation. For individuals to fully fund their retirement, they need more than just the superannuation guarantee. They also need the desire to make their own contributions. By discouraging individual superannuation contributions, the government is actively discouraging the community from saving for retirement. In the Financial Review of 17 August this year, Barrie Dunstan wrote: Governments, as well as consumers, may need educating, considering that research group Mintel has found that, relative to many European countries, the level of targeted retirement income here is low. Taking the Australian level of retirement income from government pensions and privately financed savings as the base of 100, Mintel's figures put the relative welfare index of Italy at 196, Spain at 186, Sweden at 162 and Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg at 147. It is obvious that the governments of those countries are encouraging a much higher rate of retirement income for their citizens. Of course, this will also have the potential of translating into higher rates of national savings. The coalition will announce a revised superannuation policy, in the lead-up to the next election, that will try to come to grips with many of these issues. It will not necessarily mirror that of the 1993 election, but it will be committed to increasing the flexibility of the superannuation system and reducing the compliance costs of businesses. As I stated earlier, 2606 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 October 1994 the coalition does not oppose this bill as it is largely a housekeeping measure that, we have been pleased to note, was drafted in consultation with industry groups.
