Debate resumed from ist July (vide page That the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by the ®lerk, be agreed to by the House. debate on the Address-in-Reply has some uses, and more abuses. especially at the opening of a new Parliament, it does fulfil a distinct function, and, to use a familiar phrase, assists us to clear the decks before entering upon the specific business of the session. ,The outlook after the recent election appears to deserve special consideration at the hands of honourable members. An examination of the Speech itself need not detain us at any length. Seemly references are made to the great loss sustained by the Empire owing to the death of the late King, and our congratulations upon the accession of his son, both events having necessarily fdled of late a large space in the reflections of all our people. I should have been glad if there had been added an expression of gratification at the creation of the new Dominion of South 'Africa. The Provinces of that country haying now united, complete the establishment of Federal Governments in all the several groups of contiguous colonies hitherto unrelated, except as portions of the British Empire. They are thus making for the efficiency of their administration of local affairs; providing a means by which all the Dominions may join with the Mother Country in the protection of their common interests, and in a common policy, growing, I trust, more and more consistent and effective year by year. The heartiest good will of the people of this Commonwealth goes out to our fellow citizens in the new Dominion, with our best wishes for them in the development of their large portion of one of the great continents of the motion for the adoption of the Addressin-Reply may be congratulated upon the manner in which they discharged the more than formal duties devolving upon them. They have introduced themselves to the House in a manner that will commend their future utterances to our consideration. Coming to the Speech itself, the greater Chief Electrical Engineer, 30th June, number of the proposals are outlined in such brief and vague terms that the substance of the actual measures can be but dimly discerned. This is mentioned, not that I regret-it, but as an explanation of my reason for passing comparatively lightly over a number of matters merely alluded to in a way that affords no clues to the actual distinctive proposals intended to be made. If , indeed, we had been presented with no more than a catalogue of the subjects proposed to be treated, there would have been little Nevertheless, ground for complaint, so far as the Opposition is concerned. Our desire is that this should be a business Parliament; that whatever the Government have to lay before us shall be dealt with in a business way. There is no reason why this session should not be brief and brisk, even though' devoted to a full consideration of all the matters alluded to in the Speech. Let me, at the outset, indicate that, so far as the Opposition are concerned, there is no suggestion of obstruction. Our object will be not only to facilitate the passage of wise measures, but to throw into stronger relief by our brevity whatever criticisms or objections we may offer. Our verdicts need not be burned under mountains of accumulated or unnecessary matter rendering them undiscoverable without .research. We shall fulfil our duties as an Opposition effectively without undue heat or prolixity in debate. The Governor General's Speech, to deal with it in a very rudimentary arithmetical manner contains thirty paragraphs, of which more than one-half simply consist of an index or catalogue, without exposition. In the remaining half, most of the Bills are familiar friends, calling for little or no comment. It would have been difficult for the Government to sav less in reference to the Federal capital, the Western Australian transcontinental railway, or the establishment of trade relations with other Dominions. Each of these themes will afford us ample reflection when the actual proposals are before us. There is not even a clue to the order of business.

If it is to be dealt with satisfactorily the sooner members are placed in possession of the schedule of the Government proposals the more rapidly will they be able to satisfy themselves whether it includes all the anonlalies they have had in mind in pressing for it. If we had been sitting on the opposite side of the House such a measure would certainly have been, if not the first, at least, one of the very first submitted. taken that course with an object that should appeal to the present Governmenta desire that the schedule should not be allowed to drag till towards the close of the session, or be dealt with in circumstances of duress and haste. It can be more speedily disposed of if on questions involving so many technical considerations, honourable members are given a proper opportunity to supply themselves with these details in advance. upon the gratuitous offers of information frequently made in the lobbies. No honourable members who have dealt with Tariff provisions in this House desire to see such interventions during the coming discussion.

Due consideration can be much better afforded if Ministers at once disclose exactly what it is they intend to ask this House to do in order to meet the financial exigencies of the Commonwealth, which also affect those of the related Governments of Australia.

After the close of 1910 this Parliament has not only the power, but the right, to dispose of all its revenue.

21,Mr Hughes,"The honourable member,the consent of the seven Governments, and of the whole of the people of Australia, voting as citizens of the Commonwealth, and as citizens of the States, to make another agreement which would have fulfilled all requirements. will be a matter for subsequent debate. I am dealing now with the manner in whicli Ministers propose to carry out their financial intentions, and suggesting that this is not only ungracious, but suggests a suspicion of illegality-a n attempt to get around the Constitution. Such action is unnecessary j and with this deprecation I pass it by. member say that, when the people deliberately rejected his proposition and accepted ours? member's proposal was I do not know, except as conveyed in the statement of the Prime Minister that he approved a term of ten years.

But the Attorney-General must separate his two statements: first, that our proposals were rejected, which is indisputably true, and, next, that his or some other person's proposals were accepted, which is indisputably unproven, and also untrue. To count all the votes against a particular scheme in support of some other scheme is quite unwarranted. need not be further discussed. The Government could have achieved whatever end they have in view without putting into the mouth of the Governor General a threat which can only be executed by might rather than legal right. However, to proceed, the old-age proposals merely involve questions of dates. The allusion to the Northern Territory transfer appears to be entirely satisfactory; and, if I can trust its phrasing, there is no fault to find with the paragraph relating to immigration. So far, there has been nothing fresh, or any new departures of moment to detain us. I The new proposal take it that the repeal of the Loan Bill isa necessary result of the recent voting. The News cable subsidy looks trifling in the absence of explanation or comment. Uncertain of its nature, it passes without reference. But for the interjections I should, have almost disposed of the Speech. A t any rate, we have reduced the thirty paragraphs to three; and now approach what appear to be the' cardinal points of the policy of the Ministry. But before going further, we ought to notice, a few curiousomissions ; and I use the word ' curious ' ' ! because it does not follow that the absence of mention means an absence of intention to deal with the matters omitted. But we ought to be. informed. Among the propositions which we pressed very strongly, and to which a number of honourable members opposite drew the attention of the electors, was a group of proposals under the heading of an Agricultural Bureau. This was to be founded with the object of equipping the producers of Australia-far mers, cultivators, and pastoralists-wit h -better means of coping with insect or vegetable pests, with a better knowledge of Australian soils and circumstances, new products, and new methods of cultivation, in order to arm them for the battle waged successfully in the settled areas of the continent, and about to be extended beyond them, especially under the relatively novel conditions to be found in parts of the interior, and in tlie north df the Northern Territory. These propositions were probably approved elsewhere as unanimously as at every one. of the many meetingswhich I had an opportunity of addressing. Side by side with that, propositions in respect to unemployment were given a very large space in many places by many of us, and received a similarly favorable reception. We indicated that advantage would be taken of the work of Labour Bureaux, and studies made' of the possibilities of inThe subject surance against unemployment, the registration of unemployed, and a variety of other assisting measures. We undertook that a commencement would be made at anearly date to deal with what has been described as one of the greatest evils, if not the greatest, of our modern industrial' system.

28,Mr Deakin,"There were so manyaction taken under an Inter-State Commission clothed with industrial powers over Wages Boards. References were made to successes achieved, in America more particularly, by means of agricultural bureaux, and in Europe by other modes of organization, from which Australia had reason to hope for similar gains. These great general non-party proposals were cordially welcomed on every hand, and will be similarly welcomed in this House when the Government thinks fit to submit measures for giving effect to them. The fact that we laid exceptional stress on them is not, I trust, a reason why Ministers should not take them in hand; because, as I have insisted, they are non-party, and have received the support of persons of all shades of political views. In relation to employment, we relied upon the bearing of investigations into the agricultural development of the Commonwealth and also upon the application of a fiscal stimulus to rural and civic industries. There was to be such a continuous study of foreign methods and markets, and such a comparison of ours with theirs, as would fit Parliament to judge of any proposition submitted regarding the encouragement of better methods of production. If it were found that the position of an industry was due to any neglect to adopt the most improved machinery or the most efficient methods, a different attitude would be taken towards its appeals for duties from that adopted with regard to one which, to the best of its powers, had put itself in the front rank in these respects. If a proper spur is to be applied to our production by the application of new methods and a greater use of the inventive capacity of our people, a great deal must be done to enable those engaged : in any industry to familiarize themselves with tlie latest and best results of the -world's intelligence in respect to its output. All this is truly Federal and national work. AVe come now to three paragraphs in the -speech which appear to demand a closer -examination. They relate to the note issue, -the land tax, and sundry amendments of the Constitution. -Commonwealth note issue'cannot be profitably discussed until we know what is to be the limit of the issue, the convertibility of the notes, and the gold support to be given to them. It is a question of safeguards, and, so far as I understand the situation, of nothing else. : issue may be made indisputably secure, or it may be left in doubt; that is, it may be insufficient to sustain the stress of a crisis such as that through which Australia passed some twenty years ago. We shall require to look with the greatest caution at any proposals for a future multiplication of the notes. Until we have before us the details of the Government measure, and know what safeguards are to surround the issue, it can only be casually mentioned. An issue such as is proposed would, of course, have this advantage, so far as the Ministry is concerned-it would tide the Treasurer over certain immediate difficulties, by giving him a loan at a low rate of interest, on which he could draw more largely for a longer period than he can hope to draw upon the Trust Funds. Federal Parliament I was in favour of a Commonwealth note issue. suggesting that this is a new proposal so far as the Prime Minister is concerned. It is not. I have heard him discus's it over and over again in this Chamber. However, we must wait until we see the measure. A Bill for the imposition of a Commonwealth land tax was the first Ministerial measure of last session; I do not know why a similar measure does not take first place on the programme for this session. member desired that the remedying of Tariff anomalies should be made the first business of the session. How many measures does he think ought to be put first? anomalies should be among the very first things dealt with. It is so short a time since that statement was made that the honourable member, however much he may wish to forget, can hardly have done so. I did not say that the rectification of Tariff anomalies should be the introductory measure of the session; I said that there were strong grounds for making it one of the very first measures of the session. has not been so successful as usual in wrapThe proposal regarding a ping up his meaning in a maze of words. would not be for want of example in the honourable member's speeches.

34,Mr Deakin,"My failure to do thatremain blind to the opportunities afforded by this legitimate source of revenue, and to its other promises of development. Many times during the last nine or ten years have we called the attention of the Premiers to the fact, and, on one occasion in particular, I remember coming into conflict with State Ministers on the subject. In consequence of the hesitancy and delay of the State Governments in respect to land taxation or their imperfect use of their powers in this respect, the verdict of the last election was distinctly in favour of the Commonwealth's exercise of the powers in that regard which it has always possessed. In common with many others, I still think that these could be better exercised by the State Governments, since Commonwealth legislation must make one set of conditions apply to the vast area of this great continent. There are inevitable difficulties and ingraph, as it stands, is comprehensive herent inequalities in the imposition of land taxation, even when applied to comparatively small areas, because of differences in conditions which it has hitherto been found impossible to meet adequately.

Those who are putting the soil to its best use should beginning, and the words "" in relation to "" not be treated in the same way as those who are content to shepherd it, leaving it almost unproductive. Questions of valuation, rating, and special conditions must present many problems, and the application of one tax to the whole continent make all of them greater than if adjusted to smaller areas.

If we can trust the newspapers, the proposed rates of taxation have already been altered; they may be altered again. We have now arrived by easy stages at the thirtieth and last paragraph in the speech. It may be described as the kernel of the document. Being worded with the careful inexactitude that characterizes other parts of the speech, it is capable of covering even more contentious matter than the other twenty-nine paragraphs. I say ""may,"" because, if ever a draftsman's skill was shown in drawing a circumference somewhere beyond our powers of vision in every direction, the writer who drew up this clause may be complimented on his success.

I have heard sentiments less generous expressed, and congratulate the honourable member on his experience. In this regard, let me again express the hope that these measures also will be tabled promptly, and that we shall be afforded an opportunity of considering them in all their aspects before we are asked to debate them. It will mean a saving of time, and is no unreasonable request, in matters of such vital moment to the whole Commonwealth. Ot course, Ministers are not to be held even to their own pre-election speeches, still less to some of the other speeches lately delivered by their supporters, although it is in the light of some of those that the public will be inclined to interpret the-circumnavigations in this one clause. It brings us to the very brink of complete unification. If corporations of all kinds, and all bodies, corporations or not, which enter into agreements justifying their classification as "" trusts or combinations,"" or bring themselves within the wide range of the word "" monopolies "" if these are brought under Commonwealth control in regard to all trade manufactures, production, industrial matters, and navigation, what will be left of the States will be the rind. able for the honourable member to wait until he sees the Bills? to come to some phases of the present situation. The authority under which Ministers are acting is that of majorities in both Chambers to which they submit this programme of legislation As has already been remarked, both by the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply, the present Government finds itself happily in a position farsuperior to that of any of its predecessors, the two with which the Prime Minister was associated, and those with which we were associated. No previous Ministry in this country has been able to stand alone, or to deal with its business independently. Although all of them had long views, every one of them had to take short steps. Our The Attorneymajorities were always free and fleeting, and there was no assurance that any plan commenced would be able to be completed by any particular Cabinet. The fact that we have seen eight Administrations in nine years tells its own tale. Steering through choppy seas and changeable gales, Ministers of the Commonwealth in the past have held no sinecures while they occupied those benches. I congratulate my friend, the Prime Minister, and his colleagues, upon commencing their present voyage under conditions absolutely different.

There is nothing in Parliament, and nothing out of it, short of the electorates, that can prevent this Government from carrying the whole of the programme of its party in this Parliament. Realizing that, we drop a sympathetic tear for the past Governments, which, with the largest hopes and the most ambitious aims, had never the shadow of such an opportunity.

One question, however, which we are still entitled to put is : How far can the autho-rity recently given to them fairly be said to -extend ? To refer briefly, but I hope with sufficient accuracy, to the recent election and our own experience in it as a political party, plain prose seems insufficient, and I resort to poetry. Kipling's lines which appear to me to sum up the situation have been, I think, in part already quotedLet us admit it fairly, as a business people should, We have .had no end of a lesson; it will do us no end of good Let us approach this pivotal fact in a humble yet hopeful mood; We have had no end of a lesson; it will do us no end of good. doubt about that. end of good, what kind of good has it done my honourable friend? Even poetry will not express that. pressed in algebraical formulas. which opens out towards the infinite. Still we, as an Opposition, realize that, under our system of politics and of government, parties are always made in adversity. Honourable members opposite know that. It is in prosperity that another series of tests is applied, under which our parties often go to pieces. I shall not disturb Ministers with any anticipations in that regard, but we intend to apply the lesson so that it will do no end of good to ourselves, and also, we hope, to that immense number of the citizens of Australia who, with all our real defects-and they were very small compared with the imaginary-ye t gave us a great total of votes. I notice in a corner -of the Governor General's Speech a reference to an Electoral Bill. It may be a mere machinery corrective; it may be a measure of large scope. It ought to be a measure of large scope. After a little while, when a more philosophic view can be taken of the incidents of the recent contest, -attention can be profitably drawn, not only to the principles upon which our elections have been conducted, but to a number of practices that are springing up, which, uniess checked, promise to prove most injurious to the public interests of Australia. An Address-in-Reply is not the occasion to broach these. When we face the consideration of the possibilities' of improving our electoral system, we shall be compelled to take into account, not only its principles, but also those practices, if we wish to preserve the reputation of the country and to insure the proper working of the processes by which members of this House and of the Senate are chosen by the electors. Of fundamental principles one at least deserves mention, and that is the principle of fair, or something like fair, representation. This, I take it, is the basis of the whole elective system in a Democracy; if it goes, all goes. Now even the most superficial consideration of the voting at the late general election shows results so extraordinary that they cannot by the widest extension of terms come within the meaning of "" fair representation."" For instance, to pick out a few figures the figures contained in an official return about to be circulated, of which I have requires to be exobtained a proof, I find that there .is still a great deal necessary in order that the peoples voting at the polls may be represented in some fair proportion in this House. Let me take two illustrations. In Queensland-usin g round numbers-85,00 0 votes seated six members of the Labour party; whilst 80,000 votes for the Opposition seated only three representatives. No one can say that there is any proportion in that case between the votes of the electors and their representation in this Chamber. In New South Wales labour with 252,000 votes obtained seventeen representatives, whilst the Opposition with 230,000 votes have but eight representatives. give us thefiguresfor Victoria? course, the two glaring instances.

One result is that we have lost the great advantage of a free expression of opinion by honourable members of that party. applied the gag. apply to any one comparable to that now applied to the whole of the Labour party by its own members, and against our protests ? It is not denied that out of these strange parliamentary methods may come -some discoveries useful, perhaps important, in constitutional government; at present there seems no such prospect. Eveni f departures of this drastic nature appear to offer a temporary advantage, we must realize that it may be too dearly purchased. Iu the words of the German proverb, we should "" take care not to throw out the baby with its bath water."" There is grave clanger, that in the endeavour to make short cuts to party unity, some of the essential principles of responsible government will be sacrificed. Is it possible to carve off this or that limb from the body corporate-fro m our constitutional government-of every feature of which we know the historic origin, and to which some of us have paid allegiance for many years without profoundly altering the character and relation of the whole, and perhaps destroying it? Under present circumstances, we on this side may no doubt be plunged in many difficulties. We have to convince the general public of the peril of a departure known nowhere else in the Empire, or in any constitutionally-governed country. Our hope is that the whole of our part in the legislative work being done in the public eye, and within the public hearing, open to criticism, in this fashion we may make the whole of the electors, friends or foes, partners in all we do, and in all we aim at, whether we succeed or fail. This will be amongst the heaviest of the responsibilities resting on the present Opposition. The best way to convey my sense of the cumulative effect of the innovations for which honourable members opposite are responsible, is to ask them to run over in their minds a few words, each with a long history behind it and a meaning attached by generations of experience. Let them, having run over in their minds the words "" Ministry,"" ""Cabinet,"" ""Executive,"" ""Party,"" ""Caucus,"" and "" Parliament,"" now ask whether, if they use them hereafter when referring to our o\vn government, ; they realize that they are compelled to impart to them a significance which they possess nowhere else all the world over. Neither in Great Britain, in any of the British Dominions, nor in any of the States of the Dominions, do we find these words used in the sense in which we are bound to employ them when referring to honourable members opposite and their organization. The chief resemblance it supplies is to the methods of continental autocracies. Our Federal system is equally endangered. I should be the last to discourage experiment, even in these matters-the last to reject an innovation because it was an innovation, or to find fault with it on that ground. If only one of these terms required a fresh translation, little need have been said; but here we have words which denote realities ot most potent influence. Grouped together they cover practically all the operations of our Parliament and all Government agencies, and now every one of these has to be understood, or rather interpreted in a new sense. If the transformation with which we are confronted, prove in the future to the advantage of the electors and to the Government of the country, honourable members opposite will enjoy a fame they will deserve; but we believe that these surgical operations will prove fatal to the life of constitutional government, as we know it. They may inaugurate another kind of government, of which, as yet, we have hacl even in part little experience, and that little of a most discouraging character. Henceforth, in communicating with the Mother Country, or any of our sister Dominions, we shall require to provide them with a glossary. Confusion will be worse confounded if they attach the old meanings to institutions -or gatherings retaining the old names. the same? ""Opposition side"" remain.

No' Caucus'' I know of, or have heard of : elsewhere, elects its Ministers and shares their Cabinet responsibilities as ours does. No other "" Caucus,"" so far as I know, controls both Houses and the Executive. The original Labour Caucus always conducted its business in some respects very like a Cabinet.

Ministers leave Cabinets to assert their personal principles; but how rare are the occasions when similar independence has been exhibited in any Caucus in Australia. describing his own Caucus, or ours? and our differences become public. I am describing the only Caucus ""-the , : Labour Caucus. Why shut the mouths of is wisdom, but in a minority there is some wisdom, sometimes even more than in the majority. That is the case at present. Why should the minority of your Labour Caucus have their mouths closed in this House instead of retaining the same freedom as any minority of the party on this side? Outside the Commonwealth there is no political body of this character which shares Cabinet and Executive responsibilities. Here we see a levelling up of all members and a levelling down of all Ministers, who remain heads of Departments only. Your ""Prime Minister"" is liable to be outvoted in his own ""Cabinet,"" while the whole "" Cabinet"" is liable to be outvoted in "" Caucus"" by a majority which dees not openly assume the responsibilities of office. this House. House in the public eye and in the public hearing, is very different from the happenings in a "" Caucus '' outside, away from the public eye and hearing, and confined to the members of a particular section. In view of these cumulative changes in your Cabinet, Executive, Ministry, and party, through your "" Caucus,"" what we are nowgetting may be constitutional government, but it is of a new pattern, with a new distribution of power, and a new employment of the method of secrecy. So far as I know anything about the ""Caucus,"" though that is very little, I do not know why such strict secrecy is observed. The cumulative effect of these changes upon the i government of Australia is certain to be potent, both in legislation and administration. I make no attempt to assume the prophetic office or to determine whether there will be any compensating advantages. Frankly, I do not knowj but I am certain that constitutional students all the world over, when they are apprised of this new departure, will take it into account. This may put honourable members opposite on their better behaviour, because they certainly will be subjected to very close scrutiny in regard to their policy from all parts of the world. Theirs will be the credit of inventing and putting into force a new kind of government which is responsible in a sense, and constitutional in a sense, but in no accepted sense-in a novel sense-whos e value can only be tested by its effects. I do not think that honourable members opposite can complain your minority ? In the majority if we judge their new system by its fruits. We cannot judge them in a day; but in time they will declare themselves. The spirit ancl form of our Constitution, if it resists those innovations, will deserve even the highest encomiums that have beers lavished upon it because of its elasticity, its possibilities of adaptation to new circumstances and conditions. Our Constitution cannot be praised enough if it endures this strain without losing its essential characteristics. Constitutional government, as we know it, has hitherto been the topmost achievement in the organization of civilized peoples, the greatest agency of political freedom, social evolution, and popular government the world has yet disclosed. Necessarily those who treasure it may be forgiven if they speak of it with something more than an intellectual appreciation.

After thirty years spent in assemblies governed by the old practice and principle, I may be pardoned if it still seems to me the one direct way in which men of our time, amid modern developments, and with broad democratic aims, can associate effectively for the accombers able to acquit themselves in such a plishment of public purposes. I view, therefore, with some apprehension a departure so decided. You are leaving the high road, and taking an abrupt turn to the left-re tracing your steps, going backwards and -downwards. We may be refuted by experience, and shown that this track, though -circuitous, can lead us onward. Exceptions -excepted, honourable members opposite have the same general aims as ours, and however the electors may be divided as to the means by which fundamental objects are to be reached, and as to the men to be trusted to reach them, they, too, are broadly at -one in their reverence for those principles -of constitutional government which are now receiving an entirely new and experimental application. We are united as to the ends w; ought to achieve. But let me repeat again, it is possible to achieve our immediate social, industrial, and legislative objectives, and yet to buy them too dearly. We cannot afford to permit the destruction of the spirit of the Constitution, so as to prevent further -similar achievements in the future, and prove these to be the last fruit from an old tree-frui t such as it will not be capable, of bearing again. I fear that we are striking too near to the heart of that tree; that in these changes we shall be cutting too -deeply, thus, impairing its ancient, traditional, but still vigorous life. If this be not so, let us face the experiment. Let us trust that it may not be too expensive to the country; that in the three years of absolute power which my friends opposite are about to enjoy, and with their uncontrolled -capacity of translating into Acts of Parlia„ ment the whole of their policy and programme, it will stand the. strain put upon it.

'[4.45J-Though unable to .agree with all his conclusions, I offer my congratulations to the honourable member for Ballarat, who has favoured us with one of his best efforts. Like him, I congratulate, too, the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's speech. ThoughI have not heard so many speeches of that character as the honourable gentleman, I can say I have never heard two clearer utterances from new members. The House is to be congratulated upon having two new memmanner of the duties allotted to them. I was interested in the historical references of the Leader of the Opposition, to whom I offer my congratulations on his election to that position, which is the right of a displaced Prime Minister. The House*will gather from the tone of his remarks that the criticism of the Opposition will not be unduly fierce or vindictive. The Ministry will welcome the keenest criticism, and the closest examination of its proposals. Ministers will listen to the arguments offered, and decide questions on their merits. No attempt will be made to use the power of numbers vindictively, or to humiliate the Opposition. There will be no display of force so long as Opposition members desire to use arguments. I have never been a party to the application of the powers for curtailing debate which are given by the Standing Orders, and I hope that I shall never need to take advantage of them. Whilst interested in the sketch of the development of responsible and constitutional government given by the Leader of the Opposition, I do not agree with his presentment of the case. His contention was that constitutional government is something apart from the members whose support has enabled Ministers to carry their measures through Parliament. Nothing of the kind. May I remind the honourable member that that great Liberal leader, the late Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone, frequently called his party into councils where they discussed in secret the policy to be brought before"" Parliament, without the press being present, and without informing the newspapers of their decisions, or the manner in which they were arrived at. May I remind him, too, that that stout old Conservative and exceedingly capable man,the late Marquis of Salisbury, was compelled by the younger Tory party to meet in caucus again and again, and to take from the party his lines of policy? cedent for the honourable member to quote! honourable member's leader, who tells us",25,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

It is known that, in Australia, Premiers have been compelled to take into their Cabinets members with whom they did not wish to be associated. Is that the kind of constitutional government which the Leader of the Opposition prefers to that which we have here? Happily, the constitutional position is not now in issue. With a free franchise and open Parliamentary discussion, no harm can come to the Democracy of Australia. While we have a free press, and decisions must be arrived at after open discussion in Parliament, the electors may be allowed to say how they will be governed. I leave the matter to them. While certain innovations may have taken place, none has gone further than I desire. In fact, there are many more which I hope will take place, because I believe that they would improve our methods of administration and legislation. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the effect of our methods on administration. I wish to ask him what he meant.

I am glad to have given him an opportunity to correct the. report. immediately. of reading the contradiction. I may safely leave the question of the proposed amendment of the Constitution to the Attorney General.

He denned these to be the note issue, the land tax, and the amendments of the Constitution. The note issue is to be on recognised safe lines, which have been adopted in Queensland for over seventeen years. The Bill will disclose the same principles. When discussed in that Parliament, it was condemned by nearly all the banking authorities there, and stateState issue were brought into operation, there would be fewer notes in circulation in proportion to the number of people than* there were before. They also predicted loss, and even ruin. None of these things has taken place. As a matter of actual fact, three times the number of notes are in currencv in Queensland compared with the average of the rest of Australia. The Bill will deal with currency only.

It is absurd to suggest that the Commonwealth, which has at the present time a debt, including the indebtedness of the whole of the States, of over ^250,000,000, will have its credit endangered by having a note issue as part of its currency. the honourable member proposes to go no further than the Queensland Government did? gards the method and form of the Bill. It will relate entirely to currency. As regards the amount of the issue, of course, that must be larger. It must have an absolute gold backing, and thenotes must be redeemable at the Treasury whenever presented. tern Australia wants gold for a lot of those notes, how will it get it? institutions will have gold sufficient for the amount of notes which they may hold from time to time. many notes. back to the Treasury..

The issue will be a very great convenience to the people of Australia, altogether apart from the small profit that will be derived from it.""

153,Mr Fisher,"I took the same viewa first charge on their assets-as they should be. But what protection does that give lo the holder of the notes? I venture to say that, substantial and sound as all these banking institutions are, not one of them has more gold in reserve than would meet the demands of those who have current accounts with them, and persons holding their paper have just as much chance of losing as those who have current accounts there, in the case of a run. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The States have had to come to their rescue three times already. has properly pointed out that whenever the private institutions failed, the Government, representing the people of the Commonwealth, would have to come to. their aid. Speaking generally, I should not hesitate to come to their aid in a case of that kind. But it is the bounden duty of the Common, wealth Parliament, and of the Government, in view of the powers possessed by it as representing the people, to put the whole of the currency on a sound basis before we start any ""other arrangements regarding banking or anything else. people to get by the change ? convenient Australian medium in the shape of a paper currency. vertible as the present notes arc. come to the Treasury, at Melbourne, to get gold for the notes. vertible at the Treasury.

But I should keep an eye on them, because it would be an evidence that they would not be above causing a rush on the Treasury to try to deplete its resources. A great deal of hostility arose in Queensland in this matter from the banks. They tried to defeat the Treasury note issue to begin with, notwithstanding the fact that the Queensland Parliament had come to the rescue of some of them. It is no breach of confidence for me to say that practically the whole of the banking institutions in Queensland are in favour of a Commonwealth note issue. I recently had the honour of a rather lengthy interview with the leading bankers of Australia, and it is no breach of confidence for me to say that, after a very long discussion, they offered no serious opthe position to the proposal which is to come before this Parliament. ister tell them what gold backing he proposed ? 25 per cent, at any time.

If the whole of the notes came in with a rush, the Government would then be able, within a reasonable time, to pay them all in gold. much like a loan. a loan that gives absolute security to the person holding the Commonwealth paper. The honourable member must admit that to begin with, and admit also that the Commonwealth will have the use of two-thirds of ihe money deposited with it in the meantime, and, by simply holding the credit of the Commonwealth in convertible paper, it will be absolutely certain that only such a catastrophe as the destruction of the Commonwealth by an earthquake could prevent people from receiving gold for the paper that they hold. surer will not let go of the notes, which are to be legal tender, unless he gets sovereigns for them? earlier that the banks would not get a single note until they came with a sovereign for it.

Thus, if there were an excess of issue of, say, £2,000,000 for some special circumstances, that £2,000,000 of notes would come in again when the emergency was over, and tiien the amount would return to its normal proportions. It would be just as well to hold the full amount of gold against the excess issue. Mr G. B.

May I remind honourable members that in Australia, as the It will be very honourable member for North Sydney, who has read up this subject, will know, there is no period during which there is a specially large demand for circulation. The largest excess at any period does not exceed 10 per cent, or 12 per cent. The position is different in tlie United States of America, where the demand for currency of any kind at one period is double what it is at another. When so much is said of the danger of a rush on our gold reserve, ancl the incapacity of Australia to meet a demand for gold, I feel constrained to ask where there is a country whicli is better able to meet such a demand. Here we have practically a production of over £1,000,000 worth of gold every month, and if one were able to see ahead only a month or two, one could make any reasonable* provision for an extraordinary rush or for any timidity on the part of the people.

206,Mr Fisher,"Al l the more credit toCommonwealth should be first. W«e hear nothing to-day of that charge. cause of the victory ? The honourable member knows better. the victory. Nothing was more unpopular at the time than the action taken by the Labour party, when in Opposition, in opposing the agreement. Only one metropolitan newspaper in this State thundered out its denunciation of the agreement, and the Commonwealth is indebted very largely to it for its attitude. I think that nearly every influenany compromise, and, therefore, we had to tial metropolitan newspaper in Australia thundered forth denunciations of our action with respect to the late Government's proposal, and never failed to point out the little disagreements and differences amongst us. Notwithstanding that, the national sentiment and the soundness of the position taken up by our party prevailed, and support was won by us, I am glad to say, even outside our own ranks. That being so, when I hear the principal spokesman for the agreement under which a payment of 25s. per capita was to be made annually to the States from the very date proposed by us, and was to continue until the Constitution was altered, asserting that our proposition is unreasonable, improper and almost illegal, I feel that he is not taking into careful consideration the language he is using. the six-months' period. The Government cannot get behind the Constitution, whicli says that the Braddon section shall continue to operate until the end of the present year. After that, they may do as they please. apprehension as to what I now say. The agreement entered into with the State Premiers allowed the Commonwealth Parliament to propose an amendment of the Constitution with respect to the payments under the Braddon section, and provided that the new arrangement should come into operation at the end of June last. agreement been accepted by the people, the Constitution would have been amended, and the proposed payment would have been legal. As it is, the Government's proposal will not be legal, because the Constitution remains unamended. object to the proposed per capita payment of 25s. per annum, but we did object to the agreement being embodied in the Constitution, so that a majority could not take it out again. That was the point at issue-, and the honourable member knows it. We said that, having regard to the voting at the previous general election, nine-tenths of the people might be in favour of removing the agreement from the Constitution, and yet would be unable to do so. We declared that we were prepared to sanction such a payment for a reasonable time, but the Government of the day would not listen to appeal to Csesar. Caesar, I am glad to say, has adopted our view. Will any injury be done to the States by our asking Parliament to pass a measure guaranteeing for ten years a return to the States on the same basis as was proposed in the agreement? good, so far as it goes. rous. We have stood by our promise to the very letter. Is it not a fact that many of the State Premiers, as.well as other advocates of the insertion of the agreement in the Constitution, declared that one. reason why they wished that to be done, as against our proposal, was that if it were placed in the Constitution it could be taken out again next year? On the other hand, we were told that if we fixed ten years we should be in honour bound to keep the agreement for that period. The present attitude of the Opposition is, in my opinion, most ungracious; but I think that when the Leader of the Opposition considers this matter, he will agree that if this Government is at fault, it is in the direction of generosity. I had expected the Leader of the Opposition to say a few words about the troublesome deficit come on afterwards. out that this deficit was a legacy from a previous Government. posed hacl been carried, there would have been no deficit. promise in regard to the £600,000 was rather an awkward part of the agreement.

' I can refer the Leader of the Opposition to statements made again and again to the effect that in placing the agreement in the Constitution we were only doing something that could be undone next year. alter the Constitution! we said, and that is the view we have held all along. In my opinion, to insert this agreement in the Constitution would have been eating into the very heart of our Federation. When it was sought to again amend the Constitution, it would have been necessary to fight every interest that had grown up under the agreement, and, as a matter of fact, an amendment would have been impossible without a mild revolution. I desire to correct an impression which may arise in the minds of honourable members, and of people outside, in regard to the action of the Government in respect to the States Governments. Some of the Premiers say that if the Commonwealth Government had taken them into its confidence, there would have been no difficulty in financing this difficult period. Let me relate the his own press lately? tory of the whole affair. As soon as we came into office, I publicly stated that I should be glad to .co-operate' with the States different news from that seen by the honPremiers, and meet them in conference,, if so desired. The Premier of Victoria saw me, and we talked over the terms, and, after seeing me on a second occasion, he went to Sydney, and had a conversation with the Premier of New South Wales. He informed me that the 17th June would be a convenient date for a Conference on the terms indicated. I pointed out that it would be most inconvenient for Commonwealth Ministers, but that we were willing to meet them. Nothing took place for a few days, until Mr Wade wrote stating that the tentative date was a most inconvenient time, and suggesting that the Commonwealth Government should outline their policy for the Premiers to consider, and that, if they thought fit, they would afterwards convene a Conference at which the matter could be discussed. On receipt of that letter, I stated briefly to the press that the policy of the Commonwealth Government would be first indicated to the Federal Parliament through the GovernorGeneralj and I regard that as a proper attitude to take up under the circumstances. Practically the same terms as those we are asking Parliament to endorse were put forward as a basis for the friendly Conference which I suggested j and I think that no terms could be more favorable or generous. I have reason to believe that even honourable members on my own side thought I had gone too far in order to conciliate the Premiers. I felt, however, that as the people had given us numbers and power, we could afford to be generous, and for that reason I was exceedingly anxious to meet the States. I had hoped that the Premiers would have stated their readiness to deal -with the present Government as fairly, as generously, as they had proposed to deal with our predecessors. ously with us-the y did what they thought was fair, but they certainly were not generous. expect the State Premiers to deal as fairly with this Government as with the late Government ? give this Government exactly the same terms they gave us-that is the trouble. member been reading the statements of his orable member.

We are at no greater disadvantage in this matter now that there is a deficit than they when there were surpluses. I compliment the Leader of the Opposition upon the absence of violent political antagonism from his remarks. May I express the hope that he will enjoy vigorous health, and be able to satisfactorily perform the duties of his office? It is thirty years since his parliamentary career commenced in this chamber. This is a long time. As for the Ministry, and the party behind it, we shall be glad to hear him and any of his supporters at any time. The most severe criticism regarding any measure we may submit to the House will be welcomed. sures outlined in the speech of His Excellency the Governor General, I wish to refer to the introductory paragraph informing Parliament of the great loss the nation has sustained by the lamented death of His late Majesty King Edward VII . Mother and the Royal Family in their sad bereavement. It seems strange that when expressing sorrow at the death of one Sovereign, we necessarily have to immediately afterwards offer our congratulations to the new Monarch. We all wish a long and beneficent reign to His Majesty King George. V., and We propose to borrow feel sure that he and his beloved Dominions beyond the 'Seas, of which Australia forms part.

It was a pleasure to one to listen to the speech of the Prime Minister; he was so fair spoken, and so full of good sentiments. He seemed to wish to please every one, and to pay compliments to all. Remembering his attitude a few months back, it is difficult to believe that he is the same man as we knew leading the late Opposition. I hope that a similar change has operated in his first lieutenant, and that the Attorney-General will give up his pretences at ill-temper and vituperation to which we are so much accustomed.

263,Sir John Forrest (Swan) [5.46].,"member of a Government during a considerable portion of my parliamentary life,' and am therefore more accustomed to defend administrative action than to attack Ministries. I felt, when in Opposition for two or three years, some little while ago, that I have not the same aptitude for attack as I seem to have for defence. It is indeed easier, in some respects, to defend than to attack, because a Minister is always able to possess himself of the exact facts of a case under discussion. But, while the Opposition will not find fault unnecessarily, I do not think it part of my duty to compliment Ministers on anything they have done. I am here to criticise the Government, when I think that it is not managing the affairs of the country in a straightforward and proper way. During the .last fortnight I have constantly noticed reports in the press of interviews with the Treasurer, in which he speaks about the deficit inherited from his predecessor, and apparently wishes to make it appear that, during the two months, for which he has held office it has been considerably reduced. However clever the honourable gentleman may be, it is impossible that anything he might have done could have reduced the deficit. Had the late Government continued in office, the result would have been the same. We knew before the last House was dissolved that the Postal and Customs revenue was increasing, and I made a speech informing the country that, taking into consideration £600,000 which we expected to get should the Financial Agreement be carried, there would be a deficit of only £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 . Mr G. B. EDWAKDS -The mistake which the right honourable member made was in under-estimating the deficit of his successor. under-estimate it. Every honest Treasurer tries to make as true an estimate as is possible. He estimates the revenue at what he thinks it will be. our revenue at the amount which we thought we should receive. Australian conditions have, improved since then, and, as a consequence, the revenue from Customs and Excise, and from Postal, Telegraphic, and Telephonic services has increased beyond the estimate, so that the deficit is now lower than we thought it would be. There has been a further saving of which I do not approve, though I cannot hold the present Government responsible for it ; I refer to the saving due to the holding back of votes which should have been expended on works and buildings authorized by Parliament. The Fisher Government has had no more to do with the present condition of the public funds than have you, Mr Speaker, or any other honourable member; therefore, I do not know why the Prime Minister should have so much to say to the newspaper reporters about the reduction of the deficit. The honourable gentleman almost disarms criticism by his readiness to do what may be right should there be a doubt as to the legality of the action regarding the Trust Funds. In my opinion, without question he has done wrong, and the sooner he rectifies it the better. He seems to have no regard for law or Constitution, and to think that, because he has a majority behind him, he may dip his hands into the Trust Funds. Surely the Labour members are not like dumb driven cattle, to do what they are told, and to remain silent when the Constitution is being violated ! Ministers have been impeached for less than the Treasurer has done in laying hands on Trust Funds despite the express prohibition of the law. Apparently, while he has a silent and subservient majority, he does not care what he does. Section 61 of the Audit Act 1901 saysI t shall not be lawful for the Treasurer to expend any moneys standing to the credit' of the Trust Fund except for the purposes of such fund or under the authority of an Act. taken money from the Trust Funds? so. fications. What has been done has been a mere adjustment by the Treasury officials. the kind. Current revenue adjustments have nothing to do with the taking of money from Trust Funds. Section 87 of die ConWe estimated stitution provides that the Commonwealth' shall not spend more than one-fourth, ancl that the remaining three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue must go to the States. That has to be adjusted at the end of each financial year, and in this large territory it cannot be arranged to a pound or two at the end of the year. It takes a week or two afterwards to absolutely adjust the current accounts, but it is simply an adjustment, as the revenue is there, and there is no deficit.

Sometimes it is a matter of only two or three thousand pounds. orable member make the adjustment? have to be closed at the end of June, and the adjustment was made in July. ing of that adjustment has nothing to do with the Trust Funds. able member say that there was ever any moment of practical time when there was a deficit of £37,000 odd in those particular Trust Funds? Minister said there was. There is no doubt whatever that he had no right to touch one penny of the Trust Funds. charge which I bring against the Treasurer and the Government is that they have spent £406,000 of money that, by the law of the Constitution, belonged to the States. I saw, with surprise, that the Prime Minister told die Premier of Queensland that the Commonwealth had not touched a penny of"" the States' money. If so, the money must be there. Why, then, have not the Government returned to the States their three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue ? the States' money. belonged to the States. The Government have taken a part of the States' three-, fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to the extent of ,£406,000, by the Prime Minister's own admission. In doing so they have broken the Constitution. It must have been broken, or that money would have been there to return to the States. The Commonwealth Government have no power to touch any of the States' three-quarters of the Customs and Excise revenue. All that they can expend is the Commonwealth's one-quarter. Section 87 of the Constitution saysOf the net revenue of the Commonwealth will find in the greater part of the Speech from duties of Customs and Excise, not more anything that is important in the sense of than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. If the Commonwealth Government have not applied more than one-fourth towards their expenditure, the remaining three-fourths should be there to give to the States. Where, then, is that amount of £406,000? It has been spent by the Commonwealth in addition to the one-fourth. Any one can see that. Therefore, not only has the Prime Minister spent money belonging to the Trust Funds illegally, without authority, and contrary to the express terms of the Statute, but he has also violated the Constitution by expending more than one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue for Commonwealth purposes. ments is in accordance with fact. able member has no right to say that. I know more about the matter than he does, and his assertion is utterly wrong. The honourable member need not think that ignorant bluster can controvert me. I know too much about the question, having been Treasurer for years. To show that the Prime Minister has clone wrong, he intends The second now to bring in a Bill to authorize him to use money standing to the credit of the Trust Funds, and to pay the States what he has illegally taken from them. Where is the £406,000 which has not been paid to the States? It has been illegally spent by the Commonwealth, contrary to the terms of the Constitution. spent. able member will have ample opportunity to reply when the right honourable member for Swan has spoken. through the Speech, and, with the exception of two or three paragraphs, nearly the whole of it might have appeared in any Speech made at the present time, seeing that the matters dealt with are all in course of being carried out. The last fifteen paragraphs relate to questions tiiat have already been before us, or that, at any rate, we know all about. They may serve very well to fill up the Speech.

282,Sir John Forrest,"I have readnew ? we were going to bring in penny postage for each State in Australia, and I understand that that is what the Government propose. The result of the election has been referred to by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I shall say no more than that the election has turned parties upside down.. It has put us where the Labour party were, and put them where we were. When they remember how they acted when they were on this side; how much noise, and how many long speeches they made; and how much obstruction they practised, and how ill-tempered they were, they should be pleased to know that we do not intend to follow any. tactics of that sort. There is a general impression abroadI do not know whether it obtains in this House, but I should hardly think so, because honourable members should be in closer touch with the real facts than are the bulk of the people outside-that the vervoted for the Financial Agreement. dict of the country has been overwhelmingly in favour of the Labour party. certainly had the effect of giving them a majority in both Houses, but I submit that it .was not so much in their favour as, some think. I remember a very good admonition in the good Book, to this effect: "" Let him who thinketh he standeth take heed Test he f a l l . "" With a very small swing of die pendulum the position of advantage gained by honourable members opposite may easily be changed. I hope, therefore, that they will not indulge in any bluster or undue arrogance, because they have not much to boast about when all is told. I find from these figures, which have already been published, that the Labour party in this Parliament represent only 30 per cent, of the electors. Only 673,697 voted for them, while 1,584,785 either voted against them, or did not vote at all. The Labour party in this Parliament are, therefore, representative of only 30 per cent, of those on the roll. One good feature about the position, of which I am sure that all of us on this side are glad, is that in the past we have always suffered through the promises made by the Labour party, which they have not had an opportunity of carrying out. Many reckless and unscrupulous people, when they know that they have no chance of carrying out a promise, are not so particular how much they do promise. That difference is often noticed between men not likely to be, or not expecting to be, in power and those having, or expecting to have, power and responsibility. The Labour Opposition promised all sorts of things, but thought they would never be called upon to carry out their promises. They have now an opportunity of doing so, and we shall see how they fulfil the task in the next two or three years. The Prime Minister referred to what the Financial Agreement meant, and what it did not mean, but if he had been in Western Australia, and heard his own party defining it, he would not have understood what were the real views of the Labour party. They said that there was no difference between the proposals of the two parties; that the Brisbane proposal was better even than our own; and the Gympie proposal better than both. They said anything, except where the forces were too even, and in those cases they declared themselves in favour of the agreement as it sto6d. Honourable members who have looked at the returns know that a great many of the Labour party The agreement, after all, was lost by a It has very small majority. Three States were in favour of it and three against it ; and although 1,316,352 votes were recorded, it was lost by only 25,324. We recognise that the majority must rule, but it may reasonably be said that there was only a bare majority against the agreement. We accept the result of the referendum as the decision of the people, although practically one-half of the electors of Australia who voted favoured the proposals of the then Government, while 854,506 electors did not take the trouble to vote at all. In the circumstances, it is idle for honourable members of the Labour party to ride the high horse, and to say that the country at the last general election was wholly in favour of their policy. On the Financial Agreement there was almost a drawn battle between the two parties, and 854,506 looked on and did not vote. had been on the other side, what would have been said by the present Opposition? cision would have had to be accepted by the Labour party, just as we have had to accept the actual result, as the verdict of the whole people, though it is not, as only 670,838 out of the 2,258,482 on the roll voted for it.

286,Sir John Forrest,"Such a deGovernor-General's speech, with respect to the payment to the States, was in accordance with that for which the Labour party had always contended. I have before me, however, certain quotations from letters written by a member of the present Government which tell a different tale. refer to letters written by an honourable senator who held office in the last Labour Administration, ahd who is to-day Minister of Defence. I invite honourable members to bear in mind that these quotations are taken, not from the report of a speech made by the honourable senator-if they were, it might be said that he had been misreported-bu t from two letters addressed by Senator Pearce to the editor of the West Australian, on the 22nd and 25th February last. who was then the leader of his party in that State, and who is looked upon as the guide of his party in Western Australia, wrote in the first letter, dated 22 nd FebruaryT. might be allowed to say that when Senator de Largie moved in the Senate last session to limit the present agreement to 25 years he had the votes of every Labour senator, so that though there is no time stated in the Brisbane Conference scheme, that warrants me in saying that in any Act passed to determine the question the Federal Labour party would be prepared to give it a currency of that length of time.

As to the result of the referendum with respect to the consolidation of the State debts, no one party can take any credit for it. 1 advocated the consolidation of the State debts, and voted for the* proposed amendment of the Constitution with respect to them, just as I voted for the Financial Agreement. The credit for the result of that referendum I must be shared by all parties. I come now to die question of old-age pensions, and invite the House to note the difference between the attitude of the Labour party to. day and that whicli it assumed a few months ago. When I , as Treasurer, had charge of a small Bill designed to liberalize the Old-age Pensions Act, I was met by the full force of the Labour party, who desired to reduce to sixty years the age at which a man might become entitled to a pension. member is in error. The Labour party, on the motion of the member for Wide Bay, now Prime Minister, desired to reduce the age iii the case of women to fifty-five years, and in the case of men to sixty years. The honourable member forgets what he did. for. able member was present when the division took place, he must have voted to reduce to sixty years the age at which men might become entitled to a pension. I told the Labour party then that if that proposal were pressed I should be compelled to abanrevenue of the Commonwealth a greater demand than it could bear. They did their best, however, to embarrass the Government. They simply desired, for their own political purposes, to place us in a monetary difficulty, although they say now that they did no such thing.

297,Sir John Forrest,"Land in thehave not done as well as is desired with their property. The land taxation proposals of the Government are unscientific, and are based on a wrong principle. I do not object to the compulsory improvement of land, but I have always said that a man has a right to hold that which he has lawfully obtained-that no one should be able to take jit from him; but that if the State requires land so obtained in order to improve the conditions of the State generally the Government should buy it from him. I see no harm in that. It is a fair stand .to take up. It is fair for the State to say to a man, "" As you obtained your land under the law, so' you must sell it under the law."" But to tax a man's land for the express purpose of depreciating its value-of reducing, perhaps, the value which he _ has actually paid-is lutely immoral; it is robbery. Such a proposal is not open to logical discussion. on the part of the Government, is an invasion of the constitutional rights of the States. It is an attempt to do indirectly that which they could not do directly. 1 admit that closer settlement, especially along railways, is desirable, and should be encouraged, but let that encouragement be extended in a direct and straightforward manner. Let the object of this Bill be clearly stated in the preamble. I ask the Attorney-General whether that . will be done. I am sure that it will not. It will be left to the people to infer the object of the Bill. The honK orable gentleman will allow the people to talk about the object; he has told us himself that the object of the Bill is to burst up estates, but he will not dare to state that object in the Bill If the Prime Minister wishes to act straightforwardly, as he is so continually posing in this House, let him say that the Bill is introduced for the purposes of closer settlement, and further occupying and improving . the lands of Australia. The Prime Minister will not do that, because he knows that, if he inserts those purposes, the measure is not worth the paper it is written on. He introduces a measure ostensibly with one object, but really with another. Sitting suspended frvm 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. another matter which is closely associated Tax Bill is not revenue, but the bursting up with the question of the land tax, and which of large estates. is set forth in the following paragraph of the Governor General's Speech :"" In view of the urgent necessity for encourag' ing an influx of suitable immigrants to the Commonwealth in order to more effectively develop its great resources and defend it against possible invasion, My Advisers intend to adopt a policy which it is confidently believed will, by making fertile land available, speedily induce very large numbers of people of the right kind to settle on the lands of the Commonwealth. That is a -very well-constructed paragraph, and it meets with my entire approval so far as it sets forth the desirability of adopting a policy which will make "" fertile land available "".and induce "" large numbers of people of the right kind "" to settle in this country; but as one who knows something ot the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, its meaning is difficult to understand. I suppose that not only the .Goabso vernment, but all members of the House, : know very well that the Commonwealth Constitution was framed by the States, givBut besides, this proposition, ing up certain of their powers to the central authority. The States, before Federation, were practically sovereign States, leaving out the Royal veto and the British Parliament There was one power, however,, that the States did not transfer; that is, they never gave the Commonwealth any power over the lands of the country. wealth a general power of taxation. orable member think' that I am not aware of that fact? The only power in regard to land which was given to the Commonwealth was to take an area in New South Wales for the purposes of a Federal capital, but even that had to be granted by the State or acquired by the centralpower. The Commonwealth does itself. not own an inch of land, so that if it desires to erect a post-office or a drill shed, it has to buy the land, either from a State or some private individual. There is no power given to the Commonwealth to interfere with the sale, occupation, or development of the land; and if this Parliament passes a law with any such object as that indicated in the paragraph, that law will not be worth the paper it is written on. There is power given to the Commonwealth to impose taxation for revenue purposes.

How is the Commonwealth going td make "" fertile land available"" so as to ""speedily induce very large numbers of the right kind to settle on the lands of the Commonwealth?"" Is it proposed to purchase the land ? So far as I can see, the Commonwealth cannot buy the land except for public purposes, and I question whether land for the purposes of settlement can be regarded as for a "" public purpose "" under the Constitution. According to the Prime Minister this is one of tbe most important paragraphs in the Governor General's Speech; but he has not told us how effect is to be given to it. Then, what are "" people of the right kind "" ? against the honourable gentleman. years endeavours to induce people to vote against me have been made by the Labour party, but on each occasion my majority increases. The Government do not tell us how they propose to settle the people on the land, or when they propose to start. As I have said, the Commonwealth does not possess an acre of land, and is not likely to do so unless the Constitution be changed. thern Territorv! that immigrants who belong to the Labour party will care to go there; and altogether the proposal of the Government'' is rather too much to ask this deliberative assembly or the people of Australia to swallow. orable member say that the proposed land tax is not legal ? that a land tax is illegal, but for the object violate the Constitution to injure them. Noset forth it is thoroughly illegal. The Government say that, while they have no land of their own, they may succeed in bursting up some of the big estates, and thus make land available. They seem to forget, however, that when these estates are burst up the lands will remain under the control of the States. It is in the Governments of the [6]2 States that the land of Australia is vested. It is they who have the disposition of it, and the ability to facilitate occupation. No doubt the Commonwealth could arrange with them for the increased settlement of the country by means of immigration. The Deakin Government offered to bring immigrants from the Old Country, and to land them at the principal ports of Australia free of charge, if the Governments of the States would promise to give them land, or to look after them on arrival, but the offei was not accepted. Statements such as that which I have read should not be put into' print. It is a gross misrepresentation to say that the Government will put people on the fertile lands of the country, sc-eing that the Commonwealth has not control of the lands of Australia, and under the Constitution is powerless to make them available for settlement. In Western Australia, where there are but few large estates, the bursting-up of large estates by means of a land tax has been advocated ad nauseam by the Labour party. Those who advocated it seemed to think that the Commonwealth has power under the Constitution to impose a tax with that object. They seem to be unaware that a tax with that avowed as its object could not be imposed. They know that the whole business is a dishonest one. An attempt is being made to bring about by a side wind what cannot be done directly. orable member to withdraw what he said. the remark, if you desire me to do so, sir ; but it was not applied to members of this House, and I referred to political, not to personal, dishonesty. member must not impute improper motives to other honourable members. rule does not apply to those outside the Chamber!

But why should they say that what is good for them is not good for others? I do not wish to impute motives, but there are those who, when addressing an audience believed to have nothing, are willing to gain a temporary success by suggesting that the possessions of others should be taken from them. member has always acted on that principle. honourable gentleman mean ? member was in Opposition before, he was not happy until he had shifted the Labour Ministry then in power. isters had not a majority to support them.

I would, do again what I did then; but I would not act unfairly. member cannot do again what he did then. gentleman thinks that he is on a hill now, and can afford to gibe. The paragraph to which I refer is most misleading, because it holds out hope which cannot be fulfilled unless the Constitution is altered. I come now to a matter which affects Western Australia more intimately than do many of the other measures in the Government programme-the paragraph which refers to the construction of a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. That paragraph is as vague as it can be. . Ministers merely say that they are taking all necessary preliminary steps towards the construction of the line. What preliminary Steps are they taking? Have they taken any ? honourable gentleman, when he speaks, will tell us what they are ? has been put down. by the Government of Western Australia. The route had been surveyed, and the plans of the survey were ready just before the prorogation. It has been said by leading members of this wonderful party, which is always in the right, and ready to attribute bad motives to every one who is against them, that last session I ought to have seen to the passing of a measure authorizing the construction of the line. It has been said, too, that when the Right Honourable Sir George Reid was in power with a majority of only one-the late member for WilmotI should .have availed myself of the opportunity to coerce him into doing what was wanted. Those'who think that I am a man of that sort have a very low opinion of me. It might be politics to coerce one's leader and colleagues when in a difficulty. Such conduct is contrary to the course which I have mapped out for myself. I have been charged by members of this wonderful, omniscient party, which never does anything wrong, with not having done what I could at the end of last session to pass a measure authorizing the construction of the line. Any misrepresentation seems to some permissible at election times. Senators who know me well, with whom. I have worked for years, and against whom T Have not said a word, never even mentioning their names, told the electors that I had done less for this project that any other man in either House of this Parliament, and that the line had not been sanctioned because of my inaction. That is the sort of treatment to which I am expected to submit quietly. I have never said anything during election times against any member of the Labour party, and I do not intend to say anything against any one now. WhatI wish to know is what preliminary steps have been taken by this Government for the construction of the line. The people throughout Western Australia were told that if they returned the honourable member for Ballarat and his supporters to power, the line would never be made, but that if the Labour party won, it would be made. I am willing to assist the Government in constructing this line. Seeing that the Labour party got votes all over Australia, by promising to make the line, it is its duty to give effect to its promise. Candidates for Parliament should not promise to do certain things if they cannot do them. It would be better to say', "" We shall do our best."" But, seeing that the honourable members representing Western Australia have made promises in regard to this matter, they ought to redeem them. I do not suggest that they should put their colleagues in a difficulty, or do what is unfair, but as telegrams stating that the Labour party were in favour of the construction of the line were despatched to all parts of Western Australia, and as the people were led to believe that if the",42,Forrest Wha T About The Will Wish To Say A Few Words But The Go

Like the Leader of the Opposition, I regret very much that the Government has not done anything towards reintroducing an Agricultural Bureau Bill.

An Agricultural Bureau .Bill was introduced last session; and if the late Government had been returned to power, it would have been speedily passed. According to the vague reference in the Speech, immigration, I understand, depends on land being made available; and this absolutely fails to meet the great needs and requirements of the Commonwealth. The question of immigration is absolutely the most important . thatthis Parliament could be called upon to deal with. Without more people to occupy our vast spaces, and develop our resources in every conceivable way, we canhot expect to build up a great nation or be in a position to defend ourselves if the teeming mil-lions of Asiatics feel disposed to invade and annex the country. fore !' iterated by every honourable member. In 1900 the population of the Commonwealth was 3,765,000, while in 1910 it is 4,335,000, an increase during the period of Federation of 570,000. In Canada, in 1901, the population was 5,371,315, as compared with a population of 8,000,000 this year. In Australia we have an area of 3,000,000, while Canada has an area of 3,619,000 square miles. The total production of Canada is about £200,000,000, as against £164,000,000 for the Commonwealth, Canada showing something like £ 2 5 per head, and the Commonwealth £ 3 9 per head. The export trade of Australia is larger than, that of Canada, being £70,000,000, as against £50,000,000, and yet Canada has been advancing in the way of population for several years by immi-. gration at a rate of something like 200,000 per year, compared with an increase in -Australia last year of about 28,000. This, is a deplorable state of affairs, favoured as we have been since 1902 with a prosperity unparalleled in the history of the country. Of all the nations on earth Australia requires population, not only for defence; and yet we have this slow rate of increase. the increase is the natural increase. of immigration. ment give land, do they not? admit that the State Governments in Australia have been dilatory in making land available.

In Queensland, I understand, there are lands which can be, and are being, made available very rapidly. In New South Wales the Government have repurchased a good many estates, while in Victoria, I am pleased to note, the Government are awakening to a sense of their responsibility.

According to the Official Year Book for 1908, if Australia continues' to increase in population at the present rate for the next -forty years, there will be less than 8,000,000 people in 1950. We are thus giving the Chinese and Japanese nations forty years to. equip themselves to annex this great Australian prize, and even then they will have to face a population of less than 8,000,000. This is a serious state of affairs which should awaken the Commonwealth Government-whic h has the administration for the next three years-to a sense of their responsibility. .member's opinion of the terrible industrial .law suggested? offer an opinion on the question at the present time. I am quite conscious of the fact that in several of the older countries of the world, the central Parliaments have legislative control over all industrial matters ; and I am willing to admit that it is necessary that the Commonwealth should .have certain appellant and final control. I .am not satisfied so far, however, that, the proposal of the Government will prove, any better than that of the late Government for ah Inter-State Commission. This Commission would have given the Federal body control over all industrial legislative matters, and resulted in harmonizing wages and industrial conditions throughout the States; and this would have been carrying out what may be called a true Federal .function. I am not amongst those who regard the Constitution as some sacred parchment that must not be amended. As a matter of fact, there is provision made in the Constitution itself for amendment if it be necessary -to carry legislation to the greatest advantage. In my opinion, there are directions in which the Constitution might be, and should be, amended in the near future. For instance, the railways throughout Australia are controlled by the States, and cannot be touched by the Commonwealth without the consent of the States. I represent a constituency which runs for 200 or 300 miles along the border between New South Wales and Victoria; and I know the difficulty there is in coming to anything like a proper agreement as to the distribution of the waters of the great river. . I should be prepared to "" support any amendment which would give the Commonwealth the control of the waters of the Murray. Then great difficulties exist on the borders between two States in respect of railway construction. On the New South Wales side, for example, we have railways running down within easy distance of the Murray, and stopping at a certain point, in order that traffic may be diverted into the capital of that State. We have also two States-namely , South Australia and Victoria-discussin g the question of whether they ought not to be linked up by certain railways which run near to their border, because such a course of action might possibly permit of the produce of the primary producer being taken-as it ought to be taken-to the nearest seaport. I believe , that when our Constitution was framed by the Federal Convention, it was well understood that certain amendments would require to be made in it before it could be perfected, and before it could be made to meet the requirements and aspirations of the Australian people. I shall exercise my right to vote in accordance with my convictions upon any measures which ma'y be introduced by the Government, regardless of the fact that I am sitting in opposition to them. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (North Sydney) [ '57-]--; 1 think that a debate upon the 8 motion for the adoption of the Address-inReply to the Governor General's.

373,Mr Sampson,"I am not going torather than otherwise. Personally, I am rather disposed to deprecate references to ""old battles long ago."" I prefer to look forward to the duties that immediately confront us, with a view to seeing how far we, as an Opposition^ can cooperate with Ministerial supporters in doing something to promote the best interests of Australia. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth we have an opportunity of accomplishing something. Irrespective of whether those who now occupy the Treasury benches be friends or foes, they certainly have the right to claim that, for the first time in our Federal history, we have a really responsible Government in office. All previous Ministries have been representative of only about one-third of the strength of the House, and, consequently, have had to depend upon the support of some other party for their continuance in office. affected not only the measures which they put before the House, but also the passage of those measures ""through it. Up till the present time we have not had anything in the nature of truly responsible government since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. So far, I welcome the change because of what it may give to us in the future. Whether the present occupants of the Treasury benches will be able to retain office for a sufficient time to enable them to give effect to their proposals, may be a matter of doubt. Personally, I believe that, though they possess the strength of a giant, they will use it with discretion. Stuart Mill, in his celebrated book on 'Representative Government, saysThose who are supreme over everything, whether public platform apprehended that it would they be one, or few, or many, have no longer need of the arms of reason. They can make their mere will prevail, and those who cannot be resisted are usually far too well satisfied with their own opinions to be willing to change them or to listen without impatience to any who tell them they are in the wrong. That is the position of the occupants of the Treasury benches. They constitute an overwhelming majority of the House, and they have all sorts of proposals, which, at present, are in a more or less nebulous condition, to put before it. But we, who are inclined to go more slowly than they, need not apprehend the submission of any very revolutionary measures. Our friends are naturally jealous of the honour of their positions, of the power which they are enabled to exercise, and of the kudos appertaining to political life. They have one price to pay for the continuance of the possession of Mr G. B. Edwards. the Treasury benches. That price is moderation and caution, and I am inclined to far off unhappy things and think that they are prepared to pay it, and that, consequently, they will remain upon those benches for a considerable time.. Upon their part, honourable members on this side of the House will loyally follow our leader, but will indulge in no factious opposition. I do not think that I can be charged with ever having offered factious opposition to any Government when I was formerly a member of this House. I was prepared to accord reasonable support to a Ministry with whom I disagreed whenever I felt that they were acting in the best interests of Australia. I can promise the Government a willing support upon all occasions upon which I can follow them, but when I differ from them they must expect honest, fearless criticism from me. I disagree with my leader regarding the nature of the speech which has been placed before That circumstance prejudicially us by the Governor General. To me that deliverance appears to be quite as full and explicit as any Vice-Regal utterance framed by the honourable member for Ballarat, or by any Government which has held office since the inception of the Federation. Vice-Regal speeches are merely intended as an index to the measures which will come before Parliament, and the speech which was delivered by His Excellency last week contained quite as much detail as we had a right to expect: Moreover, I congratulate the Ministry upon having laid down in that speech a programme which is an ample justification of John their promises to fhe electors during the recent campaign. It contains all that we who followed their deliverancesfrom the contain, whilst it does not include anything which we did not expect to find there. Consequently, I compliment the. Government upon their evident desire to carry out their pledges to the electors. How far I agree with the policy which they have put forward is quite another matter. There was just one point which I could not help noticing in connection with the Vice-Regal utterance, because it has been a subject of mystification to me. So far as I am aware, all other Vice-Regal speeches have contained paragraphs-which were specially addressed to the members of this House. Of course, the bulk of these deliverances is directed to the members of the Parliament, but, nevertheless, two or three paragraphs have always been specifically addressed to the members of the House of Representatives. This is a matter to which I may specially call your attention, sir, as the custodian of the rights of honourable members, because I think that inquiry should be made as to the reason why this practice has been departed from, in view of the possibility of constitutional developments. since we discarded that oractice. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I know of no reason why it should have been dropped, and I think it was unwise to drop it. Section 53 of our Constitution provides that measures appropriating revenues or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not be originated in the Senate. Further, it declares that the other branch of the Legislature may not amend such measures, and it adds that "" Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have, equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws."" That section declares that under the Constitution this House possesses rights and privileges in dealing with matters of finance, of the imposition of taxation, and of the appropriation of moneys, which do not belong to the Senate. I do not know why the practice which was formerly followed has been departed from. It seems to me that this House should very jealously guard its powers and privileges, in view of the circumstance that, as yet,, we have had no serious disagreement with the other branch of the Legislature in respect of legislation. But, sooner or later, such a disagreement must come. Consequently, we. cannot be too careful in safeguarding the rights and privileges which the Constitution has conferred upon us. I do not intend to indulge in details regarding the results of the recent elections, or to offer .any explanation of why the party with which I am associated was defeated at the polls. To do so would be merely to beat the wind. But, irrespective of whether an honourable member sits upon the Opposition or the .Ministerial side of the Chamber, I say that if he is conscientious and desirous of giving to the people that absolute control over elections which they ought to possess, he is bound to consider, in connection with any amendment of our electoral law, some new system of voting which will enable the views of the electors to be more readily expressed, so that we may obtain a more honest representation. I am not now alluding to the disparity between the size of various electorates, or to the fact that one honourable member may represent 20,000 voters whilst another may represent 30,000 or 40,000. I am referring more particularly to the system of voting. When the principal Electoral Act was. submitted to this Parliament, I recollect that discussions took place in both Houses upon the question of whether or not we should adopt the preferential-voting system, the contingent vote, or proportional representation. There were full-dress debates in both Houses, but the result was that the Bill merely provided for the old-fashioned system of a simple majority. ber supported the block-vote system. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I was always in favour of proportional representation. member voted for the block system. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I do not think that a vote was taken upon it. Ii ansard. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I recollect that the honourable member for Angas spoke strongly in favour of the system of proportional representation' which had been tried in Tasmania, and that that system was also warmly supported by the late Sir Edward Braddon. However, we could not secure proportional representation, and the system proposed left us the privilege of plumping, to which I was opposed. Consequently, I had to vote for the lesser of two evils. But I am not here to fight old battles over again. I am here to point out what I think are the defects of the present system, and, further, to state that since that time, there has-been a development of what we know as the machine in politics. Not only has the Labour party further developed its political mechanism, selecting its candidates, but the party I belong to also does the same thing now. I am not speaking for my own side alone. I do hope that honourable members will not be influenced by the fact that a sitting member may get an advantage out of the present situation, but will look at the matter in the light of justice to the electors, and not to themselves. If a candidate is not a sitting member, or even if he is a sitting member, in some cases, he has to run the ordeal of selection by some form of voting, more or less complicated, perhaps, first by his party supporters, and subsequently by election. I had to go through these two ordeals. canter. Mr G. B.

It subjects every man to two elections; the first of them is not governed by any law whatever, and may be manipulated. being amateurs on the honourable member's side. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I am not making these remarks about my own side only. There are honourable members on the other side who had to meet the same demand, and there are candidates on both sides who experienced the same thing with the utmost dissatisfaction. We ought to alter this system. If , under the necessities of the Constitution, we cannot get any. system of proportional voting, because the difficulties are very great, for we have to alter our electorates frequently by reason of the varying demands of the population, at least we can get, in this session, an alteration in favour of a preferential voting system, which would enable as many candidates as liked to stand on either side, and not prejudice the chance of any political party by reason of the accidental number of its candidates. Whether your party is successful or not, you could hope to have a fair run, as the sportsman says, for your money. Each side should have a fair run, and the best side should win. But, under the present system, the best side will not win, if it should happen to have two candidates in the field. The' feeling throughout Australia, taking it by and large, is pretty evenly divided, and if. one side is represented by two candidates, and the other side by only one, it is a hundred to one chance that the latter will win. there ? Mr G. B. EDWARDS -There were several cases in New South Wales, and, I think, there must have been others elsewhere. In any case, the system ought to be altered, as it is manifestly unfair and unjust. We should give a fair field to the candidates to poll in the order of their constituents' liking. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to the developments which have resulted from the advent of the Labour party to power, that is, in the directalce control of £250,000,000 worth tion of the caucus defining the policy of the Government, and electing its members. I hope that this introduction of the electoral principle in appointing Ministers may be carried one step further. If that were done, and the election conducted in the House in the open light of day, and with the press represented, and both sides taking part, I should welcome the change which has been made by the Labour party, as the beginning of a reform fraught with the greatest good to the development of the Commonwealth. Buti f the system is to continue, and to be adopted by other parties, of selecting Ministers by election in a cellar or caucus room, it must be fraught with evil in the form of an arrested development. Anything which is done behind the scenes is not likely to give the best results. Moreover, it is, viewed from my stand-point, a deprivation of the liberties of this side of the House. the honourable member think his side would have got into the Ministryi f that system had.been in vogue? Mr G. B. EDWARDS I think that the division of opinion on the other side must have been pretty equal in regard to some of the Ministerial appointments. If this side of the House had had a say in those elections, in the open light of day, we might have helped the better men on the Ministerial side to make a choice, in one or two. instances, which would have been more acceptable to the nation, and more beneficial to the Government. I hope that that reform will be achieved, and if what I consider the ill practice on the part of my honourable friends on this occasion leads to the fuller reform, I , at any rate, shall be thankful for it. With regard to one of the measures foreshadowed in the Governor General's Speech, I find myself at variance with honourable members on my own side, and more in accord with the occupants of the Treasury benches.' When the Prime Minister was speaking this afternoon with regard to the Governmental control of the paper currency-that is, the issue of notessome of my interjections must have led honourable members to understand that I support that proposal; indeed, I have advocated it for many years. I see no danger or difficulty, provided that the issue be severely limited, placed under proper control, and made sufficiently elastic to meet the demands of commerce. I think that a nation which is honest enough to be able to of debts to creditors all over the world,may be safely trusted with £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 worth of paper money. I hold that a Government which carries on such a business as this as honestly as it has been carried on in the past, may be safely trusted, with due checks by a critical Opposition, to have control of",52,Forrest Wha T About The Will Wish To Say A Few Words But The Go

381,Mr Hall,"Ho w many Ministers doesa paper currency of the fullest magnitude required by the States. I believe that the -demand -for paper currency in Australia is really much greater than the figures show. I do not know of any country in the world where private cheques are so much used as they are in Australia. In other parts of the world it is a rare thing to see a private individual presenting a cheque to almost an utter stranger, but here you will see that happening every day. in London, too. MrG B. EDWARDS -The manner in which this form of paper currency passes from hand to hand in Australia is really appalling. I often wonder that there is so much trust ex-, hibited between men when one man knows so little of the other. I think that with a system of Government' notes, a great many of these cheques will not be issued. I believe that a* system of Government paper currency will give us all that we require, and lead to less possible chance of fraud than we have at present. argued by some of the opponents of the Government proposal that the present system of currency provided by the banks is entirely satisfactory and eminently safe, and that we should not seek to alter it in any way. It may be satisfactoryI believe it is. But that it is eminently safe I deny. On three conspicuous nrrasion.s it has failed, and the State has had to step in and defend the banks' notes. By merely guaranteeing the notes, it enabled people to accept them and pass them from one to another. Directly after the issue of a proclamation by the Dibbs Government in New South Wales, protecting the .notes of two or three of the banks, notes whicli had been selling a day or two previously for 16s., 17s., and 18s. each, immediately rose again to the value of 20sSo long as you have an honest Government, so long as you have the ordinary safeguard of a sufficient reserve in gold to meet any demand made on the Treasury to convert the notes, and so long as you do not force them on the public, but only give them as the Government propose to do, in such number as they may be demanded, there is no reason for apprehension. Further, if you increase the issue beyond what is considered a safe' amount, you should hold pound for pound on the surplus that is issued to meet the sudden expansion required by what is called the moving of crops, or any great demand of business. Say that a limit of £5,000,000 is considered safe. Then we empower the Treasurer, with the co-operation of certain Commissioners who will work with him,, to issue ,£5,000,000 worth of notes, and to hold his reserve of 25 or 30 per cent, in gold as against the notes. And if for any reason the Commissioners find it desirable to issue 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 more notes, he must hold £1,""ooo,000 or £2,000,000 in reserve, because that amount is issued in excess, and intended to be withdrawn at the moment that the need for the expansion of the paper currency declines, and it is time to retire the extra issue of papci. JL see 110 chance of any wrong happening. ' I hold that the Government should exercise all the powers it has under the Constitution, and one of these powers is the complete control of the currency. I contend that that' power was taken with the intention on the part of the framers of the Constitutionmany of whom were able, experienced business men-that the Government should sooner or later make use of it. Some ot the banks will suffer to a small extent from the It has been proposed change. Many of them will not suffer at all. Some of them have told me that they would welcome the change, as it would relieve them of some troublesome operations. Other banks whicli lock up their own notes in far-away branches in various parts of the continent, not issuing them until suchtime as there is a local demand for money, and only then paying the tax, would no doubt lose by the change. But in dealing with questions of public expediency, or the necessities of private individuals, even ""in dealing with questions of absolute safety, we cannot afford to be influenced by such considerations. All the critics argue as though they were the only, persons who were striving for absolute safety. If honourable members want absolute safety, it cannot be obtained from the banks. During the last few years the present system has been safe,' but a few years ago it was not. We have seen that in New Zealand, Queensland, and New South Wales, it has not been safe, and that will occur again. In those cases the Government had to step in and tide over the time by becoming responsible for the note issues. Our national Government should take over the whole currency under stringent provisions for regulating and limiting it, and for burning the notes as they pass out of existence-becaus e that is one of the most troublesome things which we shall have to deal with-so that",53,Forrest Wha T About The Will Wish To Say A Few Words But The Go

We can trust in what we know to be the honesty of the ordinary average Government in Australia, a/id issue within the limits of the necessities, of our currency. I hope that when this proposal is being carried out the Government w'll see their way to issue some notes of the value of ios., and that when they do so they will withdraw all the half-sovereigns at present in circulation, and will avoid the loss on half-sovereigns which will in future have to be borne by us now that we are taking the profit"" on the issue of silver coinage. This is a measure I advocated before in this House for six years. Various Treasurers denied that there was any profit to he. not out of the proposal, while I claimed that there was a profit of probably £35,000 to be derived from it. NowI see that the profit is estimated at from £60.000 up to £100,000, but those who make these estimates are, I think, wrong, as they are taking for one year the profit which should be spread over a number of years. I always pointed out that if we secured the' profit on silver coinage we would have to take up the duty of repairing the wear and tear of our gold coinage, which has hitherto fallen upon the Imperial authorities. I understand that we have now to undertake this duty, and very many of the half-sovereigns at present in circulation are quite below what is known as legal toleration, that is to say, they are much below their proper weight. We shall have to recall and replace them by recoinage at a considerable loss, and at the same time a certain loss will be going on in connection with our sovereigns, whiqh, in future, we shall have to meet. If we adopt a paper currency we should make use of it to avoid the loss on half-sovereigns. The loss on these coins is four or five times as great as that on the sovereigns, because, in proportion to their value a much larger surface is exposed to wear and tear. Further,, a half-sovereign is not desired at all by the man in the street. The use of the coin leads to mistakes. One is apt to mistake it for the sixpence, and, as a small coin, it is freby obscure private members who induced quently lost. Any honourable member who has travelled abroad will know the convenience of two-dollar bills, and how very handy they are.

EDWARDS -And will withdraw the half-sovereigns, on which we are bound to lose a considerable sum of money. I regret that the Government have not seen their way clear in submitting their currency proposals to propose the adoption of the decimal currency. Honourable members may take it for granted that the best time to introduce a change from our present system to the decimal system is when we are printing and coining new money, and must incur the expense of new dies. Really the only question to be settled is whether the alteration is desirable. doing away with the half-crown. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Yes, I am glad to see that the Treasurer of the day put his foot down against the coinage of the half-crown, because it would block the way to the adoption of the decimal system, the half-crown being no part of a decimal system based on the sovereign. If Parliament is against the adoption of the decimal system we cannot have it, but I remind honourable members that the House of Representatives, in two preceding Parliaments, endorsed proposals for its adoption. In the face of that we had one Government after another failing to carry out the will of this House. I hope that when so many political developments are promised we shall have one which will give us Governments responsible to the will of the House. When the will of Parliament has been definitely expressed the Government of the day should carry it out, particularly in a matter of this kind. coinage. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -This House, and I believe this Parliament, are in favour of it ; the present Prime Minister says that he is in favour of it ; I believe that 70 per cent, of the people are in favour of it, and yet we cannot give it effect. Why? Because there are no votes to be gained, and no log-rolling to be done by its adoption, because the proposal was introduced only the House of Representatives to accept it, and because it will be left only to obscure private members to again bring it under the notice of Ministers. I hope that before this session ends this House, as its predecessors have done, will pa""ss a motion in favour of making our system of money and currency the decimal system.

385,Mr Fisher,"I am in favour of decimalthat the Government have not promised the introduction of any law dealing with marriage and divorce. I do not know whether the Prime Minister thinks that the matter was not of sufficient importance to be included in the Governor General's Speech, but when the Commonwealth Parliament is endeavouring to unify procedure in the different States we should have one' law of marriage and divorce in operation in all of the States at the earliest possible moment. The Government have promised the introduction of quarantine legislation, and legislation of that character, which is probably not so necessary as a Commonwealth marriage and divorce law. When the Government do introduce a quarantine law I hope they will propose to abolish the quarantine station at Manly. There, in the finest position, and at the very gate of Sydney, a very large portion of land which would make one of the most magnificent parks for ihe adornment of the city is locked up for the purpose of accommodating, about once in three years, the passengers on some ship in which yellow fever or something ot the kind has developed. I think that in any Quarantine Bill submitted the Government might very well provide for handing the site to which I refer back to the New South Wales Government to be made a park, and might adopt some less valuable and less beautiful position for quarantine purposes. position to be had ?

I have always been a believer in land taxation. When the honourable member for Barrier used to sit on the Government cross bench in the early days of the Federal Parliament, when we were putting the Tariff through, I heard him call out that a tax on land would make up some of the deficiency in revenue anticipated from the duties proposed on certain goods. I used always from my seat on this side to tell the honourable member that I would be with him in introducing a national system of taxation in the Commonwealth. With society as it is at presentconstituted, I believe it is impossible to have any honest system'of taxation without calling upon land to»bear some proportion, and a very considerable proportion, of the general burden of taxation. I believe that by adding land taxation to our other proposals, we might have remitted much of the heavy taxation we placed upon the shoulders of the poor of the country by the Tariff. But the right time to consider the question of land taxation was when we were considering the whole 'fiscal scheme of the country. It should not have one as heavily as possible with Customs Mr G. B.

The present small sack is useful for many kinds of produce, but there are some kinds of produce of which it will not hold more than 1 cwt.

The honourable member for Wilmot will agree with me that when a larger weight of produce than 200 lbs. is put into a bag it should be confiscated. the honourable member say that.

ELLIOT JOHNSON -That is too much. this House, and every medical man in Australia will say that the health of the workers would be better if they had less heavy weights to move. I ask the Minister not to depart from the present regulation respecting weight in regard to the contents of bags. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne as to the medical aspect of the question. I suppose that one-fourth of the wheat which has been sent from the ports of South Australia has gone away in bags holding more than is allowed by the law of the Commonwealth. no law on the subject A Customs proclamation prevents the importation of bags greater than a certain size. the Minister to see whether it is not possible to pass a law which will prevent the using of bags for the conveyance of weights exceeding 200 lbs. Of what use would it be to appeal to the Governments of the States? We might wait till the Day of Judgment, arid they would do nothing. as they are. will not. should. The honourable member is .introducing the thin edge of the wedge in asking that bags larger than the recognised size shall be admitted.

The States have had an opportunity to act, and I believe that only Queensland has moved in the matter. New Zealand wisely made the question the subject of railway regulation increasing the rate of freight on bags over 200 lbs. in weight. That was a sensible, intelligent, and practical method of doing it, and I believe that Queensland has pursued a similar course. In these circumstances, J earnestly appeal to the Government. not to weaken in their determination in this respect, but, if anything, to strengthen the law. law. a difference of .opinion as to the powers of the Commonwealth in that regard. If we can make a law, the sooner an attempt is made in that direction the better, but the Minister of Trade and Customs has power to do a great deal by administration. If the matter is debated on a future occasion there will be no difficulty in showing that, on'the principle of common humanity, the standard ought to be adhered to. Anyone who knows the waterside workers of Australia must recognise that a man who carries the heavy bags for a few years is broken up. T believe that, in this House, in spite of party differences, we are all actuated by principles of common humanity, ancl in the name of humanity we ought to see that the use of the large bags is stopped, and the sooner the better. I have no hope of a successful appeal to the State authorities. During the debate this evening reference was made to the weakness of the States in dealing with inIt is not necessary that they dustrial legislation. The answer is obvious, that the States have Legislative Councils elected on a fancy franchise, and with' power to veto the popular Houses of Assembly. In those circumstances, it would be a sham and a farce for the Federal Government to appeal to the State Governments to do anything in the matter. wish to call the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to a matter that is creating considerable uneasiness in the minds of producers.

The Minister would he well advised to let the country know his intention in regard to that important matter, and I appeal to him to make a statement accordingly to and during the election I made it my business to inquire of hundreds of farmers on ' the question of the size of bags. I did so in consequence of statements appearing in the press to the effect . that they were not satisfied with the standard. In every instance they said, ""Leave the bags alone."" They looked on the introduction of the standard as one of the best reforms ever made in connection with the handling of their produce. I also submitted to them the proposition that there should be a railway regulation imposing extra freight on bags weighing over 200 lbs. The moment that was suggested the farmers said, "" We' should have to have scales in our paddocks to weigh every bag before it leaves there."" Those who are familiar with the . way in which wheat is handled know that it is not weighed until it reaches the railway station or the port. moment the standard size is departed from there will be trouble. I trust the Minister will maintain the regulation, which will always stand to the credit of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who introduced it. It was one of the greatest things ever done for the relief of men on the wharfs and in the holds of ships, and even of the farmers themselves, who now admit that they would.not go back to the old conditions on anv consideration. My electorate is largely interested in the question of an export duty on hides. Tn the district of Botany there are large num-bers of men out of employment' from the fact that they cannot get the hides. Foreigners come into the markets, buy the hides, and export them. place before the Minister some facts on this matter, and, therefore, I hope he will keep an open mind, and not accede to the request of the honourable member for Echuca to make a pronouncement straight away. The matter is most important to the industrial life of this country, and will have tn be dealt. with"" in the House' sooner or later.

Any import or export duties to be proposed will be dealt with then. I have no intention of altering the size of the standard sack. Every day I receive two or three letters accompanied by petitions on the subject. There is a printed petition going the round of the Commonwealth asking that the size of the sack be increased, and reaching me -daily with a varying number of signatures. I have answered every one of my correspondents, that I have not the slightest intention of altering the size of the standard sack. Minister to alter the size. We are asking him to allow others to come in. allow others to come in that may be used for carrying wheat. the users are breaking the law. Cannot they be fined? with our present powers, but it is the intention of the Government', as stated in the Speech, to introduce a Bill to amend the Customs Act, which will give us, over exports, the same power to a certain extent as we have over imports. It will then not be possible to export wheat , in bags over the standard weight. . That will meet the case mentioned by the 'honourable member for Hindmarsh. I believe a great number of backbreaking second-hand bags are in use, and if anything can be done'to preWe intend to vent that, it is my intention to do it. States can come in. they wished, take action to prevent the large bags being manufactured. We are informed Chat they are being manufactured in the States to-day, of a size greater than the standard. Unfortunately, we have no. control over that, .although we have control over the imported stuff.
