Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon noticeIs he aware that great difficulty is experienced in country centres in obtaining necessary facilities for rifle ranges to enable shooting to be carried on safely and expeditiously? orable member's question is thatThe Minister is aware that some difficulty has been experienced in providing proper facilities for rifle practice in country centres, which has been mainly due to the fact that numbers of ranges have had to be closed owing to the spread of settlement and the consequent withdrawal of permission to shoot. Although in many cases owners of private property have granted permission to shoot over their lands without charge, or at a nominal charge, in others such permission has been refused, and the expense of purchasing or leasing the necessary land in many instances is practically prohibitive, and where purchase becomes imperative Parliamentary approval has first to be obtained for the expenditure. However, everything possible is being done to provide proper facilities as expeditiously as possible. POST-OFFICE CLOSING.

Debate resumed from 20th September O'MALLEYThat this Bill be now read a second time. I do not propose to speak at length upon this very important Bill, because at the present stage I scarcely think that it is necessary to do so. "" Hope deferred maketh the heart sick "" and for ten years I , and the other representatives of Western Australia, have been battling hard to bring about the project which is dealt with in this measure. Prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth we were led to believe that the construction of a railway connecting the eastern States and the West would be one of the first acts undertaken by the Federation. We had been told that by the most prominent politicians-by the strongest advocates of Federation. But the result proved very disappointing. Instead of Parliament being willing to construct this trans-Australian railway, we found that it would not even seriously think about the matter. At any rate, it was impossible to get sufficient support'for the undertaking, either in this House or in another place. I need scarcely say how bitterly I felt this disappointment, because I had led the people of Western Australia to believe that a railway connecting that State with the eastern States would be speedily constructed by the Federation. There can be no doubt that if South Australia had been of the same mind as Western Australia after the advent of Federation this railway would have been built by those States themselves. I do not think it would have been constructed upon the gauge which is now proposed, but I am quite certain that railway communication would have been established between the two States long before now. But South Australia took up the position that the matter was essentially a Federal one. In fact, she did not even give her consent to the Commonwealth constructing the line through her territory until this Parliament 'had agreed to take over the Northern Territory. I wish to point out that there is amisapprehension, entertained even by some honourable members, in regard to this proposed railway. Only yesterday, a prominent member of this House was under the impression-unti l I told him the facts-that the mileage of the proposed railway through Western Australian territory would be fat greater than the mileage through South Australian territory. As a matter of fact, 605 miles of the line will be in South Australia-that is, the distance from Port Augusta to the Western Border-and only 455 miles of it will be in Western Australia.

But better authorities than myself, including all the enThe new-comers used to support me also gineers-in-chief throughout Australia, think it will pay after ten years. The engineerin-chief of Western Australia, the late Mr C. Y. O'Connor, and Mr Deane, the engineqr-in-chief: .of the Commonwealth, have both given independent opinions to that effect. I must admit that wherever this undertaking has been mentioned by me throughout Australia, I have not experienced any difficulty in convincing my hearers that it was a necessary one. But in this Parliament the position was different, and we have for ten years had a very uphill fight. I rejoice that that difficulty has now been overcome, and that a true Federation, so far as Western Australia is concerned, is at last in sight. It is extraorknow the facts. dinary that there should have been such opposition exhibited to this railway. A vast and practically undeveloped country is at the very door of the people of Eastern Australiaa country with a population of 300,000, who, as a body, are the most progressive and prosperous people in the world. What sort of a place is it to which it is proposed to build this line? Western Australia has a trade of ,£16,000,000 a year, she has 2,500 miles of railway running, and that mileage is being largely increased. These railways cost £12,000,000 to construct, and in 1910 they returned .£153,111 in excess of working and maintenance expenses and after the payment of interest on the capital outlay. In other words, they yielded a profit of .£153,111. These people have produced £100,000,000 in gold from the soil, and during the last ten years the average yearly production has been £7,500,000. That is the country in the management and development of which we want more of the people of the Commonwealth to come in and share. want that. stagers, as the honourable member calls them, large as was being farmed ten years [22 SEPTEMBER, 1911.] Railway BUI. 741 mortgaged every sixpence they had in the world to give a water supply to the new population on the gold-fields. that.

The mines of Western Australia, besides producing ,£100,000,000 in gold and providing a tremendous amount of employment, have paid .£21,000,000 in dividends during the last ten years. One would think that an El Dorado like that, which is to-day producing an enormous quantity of gold, and is besides rich in agricultural and pastoral production, would have been a country which the people on this side would have been very eager to be closely connected with. The only reason why they have not insisted on closer communication hitherto is that they did not Those who went there nearly always stayed and Suilt homes there.

To the people there Federation has been but a name. They have not had a chance of realizing that the Commonwealth was really intended for them as well as for the rest of the people of Australia. If they wished to come and see these great populous cities in the eastern parts of Australia, they Justice and common interest were certain to had to make a four or five days' voyage across the ocean. Is it any wonder that they did not feel that they were really a part of the union? But this work, when completed, will show them that they are. I have always said that the best advocate for the union of the peoples of East and West would be the railway guards when they were able to call out at the Perth railway station, "" Take your seats for Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane."" I am very glad to say that public opinion on this subject has altogether changed, not only in this House, but throughout Australia. I believe that every one is now in favour of a railway connection being made. Even the press has given up opposing it-that is, I should say, the portion of the press that used to oppose the project so strenuously. All are now practically in accord, and the result is the Bill that we have before us. We all remember reading in the Scriptures that when St. Paul journeyed down to Damascus"" suddenly there shined round about him a light out of heaven,'' and he heard a voice saying unto him, "" It is hard for the to kick against the pricks."" Those who have been opposing the construction of this railway have found it hard to kick against the pricks-the pricks being public opinion, and the wisdom, and justice of the people of Australia. I, myself, from the beginning never had any fear whatever as to the ultimate result. I have often said in this House, "" You can delay this work, but you can never prevent it. You cannot prevent this railway being carried out in the near future. If you delay it for a while, that is all you can do."" I knew very well that, as time went on, the people of the East and the people of the West would want to be brought closer together for purposes of trade and commerce, of defence, and, of mutual intercourse. They would not be content to have a thousand miles of unoccupied country separating them. They Sir John Forrest. I mention these facts to show would not be content to have to make a four or five days' voyage across the ocean to reach one another. They would be bound to say, "" We must have communication in the speediest way between all the great centres of this Commonwealth."" The case was too strong for the work to be thwarted. Parochialism might have its day, ignorance and misrepresentation might have their day, but they could not continue to exercise their influence. prevail. I think that the Ministry have acted wisely in determining to proceed with this work; and I think that I may add that they have the support of an almost unanimous House. It will not astonish honourable members when I say that I shall give them all the assistance in my power. This is the consummation of a great federalizing effort. It will bind together with hoops of steel all the people of Australia. I am not concerned personally, whatever some may say, with what party or Government gets the credit for carrying out this work. WhatI want is that the railway shall be built, and that the consummation of the Federation of Australia shall be a reality for all parts of it. right honourable member to say that he would give us all the assistance in his power for the completion of our programme when this work was finished? ing of this Railway Bill. The honourable member misunderstood me. I have done my best, and the other representatives of Western Australia have done their best. We have received a lot of support in this House, but we have not had sufficient support until very recently. It is a bold comprehensive policy which alone will do for this country. We must provide the necessary means of transit. I know that this work is in the hands of the States, but whenever we have an opportunity this Parliament, as representing the whole of Australia, must be equal to the occasion. It is a bold comprehensive railway policy, giving means of transit to the people, which is wanted in Australia. When we have an opportunity, let us not lag behind, but let us show them an example. I also wish to say that I hold the same views in no less a degree, though the population is not there, in regard to the opening up of the Northern Territory which is now committed to our control.

It is not enough to build railways anywhere haphazard. We want to put them in the right places, and we want experience and judgment in action, in the same way as we want boldness and comprehension in policy.

Therefore, I look on with some fear and trembling the trusting to the present Government of the carrying out of great projects.

Circumstances, they say, alter cases, and I should say my honourable friends squirm under this demand and.dislike it just as much as any one else would, but have to bow their heads and submit to it. Let me now refer to the cost of the railway. According to the estimate framed by the eminent engineer engaged by the GoThe only way in which we vernmentMr Deane, who I suppose has 'had more experience of railways and railway construction than has any other man on this side of the Equator-the cost of the line was to be just under £4,000,000. But according to a paper which was handed to me yesterday by the Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Deane believes that owing to recent discoveries the amount for providing a water supply on the line may be reduced by £350,000. ber aware that this second estimate of Mr Deane was given after an estimate was furnished by another engineer? aware of that. We know that water by artesian boring on an immense They have limestone plateau has been found, which will very much simplify the work of construction. The cost of the railway is now estimated by Mr Deane at about £3*650,000. I have always thought myself, and I would have said so only for this paper which the Minister handed to me yesterday, that the estimate of £600,000 was too much for providing a water supply We do not want for the railway alone. If a supply of water for more than the railway is required that is another matter. My opinion is-and I shall continue to express it until I am proved to be in the wrong-that this railway if tendered for and let to a substantial firm to build would be constructed for £3,000,000. South Wales is against that view. He the Commonwealth can call for tenders, and if the lowest tender is too high it need not be accepted If it calls for tenders for constructing the line on the departmental plans I believe it will be found that the work can be done for ,£3,000,000. My eminent friend, the engineer, may say that my estimate is too low.

Mr Deane Wynbring and Kychering offer opportunitiessaysBetween Kalgoorlie ancl the Nullabor PlainThat is about 170 miles altogethercatchment dams must be built or artificial catchments prepared. At Cardinia, 82 milesThat is a big granite rock 82 miles from Kalgoorlieand the granite ridge at 107 miles east of Kalgoorlie, there are good rock catchments. Wherever you get rock catchments along that route you may depend upon securing a good deal of rain water. The plan they have is to put a parapet round the foot of the catchment, which acts just like the roof of a house. All the water which falls within the area runs into a dam, and so every drop is conserved. We followed out that plan with great success on the railway between Southern Cross and Coolgardie. long time we were able, and it was astonishing to what extent we were able, to provide water for the railway by that means The granite rocks in that locality were very much more numerous and extensive than they are at the place named by On the NullaborP l a in That is a very extensive limestone plain, elevated from about 700 feet at its highest down to 500 feet, when it reaches the boundary of Western Australia. There are about 25,000,000 acres of grassy, open country without timber, on this immense plainOn the Nullabor Plain the State Government of Western Australia have carried out boring operations with success. At No. 3 bore on railway route, 344 miles (from Kalgoorlie), water was struck between 1,270 and 1,344 feet in beds of fine and coarse sand with hard bands and granite boulders with hard granite at the bottom. The water stands in the bore about 420 feet from surface; there is a large supply, and it is of good quality, no salt, a little hard, but it is considered that it would be good water for boiler purposes. This 900 feet of water is a splendid discovery, l l is 344 miles from Kalgoorlie, and altogether removes any anxiety in regard to the water supply. There are about 100 miles of sandhills, though these are No. 4 bore at 419 miles 73 chains was bottomed on granite at a depth of 907 feet. drawing 30,000 gallons water stands at from the surface; quality slightly Among the sand hills artificial catchments of the latter is very extensive, and the former is capable of great improvements by stripping. edge of the From Tarcoola East there seems little difficulty of conserving water. Where well water cannot be obtained sites for dams can be found. In the estimates of cost furnished with the report of the i r th October, 1909, the sum of £609,000 was quoted for water supply. This was figured out on the assumption that steam locomotives would be used for hauling trains over the line. This item of the estimate has been further looked into, and I have found it possible to make a considerable reduction, partly owing to the fact that water of good quality has been proved by boring to exist below the surface at a point 344 miles from Kalgoorlie, as mentioned previously in this report, and partly by adopting a cheaper method of conveying water to distances along the line, namely, by using wooden stave pipes instead of steel. The scheme now proposed is to take water from the Mt. Charlotte tank at Kalgoorlie, conFor a vey it along the line in pipes of suitable size, delivering it for the use of the steam locomotives in water tanks about 50 miles apart, till the tank at about 257 miles from Kalgoorlie is reached. Then making use of the water at No. 3 bore at 344 miles, pump and deliver this back towards Kalgoorlie as far as 295 miles, where a tank would be placed, and sending it along the line in the direction of Port Augusta as far as the end of the limestone plain where the sand hills are entered, at about 632 miles from Kalgoorlie, which is the lowest point on this part of the line, viz., 329 feet above sealevel. Between No. 3 bore and this point tanks erected at intervals of about 50 miles would be supplied from the same main. By the above scheme sufficient water for engine purposes can be secured at a total estimated cost of £456,000, thus showing a saving of £155,000 on the estimate of October, 1909. If the internal combustion principle can be applied to the locomotives used on the railway, the provision for water can be much reduced, and it might be safe to Teckon on bringing the cost down to say, £250,000, as the water requirements would then be confined to station purposes and household use. That is very satisfactory. Personally, I never had any anxiety as to the water supply, because we have had some experience in this respect, as I shall show later. All the engineers report that the railway will pay after a certain time; and I am quite content to accept their estimate of ten years; though I do not agree with it. I venture to predict that the returns will be better than the engineers anticipate. Engineers",17,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading
39,Sir John Forrest,"That would not in Western Australia, but in South Aus",18,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading
40,Mr Deane,"value their professional judgment most of all; and they always endeavour, and rightly so, in giving an opinion, to be on the safe side. We cannot accurately forecast what the returns for the railway may be. A rich discovery of gold, attracting thousands of people, as on previous occasions-thoug h the attraction will be greater on account of the greater facilities of travel-woul d alter would come when not only would they not all our calculations. The Western Australian Government constructed 120 miles of railway from Southern Cross to Kalgoorlie at the small outlay of £200 or £300 a mile; and the contractor, whom we were obliged to permit to carry passengers and goods while the contract was under way, made a fortune. The fact that the two sides of Australia are separated, and that this railway will connect them, promises results much more profitable than we can anticipate now. Expected returns of this kind cannot be put down in black and white; but when we observe the success of similar projects all over the world, we may very well look on the bright side. At any rate, I believe that this railway will never be a burden on the people of Australia. Mr J. H . CATTS -Will the right honourable member stake any of his capital that it will not be a burden ? honourable member will put down a similar amount as a stake to the contrary. This railway must be a success; and, by-andby, it will be regarded just as the Coolgardie water scheme now is. The last time. I spoke on the subject of the water scheme in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, I told those who denounced it, and described it as a pall hanging over the State, that the time would come when not a man in the country would have a word to say against it. member was lucky at that time. judgment. rescue! there before the work was commenced. able member's pardon ; that is. not so. that the Bill was introduced, and Kalgoorlie was discovered in 1893. member looks into the matter, he will see that I am right. tion shows the foolishness and conceit of some people. I was responsible for the scheme as Premier of the State, and yet the honourable member tells me that if I look into the matter I shall find that he is right. I told the opponents of the scheme that the time say anything against it, but would search* the records in order to justify themselves in saying that they had supported it. That has come to pass; and those who opposed the scheme are now saying that they did not oppose it much, or were in favour of it at last, ancl so forth. There is a remarkable surface feature of the country to be traversed to which I wish to direct special attention. From Perth to a place called Bullabulling, near Kalgoorlie, the country rises to an altitude of about 1,610 feet above the sea. Thereafter there is a gradual fall towards Kalgoorlie, and while there are some undulations and some rising ground, these are not sufficient to interfere with the gravitation of water all the way from Bullabulling for 683 miles to the far-distant sandhills of South Australia. In other words, water can be carried by gravitation from Bullabulling across the Western Australian boundary to the sandhills of South Australia. the respective elevations? Australian boundary the elevation is 507 feet, while at the sandhills themselves there is an elevation of 329 feet above the sea. That is the lowest point on the line, so that we have a fall from r,6io feet .at Bullabulling to 329 feet at the South Australian sandhills, the elevation at the Western Australian boundary being 507 feet I looked into this matter some eighteen months ago and came to the conclusion that if all other means of obtaining a satisfactory water supply failed, we should be able to carry it through the country by means of a gravitation scheme. My suggestion is not that, as Mr Deane, the engineer, proposes, a small pipe should be laid sufficient merely to provide for the requirements of the railway, but that we should put down a big pipe which would supply the wants, not only of the railway, but of people who settle in the country, and also their stock. honourable member get the water? >",18,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading

Contemplate the effect of this 640 ply. Not more than one-half of the water which the pipes are capable of carrying is being used in connection with the Coolgardie capable of carrying 5,000,060 gallons a scheme. The surplus is far more than would be necessary to fill the small pipes that Mr Deane suggests should be laid, but would not be sufficient to supply such a service as I propose. Mr Kernot, Chief Engineer of the Victorian Railways, at my request worked out the figures as to the volume of water which a 24-in. pipe service would be capable of supplying. service ? based on a steel pipe service. Mr Deane, however, says that wooden pipes would be cheaper and better, because, unlike steel, they would not corrode. For the first 130 miles a 24-in. pipe by gravitation would supply 2,000,000 gallons a day. At a point 220 miles from the starting place it would supply 1,250,000 gallons a day more; at 380 miles from the starting point 1,000,000 gallons a day more; and at a distance of 455 miles-o n the Western Australian boundary-500,00 0 gallons a day more-o r a total of 4.750,000 gallons per diem. spared from the Mundaring scheme? additional pipe could be inserted and more water pumped up. The present pumping plant is capable of pumping up a much larger quantity than is being raised. sufficient quantity available in the dam to give that supply? not we could build another dam. As a matter of fact, however, only one-third of the storage capacity of the dam is now being used. I should think nothing of building an additional dam if that were necessary. The estimated first cost of supplywe ought not to interfere with it. ing 5,000,000 gallons of water per day through this vast stretch of country, presuming the water was at Pullabulling in sufficient quantities to supply the railway service, and their stock is £1,500,000. estimate would be considerably reduced if the scheme provided for the use of wooden rather than of steel pipes. This initial cost having been incurred, the additional cost would be comparatively slight, since through to the South Australian sandmiles of river lunning through that great expanse of country. A water service day would indeed be a veritable river, and if the country is any good at all it would confer upon it inestimable advantages. I contend that the country is good. It consists largely of a limestone plateau, all covered with good grass. Quite recently the stationmaster at Eucla sent me a telegram stating that the present season was one of the best ever known there. The whole country, he declared, was covered with grass about a foot high. In other words, the vast territory through which this line will pass comprises 25,000,000 acres of good grass. What an outlet for starving stock at a time of drought in other parts of the Commonwealth. In a good season the whole of the stocks of the Riverina could be maintained there. As the result of the Kalgoorlie water scheme from Northam to the gold-fields, all the intervening country has been settled with farms which extend much further to the east than we thought would be possible. Such a scheme, presuming the water is at Bullabulling, as I have just suggested, would involve a first cost of £1,500,000, and the cost of maintaining the service would be comparatively light. In connection with the Kalgoorlie water scheme we have to pump the water uphill against a head of 2,500 feet, including friction, but in this case the water would be running down hill. Surely this ought to be an Australian undertaking. Surely we ought to be capable of subduing the wilderness. member suggest that the State should carry out that water scheme? the Commonwealth and the State to undertake it. able members to seriously consider the effect of this additional 640 miles of fresh water running through a territory where the people on the land, at present there is no surface water.

He said, "" I think we could."" We do not, perhaps, want the line exactly straight, but fancy an extent of level country with a gradual fall all the one way for 450 miles. This is a limestone plateau, which is generally supposed to be good country, and all it wants is a good rainfall. of level limestone plateau, which is well grassed in good seasons, and from 700 feet to 329 feet above the sea. We then come to the sand hills of South Australia. There are, I think, about 100 Deane that they are not so formidable as people think. I know the sand hills of Central Australia, and can tell honourable members that they run in ridges for miles; there is a valley between them, and the bottom of the valley is quite level, but when you want to cross over you have to go up the hill and down into the next valley. hills? that they present very little difficulty, beafter passing through the stretch of sand cause they are not the ordinary drift sand hills. Only the top is sand, and down below is hard rock. A good description of them is given in Professor Gregory's account of the sand hills on the shores of Lake Eyre. There is a geological theory given by Mr Brown, the Government Geologist, as to how they are formed. It appears they are not formed by drifts, or else they would be of the same softness right through, whereas underneath they are fairly hard limestone or sandstone rock. This, therefore, can be got through without any great trouble, and Mr Deane thinks very little of the difficulty of getting from one valley to the other. the valleys? were so, as water would be plentiful. In the valleys it is firm sandy ground. The formation of the hills is just like the waves of the sea. They are very common in Northern and Central Australia. I For passed over some in 1874, D u t kept generally to the south of them. right honourable member says they are not Some quartz reefs may be drift sand hills at all? We then opinion now is that they are not. Artesian fresh water has been already found I asked Mr Deane yester-' in two places on the limestone plateau I have described. There has been discovered 900 feet of fresh water coming within 400 feet of the surface, and if there is fresh water in one place it is only necessary to bore to get it in other places. There are 25,000,000 acres of grassj', open plain, and I predict that the whole of that will be used for grazing purposes. I do not see There is, then, this 450 miles why, if the rainfall is sufficient, anything should not grow there, because the latitude is between 30 degrees and 31 degrees, or a little further north than Perth. able about the rainfall? no one lives there, but we know that the rock holes are often full. The average rainfall at Eucla and along the coast is about 10 inches, and there is no doubt that the tendency of the fall is to decrease as you go further north. This part, however, is not very far north, as the line will pass within about 50 miles of the sea at Eucla. I should say that the rainfall would be less than at Eucla. We then cross the South Australian border, and get to Tarcoola, hills I have described. Tarcoola is 801 miles from Kalgoorlie. There is a township there, with a telegraph line, ancl the South Australians have great hopes of it some day turning out a good gold-field, although it has not done much up to the present. The South Australian people have great confidence in it, as also in Mount Gunson, nearer Port Augusta, where, I think, rich copper has been found. From Tarcoola to Port Augusta is 262 miles through settled country, where there are sheep stations. When Mr Deane travelled over it he described it as beautiful and covered with flowers.

73,Mr Hall,"I s any information availThis, then, is the country which has been termed a desert, only because there is no surface water in it. What we have to do is to reclaim the wilderness. Where the soil is good and things will grow, but no surface water is available, we must find the water. If water can be supplied by gravitation, it is a very easy matter; but when it has to be pumped, as is the case with the Coolgardie water scheme, it means an everlasting expense. Yass-Canberra. water can be obtained by gravitation at Yass-Canberra by going a good way up the Cotter River. member has only shown that water can be got by gravitation over 400 miles out of the 1,000. that it can be provided by gravitation over 640 miles, and when you reach Tarcoola and go on towards Port Augusta you get into more settled country, with wells, where water is easily obtained. In any case, 900 feet of fresh water has been discovered .344 miles from Kalgoorlie, within 400 feet of the surface, so that a permanent supply is assured already. Deane's recommendation will be carried out so far as railway purposes are concerned, and a quarter of a million pounds will cover that; but, of course, if we want to go in for a settlement scheme, which would probably be a matter for the Commonwealth and the State, the possibility of a wider scheme is in front of us. Only by providing a good water supply can this vast territory be used to the best advantage. The result would be that the country would be settled and intermediate traffic would be protime. vided for the railway. My opinion is that immediately after the railway is constructed all this country will be utilized, forpastoral purposes at any rate. Let me quote descriptions of the country furnished by people who have no interest in it except to tell the truth. Mr Muir, Inspector of Engineering Surveys, was sent out by me to examine it in 1901. He went over that stretch of country from Kalgoorlie to Eucla, about 500 miles. Eucla? open roa'dstead with sand banks and a jetty where ships can go, but it is not a good port for large ships. Mr Muir said about the country he traversedTaken as a whole, this stretch of country is one of the finest I have ever seen in Australia, and, with water-whic h doubtless could be obtained if properly prospected for-it is admirably adapted for grazing purposes, and will, without doubt, be taken up some day from end to end. Mr Deane went over the country from the western side for about 200 miles inland from Kalgoorlie until he got to the limestone plateau. The country on the plain is the same throughout, and he did not travel over it. Reporting on this country in May, 1909, he wroteThe country passed through is not of the desert class. This fact should be distinctly borne in mind. Writing again of the same country, he saysEverywhere along the route vegetation is abundant, such as salt bush, blue bush grass, and edible and other scrub. Speaking of the country on the eastern or South Australian side he reported in July, 1909From a pastoral point of view the country traversed, with the exception of the sand hills and salt lakes areas, is well covered with salt bush mulga and other edible bush, and in many places in the winter with herbage and grass. During the discussion of this question the I expect that Mr point was raised as to the necessity of altering the gauge of the, line between Port Augusta and Terowie. From Melbourne to Terowie the line is constructed on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, and from Terowie to Port Augusta on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. It would be very inconvenient to travel by a wide gauge to Terowie, then by a narrow gauge to Port Augusta, and later again by a wider gauge to Fremantle. I do not think that we need bother our heads about this matter at the present I have no doubt the Government have it under consideration. I feel quite sure that the South Australian Government will make the necessary alterations in their narrow gauge line. In fact, they are considering now a line from Port Augusta along the coast down towards Port Pirie to join the wide gauge line further south than Terowie. able gentleman think we should proceed until that matter is decided ? Ought we to take the risk ? The risk will be nothing, because the South Australian Government must consider the convenience of the people.

81,Sir John Forrest,"Certainly .people of South Australia will never be content to let such an inconvenience continue. I do not think it has ever been suggested that the South Australian Government wiil make people change about from a wide to a narrow gauge. They have agreed to the construction of this railway in a most friendly way. Western Australia has already agreed to make any alteration of gauge required in the line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. The broadening of the gauge between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle will involve a great deal of expense, but I have never heard it suggested that the Western Australian Government will not be prepared to do what is necessary. The people would not stand having to change about from one gauge to another. people of Western Australia is to have a through line to the eastern States, and the people on the eastern side will desire in the same way to have a through line on one gauge to the ship's side at Fremantle. I am satisfied that the State Governments of South Australia and Western Australia will change the giuge of their lines where necessary to any gauge adopted by this Parliament for the transcontinental line. Western Australian Government have agreed to adopt the same for their line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. able gentleman not think that the South Australian Government should be bound in the same way? whether the Victorian Government will agree to alter the gauge of their line. -doubt they will all be prepared to make the necessary change of gauge. Western Australian Government will have to alter the 400 miles of line between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle, which is at present -constructed on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, to the gauge approved of by this Parliament for the transcontinental line. easy to alter it to a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge? but I am not dealing with that question at present. are built for a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge. gineers-in-Chief of all the Australian railway systems have sat to consider this -question of the gauge on two occasions. The Railways Commissioners have dealt with the matter on several occasions, and I may mention that the late Mr O'Connor, in reporting on the proposal in 1901, without any instructions whatever, made his calculations on a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge. He evidently seemed to be of opinion that that was the right gauge to adopt. AH the expert reports are in favour of the adoption of the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge, I suppose because it may be considered the world's gauge. I am aware from my own experience recently that it is possible to attain a speed of 60 miles an hour on that gauge at any time. I do not wish to labour the question of the gauge. I intend to support the Government in the matter, because what they propose is based on the The desire of the reports of the experienced engineers who have dealt with the question. . I can the more readily support the Government in this case, because I know they can have only the public interests in view. They have not in this matter to consider any outside view of preference, such as preference to unionists. They have no axe to grind, and removed from the extraneous and evil influences; which, I regret to say, press from every side on my Whatever gauge we agree to, the honourable friends opposite to induce them to go where I feel sure they do not themselves wish to go, their judgment may be taken to be reasonable and unbiased. Acting as they are in this matter on expert advice, which the Minister has assured us they have considered carefully, I am prepared to support the adoption of the gauge they have proposed for this line. after the proposed line has been constructed, to travel throughout the States without changing carriages. years I believe it will, as a uniform gauge is sure to be adopted. That is a national question, to which this Parliament might well devote its attention. proposed line will probably determine the standard gauge. Whatever gauge is adopted for this long length of line from Port Augusta to Fremantle1,447 miles-wil l probablv become the standard for Australia.' The States should not be asked to hear the whole cost of providing a standard gauge on the lines connecting the capitals; the Commonwealth should, I think, and would, I believe, share the expense.",22,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading

Before resuming my seat, I wish to thank those honourable members, both here and in another place, on my own behalf, and on behalf of the people of Western Australia, for the generous support which they are giving to this proposal.

He has had so great southern continent. I rejoice that one more work for which I have striven for so many years, like so many others with which I have been associated during my twenty-eight years of parliamentary life, is likely soon to become a matter of history. From the inception of this Parliament, I have felt it an obligation upon me to do all I could to bring about the construction of this work. I felt that if I shirked the task, or declined to take further part in public affairs, or did not continue at my post till this railway was authorized, I should not be carrying out my pledges to those who, following my advice, and in the full belief that this railway would be built by the Commonwealth, voted for the acceptance of the Constitution by Western Australia. of the right honourable member's career? the coping stones of many arches with which I have had the honour and privilege of being associated. A few years hence no one will be willing to admit that he opposed this great humanitarian and utilitarian undertaking. Honourable members have been associated with other enterprises which have been gained only by strenuous effort, but after a year or two have become part of the daily life of the community, and regarded as a matter of course, so that the difficulties which had to be contended with to bring them to a successful issue have been almost forgotten. Similarly, once this line has been completed, it will not be comprehended that any one could have thought it undesirable, or could have opposed its construction ; the people will look on it as a work necessary for their material welfare, comfort, and convenience. I have had great pleasure in taking part in the debate on the sewnd reading of the Bill, and hope that when the measure has passed Ministers will let us see what they are made of by constructing the railway as speedily as possible ; and I hope that it will be constructed in less time than the three years I havs estimated to be required for the work.

He is an extraordinarily good shopkeeper, and can place his goods in his window to much to do with Western Australia that I feel bound to give attention to what, he has had to say on this matter, but there are many points on which I disagree with him. I have noticed that whenever a member of this House favours a proposal, he speaks of it as a national work, and, on the contrary, if he is against it, he regards it as. parochial.

That end can only be secured by the development of the whole of the country, from end to end. It is useless to pretend that we can carry commodities over so great a distance without intermediate freights. Another important question is that of the gauge. As to the best gauge to choose, I have, of course, to accept the opinion of practical men. I know little about the matter personally, but I should have thought that the broader the gauge the more durable the line would be. Certainly any one who travels from Sydney to Adelaide has to admit that there is not so much oscillation on the broader as there is on the narrower gauge. think that the broader the gauge the greater the safety. It has often been a marvel to me that trains with narrow flanged wheels, running over a narrow-gauge line, did not leave the rails more frequently than they do. I think that it is more the intervention of Providence than engineering skill that has prevented accidents from this cause. But if engineers agree that a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge is sufficient, I must accept their verdict. attention to this question for some years, ancl know that there has always been a difference of opinion. Undoubtedly the narrower gauge is cheaper, but, on the other hand, the broader gauge gives greater durability, steadiness, and safety. If , however, the consensus of opinion among engineers is that the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge is preferable, I shall have to accept their conclusion, just as I accept the views of a majority of lawyers or a majority of doctors. should always reserve the right to maintain bis own opinion. can do that in connection with a matter about which I know nothing. If I have to follow a course, I prefer to take ""the opinion of the majority of the experts in the matter, as I do in everything else. When the honourable member for Flinders spoke the other day, he submitted a point which I think is well worthy of consideration. He suggested that, seeing that there had been no decided opinion expressed as to which is the better gauge, and that as from Albury to Terowrie there is a gauge of 5 f t . 3 in., and from Terowie to Port Augusta a gauge of 3 f t . 6 in., it would be cheaper afterwards to alter the gauge from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie from 5 ft., 3 in. to 4 f t . 8£ in., whereas if it were found afterwards that the latter was not the right gauge it would cost more to alter the gauge from 4 f t . 8J in. to 5 ft. 3 in. He took that broad stand, and suggested that seeing that nothing had been decided, the matter might be considered, and I agree with him. Tf a gauge of 4 f t . 8J in. be adopted for the transcontinental line, Queensland will have to alter the gauge of its railway system. in any case. Wales the gauge at present is 4 ft. 8J in., while from Albury, in New South WaleSj to Terowie, in South Australia, the gauge",25,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading

The question which will have to be seriously considered is that of expense. land and New South Wales and the border of New South Wales and Victoria a great extent of country is traversed by railway, and if the permanent way has to be altered to a broader gauge the cost of the work will be enormous. But there is no immediate necessity to make the alteration any more than there has been during the last twenty years. If we cannot decide which is the proper gauge to adopt, and can get a continuity of line from Albury to Perth on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, that will go a long way towards giving us uniformity. It will be better to consider that aspect of the question now if we cannot get a decided opinion, and to build the Commonwealth line on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. the Commonwealth had discovered the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge. honourable member knows more about railways than I do, but I submit that men who have had more experience of railways than he has had would differ from him. anvthing. honourable member need not think that I feel the remark which he passed. I am simply looking at this question from the standpoint of the ordinary man in the street. Seeing that there is such a great diversity of opinion on the question of gauge, I think it is necessary that we should follow the path of least resistance or trouble. I share the opinion of the honourable member for Flinders. I would point out that if Western Australia has agreed to alter the gauge of its railway from Kalgoorlie to Perth to 4 ft. 8J in. it would not cost much more to adopt the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. If the railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie is to be built with national money, the whole cost of regrading the railway systems of the States should be borne by the National Parliament. That would be merely an act of justice to those States which will have to alter their gauges. If that point is conceded I shall be willing to leave the whole matter to the engineers and financiers of Australia to deal with. Unification would settle the whole difficulty ? orable member there, but I do not know what chance we have of getting Unification. In spite of the fact that there is more apBetween the border of Queensparent safety to life on a broad-gauge than on a narrow-gauge line, I shall accept a narrower gauge than the 5 ft. 3 in. for this new line if the experts advise that it will do all that is wanted. If , however, the people of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia are expected to pay for the alteration of their railway gauge, which is a matter of national concern, I shall have to give this proposal more consideration before I cast a vote. Australia are willing to pay for the alteration. will get a benefit out of this great national railway when it is built; and even if South Australia should have to pay for broadening the gauge between Terowie and Port Augusta it will also gain a material benefit. I think. able friend has scratched the leopard, and shown the spots, I want to know where Victoria is likely to benefit, and why it should be asked to pay, not only its share of the deficit on the working of the transcontinental railway, but also the cost of altering the gauge on its trunk line, which would be considerable, and upset its whole railway system. Whether we care to make the admission or not, we look at questions from a State stand-point. For instance, on the question of acquiring the Northern Territory, we always found the representatives of South Australia supporting the proposal. On the question of the Federal Capital, we have always found the representatives of New South Wales strong advocates. A representative of Western Australia has always taken more interest in the question of this railway than he has done in any other question. ists, though.

Unless these questions are answered satisfactorily my vote will not be cast for this railway. If the whole of the ""national spirit"" is to be with Victoria, and the whole of the national gain with the other States, I shall cast my vote in such a way as to secure justice for my own State as far as possible.

Under the altered circumstances this railway is necessary; but there must be the safeguards I have indicated. This question has been before Parliament for a number of years, and I am glad that it has reached its present stage. In my opinion the railway will be a great success : and many honourable members, who, though not directly opposing it, are supporting it in a half-and-half way, do not realize the magnificent nature of the country that will be opened up.

165,Mr Hedges (Fremantle) [12.37],"Japan's first act was to order more rails and rolling-stock for Korea than are required for this railway. Fortunately, we have not had to defend ourselves against a Power like Russia, and we have no money invested in old guns and powder. It should be a small undertaking to a community having everything that a country can require to connect its distant parts by means of railways. In Western Australia there is one of the most magnificent agricultural areas in the world. State contains gold, timber, cattle, wool, and agricultural country, and the construction of this railway will cause development such as we have never seen in the past. As to the route, the South Australian Government, in demanding that the line should go north as far as Tarcoola, played directly into our hands. We have taken over a railway which, as I pointed out during the discussion on the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, was carried from Port Augusta north with the intention of extending it to the Queensland border. In the first place, a survey to the Queensland border was made. The pegs were lost, but I have it on the authority of MrH . C. MJais, one of the best railway engineers we ever had, that the intention was to take that line into the corner of Queensland and New South Wales. The line actually taken over by us, after going a certain distance north, runs almost due west for about 100 miles. The map exhibited in the chamber shows that all we have to do in carrying the line to Port Darwin is to start at a point about 100 miles along the line that we are now proposing to construct, and to build it on a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge. In that way we should save a lot of construction work, and avoid having lines coming into two different parts of Port Augusta. I have here a map-the best that I could obtaina glance at which will show very clearly the whole position. The line as marked on the map is pointing straight towards Port Darwin. I hold, therefore, that, instead of incurring the exgrown in Western Australia are also free pense of altering the 3-ft. 6-in. line that we have taken over, which would be a very costly affair, it would be much cheaper for us to construct the section that would be required to carry the line 100 miles out from Port Augusta straight up to the north. In that way the route from Port Darwin to Port Augusta would be shortened by at least 100 miles, and we should really save the cost of constructing about 200 miles of line in connection with the railway to Port Darwin. From time to time the proposal to construct this transcontinental line has been bitterly opposed by newspapers in the eastern States, that have described the country to be traversed as a sandy desert. I am glad to know, however, that the exact position of the sandhills to which these newspapers have referred has been fixed, and that they are 170 miles inside the South Australian border. As a matter of fact, they are not within Western Australian That territory. As I have often told the House, the timber belt extends from Kalgoorlie for a distance of 160 or 170 miles east, and the country thereafter to be traversed consists of good grass and good edible bush lands. For a distance of 160 or 170 miles from the South Australian border the line will traverse really splendid country, which will feed stock. Western Australia to-day is exporting more timber and producing more gold than all the other States put together. In a few years we shall be able to say the same of our wheat production. It is only a matter of time. Great wheat areas are now being opened up in the West, and we have also an area big enough to enable us to produce, I hope, quite as much wool as all the other States combined now do. We have the finest and the largest areas that have ever been opened up in Australia for the production of apples and other fruits of that class. The apples which were sent from Western Australia to England last year fetched double the price which apples from other parts of Australia realized. about 2s. per case more. lutely twice the price. No doubt one reason for the better prices realized for Western Australian fruit is that we are at least seven or eight days nearer the English market than are the eastern States. That saving of time in the carriage of perishable products to the English market must be of very great importance. Apples from blight and pests. They are clear of all marks and blemishes, and are a very fine fruit. Indeed, I have never seen apples equal to those grown in the southern part of Western Australia. It is well known that no better grapes are grown than those produced in the West, and the same may be said of our oranges. Just before I left Perth to attend the present session of Parliament, I saw in Sandover's window, in Hay-street, navel oranges which we're larger than any I had ever seen before.",28,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading

Much attention has been devoted to the question of gauge, and some of the utterances of honourable members on this phase of the subject have been rather selfish. It is astonishing to he can place an order for rolling-stock for me that Victoria should claim to have a voice with respect to the gauge of this line, seeing that years ago the Government of this State recognised that its 5-ft. 3-in. gauge was altogether useless in connection with the opening up of large areas. They went one better than Queensland and Western Australia by building 2-ft. 6-in. railways, instead of 3-ft. 6-in., to open up their timber areas. , Lines whicb had to carry heavy loads^ and the longest timber that could' be obtained in Victoria, were built on a 2-ft. 6-in. gauge. two little tramways. money has to be expended the Victorians are nationalists, and claim that the Victorian standard railway gauge is the right one to be adopted for Australia, but when they have to spend their own money they are quite content with a narrower gauge. And so with South Australia. South Australian Government commenced to open up their big northern areas with a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge railway. They carried that line as far as Terowie, and there they stopped, saying, '' We cannot go on at this rate. We have spent more money than we can afford."" South Australia is the only State in the Commonwealth with three breaks of gauge in its territory-on e at Wolseley, one at Hamley Bridge, and one at Terowie. South Australians would never have opened up their country if they had not abandoned the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge for the 3-ft. 6-in. The whole of QueensThen; is a bi{; stretch of country land, one of the most magnificent areas in the Commonwealth, has been opened up by means of the 3-ft. 6-in. gaugea splendid gauge for opening up country. It Had Queensland and Western Australia been foolish enough in the first place to In begin with a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge their country would never have been opened up today, as they could not have afforded to build the lines. Victoria went one step My sole desire is too far the other way in adopting a 2-ft. 6-in. gauge for some lines. The Commonwealth is taking the middle course in I wish adopting the standard gauge of the world a gauge over which nine-tenths of the traffic of the world is being carried, and which has been approved by all the engineers who have special knowledge of the subject. One can place an order in England or America for rolling-stock for the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge much cheaper than outside gauges. If a man requires rolling-stock constructed in England or America on a 3-ft. 6-in. or 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, he has to pay a bigger percentage per ton. In England the workshops where rolling-stock for the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge is constructed are absolutely separated from the workshops for the construction of the standard gauge stock, although both may belong to the same people. Not even a spanner or other appliance used for the making of 4-ft. 8j-in. material is used for the manufacture of 3-ft. 6-in. maThey were only terial. The 4-ft. 8£-in., the standard gauge of the world, has carried up to date the whole of the traffic of England, and practically all fhe traffic of America. That being so, honourable members who advocate the use of a broader gauge are looking too far ahead. ber admits that it must come in fhe future? members who think that the traffic between Western Australia and Port Augusta will increase to such an extent that a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge will not carry it could not use a better argument in favour of building the line. Statements have been made in the House that Mr Harriman, the great American railway owner and railway stock manipulator, advocated the use of a broader gauge. So he did at one time, but my impression is that he did it to make the public believe he was carrying a great deal more freight than",29,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading

171,The Mr Hedges,"I do not. Honorablewas actually the case, and thereby to increase the value of his shares in certain railways. When the proposal for adopting a broader gauge was inquired into the experts condemned it absolutely. In their report they said, "" If a 4-ft. 8j-in: gauge single line will not carry the traffic, duplicate it. If it will not carry it then, duplicate it again and again in preference to building a line on a broader gauge."" There are many reasons for this, one of them being that the weight of the rolling stock is increased out of all proportion to the carrying capacity of the vehicles. The sleepers for a broad gauge railway require to be strengthened out of all proportion as compared with the sleepers necessary for an ordinary track. In building a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge line now, the sleepers have to be of such a prohibitive price that the South Australian people are putting in steel sleepers on the line between Adelaide and Melbourne. If we adopted so expensive a system for a line across such a long stretch of country as that between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie,' we should be undertaking a task that we could never afford to carry out. In America the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge runs over treble the length of country, and the most luxurious trains in the world travel on it. If that gauge is good enough for America, it is good enough foi Australia. Had it been proposed to adopt the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge I should have been against it ; had it been proposed to use the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, I should also have been against it ; but we can afford to build the line on the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge. By so doing we shall be making that gauge the standard for Australia, and we shall be thanked for doing it in years to come. One effect will be to bring the States into line. I do not claim that it will be necessary to alter all the gauges in Australia. The Engineer-in-Chief of South Australia, in a recent report, said it would make things very bad for the travelling public of South Australia, but I do not see what difference it would make to the people travelling from Port Augusta to Adelaide, as they have been doing for the last twenty years, if we built our line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie 10 feet wide. It is simply a matter for the South Australian Government to alter their own facilities as the Western Australian Government propose to do,.and will shortly do. Let Victoria abandon her selfish feelings, and alter her own tracks, and let South Australia alter hers. The Western Australian people prepared for the change when they built the Midland Junction works in a manner suitable for alteration to a 4-ft. 8^-in. construction. They looked ahead, knowing that this line would come through from the East, and that it must be on a different gauge from that hitherto used in Western Australia. The proposal that the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge should be adopted reminds me of the recruit who, when he was told that he was out of step, expected all the others in the squad to alter their step. All credit is due to the New South Wales people for starting on the right track by adopting the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge. The Commonwealth Government by adopting it are doing the right thing. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. railway is absolutely necessary, and that it will go to a part of Australia which is much better fitted for settlement than some honourable members would lead us to believe. Western Australia has been greatly de-. veloped since 1893. At that time the eastern States were almost on their uppers. Prices were very low for grain and for horses, cattle, and all kinds of stock. Draught horses, which now fetch £ 6 0 per head, could then be bought for £ 1 4 per head. The development of Western Australia was seriously commenced and a great forward movement made at that time, when the eastern States required all the assistance that could be given them. I do not know where they would have drifted to if it had not been for Western Australia. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, in a manner which I am sure is quite foreign to his nature, appeared today to be in a mood to disagree with everything. He disagreed with the proposed gauge of the railway, with the omission to secure grants of land from the State Governments on either side of the line, and he even went so far as to disagree with his colleague on the other side, the honourable member for Maranoa. He reminded me of a story I once heard of a testy old Church of England minister, of whom it is said that he disagreed with every congregation wherever he was appointed,' and, ultimately, when he was sent to the South Sea Islands as a missionary, and was there killed and eaten, he disagreed with the savages. There is very little in the honourable member's argument with respect to the reservation of land on either side of the railway, because",30,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading

175,Mr Mathews,"They were like a lotquiet before the honourable member arrived. As a matter of fact, although most of my interests are connected with the gold-fields, I represent a coastal constituency, and the big agricultural development in the West has been made possible largely by the expenditure of money earned on the goldfields. The honourable member knows little of Western Australia if he thinks that the construction of the Esperance line is a necessary preliminary to the making of the proposed railway. The antagonism that he speaks of is so much froth. A man generally finds what he looks for. As Eben Holden said, "" There aint no trouble in this world unless you go round looking for it . "" If the honourable member found a feeling of antagonism he must have been nosing round for it. He would have been much happier had he mixed with persons of a more genial nature, like himself. I am sorry that I had not the opportunity of seeing him, and keeping him clear of the trouble which he appears to have got into. I trust that the second reading of this Bill will be carried, and that the line will be constructed as early as possible on a gauge of A ft8J in. Following two representatives of the State, it is needless for me to extol the wonderful productiveness and mineral resources of Western Australia. Of the future of the State no honourable member has any doubt; but, like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I think that we should have the fullest information before entering upon a work the cost of which will be exceptionally large. On questions of expenditure we must accept the judgment of engineers, but my reading leads me to think that the opinion is coming to be held by authorities on the subject that in closely-settled districts, or for long haulage, the gauge of 4 f t . 8J in. is not as good""* as a wider gauge. The honourable member for Fremantle spoke of the need for the line for the defence of Australia, but it seems to me that if the leading countries of the world all use the 4 ft, 8£ in. gauge it would be an advantage for Australia to have another gauge, so that should she be attacked it would be more difficult for her enemies to use her railways. Men accustomed to the control of railways constructed on a 4 f t . 8J in. gauge might be somewhat at a loss if asked to control some other gauge. Even Australian experts are not unanimous regarding the wisdom of adopting a 4 f t . 8J in. gauge. Two gentlemen of eminence in the engineering world here suggest another gauge. One is Mr Hales, an engineer with thirty-eight lyears of experience in Tasmania and New Zealand, and the other is Mr Smith, who is also an ""engineer. The honourable member for Fremantle, with his wide knowledge of contracting in connection with railway construction, must know that where a country is mountainous a narrower gauge than would be employed in plain country is usually adopted. But, according to the right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Fremantle, the proposed transcontinental railway presents no engineering difficulties whatever on account of the exceptionally level nature of the country to be traversed. It seems to me that that is an additional reason why we should adopt a wider gauge than the 4 f t . 8J in. In this connection certain figures which I have obtained are decidedly interesting. I find that New South Wales has constructed 3,643 miles of railway of 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge at a cost of £48,925,348, or £13,430 per mile. Victoria has built 3,383 miles of railway of 5-ft. 3-in. gauge at a cost of £42,453,801, or £12,549 per mile. Thus the wider gauge employed in Victoria has cost nearly £1,000 per mile less than the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge has cost New South Wales. Wales the railways climb mountains 4,000 feet high. constructed 599 miles of railway of 5-ft. 3-in. gauge at a total cost of £6,670,794, or £11,136 per mile. In other words, her railways have been builtI admit that they mostly traverse level country-for £2,000 per mile less than those of New South Wales with the lesser gauge.

South Australia also built 1,313 miles of railway of 3-ft 6-in. gauge at a cost of £7,737>738, or an average cost of £5)892 per mile. In the Northern Territory there are 145 miles of railway on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, which cost £1,180,155, or £8,111 per mile. Queensland has constructed 3,661 miles of railway of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge at a total cost 0 1 £24,336,372, or £6,648 per mile.

But, notwithstanding that such a stage of perfection in haulage has been reached in America, operation now in Australia? Mr Harriman declared his belief that it was necessary to adopt a wider gaugeeither a 5-ft. 6-in. or even a 6-ft. gauge. In this Parliament we hear a good deal about the national view which we ought Tasmania has to take of things. In this matter we should certainly, as far as we possibly can, take the broadest view. We should consider what has been accomplished and the difficulties that have had to be overcome in other countries in connection with the haulage of goods. In America at the present time considerable difficulties are being experienced on many main lines owing to the congestion of traffic, and it was owing to this fact that a great railway man like Mr Harriman made the In Tasmania suggestion that the gauge should be wider. The railway between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta will, of course, be a long-distance line upon which haulage will be a very important factor. Engineers have stated that engines that can be placed upon a 5-ft. 3-in. railway can be constructed at least 20 per cent, heavier than with the narrower gauge, and have a 10 per cent, heavier load than can the The largest engines running on a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge railway. That point is worthy of some thought. If we can build an engine to run on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge line that will pull a 10 per cent, bigger load than the largest engine that can be placed on a 4-ft. 8£-in. line, the wider gauge is cerversion has to be tackled the cost to the States and to the Commonwealth-whic h will probably have to come to the assistance of the States-ma y probably lead to the In Vicintroduction of what is known as the third line on the wider gauge railways during the transition period.

From north to south, Australia covers 1.900 miles, and from east to west, 2,500 miles. there are long-distance lines in America, and there the engineers contend that 5-ft. 3-in. gauge railways are by far the more desirable lines to construct. I wish now to quote from an address delivered by Mr Perth, and to journey from Fremantle Alex. Smith, in which he gives the history of railway gauges in Australia. He saysIn the "" fifties"" far-seeing advisers of the Colonies, who had a near acquaintance with the merits of the gauge controversy, decided upon the broader "" Irish,"" or 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. The Colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia endorsed the choice, and made it the standard-in New South Wales by Act of Parliament. Possibly an even wider gauge might have been recommended had rolling-stock of wider gauge been a market article. Victoria and South Australia abode loyally by the contract and commenced construction. Then New South Wales changed its policy, its engineer, and its gauge, and the unique opportunity for obtaining uniformity was wilfully thrown away. Since then various other gauges have been introduced, on the plea of their suitability for cheap pioneer development. That claim-temporar y expediency-is the only valid reason for their introduction. Of course, I can quite understand that in the purely developmental stages of the history of the Australian States it may have been necessary to build narrow-gauge lines to provide ready means of bringing produce to market. where country is mountainous and difficult a narrow-gauge line may be advantageous. But we have been reminded by the right honourable member for Swan that in connection with the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta there will be no considerable engineering difficulties. Therefore, I contend,^ the broader the gauge the more suitable it 'will be. I do not say that I intend to vote against this Bill unless the gauge be fixed at 5 f t . 3 in., but when an honourable member has any information to give bearing upon an important point, it is right that he should lay it before the House. If we pass this Bill containing a clause providing for a 4ft. 8£-in. gauge, it seems to me that we shall have fixed the railway gauge of Australia practically for all time. If we do that we-, may some day awaken to. the fact that we have made a mistake in not adopting the wider gauge, so that bigger loads might be drawn. Certainly, for the present, we shall not have a very great traffic on the line. But almost from the start, in my opinion, we shall have This is a country of vast disa consideiable passenger traffic. I believe that there are many people in the eastern States who would be more ready to take It will be admitted that a trip to Europei f they could avoid the rough voyage across the Bight by taking train to Perth. When this line is built a person will be able to take train all the way from Brisbane to the steamer at to Marseilles in three weeks. We shall be able to travel by train practically from one side of Australia to the other. That will be, I think, very desirable. I believe that from the very opening of the line the passenger traffic will be a very considerable factor. can discard the possibility of the mono-rail coming into use? to suggest that the profession of engineering has reached the highest pitch of perfection or exhausted all the ideas which are to be evolved in this world. It would be contrary to the history of that great profession if I were to make such a statement. I do not know of a profession which is engaged more deeply in study and researchin respect to improvements to machines of various kinds, and particularly to railway locomotion, than the engineers whom we have in Australia and in other parts of the world. It .is quite possible that before I also admit that many sleepers have been laid on this transcontinental line a discovery may be made which will transform methods of transit. In the meantime we have to come to a decision. I do not know that much has been done in respect to the mono-rail. I should hardly like to glide over country in a train running on one rail, and that is why I favour the adoption of the broad gauge. I prefer to ride in a vehicle with a fair sized under-carriage. only used for light traffic. bably before our transcontinental railway is completed we may find that the engineers in some parts of the world have changed their minds in respect to the laying of railway tracks. I propose to make other quotations. I have shown that the",34,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading

196,Mr Fenton,No. I am not going,35,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading
197,Mr Fowler,S o far the mono-rail is,35,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading
198,Mr Fenton,"I believe so. Proengineers at one time decided that the gauge for South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales should be 5 f t . 3 in . ; but, owing to a change of engineer, and perhaps to a change of Government or policy in the Mother State, they decided to have a 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge. In fact, I understand that an Act was passed to fix the gauge at 5 f t . 3 in . , but afterwards the narrower gauge of 4 ' f t . 8J in. was adopted. Referring to gauges, in the address he delivered before the Society of Engineers, this speakerMr Alex. Smith, President of the Australian Institute of EngineerssaidFor instance, Britain, with every point comparatively near to a port, furnishes no parallel. That is a very important matter. That is where narrow gauges apply, owing to the mountainous condition of the country, such as in Tasmania and New Zealand. Tasmania is a country with many ports, New Zealand is in a like position. That is a great advantage, because in each case it has led to that decentralization which we all desire to see brought about. On the mainland the produce of each State is practically shipped to one port. New South Wales they are doing better than they did owing to the national programme which was recently submitted. I believe that in Queensland produce is shipped from more ports than one. In New Zealand and Tasmania the people enjoy what may be termed that decentralization which leads to great development of the country. New Zealand has very many ports at which boats call and take in produce. That means that a railway is running to each port, and that the whole traffic is not concentrated in one great centre, as in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, and, I presume, Perth, too. tinent accounts for that. considerable quantity of the produce of Victoria should be shipped at Portland. That would lead to decentralization and to producers having a lot more money left in their pockets, instead of having to pay it away in freights. I do not think for a moment that the fact that Great Britain has adopted a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge is an argument in favour of its adoption by Australia. Certainly we find a nearer parallel in America, where goods are carried vast distances. Mr Smith continuesFor instance, Britain, with every point comparatively near to a port, furnished no parallel. The writer has computed, by graphic approximation, the relation of area served to length of haul in Australia. The mean direct distance from the coast of the whole area of the continent proves to be about 219 miles. The maximum haul is measured by the distance between the oceans. As regards haulage, the comparisons with the other countries run as follow :United Kingdom, 25 miles; Russia, 152 miles; Germany, 62 miles; France, 78 miles; Austria, 65 miles; Canada (Companies), 183 miles; Canada (Government), 234 miles; Argentine, 63 miles; United States, 132 miles. These figures indicate that Australian lines, with the exception of Government lines in Canada, have the longest mean direct distances. That we have vast distances to travel is, I believe, an argument, especially if the country is fairly level, in favour of adopting a wider gauge. I hope that the question of gauge will be thoroughly discussed, so that we may be able to give an intelligent vote. Continuing, Mr Smith saysThus, the Australian gauge must be an economic long-distance gauge; for every ton carried should earn a return over -all charges, when rated at a tariff which permits of worldcompetition. If the products are carried at In rates less than reproductive rates, then the disabilities of the transport facilities are being covered by undue charges upon those short hauls, or those valuable commodities, upon which surcharge is not so easily apparent. Or, still more important, development by rail is confined to a coastal fringe, or regions of special fertility or wealth, whilst the interior is neglected. But a national, in contradistinction to a parochial, policy of gauge must 'contemplate the development of the whole of the resources of Australia, as well poor land as good, as well distant as near. These appear to me to be words of wisdom coming from an acknowledged authority whose opinions are corroborated and substantiated by the opinions of others. Wherever such conditions arise, financial success has been sought in the direction of increasing the train weights and decreasing the relative number of trains run, in an endeavour to miniT o a large extent. A mize labour costs and ensuing expenditures. The United States again furnish the nearest parallel. Their freight trains have obtained abnormal weight. They are drawn by locomotives twice, and even thrice, the weight of the heaviest Australian engine. All this on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, and until we have reached a similar intensity of traffic, that gauge would suffice here. That bears out what I stated a little while ago, that while some of our heaviest engines pulling the biggest loads weigh only a little over 100 tons, in America they are running engines weighing nearly 400 tons, and on a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge. According to the best judges, they have reached a limit beyond which they cannot go, and it is either a",35,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading
199,Mr Sampson,The size of the con,36,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading
200,Mr Fenton,"question of increasing the weight, size, and haulage power of the engines, which, of course, can only be done by widening the tracks, or of continuing as they are doing. It is well known that on many of the American railways the traffic is congested. If they have arrived at that position in America, should we not be very careful here in our choice of a gauge? Regarding the cost of conversion, Mr Smith gives an exampleAs an example : In 1S97 a Railway Commission met to determine the relative costs of conversion of the 4-ft. 85-in. to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge', or vice versd, in the colonies of ffew South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The mileage then involved, considered as single track, totalled 7,849, as against 9,407 now, the length to be altered being dependent, of course, upon the gauge selected. The conversion costs, including rolling stock and all charges, were estimated to be :-4 f t . 8^ in. lo 5 f t . 3 in. ... £4,260,000 5 f t . 3 in. to 4 f t . 8£ in. ... £2,360,500 .Difference If the broad gauge possesses the advantages claimed for it by experts, the estimated cost of under £2,000,000 does not appear to me to be very great; indeed, if the Commonwealth and the States were prepared to share the expenditure it would be a mere bagatelle to each. other question is whether the Western Australian . Government and the South Australian Government intend to treat the Commonwealth fairly in respect to land grants on either side of the line. Certain powers of resumption are given by the B ill ; but, considering the immense value of this project to the two States concerned, and the vast tracts of territory at their disposal, it would be only fair that certain areas should be handed over as I suggest. This line will undoubtedly lead to considerable development; and if the desire is to encourage settlement along the route, I know nothing that could be more conducive to that end than liberality on the part of the two State Governments in the matter of land concessions. Before the Bill passes, I hope we shall receive some kind of assurance that the States will, I shall not say come to our rescue, but come to our help in the construction of the line. Although the preponderance of evidence appears, at present to be on the side of the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, we should consider the question well; and T am not inclined to take exception to the gauge favoured by the Government, if we can; as the result of negotiations, obtain considerable concessions in land along the route. There will be a great army of railway men employed in the construction and management of the line; and, doubtless, at stopping places and railway stations, centres of population will have to be provided for; and, under all the circumstances, the State Governments should in no way stint the Commonwealth in regard to land. Without reference to arbitration or litigation, it ought to be an easy matter to arrange for the granting of land along either side of the railway; and there is not the slightest doubt that such land would be put to the best use by the Commonwealth. In many instances the Western Australians, advanced as they are, might by this means be given many object lessons in agriculture. The majority of honourable members seem to be against the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge; and we should weigh well the opinions of men who know what they are talking about. Above all, I hope that strong pressure of the right kind will ... ... £1,899,500 be brought to bear on the two State Governments to induce them to confer on the Commonwealth the benefit of extensive land grants in connection with this great project of railway construction. matter of great satisfaction to a Western The only Australian like myself, who has been in the House since its inception, to notice the great change in the opinion of honourable members with regard to this railway scheme. During this debate the issue has been one of ways and means rather than one involving any condemnation of the project as a whole; and yet not so many years ago the proposal was as often as not jeered at as an utterly impracticable and wild-cat notion. However, we are leaving that tendency almost entirely behind ; and it is only by way of interjection that I have heard any of the old objections raised during this debate. The '' desert'' in some way or other has mysteriously disappeared, in the opinion of honourable members, who are actually realizing that this part of the continent has great potentialities, and that it is worth the while of the Commonwealth to acquire some portion of it for special development. That of itself is a very significant change. I suppose that if a few years ago the country between Kalgoorlie and the confines of settlement in South Australia had been offered to the Commonwealth, it would have been rejected with scorn; but now we are confronted with quite a series of proposals,",36,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading
201,Mr Fowler (Perth) [3.10],"It is awhich show that this so-called worthless country is highly desirable to the Commonwealth for the purposes of settlement, and is worth casting envious eyes on. It is by no means the best part of the continent; but I have always held, and hold now more strongly than ever, that, when the railway is constructed, there will practically be added to Australia a new province. We hear occasionally, even now, in certain quarters, of the "" sands "" of Western Australia. I am, perhaps, as well acquainted with Western Australia as most people. I have travelled many thousands of miles in that State, and I am also fairly well acquainted with the other States; and I say, without hesitation, that, if we exclude the coastal strip, especially on the western part, which undoubtedly is a sandy belt deriving its origin from the sea, there is as little sand relatively in Western Australia as in any State of the Commonwealth. On the gold-fields honourable members will be surprised to discover, instead of sand, a soil of a very high character indeeda rich chocolate loam that only requires water to be made to produce in abundance. As one with some interest in horticulture, I think the finest display of flowers I ever saw in my life was in the gardens of the Kalgoorlie racecourse. play which for quantity, quality, vigor, and variety of bloom, I think I have never seen equalled. While it is admitted that most of the country to be traversed by the railway is suitable for pastoral purposes, it will be found, I think, that much of it is excellent for wheat-growing. To my mind, it resembles very much, both as regards the character of the soil and the rainscant encouragement given to immigration fall, the Mallee country of the north of Victoria. Again, we have history repeating itself. twenty years ago, I was assured on all sides that the Mallee was an absolutely worthless desert. To-day, it is, as Ave know, a great wheat-producing area. I have also in my possession a book giving the experiences of an old pioneer in Australia some sixty years ago, in which he stated that at that time all the land west of the track between Melbourne and Sydney was considered worthless. Thus we see that time brings with it very significant changes, and in no respect shall we have a greater change of opinion than will follow the opening up of the alleged desert of Western Australia. phates has helped us greatly of late years. line will traverse a lot of limestone country, and nothing better could be found for wheat-growing. It is interesting to notice how, in connection with this railway scheme, we have repeated practically the experience of Canada. British Columbia, the western State of Canada, for many years agitated, and even threatened separation, in a vain attempt to obtain railway communication with the eastern States. The people of the eastern States, however, scoffed at the idea. Such a railway, it was said, would not pay the cost of greasing the axles. It was absolutely impracticable as an engineering proposal, it was urged, but the scheme was at last carried into effect. The line was completed, I think, in 1885, and since then Canada has never looked back. Most of those who have written and spoken authoritatively on the affairs of Canada have stated very definitely that its progress and development have been due to a very large extent to the construction of that great transcontinental railway. The Canadians are now about to carry a second line through even more formidable country, and I believe it will again open up large areas for settlement, and so help very largely to develop the material resources of Canada and of the Empire as a whole. The honourable member for Melbourne Forts suggested, I think, that if a certain area of land on each side of the railway were granted to the Commonwealth we should be able to proceed with its development and settlement in a much better way than would be possible on the part of any of the States. I wonder whether he made that statement in earnest? I wonder if he thought for a moment of the up to the present by the Commonwealth? Did he wish us to believe that the CommonWhenI came to Australia wealth policy of leaving immigration almost severely alone, and, consequently, of doing little or nothing to settle our waste areas, was likely to be modified in any respect by the present Government? When the little that has been done by the Commonwealth in settling people on bur waste areas is compared with the work of such a State as Western Australia, we must come to the conclusion that such lands as we are now considering can be much better left in the hands of the States to develop.

205,Mr Fowler,"That is true. Thisone in which I am particularly interested. The gauge, in all probability, will be either 4 f t . 8J in. or 5 f t . 3 in. It is a matter of comparative indifference to Western Australia which of the two is selected. Whichever gauge is chosen will be, in the near future I hope, the uniform gauge for Australia. The 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge appears to be the one which could be adopted as the standard for Australia with the least possible delay and expense. For that reason, therefore, I am inclined to favour it. We have been, given some interesting figures showing the comparative cost of construction of the railways of the various gauges in the several States, but those figures prove nothing unless all the circumstances are taken into consideration. Without going fully into all the pros and cons, it is obvious that, other things being equal, a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge railway can be constructed for less than a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge line. With all respect to those who have brought forward extracts from a pamphlet which was recently circulated, I have not yet heard in this House any definite proof that a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge offers adstructed, and that we differ only in matters vantages over a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge. Mr of detail. I hope that no time will be lost Harriman has been quoted, but his opinions are not those of an engineering expert. Moreover, it is more than possible that in representing his railways as being overcrowded with traffic, he knew that he was doing something that would have a material effect in increasing the price of the shares. It is a fact, however, that his engineers reported adversely on every proposal to broaden the lines, and recommended instead a duplication of the existing lines on a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge. I understand that many engineers 'who have considered this matter quite impartially have come to the conclusion that to put the heavier weight of engines and rolling-stock generally on a broader gauge would of necessity interfere seriously with the efficiency of the work performed, and that, all things considered, we get a maximum of strength and lightness, combined with carrying powers, from a 4-ft. 8J-in. line. That, at all events, as I understand it, is the conhave put in a few years on the gold-fields. clusion of engineers in general. may be one here and there who differs from that view, but I have yet to be made acquainted with any considerable body of thought in engineering circles that has been directed against the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. Incidentally, the honourable member for Maribyrnong, in dealing with the railways of Natal, brought out an interesting compari[29] son of the cost of railway construction by white and black labour. Many years have elapsed since the father of the present Lord Brassey demonstrated to his own satisfaction, and afterwards to the general public, in a book which he wrote, that the white navvy is far and away superior, even from the point of view of cheapness, to the coloured navvy, and that the British navvy was again superior to the Continental. Mr Brassey actually took his British navvies to various parts of the world, where he had to pay them higher rates than usual, because he found that they were so much more efficient than the native labour in those parts. I have no hesitation in concluding that if the supervision is effective, and the work carried out in a business-like way, we shall be able to put this railway through at, perhaps, .as low a cost as has been the case in any other part of the world. We have discussed all the other phases of this project ad nauseam, and I am glad that we have reached the point when we are all convinced that the railway must be conin carrying the project into effect, and feel sure that the benefit will not be so much to Western Australia as to the Commonwealth as a whole. Western Australia does not stand to gain such a great deal from this railway as very many people imagine, and may be rather the loser by it, in some respects. In the early days of Federation, and previous to that, the people who came to Western Australia during the gold boom looked with anxious eyes to that great extent of country between themselves and their homes in the eastern States, and wished ardently for the time when it would be bridged by steel rails. That state of mind on the part of the residents of Western Australia is now disappearing. The people are settling down in the State for good. They are finding out that it is by no means so bad as it was represented. Their experiences of it have been, on the whole, satisfactory, even in the case of those who There Instead of going back to the eastern States, they have made up their minds to use the little money they have saved, in order to settle on the land in the agricultural districts. Consequently, there is not such a great and overwhelming desire in Western Australia for this railway as there used to be. Again, we have a very efficient fleet of steamers, equal in point of comfort to any in other parts of the world, and the majority of people who travel to and from Western Australia find the sea voyage by no means unpleasant. It offers attractions by way of a change that many would continue to take advantage of, even though the railway were constructed. frain from visiting the West because of the sea voyage. I know many who take that view. people of AVestern Australia, and especially those of the coastal parts, are not so anxious for this railway as they were a few years ago. They realize that it will give the direct trade of a considerable portion of the gold-fields into the hands of the business men of the eastern States; and there is no doubt that, on the whole, it will pay to send perishable products across by ""rail to the gold-fields, rather than by the roundabout route which has now to be -traversed. The people of Western Australia' desire to see the line constructed, largely for a sentimental reason. They feel that they are outside of the Federation, and that, until the ""line is constructed, Western .Australia will remain practically an island -isolated by a sea voyage from the rest of -the continent. They look forward to a time when, with the assistance of the railway, the port of Fremantle will be one of the front doors of the Commonwealth. It will be, at any rate, the front door to Europe, just as, I believe, Sydney will be the front door to America. On account, also, of the railway, we in the West will, perhaps, acquire a greater amount of popularity, by reason of our insularity being diminished. People will get to know Western Australia better, and we shall benefit by reason of the amount of traffic to and through our country, which to many outside of the State is, at the present day, a country notable for its disadvantages rather than its advantages. 'The future, I believe, is all with the West, and we have only relatively started on our career of progress. This railway will not make us or mar us to any great extent, but it will carry out the Federal compact. shall be adding very materially to the general prosperity of the Commonwealth, increasing its efficiency in the matter of defence, and enhancing that solidarity of the nation which we all desire to see built up. wish to congratulate the Honorary Minisbetter ter, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, upon having had sufficient influence with the Cabinet to have this measure placed in the forefront of the Ministerial programme. It is certainly a great achievement on his part, and merits recognition; and I have great pleasure in extending to it my recognition at this moment. The Government, before bringing down a proposal to expend No doubt some people re£4,000,000 or £5,000,000 However, in my experience, the £4,000,000. understood was the present estimate. The Government, before launching the measure, should have given the House some idea of how they intended to raise the money. We should be told whether the non-borrowing policy is to be adhered to in regard to the line, and whether, when the Budget is brought down, it will contain a proposal for a further instalment of taxation to meet the cost of construction. It was certainly the duty of the Government to give some intimation to the House as to the method to be employed to find the very large sum of money necessary in this case. Whatever objections I have to the Bill can well be reserved for the Committee stage. My principal objection relates to tbe question of the gauge, which has been exhaustively dealt with by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. I hope, when the Bill is in Committee, an opportunity will be given to take a test division on the question of the gauge to be adopted. The proposal to construct this line on the 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge will, in my opinion, only accentuate the difficulties of the battle of the gauges experienced in Australia at the present time. Our railways have cost £150,000,000 to construct, and the expenditure of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 in addition in laying down the very best possible gauge for the future need not weigh with this House to any extent. Although the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge is the standard gauge in the leading countries of the world, it is not by any means proved that it is the best gauge to adopt. All the world over improvements are being made in In constructing it, we railway construction, and the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge has failed where the greatest test has been applied to it. We have American experience showing that the matter of the gauge has been seriously discussed by the greatest railway authorities in the world, and they have arrived at the conclusion that a wider gauge than 4-ft. 8j-in. is suited than is that gauge for densely populated districts with long haulages of",38,Kalgoorlie To Port Augusta Railway Bill Second Reading

208,Mr Sampson,"I was giving what Iheavy traffic. "" The Western Australian people have made good their claim to be connected by railway with the eastern States. When the Bill for the acceptance of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth was under discussion, the immediate construction of a transcontinental line through that Territory was successfully challenged in some quarters, on the ground that there was no reasonable objective for it. But the people'of Western Australia, by their efforts in the development of the State, and the extension of their public works, have established a claim for the construction of this line ' which can no longer be denied. I think the Government might, in submitting this proposal, have given the House some further information respecting the mono-rail, which has not been tested to any considerable extent in Australia. New systems of railway construction are being continually proposed, and we might have had the latest information on that new proposition in railway construction before we were asked to commit ourselves to the expenditure involved in the construction of this railway.' I have said that I intend to reserve what I have to say on the question of the gauge for the Committee stage. I trust that when .that stage is reached we shall be given an opportunity to test the opinion of honourable members on the subject. From recent reports of the' country through which this line will pass, and in view of constant discoveries of new methods of agriculture, I hope we shall find that, as the honourable member for Perth has suggested, this line will open up a new agricultural province for Australia. I hope, also that before very long the great western State of this Commonwealth will be connected by rail with the eastern States. Debate (on adjourned. NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION.
