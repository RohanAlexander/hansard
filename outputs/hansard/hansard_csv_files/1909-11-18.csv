Were the matter not of such grave importance, I should wait until the Estimates of the Department of the Postmaster General came before us to criticise its administration. staggerer to honourable gentlemen, particular-ly the representatives of Queensland, to learn that not a mile of new telegraph line, except in connection with new railways, has been erected in that State since Federation was inaugurated. It is a very fine thing for the State that Federation did not come about a few years earlier. While the Department of the Postmaster-General has been busy undergrounding telephone wires in the other States, it has wholly failed to extend the Queensland telegraph {Format). system. I asked the Secretary to the Department for a return showing tbe mileage of new wire, or a list of the new lines, erected since Federation, and the information with which he has supplied me bears nut my statement. Prior to Federation it was customary for the State Parliament to grant £ 5 0 , 0 6 0 or ,£60,000 annually for telegraph extension, but since Federation not a penny has been placed on our Estimates for that purpose, so fa r as Queensland is concerned. Tbis is a most serious matter the removal of the administration of the Department from Brisbane to Melbourne having had very serious consequences for it. COAL been very patient. Department has erected new telegraph lines only where it was forced to do so, namely, along new railway lines, where it was compelled to !>hare the cost with the Railway Department. In my electorate there are persons who are hundreds of, and in some which 1 have received from the Secretary to the Department is dated the 10th November, and is as follows: Sir,-With reference to your recent verbal inquiry as to how many new telegraph line extensions, apart from those along railways, have been provided in Queensland since the transfer of this Department to the. Commonwealth, I have .the honour to forward herewith copy of a statement furnished by the. Deputy Postmaster General, Brisbane, showing, in detail, the information desired by you. I have been carefully through the list, and have ascertained that what are referred to as telegraph extensions are in every instance telephone extensions.

11,Land Settlement Has Increased Mr Page,"In three years only oneYet the Postal Department expects postal services to be carried out at exactly the same prices as previously. stance, a man demands -£i6o to run a service, because horse flesh is dearer and wages are higher, the Department requires the work to be done for £130, the amount which it paid ten years before. The officials overlook the fact 'hat Queensland has now a Wages Board system, and that the Federal Arbitration award operates in the western districts, where drivers have to be paid proper wages, and are only permitted to work reasonable hours, the Department expects to get postal services run now at the same rate as it did ten years ago, quite forgetful of the fact that a horse which could then have been purchased for £10 or even £5 is now worth £40. Not only have the rates of wages and the price of horseflesh increased, but rations and everything else have risen in value. Queensland there is a potato famine, owing to the prohibition of Tasmanian potatoes. When, owing to these considerations, the cost of a postal service is increased, the Department say to the residents, ""We do not intend to give you the service unless you are prepared to make up the deficiency."" That is, I think, diabolical treatment of the men who are pioneering, and making life as easy as possible for those who live in the towns. Although these pioneers are making business for the townspeople, yet they are penalized to the extent of not id. or 2d., but 6d. or 8d. on every letter which they receive or despatch, as they have proved to my satisfaction. If the officials do not intend to run the Department for the benefit of those who live in outback places I should like to know what their policy is. Every day I receive from different parts of my electorate, particularly from the western portions, letters in which the writers complain that they are shut off from postal communication, simply because the tenders which have been received are, in the opinion of the Department, too high. Only two years ago the officials shut the people of one district off from postal communication merely because the tenderer asked for £30 more than did the previous contractor, and for several weeks the pioneers were left without their correspondence. During all that time it was lying at Morven. the nearest railway station, and in some instances men had to send 118 miles to get their letters. How long would the people of Melbourne put up with one Mr Page. delivery less per day? They would not stand such treatment for five minutes. TheyI f , for inwould have the Age and the Argus down, on the Department j they would have deputations from the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Manufactures and the honourable member for Maribyrnong would: be leading all the "" wowsers "" of this city to the Department to know why their correspondence could not be delivered as previously. I ask the Postmaster-General to look into these matters, and not to allow the officials to shuffle as they do by sending along a document which contains only half the truth. WhatI desired to know was how many miles of new telegraph lines had been constructed since Federation, but I have been furnished with a list of new telephone lines on which telegraph rates are charged. When I spoke to the Secretary over the telephone he said that to all intents and purposes these are teleI am told that in graph lines. In the official mind they may be regarded in that light, but you, sir, from your long Parliamentary experience know exactly how much value to attach to official answers. I ask the Postmaster General to make a searching inquiry regarding the postal services in Western Queensland. For many years prior to Federation the State Government dealt liberally with the pioneers in outback places, because they realized that the pioneers were making history. These men practically carried their lives in their hands when they travelled west with their herds and flocks. Of course it was not for philanthropic reasons that they endured hardships. If they had not gone west in the early days and made it possible for myself and many others to follow in their footsteps, life would have been hard in the State to-day. The State Government treated the western residents most liberally, extending every advantage which it waspossible to give, consistently with safety to the revenue. ways treated well. the honourable member for .calling me a squatter, but I would point out that the squatters in Western Queensland do not get treated one-tenth as well as do the town squatters like the honourable member and some of his class. The squatters in the western districts of my State do not get their letters delivered at their door. In many instances they have to ride 30 or 40 miles once a week,",16,Government House Gardens Cases More Than A Thousand Miles From Rolls Telephone Civilization And Nothing Has Been Done To Committee Labou Rex Improve The Means Of Telegraphic Communi Offices Cation There The Department Has Been Departments Badly Advised In This Matter The Letter

In many instances the mail services out towards Birdsville and the South Australian border have been cut off.

If he were instructed that mail services out west must be treated liberally, he would not dare to disregard that direction. their cue from the Central Office. to the Deputy Postmaster-General of Queensland to do what I ask, and he has told me that'he cannot. I , therefore, appeal to the Minister, and, judging by my own experience of his administration, I do not think that I shall appeal in vain. Does he think that Queensland has been treated I fairly in the matter of telephone ancl telegraph services in remote portions of the State, which are progressing by leaps ancl bounds? Does he think that the postal service there is what it ought to lie? Some may make impossible requests, but all that I ask is that the existing services shall be retained; that ho service shall be curtailed, and that in dealing with tenders for mail services, which are already in and have been hung up, the Department will have clue regard to the price of horseflesh and the wages paid by the tenderers. I wish to suggest to the Prime Minister, as I did last night, the desirableness of his making a statement to the House with regard to the way in which the Government propose to meet the financial obligations of the Commonwealth. We are faced today with a very serious situation. On the Treasurer's own showing, in the absence of the agreement which has been entered into with the Premiers of the States, we should have had a deficit for the financial year of £1,200,000. The right honourable gentleman, in his Budget statement, intimated that the Government proposed to issue short-dated Treasury bonds to tide them over a temporary difficulty, but I understand that since the making of the agreement with the State Premiers, that proposal has been set aside. Under the financial agreement, the State Governments have undertaken to contribute this year ,£600,000 to the cost of Old-age pensions. If that contribution be made, the estimated deficit will be reduced to £600,000. It must be remembered, however, that since the Treasurer framed his Estimates of revenue and expenditure, various proposals have been made that must involve a material increase in our expenditure. The Defence Bill, for instance, means a largely increased outlay on defence. The Naval Defence He must receive inBill, which is about to be submitted, will involve additional expenditure, and the financing of the Northern Territory is also a serious undertaking. In respect of these three matters alone, the Commonwealth must incur additional expenditure during the current financial year, and a largely increased expenditure next year. In the circumstances, therefore, it is urgently necessary for the Prime Minister to take the House into his confidence, and to state plainly how the Government propose tofinanceall these obligations. A Parliament that incurs obligations without making provision for them is sure to meet witb disaster.",17,Government House Gardens Cases More Than A Thousand Miles From Rolls Telephone Civilization And Nothing Has Been Done To Committee Labou Rex Improve The Means Of Telegraphic Communi Offices Cation There The Department Has Been Departments Badly Advised In This Matter The Letter

24,Mr Frazer (Kalgoorlie) [11.34],"-We are entitled to know -whether the Government intend to proceed with their proposal for the issue of short-dated Treasury bonds, or whether they have decided to float a loan. The Postmaster-General has this morning intimated that we shall be asked to make a further appropriation in respect of new works and buildings. belated expenditure of the last financial year. that we ought to have from the Government, before we pass the Appropriation Bill, a statement as to their financial proposals. I endeavoured last night to in-, duce the Minister of External Affairs, who was in charge of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, io give us some information on that point, but I take it that, in the absence of his chief, he did not care to do so. I desire now to refer to one or two other matters of less importance. I have the greatest sympathy with the views expressed by the honourable member for Maranoa, as to the extension of telephone and telegraph facilities in the outlying parts of the Commonwealth. I represent a large and scattered constituency, comprising many small centres of population, the permanency of which, as in the case of all mining townships, cannot be absolutely determined, and the greatest difficulty is experienced in securing for them services that the Postmaster-General's Department ought readily to supply. The stipulations imposed by the Department in connection with applications for improving the services are altogether excessive. shall not say lhat the Postmaster-General has no sympathy with residents of outlying districts, but I do submit to him that the Government, in connection with their financial proposals, should give due attention to the needs of remote parts of the Commonwealth. I come now to the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act. From a return that has been presented, I find that although the Act was passed about fifteen months ago, and has been in operation for nearly five months, over 400 claims for pensions in Western Australia still remain unheard. applications were received in that State, and these might reasonably have been dealt with before now. The ""Treasurer should ascertain the cause of the delay, and endeavour to have it removed at once, so that those who are entitled to pensions will be should have been very glad if I could able to obtain them before Christmas. Anhave avoided tbe necessity for ventilating other matter worthy the attention of honourable members is the failure of a member of the Government to record his vote last night on the motion for the third .reading of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. If the absence of the Honorary Minister from th'i division was not intentional, I shall have nothing further to say, but it is underin regard to the stood that a member of the Government is not in favour of the agreement. ber must not discuss that matter. avail myself of another opportunity. It is a matter for regret, however, that the Government are unable to act unitedly in respect to an important national question. The High Commissioner Bill is another matter to which I desire to refer. That Bill was passed by this House some time ago, and has been returned from the Senate with one or two unimportant amendments. I do not know whether the Government intend to ask the House to accept or reject those amendments, but it ought certainly 10 deal with them at once, and to make an appointment before we go into recess. The office of High Commissioner is a valuable gift at the disposal of the Ministry. The office is an important one, and one which the Government insisted upon making the subject of an Executive appointment in opposition to the wishes of a number of honourable members, and also to the terms of a resolution which was adopted in another place a few years ago. In these circumstances it is only fair that we should be afforded an opportunity of expressing I our opinions upon the selection which they may make. No less than seven years ago the Prime Minister stated that this Bill was urgently needed. There is nothing therefore to justify delay in passing it. I trust that the Prime Minister will outline the method in which he intends to finance the legislative proposals which are now before Parliament. Should he fail to do so, I can only conclude that the Ministry are content to blunder along without attempting to make any intelligent provision for meeting our obligations. I hope that a financial scheme has been considered by the Government, and that the Roughly speaking, only 2,000 honourable gentleman will be able to demonstrate that the Commonwealth Government is in a position to meet all its liabilities.",18,Government House Gardens Cases More Than A Thousand Miles From Rolls Telephone Civilization And Nothing Has Been Done To Committee Labou Rex Improve The Means Of Telegraphic Communi Offices Cation There The Department Has Been Departments Badly Advised In This Matter The Letter

I believe that the honourable member for Bendigo will prove himself a very capable Postmaster-General, and that there will be some chance of having these matters rectified if he is satisfied that there is legitimate ground for dissatisfaction.

59,Mr Johnson,"Quite so, but thattired of making requests to the Department and receiving the same stereotyped replies, all of which are unsatisfactory, and some of which are open, to serious criticism on other grounds. I do not like to occupy the time of the House with such matters, but one has to do the best one can for his constituents in meeting their requirements and providing them with the reasonable facilities to which they are entitled. As I am unable to get satisfaction in any other way, I have to endeavour to force matters to a head by taking this public method of bringing them under the notice of the Postmaster-General. I can endorse everything which has been said by the honourable member for Maranoa concerning the way in which the Department is dealing with Queensland mail services. I have had occasion to refer one or two matters to the Department, which, on the score of economy, has been depriving people of facilities which they have enjoyed for the past twenty -five years. In some instances the Department has cut down weekly mail services to fortnightly or three weekly services. ber's experience like that of the honourable member for Maranoa, that the service is worse than it was before Federation ? the number of services cut down, I believe that the condition of affairs now is worse than it was when the Department was under State control. It must be remembered that the people in the outlying country districts are pioneering. They are doing the work which makes it possible for our big cities lo exist. Nevertheless, while we are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on works that might be left over for a time, we are depriving these pioneers of the services which they have enjoyed for so long. They depend upon the weekly mail for bringing them their newspapers, and keeping them in touch with the outside world. They look forward to the coming of the mail. ' The day when their weekly letters and journals arrive is one of joy to them. Surely every facility should be given to them, rather than that we should deprive them of conveniences to which -they have been accustomed. I know that this policy is pursued on the score of economy. I do not wish for a moment to blame tbe chief of the administrative staff, Sir Robert Scott. He is in rather a difficult position. He has to stand all the blame, whilst at the same time he is unable to effect any improvements. I have heard honourable members complain that Sir Robert Scott has not had the experience necessary to enable him to conduct a* large Department, because he has come from a smaller State. But I know from personal experience that, no matter how good the schemes whicb the administrative ofiicers may adopt, they are unable to carry them out. Hitherto they have not had a strong Ministerial head who would insist that the money required to carry out schemes of reform must be found. The Department has been starved to a very large extent. No amount of efficiency or ability on the part of the administrative ofiicers could make up for the lack of funds from which the Department has suffered. What we require is a strong Minister, who will say plainly, "" If 1 am going to run this Department, it must be conducted in a proper and efficient way, and I want money for the purpose."" -If the Treasurer will not find the money, the Postmaster-General should have the courage to say, "" Very well then, you must find someone else to run the Department; I will not do it without sufficient funds."" We have been unduly economizing in order to return to the States considerably more than that to which tfiey were entitled. Naturally people are feeling the effects of our action. 1 regret very much that we should have pursued this policy, and I also think it deplorable that we have not had a Postmaster-General with sufficient backbone and courage to insist upon the requirements of his Department being met. I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister a matter m connection with the telephone system at Charters Towers which has been brought under my notice by the Chamber of Commerce and Mines. I do not desire to mention names, but can guarantee the facts. A gentleman in Charters Towers has a telephone in his own office. Wishing to communicate with his office, he rang up on a hotel telephone, and asked to be connected. He was promptly told that the person in charge could not make the connection, because the matter about which he wished to speak wa.s not one of urgency. It seems to me to be an extraordinary thing that the Department should place in the hands of a boy, at a large centre, which is one of the five largest towns in Australia outside of the metropolitan cities, the authority to determine whether any person desiring to use the telephone wishes to speak on a matter of urgency or not. The Postmaster-General will",22,Government House Gardens Cases More Than A Thousand Miles From Rolls Telephone Civilization And Nothing Has Been Done To Committee Labou Rex Improve The Means Of Telegraphic Communi Offices Cation There The Department Has Been Departments Badly Advised In This Matter The Letter

62,Mr Mcdonald,"If I may judge bydoubtless reply that the telephone which was being used was held on the flat-rate system and not on the toll rate. But that merely goes to prove the necessity for following out the policy of his predecessor, and compelling every person on the telephone to adopt the toll system. inquiring into the subject. MrM c DONALD have been inquiring too long. From conversations which I have had with officials I am satisfied that there was sufficient evidence in the office to guide. any Minister in the policy he should pursue. Buti f the Postmaster-General wished to shelve the matter it was doubtless a good idea to appoint a Committee. WhatI object to,in the case I have mentioned is that the business of determining whether a person ought to be connected was left to a boy instead of to some one of more mature mind, who would use his discretion in a more reasonable manner. The least the Department can do under the circumstances is to put a man in charge. The Postmaster General will doubtless say that the boy is able to refer cases to the postmaster. But that official is not always available to be consulted. A subscriber naturally feels very sore when a boy asks him the nature of his business, and then, tells him that it is not sufficiently urgent to permit him to be connected. If the toll system were in operation, these grievances would not occur. I regret to have to bring this case under the notice of the House, but I have already exhausted the means of protesting to the Department. The Deputy Postmaster General, when, the matter was referred to him, wrote saying that he was quite satisfied with the action taken by the boy. Sir Robert Scott, the Secretary of the Department, upheld the view of the Deputy Postmaster-General, because what was done was in pursuance of certain regulations. The policy pursued is that of protecting the revenue. was intended to prevent people, who are not subscribers, from using the telephone. But in this case it was a subscriber who wished to communicate with his own office. I think that the matter requires more caref u l attention than it has received, and hope that the Postmaster-General will make a note of it. I would urge upon the honourable gentleman that at least our big cities are entitled to more respect than they receive when a lad of fourteen or fifteen, no matter how intelligent he may be, is empowered to discriminate between what is or is not urgent. If the Department is going to insist upon the regulation being observed, the least it can, do is to put a man in charge. post-office at Longwood has for years been conducted at the railway station, but some time ago the Railway Department notified the Postal Department that they, The Committee desired its removal from the station. As there is no building in the town suitable for a post-office, it still remains at the station, and inconvenience is caused to the public by the fact that within the last twelve months the barrier system has been adopted there. The matter has been the subject of frequent communications between the people concerned and the Postal Department in Melbourne. Manv investigations have taken place, but nothing has been done. Private enterprise is prepared to erect the necessary building for a post office, and the Department are prepared to establish a semi-official office if a building is erected, but the stumbling block is that the Department are prevented by regulation from taking any building on lease for more than three years. No one in the town is prepared to go to the expense of erecting a place with a guarantee of only three years' tenure. It appears to me that in a case of this sort the regulation might reasonably be amended, for if the Department could take a lease for, say, six years there would be a prospect of settling the difficulty. One of the reasons why the Department hesitate is that they say the revenue is not as large as it ought to be to justify establishing a semi-official post office. But the cause of the telegraphic revenue, in particular, being much smaller than it would otherwise be is that the post office is on the railway station, and the primary business of the stationmaster being to conduct the Railway Department's business, it frequently happens that telegrams The .regulation in question are not dealt with as promptly as they should be. The consequence is that numbers of telegrams which would otherwise be sent, thus increasing the revenue of the Department, are not sent. Honourable members will readily perceive how the establishment of the barrier system at tlie station has increased the difficulties of the public in getting free access to the post office. I urge the Postmaster-General to see if the regulation in question cannot be amended so that the Deputy Postmaster General for Victoria could take a suitable place on lease for a period longer than",23,Government House Gardens Cases More Than A Thousand Miles From Rolls Telephone Civilization And Nothing Has Been Done To Committee Labou Rex Improve The Means Of Telegraphic Communi Offices Cation There The Department Has Been Departments Badly Advised In This Matter The Letter

In the first place, I wish to refer to mail matters at Mungana, about 12 miles from Chillagoe, and connected with Chillagoe by a railway owned and run by the Chillagoe Railway Company. Mungana has a population of 500 or 600 persons, but the only post-office is at the railway station, and is entirely under the control of the officers of the company. The mails are distributed by those officers, but if they have any of the company's work to perform, such as unloading trucks or checking invoices, the public have to wait for their letters until it has been attended to. respondence with the Department with reference to the matter, and get a stereotyped reply to the effect that when the place grows to greater dimensions a semi-official post office will be established. There are many less important places in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland which are far better served in regard to mail matters than Mungana, and I must bring this"" complaint under the notice of the Postmaster General himself, because, although I am treated with the greatest courtesy and fairness by the Department in most matters, I consider that I have not got fair play in this. Another question is that of the Townsville to Ayr telephone line. This was brought under my notice by the joint Ayr Tramway Board, which has built a tramway line connecting Townsville with Ayr. They desire that the telephone line should be erected along the tramway for their own purposes, ancl also for the convenience of the public. They have submitted to me figures, which I have handed to the Department, showing conclusively that by the Department complying with their request, a great saving would be effected in the management of the line alone, and by shortening the route, without taking into consideration the question of increased revenue. Notwithstanding this I cannot get satisfaction from the This would soon remove the Department. The other day I received from them a most remarkable letter containing the extraordinary statement that the work was not done because there was not sufficient time between the passing of the Works Estimates and the expiration of the financial year to allow it to be done. If that argument were valid it could be applied to all works, And nothing would be done. Almost every work undertaken has There are, however, some many cases part of the money has to be revoted. Why not do something this year, and, if necessary, the balance could easily he re-voted next year? The argument put forward by the Department is the weakest I have ever heard. able member that? from the Department to that effect, and sent it on to those interested, with a covering letter of my own pointing out its absurdity and saying that I proposed to take further action. I suppose the Postmaster General could obtain a copy of it in the Department. I have also been trying for some time to get a satisfactory arrangement I have been for some months in cormade regarding postal matters at Zillmanton, near Chillagoe, but have failed. The place is very badly served with reference to mails, and continual applications have been made to me, and through me to the Department, but the result so far has> been nil. The place is not so large or important as Mungana, but it deserves better treatment than it is getting. orable member wantr"" office; even a semi-official post-office will suit us. In many places the postal business is conducted in a store, which is not the most satisfactory arrangement in the world, but at the same time it is better than no postal facilities at all. All we ask in this case is that somebody should be made postmaster for the benefit of the inhabitants. I wish to make to the Postmaster-General a suggestion which I have made previously with regard to the supply of copper wire. It is an absurdity that we should continually be told that we have to wait for copper wire to arrive from Europeor America, when we have any quantity of copper of our own in Australia. I suggest that the honourable member should establish a little works of his own to draw out the copper wire. It is a very simple process.

69,Mr Bamford,"We want a postat Sydney, or to other large ports and see copper ingots being dropped into a hold in the forward part of a ship, and copper wire being taken out of the hold at the stern or amidships of the same vessel. I made a similar suggestion to the previous Postmaster-General, and it seems that this work might reasonably be undertaken by the Department. I am sorry the Treasurer is not present, because I wish to bring under his notice a matter with reference to old-age pensions. I am not complaining of the administration of the Act, because every complaint that I have so far made to the Minister has received his prompt attention and been dealt with very satisfactorily from tbe point of view of myself and those who have applied to me. rather in reference to the interpretation of the Act. I had some correspondence in reference to a claim for an old-age pension some time ago, and received a reply from the Department to the effect that the personal property of the applicant was so much, included in the amount being £ 3 0 for. furniture. That is not the spirit of the always' of moment. A life may hang Act at all. Although the Act provides for deductions for "" real and personal property,"" Parliament never intended that a small quantity of household furniture should be taken into the calculation. That amount would include his bed, and possibly his bedding, and if his blanket is to be assessed, why not assess his clothes or his boots? Surely the Department does not presuppose that the recipients of old-age pensions should go about in "" the altogether."" Although the amount in question is small, I object to the principle that the Department is following, and I am certain that this Parliament never intended that sort of thing to be done. There are one or two matters which I wish to bring under the notice of the Government as briefly as possible. The first is the telephone connection which has been asked for between the Penrith Hospital and the Penrith Railway Station. The Nepean Cottage Hospital at Penrith serves the whole of the district lying between Parramatta and Lithgow, including the mountain areas. In almost every case patients are brought to the hospital by rail, and it is of the greatest importance that the hospital authorities should have prompt notice of an accident case coming in, and that people should be able to hear from the hospital authorities whether there are beds available for cases at the hospital. The wire to make the connection would require to be carried for part of the way on posts belonging to the Post and Telegraph Department, for another section on the electric light posts belonging to the municipal council, and for the rest of the way on posts the property of the Railways Commissioners. There is a regulation in the Post and Telegraph Department which stands in the way of the erection of this line on the posts belonging to the Department, but I contend that in a case of this kind some exception should be made, in order that the connection between the hospital and the Penrith Railway Station may be completed. The Railways Commissioners and the municipal This complaint is council at Penrith have already consented to the use of their posts for the purpose, but there remains a gap of a quarter of a. mile to cover, for which the posts belonging to the Post and Telegraph Department would have to be used. I ask the Postmaster-General to look into the matter, and see whether the connection I ask for cannot be made. In case of accident, time is upon the readiness of the hospital authorities to meet any case coming in, knowing what kind of a case it is, and having a doctor ready to treat it at once. There have been instances in which the lives of people have been saved in the Nepean Hospital owing to the fact that a doctor has been on the spot to attend to the patients when they were brought in. There are large railway shunting-yards at Penrith, and a dep6t for engines, and accidents happen there as they do in all large railway establishments. It is absolutely necessary in the interests of the public and for the saving of human lives that this connection should be made, and made at once. The honourable member for Lang made a reference to standing grievances, and I have a standbier grievance concerning the connection of the mountain areas with Sydney by telephone. Year after year a promise has been made to erect an additional .trunk telephone line to Katoomba, but the promise has never been honoured.

A grocer at Blackheath complained fn rne that on one of the holidays he wished to get up some butter, and the train by which it would have to come left Sydney at noon. He was trying from 9 o'clock till 11 o'clock in the morning to get communi<\ilion with Sydney by telephone, and was unable to do so. He then decided to communicate by telegram, and was told at the telegraph office that the line was so fully engaged that if he wished a telegram to get to the city in time, it would be necessary for him to send an urgent wire. Not only is the telephone line overloaded, but the telegraph line is also so overloaded that those who wish their messages to reach the city in a reasonable time must send them as urgent and pay double rates. I had an experience of the telephone line myself, the other day. 1 was at Woodford and desired to catch the 11 o'clock train. I wished to ring up Katoomba. I rang up at half-past eight o'clock, and was told that I could not gel communication until 9 o'clock. I rang up again at 9 o'clock. I stood by the telephone from 9 o'clock till 11 o'clock, in the effort to get connection with Katoomba, which is only 10 miles distant, but I had to leave to catch my train without being successful. fit people in the Commonwealth who have had to be satisfied with a mail once or twice a week. as is any other member of the House towards the people in the back blocks, who require increased mail facilities.

' I remind honourable members that the money required for the erection of the line' I am referring to, was voted by Parliament in last September, and I hear only now that tenders are being called for the supply of the material. I do not speak without thought when I say that the management of this trunk line is absolutely chaotic. Telephone connection was asked foi between Tenrithl, Emu Plains, and Glenbrook, and the people concerned were asked to guarantee a certain amount. After considerable correspondence, the officers of the Department reported that the line would not pay, and that the people must guarantee the probable loss for so many years. That guarantee was immediately forthcoming, and then I received a letter from the Department informing me that nothing could be done, because the money could not be placed on the Estimates' until 1910-11. This would not be a big work by any means. What is wanted is merely the erection of a telephone line between Penrith and Glenbrook, a distance of 5 or 6 miles, and in view of the guarantees which",26,Government House Gardens Cases More Than A Thousand Miles From Rolls Telephone Civilization And Nothing Has Been Done To Committee Labou Rex Improve The Means Of Telegraphic Communi Offices Cation There The Department Has Been Departments Badly Advised In This Matter The Letter

I know that the New South Wales Government has been communicated with on more than one occasion, and has refused No one knows better than to sanction the introduction of universal penny postage, so far as that State is concerned.

States. The Department has been petitioned times without number to give redress, but the only real cure is uniform postage. If New South Wales cannot be induced to forego the revenue which she now obtains from twopenny postage, perhaps Victoria, will consent to a uniform rate of a penny halfpenny. I shall not argue now whether a penny rate should or should not be fixed, but certainly the rates, as well as the stamps, should be uniform. Pending legislation, a zone system might be established, so that places just beyond the Victorian border might be treated as if within Victoria, and the surcharge for insufficient postage avoided. At the present time, many persons refuse to accept insufficiently stamped circulars, and sometimes letters of importance are thus declined, and returned to their destination, with the result that much worry and loss is caused. revenue is unduly inflated by the present system, because many business establishments in the large towns along the border, when they have letters to send to Victoria, instead of posting them in New South Wales, and affixing to them twopenny stamps, post them on the Victorian side, and save a penny on each letter by using Victorian stamps. gains revenue New South. Wales loses. A firm, say, at Albury may be doing business with residents along the river from that point to the South Australian border. They employ an office boy, who jumps on his bicycle, takes bundles of letters over to the Victorian side, posts them there, and so saves the firm a penny on each letter. In fifteen minutes he is once more in his office, ing a repetition of the disasters of the past, and the firm has made a considerable saving. New South Wales, and leads to the undue inflation of the revenue of the Department in Victoria. of a uniform stamp, a zone system should be instituted along the border within which letters bearing a penny stamp could be delivered without the present surcharge. The honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for Herbert referred this morning to country mail services, and I desire to deal briefly with the question. About twelve months ago members of the Farmers' and Settlers' Association of New South Wales were alarmed by a rumour that the Department intended to seriously curtail the existing mail services. I brought the matter before the Department, and also before the House, and the then Postmaster-General gave us an assurance that in no circumstances would there be a curtailment of country mail services. I relied on that promise, but regret to say that in some cases' it has been broken. The Department is seriously to blame for its action in the past in regard to mail contracts. Tenders for the conveyance of mails have been accepted in many cases at simply impossible rates, and with the occurrence of a drought many contractors have been unable to carry on. Appeals have been made to the Department either to grant increased amounts, or to release from their obligations contractors and their bondsmen. In this way great trouble and inconvenience has occurred, althougth Cobb and Com pany, a large firm of mail contractors in Queensland, have been successful in obtaining some concessions. I am prepared to argue, as I have done before, that the Then, again, the Victorian Minister should protect his Department by refusing to accept a tender for the carriage of mails at a rate so low as to make it impossible for the contractor to secure a fair profit and pay a living wage. If that were done, the Department would be_ upon firmer ground than it has been in insisting upon the terms of every contract being adhered to. The, experience of bad seaWhile Victoria thus sons has been suchI think the Postmaster General will bear out my statement-that all over the Commonwealth tenders for country mail services are considerably higher than they were^ are tendering at high .rates, and the DeThe. present system does a wrong lo partment, because of these increased prices, is curtailing services, to the disadvantage and serious inconvenience of many people Pending the adoption in rural districts.

I ask the Postmaster-General to consider this matter. sympathy with the view I expressed, but the whole question must be grappled with. The loss suffered by the Postmaster-General's Department in supplying effective .mail services in country districts should be made good by an annual subsidy .granted by the Treasurer. I hope that the Treasurer will work in sympathy with the Postmaster-General, recognising that the first duty of the Government in this regard is to those who are scattered over country districts, and that it should secure to them reasonable services before it .proposes to expend hundreds of thousands of pounds upon the duplication of existing services in cities and other large centres of population. Complaints will never cease until some such course as I have suggested has been adopted. There is another matter which I have already brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General to which I desire to allude. A town in my electorate has a postal service and a telephone in lieu of a telegraph line. Murrumbidgee runs through the centre of the town, the post-office and a number of residences being on one side of the stream and some business establishments and residences, about half-a-rnile from the post office, on the other side. Last JuneI applied to the Department to grant permission to those living on the far side of the river to use a telephone in a store there as a public telephone, paying exactly the same rates as they would if they crossed tbe river and used the telephone at the post-office. That concession was granted, and proved a great convenience to the people. This month, however, the very authority that granted this permission sent a letter to the parti is concerned saying that the practice would henceforth be discontinued. There is no complaint, no suspicion of loss of revenue, and I am utterly at a loss to account for the withdrawal of the permission. I should also like the Postmaster-General to state when the Committee appointed to inquire into the accounts of the telephone branch of the Department is going to present a report. ment, and see none now. All the desired .information was obtainable within the Department itself, and could have been collected without the appointment of any one outside the public service to make an investigation. of the men in the Department ought to be I know that he personally is in dismissed. the Department officers capable of supplying all the information for which the House has been anxiously waiting, and which it desires to obtain before it is called upon to deal with the Estimates. I wish once more to impress upon the Minister of Defence the necessity for providing suitable ranges for rifle clubs, I appeared before the honourable gentleman in a deputation, and I can say that we had his sympathy ; but now I desire him to take action. I learn that, after years of continuous agitation, arrangements have at last been made at Junee for the lease of a piece of ground at the -nominal rental of £ 5 5s. per annum. This ground was inspected by the honourable member for Wimmera, the honourable member for Grey, and other honourable members, including myself, ancl also by officers of the rifle club; and I understand that it has now been approved by the military authorities. I therefore ask The river the Minister to take immediate action, so that the residents of that great tract of country, who are interested, may be enabled to practice without journeying to Wagga or Cootamundra. I desire to refer also to the desirability of acquiring a sufficient area on the Murray Downs station in order to convenence people in : New South Wales, and also at Swan Hill, in Victoria. This' land, it appears, cannot be sold by the trustees for some eighteen or twenty years, though, of course, we know that the Minister has power to resume. This land has also been inspected by the honourable member for Wimmera and myself; and I had hoped that before now arrangements would have been made to create a .range. I desire to know what has been done, or what the Department proposes to do. An integral part of the' defence system is the teaching of our soldiers to shoot straight; and, to this end, there must, of course, be practice. I may point out that, in this latter case, there is no question of danger, because the area is in open country, occupied only with stock. I desire now to call attention to a statement.

One of these threw an empty beer bottle at Mr Allcock's pony. It was pointed out that there was no bottled beer at the tattoo.

I trust that what I may say will not interfere with the negotiations now going on, but I desire to briefly place the position before the House, in order to show honourable members and the public its-gravity. I am impelled to do this for more than one reason. Not only in the press, but wherever I go, the question is asked, "" Why is it that the miners of the Newcastle district, so to speak, refuse to obey the arbitration law of the State of New South Wales""? When I recite the experiences in this district during the last two or three years, it will be plainly seen, I think, that the miners have made every attempt at all times to have their grievances redressed by arbitration. But they have not been able up to the present time to get their grievances before that tribunal. When the arbitration law was passed in New South WalesI am speaking of a time prior to the last two : years-the Court could never find time tc go to the district to hear any of the cases that the men wanted to put before it. Thr result was' that whenever the proprietora wanted, as they did, to reduce wages or to carry out anything with which the men felt aggrieved, they enforced their demands, and the men were compelled to take steps in the other Courts to obtain injunctions against the proprietors. Two years ago, this month, the miners ceased work, and were out, I think, for about a fortnight. The result was that the Premier of New South Wales appointed a special Board for that district. In the agreement it was provided that the men should return to work, and that any dispute that cropped up in the meantime should be immediately attended to by the Board, which was then sitting. On the face of it that appeared to be a very good arrangement, but the experience of the twelve months proved that it worked out very badly. It operated in this way : While the Board sat for twelve months, little causes of irritation were continually occurring between some of the managers and the boys and shift men",31,Government House Gardens Cases More Than A Thousand Miles From Rolls Telephone Civilization And Nothing Has Been Done To Committee Labou Rex Improve The Means Of Telegraphic Communi Offices Cation There The Department Has Been Departments Badly Advised In This Matter The Letter

131,Mr Watkins (Newcastle) [2.58],"outside the pale of the Federation, and these occupied the attention of the Board, together pertaining to one colliery, which was not by any means the biggest. By those means the whole of the twelve months was taken up, and the two big questions for which the men had come out-the increase in the hewing rate and the payment for small coal-were not tried by that Board, and have never been tried by any Court since. As the men are paid upon a sliding scale, and the selling price is adjusted yearly, it was of the utmost importance that the point as to whether the men were getting a sufficient increase at that time should be dealt with by the Board which was created for that purpose as soon as possible, but the Board never touched it at all. However, that Board went out of existence, and during the last twelve months, when we have had a period of slack work, owing to our foreign trade not being so good as hitherto, the miners have found that they have been attacked at one colliery to-day, another colliery next week, and so on all round, until at last it became a question of having half of the district out or all the men going out together. applied first of all for a voluntary Conciliation Board. The proprietors assented to that, and two cases were tried. ciliation method during the last twelve months, and both went against the men, but they accepted the position and went on working. the proprietors refused to continue that method of settling disputes, and although the miners from time to time demanded its continuance it was refused, and latterly they have been refused the right to meet the proprietors in conference to redress their grievances. stead of meeting them in conference, have simply replied, as I can show by letters, that they were under the other Act they found the grievances were dealt with by them apart from a conference, and replies were given accordingly. These grievances have accumulated to such an enormous extent that the men felt it important that some steps should be taken to bring them before the people of the Commonwealth. During the same twelve months, to show that so far from the men wanting to break down the arbitration law, it was really the other side that was aiming at that result Mr Watkins. orable member mean the arbitration law with one case or the Wages Board? tinuation of the other. I am referring generally to all that legislation. It seems to me that the proprietors have set their faces against it, but, instead of locking the men out openly, or doing anything to show the public that they wanted to break it down, they have chosen the other method of enforcing in detail different inroads into the wages of the men so as to induce them to stop work, and become dissatisfied with that form of settling disputes. To the uninitiated the list of the men's grievances may not, on the face of them, appear to be large, but any one who has a practical knowledge of mining, as the Minister of Defence has, knows that you may pay a man 4s. 2d. a ton, but that if you deny him fair and adequate payment upon deficient work, that amount will be materially reduced. To show which side it was that was really desirous of breaking down the arbitration system, I may point out that when the engine drivers applied for registration ' under the new legislation their request was They fought in the other Courts by the proprietors to such an extent that no less a person than Judge Heydon, who will surely be admitted to be unbiased, felt impelled to draw attention to the fact that the proBoth were settled by that conprietors of that district were fighting the application, and that their treatment of the engine-drivers contrasted strangely with the treatment meted out by the proprietors of Yet for some reason or other the southern district. can register under the Wages Board. engine-drivers be allowed to do so? miners attempted to do it? they have, but I have shown that when themselves absolutely depleted of their union funds by fighting for injunctions in the other Courts, and could never get their case before the Arbitration Court. The matter has now reached an acute stage, and whatever power can be invoked to settle the dispute on an equitable basis before it goes further, would, I . think, be welcomed by the whole community. To show that it is not just to blame the miners for the stoppage of work, let me read a statement of their secretary, which bears out my opinion",32,Government House Gardens Cases More Than A Thousand Miles From Rolls Telephone Civilization And Nothing Has Been Done To Committee Labou Rex Improve The Means Of Telegraphic Communi Offices Cation There The Department Has Been Departments Badly Advised In This Matter The Letter

I refer to this, not to put aside his suggestion, but to remind the House of the position in which we stand.

CATTS -What about the Commonwealth's right to interfere for the prevention ot an Inter-State dispute? the Constitutional provision to which the honourable member refers has been under the consideration of the High Court,'which, without dealing with it exhaustively, has decided that the word ""prevention "" must be read in connection with the condition which attaches to the whole provision, that the dispute must extend beyond one State. into the legal position, and am speaking now wholly from memory of the very important decisions which the Court has given. limited to one State. papers inform us that the Premier of New South Wales has put himself into communication with both parties, and that a deputation representing the men is to wait on him to-day. cept his suggestion that a day should be appointed for a Conference, and that they should thereupon recommence work, the men wish to submit an alternative.

I have thought reticence commendable because a settlement arrived at on the spot, with the aid of the local, authorities, is more likely to be permanent. The interference of an external authority might raise expectations higher than were warranted, or well meant intervention might prevent the success of negotiations which, so far as-we can judge, offer a reasonnble prospect of an early understanding. The opportunity of the ComUndoubtedly, this situamonwealth authority will arise when the conditions of the Constitution have been complied with, or when current negotiations have proved ineffective, and the field is left clear.

So far as one can see, no complaint in that category ought to be beyond the scope of a proper arbitration tribunal. stances, one has no need to look for other means of obtaining a settlement. All we need is an adaptation of the law making it what it was intended to be-a n efficient agency of industrial peace; a means of settling justly as between man and man, interest and interest, industry and industry, the terms and conditions of employment. Until we so perfect our judicial machinery that it shall be capable of preventing a crisis of this kind by restraining both parties, it will not have the effect we all hoped it would, and hope it may still produce, when other means fail, and a resort to Federal arbitration becomes necessary. We appreciate the manner in which the honourable member for Newcastle has opened the discussion. Although in some of his remarks he indicated his sympathetic bias towards the miners, and his personal objections to the course followed by the employers, we recognise that it is hardly poswith the coal miners of New South Wales, sible for him to separate himself from an industry in which he was reared, and men whom he has so long represented. is not an appropriate time to enter upon a discussion of the great industrial trouble that has arisen in a neighbouring State, and I do not intend to do so.

It is true that he expressed certain personal opinions, but they are shared, 1 believe, not only by every honourable member, but by every member of the community, according to his lights. I was greatly interested in the remark of the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth might, at a subsequent date, be able to intervene, and to attempt to settle this dispute. I confess that I have not the same sanguine anticipations.. I feel that the Commonwealth Parliament possesses great power, and that every member and party in it will agree that if it can do anything to bring about an amicable I have settlement, it should cheerfully and willingly take action. The Prime Minister was very emphatic in his statement that, although the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is vested with certain constitutional powers to deal with In these circumindustrial disputes extending beyond the limits of one State, it has at present no power to intervene in this dispute, since it is still within the boundaries of one State. In answer to the honourable member for Cook, the honourable member pointed out that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration would have power to intervene on the application of either of the parties. I gd further the words "" on the application of either of the parties."" threatened to extend to the same industry in another State, any citizen could, iri my opinion, effectively intervene, and move the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court to take action. If there were threats of a sympathetic strike in another State-if affiliated coal miners in another State declared that they were in sympathy and had a complaint with regard to the industry in their own State-the n any individual citizen could move the Federal Court to take action for the protection of the industries, and the welfare and good government of the Commonwealth.

I do not wish to give rise to an acrimonious discussion regarding the merits of the dispute. It is sufficient for me to know that a great industry, which is absolutely essential to the proper and profitable operation of nearly every other industry in the Commonwealth, is at a stand-still, owing to a dispute between the employers and the employees. I shall put only one case, and I hope that I shall put it fairly. The complaint of the miners is that they have been subjected to a large number of pin-pricks extending over a lengthy period. complain that they have a number of accumulated grievances. I can speak as a coal miner. younger days, both as a miner and a mine manager, I am familiar with the difficulties of the industry. I know how trying it is, and how easy it is to irritate when, perhaps, there is no intention of causing irritamight readily say more. tion. I can understand how men, having no distinct grievance, may yet say, "" This life is intolerable, and we require an alteraonly one party suffers. Those who suffer tion of the conditions under which we are employed."" I am not going to say how the trouble has arisen, but from the very first the representatives of the miners have said to the employers, "" We ask for an open conference to discuss our grievances; we ask for nothing more. We do not wish any one to compromise his position by conceding anything beforehand."" before the miners left work. many times. Before the men ceased work, they said that their conditions of employment were intolerable, ahd could not continue. I am not going to discuss the question of why they left work, but I give the statement of the men. They said that they desired the employers to agree to an open conference to discuss the merits of their case, partisan view, though I should be ready and the reply of the mine owners was: "" We shall not agree to a conference until you have returned to your work."" Let me put the converse position. Let us suppose that All my the owners had locked out their men, because, owing to certain conditions, they could not carry on. Let us assume that they subsequently asked for a conference, and' that the colliers replied, "" We shall meet you in conference after you have opened up your mines."" What would the public say in such circumstances ? Would they not condemn the colliers? of the mines could be proceeded against for locking out their men. miners been proceeded against, but some of them have actually been imprisoned. Donot let us, however, raise that issue. There is a law in existence, but it cannot be put into force'. This is one of those cases in which there is within the State at present a power greater than the State itself. Is a little breach of etiquette to stand in the way of an open conference to discuss the substance of the grievances? What would the press and influential members of the They public say if , in the circumstances I have just mentioned, the workmen said to the miners, "" First open your mines, and then Having worked in my we will meet you in conference "" ? Would they not say, ""What right have the men to interfere, and to say how the mine owners shall conduct their business?"" I leave the matter at that, although I I can feel for those who suffer most. There are two parties to the dispute, but generally receive the greatest condemnation ; it is not the first time, nor will it be the last; but we ought to keep in view the fact, which I have emphasized previously, that the powers under the Federal Constitution, in regard to industrial legislation, are all too limited. If we had greater powers,, there would be greater safety ; and we ought to recognise that the most temporary trouble in a State may extend to the whole of the States; and if it does' not paralyze industry, will cause an enormous amount of-distress, and stand in the way of the true progress of Australia.

155,Mr Fisher,"Not only have coatand willing to take my part should the occasion arise. I hope that the most conciliatory efforts will be made by every lover -of his country to bring about an amicable settlement of this grave difficulty, one that will do substantial justice to all concerned. master-General) [3.46] I am quite sure that honourable members do not expect me to reply in detail to the various complaints and suggestions that have been made in regard to the Post and Telegraph Department. A large number of the matters are purely Departmental. TheseI shall inquire into, and communicate the results to honourable members by letter. As regards telephone and telegraphic construction, the extension of mail services in country districts, and so forth, I shall be prepared to give the fullest information when we are considering the Estimates. I hope to be able to formulate a policy of a liberal and progressive character that will meet the approval of honourable members. -In reply to the remarks of the Prime Minister on the mining dispute, I must emphasize the fact that it is time this Parliament sought further industrial powers. I agree with the honourable gentleman that it is not the province of this Parliament to interfere in a dispute confined to one State; but I do not know any dispute of the character of the one in question that does not affect the whole of the Commonwealth through sympathetic strikes and otherwise. I am always surprised, when we are faced by these crises, that the Government should delay seeking the whole control of industrial legislation. I desire more particularly to draw the attention of the Minister of Defence to the great saving that might be effected in his Department, and the greater efficiency that could be obtained by an extension of the use of the machine now in operation at the Victoria Barracks for the cleaning of rifle barrels. A remarkable fact is that this is the only machine of the kind in the Commonwealth j and so effective is it, that it adds anything from twelve months to two years to the life of a barrel, which, as we know, costs something like 15s. machine for each State. 'South Australia, through no fault of the Minister, there is a great shortage of rifles; but, if a machine of this kind were in use, there are many rifles that could be issued that I had received letters and statements very rapidly. The same electrical power to that effect. that works this machine could be used to drive another, that is also in use only in Victoria, for the polishing of_metal work. Cleaning metal work by hand Is a very antiquated and expensive process; and yet that is the method in vogue in all the States except Victoria. Both machines are inexpensive, and could be adopted with advantage. I do not yet know whether the Government have decided to give any better recompense to the members of the Hansard staff, although, when we were dealing-with the Estimates, there was an expression of opinion that they were not so generously treated, although they are the hardest worked employees we have, as some other officers, who have received increase after increase. I do not say that those other officers do not deserve their increases; but they do not deserve them so much as do the Hansard staff. I am sure that, when the members of the staff took up their duties, they did not believe they were to have so mucb work thrust upon them as bas been the case in connection, with Royal Commissions. As I understand the matter, they did not expect that they would be called upon tD do that work at a l l ; and the Commissions have been, I think, far too frequent of late years. The work of the Hansard reporters in connection with the Commissions has been very well done. I have seen secretaries to Royal Commissions receiving gratuities, although their work was as nothing compared with the work of the Hansard staff, in addition to their Parliamentary duties. I hope the Government, if they have not already made provision in this connection, are going to do so. I do not think there is one honourable member of the House who will say that the Hansard staff are not deserving n€ an increase, especially in view of the fact that they have not had one since the be ginning of Federation. I now desire to say a word with regard to the statement of the honourable member for Maribyrnong that liquor was supplied to cadets at the recent military tattoo. That is a verj serious charge, which I should like to see thoroughly investigated. Either some members of the Force supplied those boys with liquor, or they did not. We have had no proof up to the present moment; and, while it is true tr.at the honoraole mpmber for In Maribyrnong asserts that liquor was supplied",37,Government House Gardens Cases More Than A Thousand Miles From Rolls Telephone Civilization And Nothing Has Been Done To Committee Labou Rex Improve The Means Of Telegraphic Communi Offices Cation There The Department Has Been Departments Badly Advised In This Matter The Letter

At the same time, when the Tattoo Committee are unanimous, after I am sure full inquiry full inquiry ? I made the statement yesterday afternoon, and the Committee met last night. they communicated with those who conducted the canteen; and there ought to be a full investigation in order that these men may not be left under a stigma. Of course, if some adult got the beer and gave it to the boys, those in charge of the canteen cannot be blamed. The honourable member for Corio will bear me out when I say that it is the simplest thing for men or boys to get liquor even if there be no canteen at all.

Yet, the Trade and Customs Department and the External Affairs Department are not aware of the facts. I do not regard the answer given to me as a purely formal one. do not think that formal answers on important matters should be given in this House. The Minister should know these things, and if his Department is ignorant of them he had better get some man into it whose duty it will be to obtain adequate knowledge of them. official ignorance of the Department and the necessity for an' Intelligence Branch, a little while ago a statement appeared in the English papers to the effect that the King had instituted a medal for members of the police forces and fire brigades of the Empire who exhibited bravery. addition there was to be a small gratuity which made the medal something on the same lines as the Victoria Cross. There is no doubt that these civilians often perform acts of bravery, without the excitement of battle, which are quite as worthv of the Victoria Cross as anything done in war.

219,Mr Tudor,"I admit that, sir, but Ispent the money on behalf of the Commonwealth, are entitled to consideration at the hands of this or any other Ministry. It might be said that, in paying these costs, we should establish a precedent, and that other unions and organizations would ask for similar treatment. But there can never be another similar case in regard to this class of legislation. We were branching out into a new line-treadin g a previously untrodden path. No other country had passed a measure of the kind, and hence we had this phase of what is called the new Protection. After the High Court had given its decision, the Prime Minister, speaking on 20th October last, saidI do not intend to debate the question of the ^20,000,000 or a little over to face, and, new Protection. I merely wished to show that it was, and is still, an essential part of the Government policy. The honourable member for East Sydney on that occasion interjectedAnd one of the parts of which I thoroughly approve. Apparently there is a majority in this Parliament who agree that, if we give protection to the employers, the employees should receive their share in the shape of increased wagesor improved conditions. I regard the Inter-State Commission Bill as an absolute sham-utterl y useless for the purpose for which it was introduced. It is a Bill. to create billets, and nothing more. ber must not discuss that question. cuss it. Last week I asked whether the Government were showing their sincerity by having this Bill hung up in the Senate for three weeks, but I find that it was really four weeks, so that it is five weeks to-day since this measure was last dealt with in another place. Is it any wonder, under all the circumstances, that the workers are wondering where their share of the benefits of Protection is? got the dissolution for which they asked, new Protection would have been hung up for five vears. longer than that under the present proposals of the Government. one of the Houses now. been touched for five weeks, and there are other very important matters to be dealt with. I trust that what I have said in regard to the expert inquiry into the telephone administration will receive attention, because five months have elapsed since the appointment of the Committee, while, ns I have pointed out, the report was to lie presented in three months. but the Committee have not finished their work. [4.50] I regret that the Treasurer is not here, because I desire to urge on him the necessity of making a Financial Statement to the House before we go to the country. The finances present a sea. of trouble, out of which it is extremely hard to find a way. We have new obligations of in a few days, we shall, J suppose, have surrendered half our revenue to the States; in other words, we are men who desire to emasculate our own power. The Treasurer ought to devise some system offinancefor the country, because, at present, we are proceeding in a very slipshod, happy-golucky way. Every great country in the world is planning a national banking system to enable its obligations to be financed. Even in the United States, where the whole policy has been individualistic, Senator Aldridge, of Rhode Island, Chairman of the Finance Committee in the United States Senate, is advocating such a.bank as I have been suggesting. This is the country which has been opposed to any proposal for a national banking system since the day Andrew Jackson vetoed the banking charter; but it is recognised that money is required for defence, irrigation and other works, and that, to that end, there must be some institution to which other banks could go for re-discounts in financial crises There is such a system in England, Germany, France, and Belgium; and Senator Aldridge's idea is to have an institution with the best features of each, and to leave a national bank as the monument of his political career The idea is to have a bank in which the United States will hold so much stock, and the other banks the balance; and I do not see why we should not have a system of the kind here. This would give us a bank of banks, where the reserves could be held, and trust moneys deposited. The benevolent associations of Australia possess over ^4,000,000; and this could be deposited at a small rate of interest, and used by the Commonwealth to finance its operations, instead of our being compelled to go into the open market and",44,Willis Th E Minister Our Suburban Population Use The Railwav

I do not care whether this or any other Government carry out the reform; all I desire is a system of national finance which will enable this country to meet its obligations. I also urge on the Government the necessity for establishing a national bureau of unemployment. The great trouble here, as in America and England, is the absence of such a bureau as exists in Germany. No one seems to be interested in the man who is unemployed, at the one time in his life when he requires help. The Commonwealth controls the post-office, the 'telegraphs and telephones; and it would be a very simple matter to have a central exchange in the Federal Capital, such as we find in Berlin. I wish that, instead of regarding Germany with fear cr ill-will, we would study her economic methods. tion to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] to business now; we have been all day on grievances. marks will be very short. An article appears in the Contemporary Review for October, of which the following is the substanceThe Labour Exchange is not only a market where men and jobs are handled like stocks nnd shares; it is also an unemployed club, where the out-of-work, instead of skulking with his. fellows from place to place, an eyesore to the city and a standing menace to the public safety, as is the case elsewhere, can have the use of spacious, airy rooms, well lighted ancl well warmed, free access to newspapers and books and games, with a good canteen and hot and cold baths at his disposal at nominal charges. While he waits for the work to come to him he can have his boots patched and his clothing set in order. He sees many, very many, other men in the same pass as himself, some better, others worse off; yet their company in comparatively congenial surroundings tends rather to whet his energy than to depress him. There is also the additional advantage in the chance of hearing of work from the other members of the club. For the trifling sum of twenty pfennigs the unsive farming section of Tasmania. employed workman becomes a member for three months, or until he has found work, if he is suited before that period has elapsed. If he belongs to a trade union, as nearly all German workmen do, which is a subscriber to the Exchange, he will be absolved from all payment. That article is by Eulenspiegel. Would it not be better for the Government to copy an institution like that from the Germans, and spend on it a little of the money that they propose now to use to establish a navy with which we think we shall have to fight them? I urge the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Home Affairs to look into that article, which is well worthy of attention, and see if it is not possible to establish a central bureau in Australia connected through the Post Offices with local bureaux. the Minister of Defence would have gone a lot further than that. will now. It is a mistake to think he has not got a heart. I would again urge upon the Postmaster-General, the necessitv of dispensing with the services of the Deputy Postmaster-General, and appointing an Inspector in each State directly amenable to the orders of the central office. When the honourable member for Maribyrnong was Postmaster-General he authorized the establishment of a new Post Office at Wynyard. Something happened to prevent the work from being carried out. The present Postmaster-General has not only approved of it, but has put ^1,000 on the Estimates for it. He has urged that the work be done, but has the Deputy Postmaster-General in Tasmania carried it out? of the Deputy Postmaster-General. fault of the Postmaster-General, for he is one of the most sympathetic men in Australia towards country towns. nothing to do with new buildings. everything to do with them. The Deputy Postmaster-General of a State is the stumbbling-block in the way of progress, because he stands in the -way of the orders of the central office. This matter has been kept fooling about, but nothing has been done. Sir Robert Scott, the secretary of the central administration, the Postmaster-General, and the Minister of Home Affairs, have done their best, and yet I have not got a Post Office, for this great fertile progresIt is because the Deputy is opposed to it. He does not want to take the present Post Office up from where it stands beside the sea. He has always said that the city would extend out ""to it. That is the whole trouble. The Postmaster-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, and the permanent secretary want the work done, the money is on the Estimates, but the Deputy at Hobart can stop it all.",45,Willis Th E Minister Our Suburban Population Use The Railwav

There is in the Darwin electorate a most important mining centre called Mount Balfour. the largest copper mines in the world have been discovered there lately, and there is no doubt that in a few years it will carry a population of thousands. there are only hundreds there. lowing is from the Launceston ExaminerMount Balfour, however, is one of the most isolated portions of the state.

The mail is despatched from Marrawah once a week only, and it takes about five days for a letter to reach Mount Balfour from Launceston. The necessity for extending the telephone wire from Marrawah to the field is fast becoming a matter of vital importance. So confident are some of those who hold properties on the field of its future that they have .deposited the required guarantee with the department for the extension of the line.

It is time for the National Government to exercise its quarantine authority. I have never claimed that it should allow diseased products to enter a State, but it certainly ought to have its own quarantine officers, and any article that they pass ought to be admitted into anv State, without the interference of an inspector or a man with a gun on the border, just as if there were no Federation. Tf that were done, the farmers of Tasmania would not be ruined, the people of Australasia would be benefited, and those grand red-skinned potatoes would fill the emptystomachs of thousands of our children, putting the glow of health into their cheeks.

In this twentieth century, in. an age of light, and in a land of constitutional liberty, where the principles of justice are amongst the highest triumphs of Christian civilization, is it to be imagined that 13,000 men are to be told by twenty, "" We shall not grant vou a conference unless you approach us as lackeys "" ? The American Constitution declares that all men are born equal, and that all have the right to live free and happy, and our Constitution is virtually a copy of it . The 13,000 men were born into the world by the same process as the other twenty. Yet they are to approach them as servants. This is not Democracy. I do not say that one side is right and the other wrong, but I say that the Commonwealth Government has the right to interfere in this matter under the law of eminent domain. I am not too sweet about some of the colliery proprietors. They do not play the game, even in horse racing. horse was being scratched day after day. but when its owner could get on all the money possible, it was run to win the 'Cup. That sort of thing is not fair towards those of us who occasionally attend race meetings. do a thing of that kind. Eminent domain has been defined as the supreme right of property possessed by the State over articles of private ownership and the right of eminent domain is the right to take private property for public use. King never surrenders this right. All the property in the Commonwealth belongs to King Edward VII . , as the embodiment oi"" the power of the nation. The owners are trustees for him. Of course, he cannot resume without granting compensation. Everything earned in the Commonwealth is earned by the processes of trade and commerce. Would the Government allow the twentv colliery proprietors of Newcastle to behave as they are behaving towards the 13.000 miners were it likelv that the Australian Navy would be tied up for want of co^l unless a conference were gr;inted? We have to-dav what is worse than a foreign war, an internecine fratricidal commercial war. Twenty or thirty mencan I wish stick up the industries of the Commonwealth, closing factories everywhere. Employers have to dismiss their hands, landlords have to go without rent, and the people have to go without provisions, because of what is taking place at NewI f there is castle. When Morgan, the great American banker, and head or tbe great Coal Trust .at Pennsylvania, laughed at the 350,000 men on strike, and some of those associated with him said that they would be starved into submission, Clarence Shearn, one of America's great constitutional lawyers, told President Roosevelt that under the law of eminent domain he could put every man to work. The President sent for Morgan, and tcfld him to think the matter over for thirty-six hours. The coal-fields were surrounded with soldiers to protect them, because of the indignation of the populace at the treatment which they had received. At the end of that time, Morgan and Rockefeller, notwithstanding their millions, had to settle the strike. If they had not done so, President Roosevelt would have taken over the coal-fields under the law of eminent domain, and left them to fight out the matter in the Courts. I should have no more hesitation about seizing the Newcastle coal-fields, and calling out the army A if the proprietors did not settle the strike in thirty-six hours, than I shall have in ordering my dinner to-night when the time arrives. The country should be run by strong men. I would sooner be strong and wrong than weak and right. If the Go-' I do not think that the men would vernment were in the wrong, the High Court would do justice. What right has any property-owner to stand in the wav of the p°ODle's interests?

Here is another passageWhatever blame the community may put upon the miners who have rushed into this strike must be shared by the masters, who have failed to use their powers and their rights in that reasonable and conciliatory manner which they ought to have felt inseparable from their positions and responsibilities. Abraham Lincoln said that power should Ibe used on the side of mercy. It cannot do other than breed interminable ill-will. It says in effect that the masters are conscious of their power, and that they will use their power for the preliminary humiliation of the men. They will only conier with those men after they have first prostrated themselves before the masters' authority. 1 hate the word "" masters."" It comes to us from the old slave epochs. We want none of it in this country. We are all men, but some are bosses and others workers. The miners have many complaints to make of the abuse of power on the part of the proprietors. And the proprietors, on their side, have many grievances against the cavillings of angry men. But we may certainly venture to say that nothing which either side may allege against the other will be so damning in proof as this supercilious attitude of the masters in response to the demand for an open conference. I trust that Ministers will rise to the occasion, and do something big. Question resolved in the negative OrderedThat the House will to-morrow resolve itself into Committee of Supply.

Home Affairs) [5.58] I listened very attentively to the indignant expressions of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in regard to the proposed compromise. I had thought I should be absolutely meeting that honourable member's wishes, because when the Electoral Bill was before us in 1905, the honourable member, as reported on page 6644 of Hansard of that year, moved an amendment to reduce the distance to 5 miles. since then. stances, I think the honourable member might as well agree to the compromise.

The result w ill ' be the complete demoralization of our electors, and when that takes place reform will be very difficult. The postal voting system, as the Minister says, was strongly advocated by members on this side of the House, and I admit that some of them were prepared to remove all distance limitations, but the practical application of the principle in Federal and State politics has compelled those of us who wish to preserve the purity of elections to ask that the system shall be surrounded by even-greater the B ill . That change of conviction has come about as the result of practical experience, because the principle has been found to lend itself so largely to abuse. sition advocated it most strongly. not prepared to advocate it now, as the result of his practical experience of it and in view of his desire to maintain the purity of elections.

Fusionists want it. know that that is so. Like a two-edged sword, it cuts both ways.

The Minister will be well-advised to standby his original proposal of a 7-mile limit, if he cannot see his way to increase it cr include further safeguards in the direction indicated by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. When the proposal came originally before the House a limit of 5 miles was fixed, but an amending Bill was introduced to raise it to 7 miles, in order to get rid of some of the abuses that had crept in under the 5-mile provision. In his original proposal the Minister intended to make it still more stringent by requiring that the distance should be, not merely 7 miles from the elector's own polling place, but 7 miles from the nearest polling place; but now, at the instance of some of his supporters who want to remove all distance limits, he proposes to go back to the original 5-mile radius. Apparently he has not learnt anything from his own experience of elections. He says he is guided by the experience of his officers, but I suppose the provision in the Bill was inserted on the advice of his officers, and now he proposes to throw their practical experience to the winds. He has failed to justify the volte-face that he is now proposing to make, and I urge him, in the interests of the purity of our electoral per cent, of those who vote for me. I resystem, to stand by his own Bill. with the honourable member for Calare. The Act of 1902 provided for a 5-mile limit, but the then Minister, the honourable member for Darling Downs, on the advice of the officers .of the Department, introduced an amending Bill to make the distance 7 miles, and that was agreed to. Yet the Minister, in spite of tbe recommendation of his own officers, now climbs down to 5 miles at a moment's notice. It has been said that this is evidently being done in the hope that it can be used for party purposes, similar to those instanced by the honourable member for Kennedy in his references to what happened in Queensland. the honourable member opposing it for party purposes ? interests of the purity of elections. Those who desire to vote should go to some polling booth and record their votes, and not 'be allowed to have a postal ballot-paper taken to them in such a way that others can practically see how they vote. When the original Bill was before us it was provided, in order to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot, that the ballot-papers should not be counted where they were polled unless a hundred votes were polled there. That was done because the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for South Sydney showed how, in some places where only a few electors voted, the' presiding officer or the poll clerk would probably be the station-owner, who would know how his workers voted, so that they would be liable to be penalized. When a postal ballot paper is issued, the recipient can take it to any one he likes and show how he has voted, of those who desire to vote by post not to do so, if they thought it would be useful to them. same thing with their ballot-papers, but they would not. the law forbids it. knows how 80 per cent, of his supporters vote. gret that the Minister has accepted the amendment in spite of our experience of the original 5-mile limit. I trust that if the amendment is carried another place will promptly' restore the 7-miles provision. Ministei's statement in regard to my attitude on this question on the last occasion puts the matter imperfectly. If the honourable member had read Hansard, he would have seen that I opposed a proposal for a 10-mile limit in regard to' a suggestion which had evidently been previously made in the debate, but which was not contained in the clause then before the Committee. My words were theseI am of opinion that the provision requiring an elector to be ten miles distant from the division for which he is enrolled before he is entitled to vote at a polling booth in an adjoining division is an unreasonable one. That is an' entirely different matter from the provision now before the Committee. There is no question now of prohibiting a man from voting in an adjoining division.

I would not prevent that man from recording his vote on election day at the Melbourne Post Office by means of a "" Q "" form. Evidently I did think at that time that a 5-mile limit was preferable lo one of 10 miles, and, apparently, 7 miles was accepted by the then Minister as a compromise. Parliament deliberately chose 7 in preference to 5 or 10 miles, and the experience at the last election indicates the need for making these provisions stricter. think the Committee will be well advised if it adheres to the existing provision. [ 6 . 1 6 ] If my memory serves me aright, the change from 5 to 7 miles was the result of the recommendation of a Committee, of which I was a member, appointed to investigate the abuses under our first electoral legislation. The fact that the change was recommended after an exhaustive inquiry should weigh greatly with the Committee. which the honourable member refers in country or in city constituencies ? mote largely in the latter. occurred in Melbourne itself. Sir persons who were not entitled to vote ? ting electors to vote under conditions under which they should not have voted. Postal votes were witnessed by persons not properly authorized, and electors who were within 5 miles of the polling place at which they were entitled to vote wrongly took advantage of the postal voting provisions. An agency .known as the "" Flying Angels"" was established to turn the system to party advantage. fairs knows that at one time in New South Wales the secrecy of the ballot was being violated in the interest of party. method was this: An organization arranged with certain electors that they should vote for a specified candidate, and to insure this being done the first elector entering the booth, on being supplied with a ballot paper, slipped a blank piece of paper into the ballot-box, and brought out the other to be marked for the candidate whom it was desired to support. This marked paper was then given to a second elector, who placed it in the ballot-box, and brought I out another ballot-paper, which was similarly marked. It was shown that large numbers. of votes were controlled in this that way. be better able than a bad one to cheat in that wav. able organization would do such a thing. This, abuse was exposed, and legal proceedings resulted,, while the law was altered to require the returning officer to initial the ballot-papers, and prevent their I insertion in the ballot-box except in such a manner as to show that the Act was being complied with. the honourable member is speaking was worse than the abuse of postal voting. abuse would be easier under the postal voting system, and more difficult to detect. like a villain he will do so. ing detection easy you prevent a great deal of villainy. In my opinion, the Minister's proposal, if carried out, would give the villain greater security. Much abuse arguments of the honourable member for Calare apply largely to the system of JOHN FORREST -In the voting of voting by ballot in any form. It seems to me that the corollary of the No ; in getamendment is the abolition of voting under the "" Q "" form as at present. In my opinion, postal voting, requiring as it does the declaration of certain prescribed witnesses, is safer than voting under the "" Q "" form. Under the latter system any two men can enter a polling booth only half-a-mile away from that at which they are entitled to vote in the usual way, and comply with the provisions of the The Minister of HomeA f law without it being possible to trace either of them, should they fraudulently deprive an honest elector of his vote, or make it inThe operative by duplicating it.

If two or three dozen electors asked the secretary to a candidate's committee, or an ardent supporter of a candidate, to assist them, it would give rise to the suspicion that their votes were controlled, and that the person nominated was chosen, not to assist them, but to see that their votes were cast for the right candidate.

The use of conveyances is disallowed under the Act. Not only is their use excluded from section 170, which sets forth the items in respect of which expenses are allowed, but in section 176 of the principal Act, we have the statement that "" bribery "" particularly includesthe supply of . . . horse or carriage hire for any voter whilst going to or returning from the poll Iii other words, a person supplying horse or carriage hire to any voter could be adjudged guilty of bribery. There can be no doubt that at every general election many persons are conveyed to and from polling places in cabs, motors, and other vehicles. Those conveyances are either paid for by a candidate in contravention of the law, or loaned by friends. We ought either to say that conveyances for the convenience of electors may be used, or that no one shall be conveyed to the poll. Under the principal Act it is not even competent for a man possessing a carriage or a motor of his own to take a friend to the polling booth for the purpose of recording his vote. The law is very unfair to those candidates who have no friends to supply them with conveyances on polling day. I do not propose that the maximum amount of expenses which a candidate may incur under the Act shall be increased. bad enough as it is. The honourable member's proposal would make it worse. law, as it stands, is very unfair. It practically declares that a candidate shall not take any one in a conveyance to a polling booth, and, as I have said, it inflicts a hardship on those who have no friends ready to place conveyances at their disposal. It has been said that at the last general election the honourable member for South Sydney had placed at his disposal several motor cars, and I should be glad if a similar courtesv were extended to me.

I do not see why we should keep up a mere pretence; and, that being so, I am in favour of the amendment.

Speaking personally, I may say that I engaged a 'bus only on one occasion, very much against my own will, and only to meet the wishes of mv committee; and of the voters brought to the poll by this means, fifty voted against me, and only seven for me. I regret that the Minister should accept this amendment.

I believe my opponent should have the same right as I have to have cabs running for him if necessary. member a State election at which twenty-eight votes were polled at one booth, and twenty-eight farmers' buggies were engaged. There is no need to amend the existing provision. I have always felt that' I had the right to engage cabs if I had chosen, because I have read the Act to mean that electoral expenses do not include the travelling expenses of the candidate, and if I engaged a cab or two I always regarded the cost as not being the travelling expenses of the other candidate. The effect of the amendment will be to increase the cost of an election. find the ,£100 limitation is regarded as valuable, not because it really means a limitation, but because it can be used to prevent a great number of people from putting one to a tremendous amount of expenre in all directions. I do not want to have the expense of engaging every cab about the place added. tell the honourable member for Batman that I have represented a working man's constituency for several Parliaments, and I think I shall continue to do so longer than the honourable member for Batman will. I understand that as the law now stands cabs can be engaged by a candidate's committee without his knowledge, and that that comm' :tee or any one employing them ,4 can be fined £ 5 0 . That is all the punishment. I was given to understand that in the second Federal election fifty cabs were employed by a committee representing one of the candidates in an electorate, and they were paid £ 1 more than they would ordinarily have received to cover the amount of the possible fine. Any man with money can get oyer the difficulty in that way if he so desires. F if t y pounds would be nothing to a rich man, and he can have cabs now if he so desires, but those who want to keep within the law are at a disJOHN FORREST -The honourable advantage. I simply ask that the £ i o a may be spent in this way if the candidate wishes. Some members say that ,£100 is not enough to allow for a candidate's expenditure. I have a constituency larger than any in Victoria, and running right -back into the never-never country. On one trip I covered 700 miles, but my expenses have not averaged £ 2 5 an election. The honourable member for Batman's logic is very peculiar. I do not want to increase the candidate's expenditure above £ 1 0 0 . Any candidate can spend .£100 to-day. I should be prepared to support the Committee if they decided that no one should be brought to the poll by a cab or motor car. That would be fair and legitimate, but to-day there is nothing to prevent a candidate from employing as many motor cars, carriages, or cabs as may be placed at his disposal by his friends to bring his supporters to the polling booth. It would be consistent if the Committee took the stand that no one should be brought to a polling booth in a vehicle, but the provision would be unworkable. I member move in that direction? foolish. To do so would be absurd. I have never spent a shilling on scrutineers, although I have contested some eight elections, but it seems to me that as candidates are allowed to pay for scrutineers, they might very well be allowed to pay for vehicles. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has shown that the law is frequently broken now. Surely, then, we should remove an obstacle from the path of an honest man.

By way of illustration, he said that a well-known wealthy man in Melbourne came to a polling booth where he was not entitled to vote, and, being directed to another booth further up the street, to which he could travel by tram, refused to go there unless provided with a cab at the expense of the candidate.

When this matter was before us yesterday statements were made which were to my mind a reflection, not only on the administration of the law by the Government, but on the management of the mines by the companies. Knowing that the circumstances from those represented, I ' wired to the Honourable H . Gregory, the Minister of Mines, as followsIn view of statements made in this House in reference to the employment of foreigners on mines on WesternAustralia and their inability to speak English kindly reply stating percentage of foreigners employed in mines for whole State and also as to inability to speak English. I have received the following r e p l y1 Special inquiry just completed, of number of foreigners employed in mines stop returns received from one three seven mines including' all principal ones employing eleven thousand seven fifty nine men show that two one seven foreigners are employed on surface and seven three six underground, total foreigners nine five three, proportion foreigners eight point twelve of total employed; if returns had included small mines this proportion would be considerably decreased, probably to less than six per cent, of total number employed, big majority of foreigners have been lung resident in Australia; no miner is allowed to work underground unless he can fluently speak English, and this rule is rigidly enforced by inspectors of mines who have mads special and recent investigations. In view of the damaging statements which were made yesterday, I am glad to be able to show, by information from the highest authority, that they are not correct. the. absence of the Prime Minister; I desire to ask, the Minister .of ..Home Affairs when he proposes to proceed with his motion to re-arrange the electoral divisions of Western Australia ? This is' no §mall matter, because the arrangement of the electoral divisions is the basis of the representation in this House.. I -have waited for a long time to see if the Government intend to proceed with the matter, because it is one which must either be gone on with or withdrawn. I content myself with asking the Minister .when he intends to proceed with it ; because there should be no delay in bringing a matter of such grave importance before both Houses of proposedParliament. Home Affairs) [11.6] -The Leader of the Opposition has asked me when I intend to proceed with the motion that stands in mv name on the business-paper in connection with the distribution of seats in Western Australia. In consequence of the fact that precedence was given to the Northern -Territory Bill on Tuesday last, the very day on which my motion was tp come on, I could not proceed with it, and there has were entirely different since been no opportunity of dealing with it. As soon as the business of. the House will permit I shall be prepared to go on with the motion. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [11.7] -The honourable member for Fremantle has replied to a charge that was never made, and was never under discussion. What was referred to was not the number of aliens employed in the mines of Western' Australia, but the number of aliens employed by the Gold-fields Firewood Supply Company, and that matter the telegram just read does not touch. There are 11,000 miners employed in Western Australia, and 8 per cent, of these are foreigners; but if , in the mining industry, there was the same percentage of foreigners as in the case of the firewood company, we should not find many of the 11,000 Australians and Britishers left.
