8,Mr Tttdor,"I s it correct, as statedthe honourable member, received notice of his intention to ask. the question, I have been able to ascertain the facts of the case. Some time ago the Government considered whether the holidays of the public servants of Australia could not be put on a uniform footing. Hitherto State arrangements have largely dictated the holidays enjoyed by our public servants. The Cabinet approved of the introduction of a Bill to authorize the granting to the Commonwealth Public Service of twelve holidays in the year, eight of them being those named in the Public Service Act, section 72, sub-section 1, the four others to be chosen by the Acting Public Service Commissioner. Those four holidays have been chosen, and Show Day is not one of them, although Cup Day is. The Commissioner was about to give effect to the decision of the Cabinet, but when I heard of the matter, I said that until the law affecting the Public Service had been amended the existing arrangements should be observed. get their holiday to-morrow? representing the Minister for Repatriation however, that he desires to know whether if the Department has yet finalized any the Government .are -aware of such cases applicationreceived from a returned and propose to do anything.

Assembly of there has been delay. [230]2 RENT: last night's Melbourne Herald, under the heading "" Publicity Brings Stories from Soldiers' Dependants,"" in which there was the following:A case that came forward to-day is that of a widow who has had two sons killed in the war. Her house is one of a terrace, and every other house has had repairs made inside except that which she occupies. For eighteen years she has paid her rent regularly, and at the beginning of the war it was 14s. Other houses have been raised to 16s. This house has now been sold, and the new landlord demands 19s. 6d. a week. When a demur was made, the tenant was asked if she would take a lump sum to go out. The lump sum was to be the amount of removal expenses. The present landlord is said to be a prominent worker for the Red Cross. I need not say any more, because I know that I have the sympathy of all the members of the House, including the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt), when I urge that something should be done to pre' ' vent action of this kind, which, more than anything else, is interfering with recruiting. natural that tlie honourable member's feelings are so strong that he should have EX-SERGEANT Lt -Colonel ABBOTT I desire to to that.

The Estimates of Expenditure out of Revenue include a sum of Â£3,430,000 for payment to the British Government of interest for two years, from 1st July, 1917, to 30th June, 1919, upon the outstanding amount due. Hitherto no in terest has been paid to the British Government upon such balance The Seventh War Loan. The people are at present being asked to subscribe to the seventh war loan the sum of Â£40,000,000. When floating the sixth war loan, the Government announced that no more tax-free issues would be placed Before the public. The present loan accordingly has been made subject to Commonwealth taxation, but owing chiefly to constitutional difficulty the loan is to be free of State income tax. It would no doubt be possible"" for the Commonwealth and States to agree that the loan issues of each shall be subject to the taxation of both, but arrangements have not proceeded so far as that. There are some dangers in permitting' a State"" to tax a loan of the Commonwealth, and it would probably be necessary to provide that the State should not tax interest on Commonwealth loans at a greater rate thai, the tax upon incomes of similar amounts from other sources. In any ' case, no action could safely be taken until reciprocal legislation had been passed by all the States and the Commonwealth. The freedom from both Commonwealth and State taxation was a great attraction to large investors, and in that respect the seventh war loan is at a disadvantage compared w i th its predecessors. Notwithstanding the disability the Government hoipes that the people will make very large voluntary subscriptions as on the last occasion. . Compulsory subscriptions if War Loans not fully taken formation is in the possession pf the Treasury showing that there are many persons who have not subscribed to war loans or who have not subscribed as much as might reasonably be expected of them, and the Government has considered whether the burden of finding money to carry on the war shall be borne only by those whose sense of public duty or self-interest moves them to do so. It is clear that the immense sums required cannot; be proMT. Watt. vided by a section of the communitylarge as that section may be. The money must be found, and the help of all the people is required. The Government has, therefore, decided to introduce legislation requiring all persons to subscribe to war loans in proportion to their means. I have reason to believe that such a measure will meet with the approbation of the chief financial institutions of Australia. While relying, as in the past, upon the patriotic spirit of the people to furnish the major portion of our loan supplies voluntarily, it has been determined that in so f a r as subscriptions to any war loan fal l short of the amount required, resort must be made to compulsion. The neighbouring Dominion of New Zealand has passed legislation in this direction, which has had a stimulating effect on recent loan operations. The measure to be submitted will provide a penalty of twice the. annual average of income tax paid during the past three years upon those citizens who do not voluntarily contribute. The enforcement of the penalty, however, will not absolve the person subjected to it from the obligation to subscribe the amount demanded. The B ill will apply to the seventh war loan at present in course of flotation. A Board of Appeal will be created with power to exempt an appellant either wholly or in part. The Government is convinced that when the equity and necessity for such a measure are f u l l y appreciated by the people it will meet with general support. Loans to the States. In August, 1918, the Commonwealth raised in London for the States (except New South Wales) a loan of Â£4,750,000 at 5.J per cent., the currency being 1922-1927.

A t the Conference held with the State Treasurers in July last it was agreed that r the Commonwealth shall find loan moneys for the calendar year 1919 amounting to Â£2,580,000 for the public works of the States, except New South Wales. How the additional money for the States is to be found has not yet been decided, but an undertaking has been given to the British Government that during the war no further application will be made in London by the Commonwealth on behalf of the five States for moneys other than renewal loans. Co-ordination of Australian public borrowing. One of the objects of Federation was to secure better control of public loans, but no solution of the difficulties has yet been arrived at, notwithstanding numerous conferences and much discussion. Though the exigencies, of the war have brought the Commonwealth and the States into closer connection than they were before, the result is still f a r from what is desirable. The position is that(1) The Commonwealth is raising huge war loans. (2) The Commonwealth is raising money overseas-for five out of six States, but these States are locally. (3) The conversion loans of the States, both in Australia and in London, are arranged by the State Governments. (4) The New South Wales Government raises its own loans in London as well as in Australia for all its requirements. (5) Municipalities and like bodies borrow separately. Â£ Under these conditions clashing in .. .. 33,109 evitably results, and will become more .. .. 1,500,000 noticeable as time goes on. During the next ten years something .. .. 20,000 like Â£390,000;000 of Australian loans .. .. 1,500,000 will have to be redeemed, being about Â£200,000,000 of State loans and Â£190,000^000 of war loans. Practically ' .. .. 500,000 the whole of this immense sum must be provided for by renewal flotations. Moreover, additional sums will be reÂ£40,937,109 quired for war, for repatriation, and for State public works. It will be seen that a herculean financial task is ahead. The rehabilitation of the world's suspended industries and the restoration of devastated provinces will absorb much money when peace comes, and the finances of the nations will probably be in such a condition that there will be little opportunity for Australia to get new loans overseas for years to come. Australian loan requirements must therefore depend more than hitherto upon Australian resources. The Government has taken into consideration the difficulties of the present, and the immediate future, and has proposed to the State Governments that they 'should give to the Commonwealth f u l l control of all .State and local government borrowing for the three years ending 3 Ist December, 1921. If this proposal is agreed to, conversion' operations overseas will be undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. The business ih Australia will also be conducted by the Commonwealth after conference with the State or Statesi n terested. Transactions with the Savings' Banks will be l e f t to the States to deal with, but market operations will be managed by the Commonwealth. I believe that the Commonwealth will be able to secure better terms than any State, but the chief and immediate advantage of placing all loans under one themselves borrowing .management will lie in the avoidance of embarrassment and loss which must result from the jostling of seven competitive borrowers in so critical a period. The Commonwealth alone can co-ordinate control of the loan business, and make arrangements which will be satisfactory to all interests. These are the arguments which have been put before the States, and the Goernment is now awaiting their replies. P u b l i c D e b t of t h e Common w e a l t h .

Owing to the control and sale by the Governmeut of important .primary products, financial operations never before undertaken by a Government Department in Australia have to be managed by the Treasury. Without such an arrangement it is clear that these huge operations could not have been successfully undertaken by the producers. In the year 1917-18 it was necessary to arrange finance for Â£26,750,000 on account of wheat: Â£45,000,000 on account of wool; and Â£5,000,000 in respect of other primary productsa total of Â£76,750,000 Afte r conferences with the banks it was agreed that they should carry a wheat overdraft at 5 per cent, per annum, and that they should bring to Australia money received by them in Londoni n respect of wool, skins, wheat, rabbits, and butter. This was subject to the following conditions : 1. The Treasurer to advance in Australia up to Â£24,000,000 in Australian notes to the banks, if required, the shares of the several banks in the Â£24,000,00,0 to be based upon . the average deposits for the quarter ended 30th September, 1917. % 2. An y bank getting anÂ« advance to furnish security by depositing 1 an equivalent amount in the Bank of England. 3. The interest earned by the deposit with the Bank of England to belong to the Commonwealth. 4. An y bank receiving an advance to have the right at any time to repay the amount in Australia, and the Commonwealth Treasurer simultaneously to return to the bank a corresponding amount in London. 5. In respect of wool and skins, the banks to pay out Â£99 15s. in Australia for every Â£100 received by them in London, but money received by them for other primary products to be transferred to Australia at par. All these transactions to be on telegraphic basis. 6. Advances by the Commonwealth to the banks not repaid in Australia by 31st December, 1918, and overdrafts granted by the banks in respect of wheat, but not then cleared off, to be subject to review and mutual arrangement as to their continuance or repayment; the banks to have the right in A p r i l , 1918, to reopen questions involved in this clause so far as they relate to overdraft on wheat. 7. The Treasurer to guarantee repayment of wheat overdrafts. The banks recently asked for an increase of the rate payable on the wheat overdraft, but the Treasurer found h i m self unable to accede to the request. r The overdraft at present stands at Â£13,471,000. It was found that the banks did not require advances of the f u l l amount of Â£24,000,000, the actual advances never exceeding Â£7,192,000. This amount has now been reduced to Â£1,729,000. The Treasury, in August, 1918, approached the banks with a request that they should transfer to Australia the wool money which will be payable in'London for the clip of the season now begun. Theamount is estimated 'at about Â£50,000,000. Most of the banks have agreed to take their shares, and the Treasury is still in correspondence with the others. An y amount not taken by the banks will be .financed by the Treasury. The conditions of advances by the Treasury to the banks are similar to those of 1917-18, but the aggregate must not exceed Â£20,000,000. Shortlyi t will be necessary to determine how the wheat crop of 1918-19 is to be financed. Wool. On behalf of Australian wool growers, the Government has sold the Commonwealth wool clips for the period during the currency of the war and one f u l l wool year commencing on the 1st July after the termination of hostilities. the Constitution! powers conferred by the War Precautions Act, as are so many other far-reaching things. That question opens up a great number pf points that are of vital consequence, not only to us in this House,",34,Budget 1918 19
104,Mr Higgs,Ho w is that done under,38,Budget 1918 19
105,Mr Watt,"It is done under thebut also to the people with whose interests we are dealing. There are some phases of the War Precautions Regulations to which objection is taken, of course; but I do believe that the -business side of the War Precautions Act, and the Regulations made under it , will be unanimouslv approved by all parties in the House. It may be necessary, for purposes of that kind, to go further than the present Act allows in order to* safeguard these huge transactions. As new worded,' the Act operates only for the period of the war and six months thereafter. That, however, is a matter about whicli the Government will have something to say to the House at the proper time. The flat rate of Is. 3Â£d. per lb. for greasy wool is continued, but the rate for handling charges has been raised from f d . to | d . per lb. Such prices are final as regards wool for British Government purposes. Tn relation to wool sold for other purposes, wool-growers are to receive half of any excess which may be obtained over the basic price. Some time will elapse before the amount of the final dividend ( if any) for 1916-17 can be determined. For the season 1917-18 the sum of Â£42,662,215 13s. 7d. has been paid to wool-growers. Appraisements for the season 1918-19 have commenced, and it is estimated that, before the end of the present calendar year, approximately 800,000 bales, valued at about Â£20,000,000, will be appraised and paid for, subject to the retention of 10 per cent. Probably the major portion of the balance of the clip, about 1,250,000 bales (of an approximate value of Â£29,500,000), will be appraised, and payment made for same, before the end of May. The total value of this year's wool is estimated at Â£49,500,000. An appraisement will take place towards the end of June next in all centres to clean up all odd parcels of wool and to close the 1918-19 wool season. The sum of Â£125,179, representing licence-fee payments by the Wool Tops Manufacturing Companies, has been credited to the Commonwealth Government Wool Tops Manufacturers' Account. A matter for congratulation is that the British Government has seen fit to arrange for these gigantic purchases, which guarantee stability to the important, pastoral industry during this time of crisis. Afr. WattI t is also fortunate that the Wool Committee, who have laboured so incessantly at this unpaid war service, have so efficiently and smoothly discharged their onerous responsibilities.

Our production of lead amounts to about 175,000 tons per annum, and the exportable output has been sold to the British Ministry of, Munitions, with the exception of lead for the markets of the East. The surplus output of copper has also beeu sold u n t i l the end of this year to the British Ministry of Munitions. The value of the output per annum is approximately Â£5,000,000. An embargo has been placed on. the exportation of t in ores and concentrates, aud in future all locally-produced t in ore and concentrates will be smelted in Australia. The formation of a Tin Producers' Association has been approved, which will protect the interests of all producers. Local requirements will be provided for. The Association will remain under British control, and the Commonwealth Government will be represented on the Board of Directors. The Australian output of wolfram, scheelite, and molybdenite has been acquired for the Imperial authorities, and it is gratifying that the production of these necessary ores has increased almost 100 per cent, compared with 1914. Considerable sums of money are being expended on up-to-date plants for the treatment and purification of these minerals. Newcastle is becoming the centre of much activity in the production of iron and steel and manufactures thereof. On the whole, the base-metal industry of Australia is in a prosperous condition. So vital is the supply of iron and steel to' the Commonwealth, that the Government has taken an option of purchase over the' Blythe River leases, situated near Burnie, on the. North-west Coast of Tasmania. W it h the production of refined metals in the Commonwealth, subsidiary industries are being developed, such as the manufacture of plate and sheet i r o n ; wire; white and red lead; zinc pigments; and sheet zinc. Bluestone is being produced, and white arsenic production is steadily increasing"". The fabrication of arsenical compounds is important to the pastoral industry for sheep and cattle dips, also to orchardists The y are parties to this for spraying compounds. The production of antimony has not advanced as it should have done, and plants for the treatment of auriferous antimonial ores must be installed in the near future. The production of. bismuth is well established, and there is every prospect that within the next year there will be ample capacity for the treatment of all bismuth concentrates recovered in Australia. Sugar. An agreement has been entered into with the Queensland Government . under which the entire crop of sugar in Queensland has been acquired for the seasons 1918 and 1919 by the Queensland Government, on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, at Â£|21 per ton of raw sugar of 94 nett titre. The price to the public will remain as at present. The agreement continues all existing condi tions, and gives some assurance to this important primary industry. The carry over of sugar from last year amounted to approximately 50,000 tons of refined sugar, which exceeds the normal season's surplus. Cyclones and bad winter conditions will mean shorter production, and it is expected that this surplus w ill be absorbed during the current year. Jam. For the 1917-18 season, the Commonwealth succeeded' in obtaining orders from the Imperial War Office for 12,000,000 lbs. of Australian jam, and from the Government of the United States for 38,000,000 lbs. Ordersf or 3,500,000 lbs. of jam .were also secured from the"" Indian Government. The price was fixed at 5s. 3d. per dozen lbs. f.o.b. A further order, totalling 22,000,000 lbs., has been received from the Imperial authorities, and is being allotted to manufacturers. These quantities were distributed amongst jam manufacturers in all States. For the purposes of the contracts, in 1917-18 arrangements were made to supply contractors with sugar at the reduced price of Â£ 2 4 per ton. The total quantity allotted at this price amounted to approximately 14,500 tons. As the ordinary price of sugar is Â£ 2 7 7s. 6d. per ton, it will be seen that its supply at the lower rate represents a substantial concession to manufacturers. Leather. For the purpose of regulating the supplies and prices of leather",40,Budget 1918 19
112,Mr Higgs,That is all right as long,41,Budget 1918 19
113,Mr Watt,"used in manufacture of military and civilian boots and shoes, a Oommonwealth Leather Industries Board was constituted under the War Precautions Begulations in May, 1917. The Board's activities were at first mainly directed towards the regulation of prices charged hy tanners for the.various leathers used in the manufacture of ordinary boots and shoes. A complete schedule of prices for these leathers has ""been fixed. For the just enforcement of these .prices on the tanners, it was necesthe veto of the responsible Minister. Dursary to fix the price of hides, and a schedule of prices has heen determined which preserves the formerly existing relative values of hides and leathers. In order toconserve supplies, the free rangements for winter provision. All export of both hides and leather has been prohibited, -permits to ship abroad being granted when the Department is assured that local requirements are fully met. In 1915, at the request of the Indian Government, the Commonwealth undertook the purchase and shipment to India of leather required by that Government. The first shipment was made in December, 1915. Since that date the value of leather shipped to India is Â£114,283 14s. 2d. A new order for 600,000 lbs., representing a value of approximately Â£70,000, has just heen given to suppliers, but no portion of the order has yet been shipped. In order to arrange for the export of surplus leather to the TJnited Kingdom the Government is endeavouring to secure the modification of a rule, established by the Imperial authorities, that preference in shipment is to be given to hides instead of leather. The Government appreciates the disabilities under which the leather manufacturers are labouring, and advices recently received from the Prime Minister indicate a prospect of early relief. Butter. During 1917-18 the total quantity of butter stored by the Federal Butter Committee of Australia for shipment to the TJnited Kingdom in connection with the Imperial contract for butter was 1,232,802 cases, the value being Â£4,488,621. For the 1918 Winter Butter Pool 35,460 boxes were placed in store for local consumption, the value of which was Â£129.800. . The total quantity of butter handled during. 1917-18 was 1,268,262 cases, valued at Â£4,618,421. Negotiations, which are not yet concluded, have been entered into for the sale to the Imperial Government of surplus butter and cheese during the year ending 30th June, 1919. The Prime Minister is doing his utmost to conclude the sale in London, and it is hoped that negotiations will be finalized shortly. All arrangements have been decided upon, contingent on the sale being made, to form and conduct a pool, the control of which it is intended to hand over to the producers? representatives under regulations which they will operate subject to ing the period for which the Pool Committee is elected they will control the whole of Australia's output, except that of Western. Axistralia, and will make arthe profits will he distributed amongst the producers. Board of Trade. A Board of Trade, consisting of three Ministers and two outside business men, has been created, the functions of which are:. 1. To investigate and report upon matters referred to it by the Minister. 2. Generally to consider and advise the Government upon matters affecting the trade and industry of the Commonwealth. Already the deliberations of this body have proved of the utmost value, and the' Government is hopeful that, as its work develops, its increasing usefulness will he generally recognised by the producing and mercantile community. Bureau of Commerce and Industry. There has been created a Bureau of Commerce and Industry whose functions are to organize commerce and industry throughout the Commonwealth. A Director has been appointed, and steps have been taken to invite the co-operation of those engaged in the great primary and secondary industries of the nation. The Government feels that this Bureau should be.free from political control, so that producers, manufacturers, and traders may be encouraged to voluntarily unite in preparatory organization for the important period of reconstruction that will follow the war. Institute of Science and Industry. Provision has been made in the Estimates for the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry, the Directorate of which will supersede the present Advisory Council.

Commonwealth Government Line of Australia. Steamers and Shipbuilding in America. During the past twelve months the operaand tions of the Commonwealth Government Line have been successfully continued and extended. Of the fifteen steamers origiVictoria. nally purchased in 1916, it is regretted that two have been lost by enemy action, namely, the Australdaleon the 19th October, 1917, and the Australbush on the 13th to large amount of cargo offering for shipment, and which was urgently required for war purposes by Great Britain and the Allies, the Government purchased the sailing vessels John Murray, Speedway, and the hulk Shandon. The John Murray left Australia at the end of last year with a f u l l cargo of wheat for thc United States of America, but on her return voyage she was totally wrecked on Maiden Island on the 22nd May. The management of eighteen ex-enemy vessels was taken' over from the Navy Department by the Commonwealth Government Line during the early part of this year. Two of these vessels also have been sunk by the enemy. Contracts have been entered into with American shipbuilding firms for the construction of four wooden motor vessels and ten wooden steamers. All the motor vessels, namely, the Gethana, Gulburra, Gooleha, and Ghallamba have. been launched, and the first-the Gethanaarrived in Sydney recently with a cargo of steel plates, paper, and lumber. The second-the Gulburra-is now on the loading berth at an American port, and is expected to leave almost immediately for Australia. Of the ten steamers, the Bellata, Bundarra, Birriwa, Berringa, and Bethanga have been launched, and every effort is being made to expedite the' completion of the contract. It is at present intended that these vessels shall be employed in the Pacific trade, and carry wheat to America, returning with general cargo. Exclusive of the vessels building in Australia, the Commonwealth of Australia at an early date will have a fleet of forty-five cargo vessels, which, at such a time as this, must be considered satisfactory. Oversea Shipping. The scarcity of tonnage arising out of the heavy demand for transport in the Northern Hemisphere, and the destruction of ocean craft by enemy submarines, developed so many problems affecting the disposal of Australian products that it was thought desirable to place the whole overseas shipping business under the control of an impartial and capable authority. Consequently the Commonwealth Shipping Board was formed ih February, 1917. Under the direction of the Board, the Overseas Central Committee, with subcommittees at each of the principal ports, November, 1917. In order attends to the loading of all overseas attempt to cope w i th the steamers. The sub-committees send reports and recommendations as to space requirements and distribution to the Central Committee, which, 'in its t u r n , reports to the Commonwealth. Shipping Board.. In this way, equitable treatment of shippers and the most economic and effective use of space are secured. How essential it has become to make the utmost use of space available is illustrated by a comparison of the overseas shipping inwards and outwards before the War and at the present time. During the year' ending December, 1913, 2,014 ships amounting to 5,371,531 tons entered, and 1,971 vessels of 5,230,417 tons cleared at Australian ports. In the twelve months ending 30th June last, only 1,078. vessels of a total tonnage of 2,488,920 tons entered, and 1,117 of 2,614,656 tons cleared. This represents a reduction of inward and outward tonnage of over 50 per cent. Besides the actual losses, large numbers of vessels which in normal times served Australian requirements, have been diverted to other work. Inter-State and Coastal Shipping. The coastal shipping has also been greatly depleted by the transfer of Inter-State vessels to service overseas. No less than fifty-three of such vessels, with an aggregate tonnage of 195,617, have been taken off the coast. In addition, sixteen ships of an aggregate tonnage of 77,017, which in normal times served Australian coastal requirements, have been removed to other work, leaving their former services to be performed by the remaining fleet. The position in the coastal and Inter-State trade, as a consequence, became so acute that it was deemed advisable to appoint a Central Committee to regulate and secure the most economic use of the space available, the whole of the shipping business thus beingbrought under the administration of the Controller of Shipping. Despite the surrounding difficulties, the result of this arrangement has proved in the highest degree beneficial. Regulation of Capital Issues. The issue of capital by companies became subject to Treasury control under the Wa r Precautions Regulations in January, 1916. S'nce then, 821 mining applications have been received, and consent has been given to a capitalization of Â£9,394,000. Manufacturing and producing"" applications numbering 2,194 have been received, aud consent has been given to capitalization of Â£30,099,000. The other applications received number 1,332, in respect of which authority has been given to a capital of Â£20,092,000. The total applications have been 4,347, and the total capital authorized has been Â£59,585,000. The figures include capital of reconstructed businesses and moneys required to pay off maturing debentures and other liabilities, as well as new projects The mining purposes are chiefly coal, gold, molybdenite, t in , and wolfram.

In the administration of the regulations' every effort is made to avoid placing unnecessary restrictions on raising for production, tension of Australian Mr Watt. The expenditure of money on amusement businesses has been made subject to Treasury consent. The practice is to refuse permission for the erection of buildings for amusement purposes in localities where the public is now catered for. The effect is to prohibit the investment of capital in new amusement ventures. Expenditure required to effect necessary repairs to existing structures is usually allowed. Speaking generally, I believe that, although some sections of the commercial world may have chafed under the restrictions, the ' regulations have been amply justified in this time of war. capital permitted in relaRepatriation.

A. scheme for utilizing portions of the farming areas for repatriation purposes is now being prepared. The current expenditure of the Federal Capital Territory has now been so far reduced that the revenue is almost equal to the expenditure. Railways. The two ends of the Trans-Australian railway were linked up on the 17th October, 1917, and the first train carrying passengers was run through from Port Augusta on the 22nd October, 1917. The traffic has largely exceeded expectations; three through passenger trains are now run each way per week. sengers must book well ahead to secure accommodation, and their numbers are steadily increasing. The live-stock traffic is growing. construction of the Tailway will enable 'large tracts of pastoral lands to be developed which otherwise would have remained undeveloped. The goods traffic is also increasing. Consignments of perishables are transported from the Eastern States to K a l goorlie and Perth. The loss in working the line for the eight months ending 30th June, 1918, amounted to Â£57,428. It is estimated that working expenses will exceed the revenue by Â£44,000 in 1918-19. Provision has been made in the current year's Estimates for Â£300,000 to provide for additional rolling-stock, water supplies, ballasting, and other construction expenses. Oodnadatta Railway is worked by the State of South Australia for and oh behalf of the Commonwealth. During the year just closed the loss to the Commonwealth in the working of this railway was approximately Â£37,000. That loss has to be provided for in this year's Estimates. The loss on the previous year's working was Â£43,640. that up. with South Australia, we cannot do that: .

The extension of the Northern Territory Railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River (54 miles) was completed during the last financial year. In the 1917 season, 18,869 cattle were Trans-Australian Line. trucked for Vesteys, Darwin, and for the 1918 season 28,795. A greater number would have been trucked during the latter season but for industrial troubles, just prior to commencement, between Vesteys and a section of their employees. It is anticipated that at least 40,000 cattle will be carried next year. PasDuring the financial year just closed the loss in . working expenses over revenue amounted to Â£21,126. The working expenses of this line have The been carefully considered by the Com-' monwealth Railways Commissioner, and it is probable that the railway w ill during the ""present financial year-for the first time since taken over by the Commonwealth-pa y working expenses, and return a sum of Â£5,000 tb the Treasury towards interest. Provision of Â£15,000 is made for the Northern Territory Railway, of which Â£7,000 is required toward the completion of the railway from Darwin to Pine Creek, and Â£8,000 for additional rolling-stock and certain other works entailed by the development of the traffic.

Hitherto the work at the Central Flying School at Point Cook has been limited to elementary instruction, but it has now been decided to establish a new course' which will produce pilots completely trained and ready for service abroad. Proposals have been worked out for the creation of air services for Australia on a more extensive scale than was contemplated before the war. The necessary expenditure will be large. The scheme involves the creation of a force of which the personnel will in normal times be citizens. They will be trained during suitable periods by a smaller number of permanent instructors. critical period it is not advisable to publish details of the works to be undertaken. The planes, engines, and materials for their construction will be produced within the Commonwealth. Amalgamation of Federal and State Taxation Offices. This proposal has been the subject of much discussion at recent Conferences between the Treasurers of the Commonwealth and the States. The scheme of handing over the collection of the direct Federal taxes to the States was not acceptable to the Government, for reasons which I have explained to the House. offered the States to collect their income taxes for one-third of the present cost. This offer was not accepted. W it h a view to simplifying the labours of taxpayers, the Taxation officers of the respective Governments were requested to collaborate in the preparation of a uniform schedule for Federal and State purposes, hut reported their inability to do so, in the face of the differences in the existing Income Tax Acts. In all the circumstances, I believe that the proper course is for the States to pass laws based upon the Officers' D r a f t B ill , or the new Commonwealth Act, and to transfer the collection to the Commonwealth. If the States demur at this proposition because of a fear that their claim upon the money involved would be prejudiced, the Federal Parliament should be prepared to give them suitable statutory guarantees. Revenue and Expenditure, 1918-19. Let us now turn to the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for the present year (1918-19):Â£ The revenue for this year, not including proceeds . of additional taxation proposed, Is estimated at 35,314,500 which is a reduction on the actual receipts for last year of . . . .

W it h respect to the other decreases and increases, I may say(1) Succession duties are obvipusly liable to large differences in annual yield. (2) The decrease in shipping revenue is apparent and not real. A Trust Account has now been established for the enemy vesvels which have been handed over by the Navy to the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers. The receipts of those vessels are credited to the Trust Account, and only the balance of receipts over expenditure is carried into the Revenue Account. The total Shipping Receipts included in the Revenue for 1917-18 are Deduct Expenditure Net Revenue-1917-1 8 . .

In 1916-17, an advance was made out of revenue for the purchase of cloth for the Expeditionary Eorces. The amount was repaid out of ""War Loan in 1917-18, and the item does not recur this year. (4) The Post Office increase is acJ counted for by increased business of all kinds. (5) Miscellaneous receipts and other items are subject to fluctuations, as they include many non-recurring items. the German owners of those ships for the repayment of .earnings after the war? the question of international law on the point; that would involve, perhaps, as long a statement as that I am now making. able -member, as a fearless layman, to discuss the matter himself; because the lawyers in the House do not seem inclined to do so. Estimates of Expenditure from Revenue, 1918-19, compared with 1917-18. It often happens that, in considering the Budget proposals of the Government, a comparison is made between the "" actual"" expenditure of the previous year and the "" estimate "" for the current year. This is misleading, because the invariable experience is that large sums provided on the Estimates remain unexpended at the end of the year. That is strikingly exemplified in the accounts of 1917-18, for which the estimated expenditure was Â£37,283,832, but the actual expenditure . . Â£3,039,986 was Â£34,975,304, the amount expended .. 994,520 being Â£2,308,528 less than the Estimate. The Estimate of Expenditure for 1917-' 18, as already stated, was Â£37,283,832, whereas the Estimate for 1918-19 is Â£45,344,595, representing an increase of Â£8,060,763. This increase is made up as follows:Â£2,455,000 Decrease. Increase. Commonwealth expenditure other than war .. .. .. Â£471,988 War expenditure out of revenue . . Payments to States .. .. .. ..

Â£8,000,763 It will be noticed that the Commonwealth expenditure, apart from war, is estimated at Â£471,988 less than the esti1 mate for last year. The following is an explanation of this decrease:Increases. Decreases.

In the Department of Defence,the increase is caused by the additional training which it is proposed to give to the Citizen Forces during this financial year. A payment in relation to increased cost of seamen's wages under Arbitration Court award explains most of the increase in the Prime Minister's Department.

119,,"Mr WATTEstimates of the Department. As they previously appeared in another section of % the Estimates no increase of cost is involved. There is larger expenditure in the High Commissioner's Office, due to war work. In the Navy Department considerable increases have been caused by revision of the pay of the sea-going Forces by additions to the numbers of those Forces, and by more numerous Citizen Forces. The decrease in the Department of Trade and. Customs is due to the fact that Â£200,000 was provided on the Estimates, 1917-18, for remission of duty on cornsacks. This is a non-recurring item. It has heen possible to reduce the nonwar expenditure of 1918-19, as compared with the estimate for 1917-18, by Â£471,988, notwithstanding the fact that large inevitable and automatic increases of expenditure have to be provided for. These may be set out as follows:Invalid and old-age pensions Â£95,000 Apple and shale oil bounties 29,250 Interest' on Treasury billsworks, &c. Payments to States Interest on transferred properties Universal training-militar y and naval Collecting direct taxation . . Automatic increments to permanent officers under Arbitration Court awards, &c. 81,704 Sundry increases . . -Had it been possible to avoid these increases', the reduction in the Estimates for .the coming year, instead of being .Â£471,988, would have heen Â£1,394,550. Reductions in Estimates of Expenditure. I may mention that after the Estimates of expenditure were finally revised by the Departments, they were reduced as follows:Estimates in chief New works payable out of revenue New works payable out of loan Total reductions War Expenditure included in Ordinary Estimates. that almost all the Departments, are performing work due to the war, and this is reflected in the expenditure.

Of these 1,083 showed excess profits when compared with the pre-war standard. 'The 'tax assessed to these businesses amounted to Â£1,064,857, of which there was collected up to 30th June last the sum of Â£680,008. The average tax per taxpaying business was Â£983. The number of new businesses was 173, and these were called upon to pay Â£94,573 in tax, or an average tax per new business of Â£546. assessed numbered .910, and their taxes aggregated Â£970,284. per old business was Â£1,0 Mr Watt. The Government has carefully studied the general incidence and effect of this impost, and has decided that it 'would not be justified in recommending it3 aboli* tion.

I now come to the question of new taxation. As already stated the revenue of 1918-19 at existing rates is likely to be Â£6,125,004 less than the expenditure. To bridge this gap it is proposed to obtain in 1918-19 the following estimated additional revenue: From Customs and Excise Â£1,985,000 â Income tax ... 2,200,000 â Land tax. ... 380,000 ,, Entertainments, tax 275,000 ,, Postage war tax ... 516,000 .. 21,129,602 Â£45,831,761 Total taxation 5,356,000 . .

Â£30,996 I shall now deal with these subjects in dueorder. Customs and Excise Revenue. The Customs and Excise revenue in 1917-18 was Â£13,225,295, and, not taking into account the revenue which will result from the new taxation, would yield in 1918-19 the estimated amount of Â£12,050,000, a falling off of Â£1,175,295. The old businesses which were The Â£12,050,000 shows a very serious decline compared with 1915-16, when the The average tax revenue reached Â£16,934,103. This represents, a reduction of Â£4,884,103. In last financial year certain luxury rebe subject to. Federal land tax is as foi-; strictions took effect. They operated for lows:only a part of the year, hut they will influence the revenue' for the whole of 1918-19.

J?he tax assessed in 1914-15 and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth was Â£2,347,000. Since that year sales during"" 1918-19 would be very -much less have operated to decrease the revenue, than has been estimated, and in this conthe tax to be finally assessed for 1917-18 nexion it may be pointed out that stimubeing estimated at Â£1,900,000. Comlants and tobacco, at present rates of paratively few sales have been made by duty, are estimated to provide well over the larger land-owners. This is probably 50 per cent, of the total Customs and due to the exceptional prices obtainable Excise revenue. The proposals for the new duties, which purchasing additional land, and taxpaywill be levied wholly oh stimulants and ing absentees also appear as purchasers. tobacco, will be introduced to the House In 1915-16 and 1916-17, 4,065 residents by the Honourable the Minister for Trade of Australia, who already paid land tax, and Customs on the conclusion of the purchased additional land, while sixtyBudget Speech. Including the Â£1,985,000 three taxpaying absentees also increased estimated to be received from the additheir holdings. The total value of the tional duties, the total revenue frpm land purchased by these 4,128 persons is stimulants and tobacco is estimated for Â£6,210,000, the average purchase being 1918-19 at Â£8,337,050, which represents Â£1,504. The latest complete statistics 59 per cent, of the total estimated Cus(for 1914-15) show that ownership pf taxtoms and Excise revenue of Â£14,035,000. able land was distributed as follows: Income Tax. It is proposed that the rates of income tax collected for last year shall be increased by 30 per cent. The additional yield Â£2,200,000. The flat rate on companies will be raised to 2s. 6d. in the Â£ 1 . The in Crown leasehold lands was assessed in estimate of the revenue at the old rates is 1914 at Â£12,240,000. This value will be Â£7,400,000 for 1918-19, so that the total greatly increased for succeeding yeara now expected from income tax this year when the additional lands dealt with are is Â£9,600,000.

The unimproved value of lessees' estates included.. The basis ^of the valuation is The actual collections of land tax in Tbis being expected' to yield about Â£380,000, the total revenue in 1918-19 is estimated at Â£2,380,000. Entertainments Tax This tax is charged on persons who pay more than 6d. for admission to entertainments. Certain proprietors who, -when the tax was introduced, decided to maintain their former prices unaltered, and to pay thei tax themselves, were compelled by pressure from competitors to collect the tax from the publio. In the six months ended June, .1917. the taxable entertainments numbered 67,799. Doubling these figures for twelve months we have the following position: Taxable entertainments in 191617 Taxable entertainments in 1917-18 IncreaseA t present rates of tax, the revenue is devoutly to be hoped that this aid and ' estimated for 1918-19 at Â£205,000. This shows a falling off of Â£40,890 compared with Â£245,890 received in 1917-18. The decrease is explained by the curtailment of horse-racing and boxing. The Government proposes to impose a tax of one penny on 3d. and 6d. admissions to entertainments. Admissions at these prices are at present free of tax. The extra yield for 1918-19 is estimated at Â£275,000, bringing the estimate of total revenue up to Â£480,000. Postage War Tax. The proposal for a postage war tax is that there shall bean increase of | d . on letter-cards, postdiscipline from which they have happily cards, newspapers, and packets. yield for 1918-19 is estimated at Â£516,000. Transfer from London Funds. In last financial year the Treasurer included in his Estimates of Revenue a sum of Â£825,355 which he proposed to transfer from London funds. The money was not required, as the actual revenue exceeded expectations. Â£800,000 from these funds has been included -as part of the money to fill the gap I have referred to. The London funds were accumulated by transferring amounts from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to a Trust Account in anticipation of the supply of goods, &c -, in Britain. Large quantities of the goods for which provision was thus made have not been supplied, and are not likely to be shipped for months, and, perhaps, years. The moneys are therefore Jfr. Watt. available for transfer back to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Taking into consideration the fact that We are now in the fifth year of war, Australia is to be congratulated on the generally healthy condition of its finance, production, trade, and manufacture. This is, of course, partly due to recent good seasons and to the expenditure of considerable sums of loan money. The resulting stimulus would not, however, have operated with such tonic effect if we had not been able to dispose of our staple products. The purchases, of wool, wheat, metals, butter, and other primary commodities by fhe Mother Country, even when we could not deliver the goods, have contributed in the most visible and noteworthy way to the maintenance of 135,598 our stability and prosperity. ... ... 159,609 I wonder whether our people fully appreciate the . potent influence) of ... ... 24,011 Britain's wisdom and ""generosity in every phase of our national well-being. It is liberality may be continued until oversea oommerce resumes its normal flow. If not, our material situation will swiftly and surely become very serious. I sound this note after mature deliberation, for I am deeply impressed with Australia's dependence, not only alone for. safety, but also for material progress, upon our Home-land and Empire. There are obvious difficulties which mav prevent an indefinite repetition of this paternal magnanimity. If these embarrassments inÂ° tensify, then the people may have to accommodate themselves to a measure of The been free throughout the whole period of the war. The war prospect ia brighter to-day than it has been since the fateful month of August, 1914. The Allies have arrested and rolled back the Western German offensive, and in the assumption of the initiative' have inflicted heavy punishment on the enemy. In Macedonia, encouraging movements are also in progress. The magnificent victory in ' Palestine should fill every Australian heart with pride and thankfulness and with an unalterable resolve to stand firm until the end. Thus only can this nation prove itself worthy of its blood and"" heritage, and worthy of the 50,000 brave men who have laid down their lives that we may be safe and free. With due thanks for the consideration extended to me by honourable members on both sides of the chamber, I conclude by movingThat the first item in the Estimates under Division 1,' The Parliament, namely, "" The President, Â£1,100,"" be agreed to. his speech printed so that it may be circulated, as I think it should be, throughout Australia? be followed.

It is proposed to increase the rates on imported ale, beer, and stout by 3d. per gallon. This increase will be accompanied -by an increase on Australian beer. Ale and beer are at present prohibited imports, but 30 per cent, of the 1916-17 importations of stout is permitted. Imported Spirits.

Although this rate may appear high, it is pointed out that the British Government recently doubled the rate on spirits, the British duty at present being approximately 30s. per proof gallon. The higher duty on spirits necessitates consequential amendment in Tariff items 4, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 24. Australian Spirits. The. Excise rates on Australian spirits have been increased, and have the effect of generally reducing the margin in favour of the locally-made article, and, in two items, of abolishing it altogether. Under present conditions, the difficulties attending importation, such as partial prohibition of imported spirits, the shortage of shipping space and the consequently greatly increased charges' for Excise duty on cigarettes. A similar profreight, have been of considerable advanvision has been inserted in the' Excise tage to the local distillers. On the other Tariff hand, the increased cost of production of Australian spirits has been trifling. 'These spectively has been made in the duties on considerations justify, in the interests of cigars and cigarettes. revenue, a reduction in the margin of Australian Tobacco.

Sitting suspended from 6.18 to 7.1/.5 p.m. Debate resumed from 20th September (vide page '6286), on motion by Mr printing Wordsi n praise of their brave WATTThat the paper he printed. of the first ideas which entered my mind after seeing the statement read by the \j Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) last week was that this is a Government of statements and not a Government of deeds. ments, not of statesmen. sent Ministry exactly. During the lifetime of the present Parliament, I have listened to something over a dozen statements made on. behalf of the present Govern-, ment, but I have failed to discover that it and the party in power have ever gone beyond the making of those statements. Let us hope, in regard to this last statement, that -Ministers at length realize their responsibilities to the country, and will tackle seriously the big problems which confront Australia to-day. The statement now before us commences with expressions of hope and confidence in the military ments of the. Alliesa hope that we all share. obtain an honourable and just conclusion! to the great struggle now proceeding. But although the statement eulogizes the brave deeds of our boys at the Front, Ministers are content with mere words; they do not go further. All honour has been paid i h spoken and printed words to the brave young Australians who have risked their all for us, but little of a practical character has been done by this Government to recompense them for . their sacrifices. One .of the greatest troubles in this community to-day is the high cost of living, which affects the dependants of our soldiers. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs, the food and groceries that a householder bought in 1911 for Â£ 1 would now cost"" Â£ 1 l is . in Sydney and Â£ 1 9s.. 7d. in Melbourne. * That shows the extent to which the purchasing power of the sovereign has decreased; and I ask, when Ministers are paying eulogy to our soldiers, what are you going to do to rectify this reduction in the purchasing power of their money % The paltry 6s. per day which wte fixed as the pay of our soldiers on the outbreak of war does not purchase nearly as much . now as it did then, and it would be better for them if , instead of speaking and deeds, we increased their pay to an amount whose purchasing power would be y ) [7.45] -On e at least as great as that of the rate fixed at the outbreak of the war. better if we made an attempt to relieve them? done to that end, but the best way to relieve the distress among their dependants, their wives and children, is to T h a t hits off the preincrease their pay to an amount whose purchasing power will be equal to that of the rate of pay fixed at the beginning of the war If the recruits numbered twice what they are to-day, that would -not increase the purchasing power of money. We ought either .to give our soldierssufficient money to enable them and their dependants to purchase .those . things that are necessary for a decent degree of comfort, or we should compel the exploiters, those who by means of combines are controlling and increasing the prioes of foodstuffs, to provide the community with goods at a reasonable cost. achieveThe Government' are doing neither of these things. things are cheaper, in Australia than in any other part of the world. Mr. MAHONY E v e n the toys that Father Christmas brings to the children have increased in price by from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent. Honourable gentlemen opposite do not like to hear these statements. It does, not suit those on the other side to listen to the request that the soldiers' should get a f a i r deal, and that the exploiters should be prevented from robbing the dependants of the soldiers. They get uneasy when they hear statements such as I am now making. We must pay our soldiers at least 10s. per day to give them anything like a livin g wage.

129,We Desire That We May Mr Corser,"A t the present time,the report of the Board of Trade appointed by the Holman Government in New South ""Wales. It consisted: of a representative of the. employers and a representative of the employees, with His Honour Mr Justice Heydon as chairman. Having gone carefully into the whole question of the cost of. living, it delivered it as its opinion that Â£3 per week is the minimum wage that any man' in Australia should receive. That opinion was published only a few weeks ago, and in the face of it the Government should pay our soldiers at least 10s. per day, and increase the separation allowances accordingly. If this be not done, and the war goes on for another year or more, the purchasing power of money will be further reduced. When men and women cannot buy what they need, they are in a very bad way. With shame must it be said that the wives and children of our soldiers are compelled to depend on the generosity of goodhearted private citizens for a decent living. Instead of compelling them to depend on private charity, the Government should come down with taxation proposals which would make those who have the money contribute enough to give a decent living to fhe soldiers who are risking their lives and shedding their blood in defence ""of the wealth of the country. . putting a tax of 33 per cent, on the tickets bought by children to go to picture shows.

There is one nasty aspect of the question to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members. took place, and .the food supplies of the people of Australia were held by a gang of bandits, meat-preserving works were closed down. In my electorate there are such works, one of them known as the National Meat Preserving Works. to mention names. National Meat Preserving Works were closed down because there was no stock available. "" The class of trade carried on at these works is tinning meat for soldiers' rations; and I should like to remind honourable members that just a few months prior there had been some talk of a dispute in this industry in Sydney. The employees had threatened to cease work, but instead of doing so they agreed, to hold a conference, w i th the employers. The chairman of that conference was one of the largest meat preservers in New South Wales, and I shall be glad to give his name privately to any honourable member who desires to have it . A t the conference that gentleman said, "" Men, before you cease work remember the class of industry in which you are engaged; remember that one t in of meat is a day's ration for a soldier."" The result of that appeal was that the men, many of whom have sons and other relatives fighting a t the Front, decided not to stop Work upon any consideration, but to refer the dispute to ""arbitration. But when the meat bandits could not get their price from the people of this country, it was -"" their troubles "" about the soldiers' rations. It did not matter to them that over 1,000 men engaged in meat packing for soldiers should. be thrown out of work-ther e was then no talk of one t in of meat being a day's ration for a soldier. The only thing that mattered to them, was that they should have their price and their profits; otherwise there would be no meat for the people or for the soldiers. Let me quote some figures in this connection from the Sydney Sun of the 12th August last. This is not at a l l a Labour paper, but one t h a t : "" wallops"" the Labour party prettyhard, and I do not mind saying that I ' "" w a l l o p "" the Sun just as hard whenever I get a chance. In the article, which is introduced in heavy-type headlines, we may read as follows: When this strike EIGHT YEARS OF MEAT. For Army of 1,000,000 Men. Ration: 1J lb. per Day. Stock in New South WalesCattle, 2,361,152. Sheep, 33,713,901. Per head of population, 1$ head of cattle; 18 l-7th head of sheep. What we EatI do not t h in k it f a i r The average consumption of meat in New South Wales per annum, 181,142 tons. A t any rate, -the Eating meat every day, it would take eight years and four months to devour the stock in the country. I want the significance of these figures to sink into the minds of honourable membersThe people of New South Wales will not starve. Tliere is plenty of meat in the cupboard, though it is said that it has very littlefat on it now. The article then proceeds to give the. stock returns I have just quoted, and goes on to sayo If the Government decided to place the population on a meat ration, every man, woman, and child, even the baby newly born, could have l i head of cattle, and 18 l-7th head of sheep. That is to say, that would be the allowance for a bachelor or a spinster without dependants. Honourable members opposite may laugh, but I fancy that these figures are too deadly for them, and show up these meat bandits just as they ought to be shown up. We are told that there is a scarcity of sheep and cattle in Australia, b u t the figures show the true state of affairs. The article proceedsA man with a wife and child would get two bullocks, and 54} sheep, sufficient to start a nice little grazing farm. Tlie man with a large family to support could start out as a squatter. That is probably competition which some honourable members opposite would not likeIn other words, if the people of New South Wales decided to abstain from meat during the -' currency of .the war, this State would give a meat ration"" to an army of 1,000,000 soldiers for eight or nine years without exhausting the supply, the assumption being based upon the average ' normal consumptionof l i lb. per man per day, with an allowance for wastage.",63,Ministerial Statement

I was pleased indeed to know that those people did hoot my leader, because I knew from that that my leader must be a sturdy friend of the people of Australia. I will leave the subject there to tell its own sorry tale to the public as to the absolute ineptitude of the Government in respect to one of the greatest problems of the day. Another item in the Ministerial statement-that contained in the last paragraph-refer s to an amendment, amongst others, to the Maternity Allowance Act . That statement is like a scorpion-the sting is in its tail. I wonder what the Government propose to do. SinoeT am desirous at all times of helping any one in need of as-'stance, I propose to offer one or two brief suggestions as to what should be done with reference to the maternity allowance. The cost of living has enormously increased. One of the greatest problems confronting not only Australia, but the whole of the western civilization to-day, is in regard to population. A declining birth-rate.must be one of the greatest menaces to the people of the western world. To keep a nation strong, active, and virile, we must have an in "" Hands off our sacred procreasing population. A young Australian is the finest immigrant this country can ever have. The allowance of Â£ 5 is givenas a maternity grant. It is not conceded by way of a dole, but as a righ t to the people who endeavour to do a duty to the nation, and are tryin g to preserve the nation's well-being. We know that the. purchasing power of the Â£ 5 has vastly decreased since first the maternity allow-ance was granted. I , therefore, suggest that we bring the.maternity allowance up to the present purchasing value of the original sum of Â£ 5 t h e figure fixed by the Fisher Government when it placed I was unable to go that splendid law upon the statute-hook of our country. Next, in return for what the soldiers have done for us, and for the struggles that their women folk have had to make here, at home, throughout the war, I suggest that We make provision that in the case of the wife of a returned soldier the allowance be increased, and that instead of the purchasing power being made the equivalent of the original sum of Â£ 5 , an added amount be given. Such a measure will be of assistance to this country, because, irrespective of what party may he in power, if we neglect to encourage the natural increase of population by the b i r t h of virile children, we may as well say good-bye to the f u t u r e of this continent as the home of a great white race. I trust that the Government will amend the maternity allowance in the manner I have indicated, and so encourage the people to do their national duty. In conclusion, I hope that the Government and their supporters w ill remember the words of the Prime Minister, who, when appealing to the people before the last general elections, promised that not one stone in the temple of Labour would be disturbed. He assured the electors that the present. Government were non-partisan, and would leave things as they found them. I especially appeal to those -supporters of the Government who at one time were followers of the Fisher Government to remember their pledges, speeches, and vates upon the electoral laws, t h e pensions, scheme? and the maternity allowance, and to ponder carefully before they, dishonour the solemn promises of themselves and their leader.",65,Starving Amid Plenty

191,Mr Mahony,"Â£8.48] -The honourable member who has ' just resumed his seat drew attention to the concern he feels for the interests of the soldiers. In fact, in the speeches of all the honourable members opposite there is apparent a desire to impress the people with the great interest they have in .the men who are at the Front-as if they were singular in that respect. This war has brought together in the Army men from all trades and callings, and all social conditions. They have been associated in a common brotherhood formed to defend right from might;, and we can well understand what will be the feeling of those men when on their return they learn that honourable members opposite have never done anything to assist .the (Government to , carry on the war and have adopted only an attitude of criticism and jeering.

We have heard the usual talk to-night about the attitude of the Government in regard to the fixation of meat prices. We shall have such talk as long as this Parliament lasts,-because the meat question is one of the trump cards which the Opposition wish to play before the country when assailing the Government's price-fixing policy.

The Premier of Queensland ( Mr Ryan), in his wisdom made an agreement with the pastoralists of Queensland, and then increased the price of'meat supplied to the Imperial Government. Either he, as agent for the Imperial Government, robbed them, or he robbed the squatters. Bear in mind that the price at which meat was obtainablein the Brisbane butchers' shops, of which we have heard so much, was not the price at which it was sold in all the Queensland shops. Only certain butchers could buy the meat at the lower price If any honourable turned him, he would be kicked out of the House for bribery and corruption, and the Queensland Government should have been kicked out of the office to which they attained by bribery and corruption. If such tactics represent the morals of honourable members opposite, they are welcome to. them. Whatever fate befalls the present Federal Government, or. the honourable members on this side, I hope that none of us will ever be associated with a Government that wiU commit bribery and corruption in order to get position and power. ih order in referring to a State Government in such terms?

I do not take much interest in soft speeches and insinuations'. the Biblical saying, "" By their fruits ye shall know them."" believes in availing himself of the protection of Parliament in order to slander people outside. do not believe in the sublime philosophy of the Sinn Feiners. Government altered the original schedule of meat prices. They should have fixed the prices earlier, because I am certainly of opinion that the rates were being advanced through the operations of a Ring. However, I have referred to that matter in previous speeches, and I have no desire to imitate honourable members opposite, who have one speech, which they reproduce on every occasion. The prices which the Government, have now fixed are too high; but I am certain that, had the Government not taken action, beef would have risen another 4d. per lb. within six months. prevent the price being raised by 6d. per matter of fact, we are worse off now in lb. in respect of cattle bought on the respect of tonnage than we have been at hoof.

We cannot have contentment amongst the working classes unless we cut the ground from under the feet of those who are exploiting the people.

I do not propose to review to-night all the matters referred to in the Ministerial statement. As a whole, the contents are good, and worthy of serious consideration. But there is one matter ""to which I wish to call attention, because I consider that there has been an oversight. We have not realized the serious position in I regret that the which we are placed to-day. But the Governments upon the other side of the world do realize ""the serious crisis with which they, are faced, and the sooner we do the same thing the better it will be for us. Only the other night the honourable member for Eden-Monaro complained that the Government had not undertaken the revision of the Tariff.

205,Mr Archibald,"I do not thinkber think that we ought to wait till the war is over before increasing our Tariff? premature to talk about the. matter now. I have been under the impression that during the war it was the policy of the Government to prevent money being invested in new enterprises. figures quoted hy the Treasurer in his Budget statement to-day conclusively show that the Government are prepared to encourage any individual who is willing to invest his money in new industries. We hear .a good deal of talk concerning the wickedness of the capitalist who indulges in profiteering. To me, however, it seems as if there is profiteering going on all round. It is as.difficult to discover tory as an agreement which is arrived a needle in a haystack as it is to find anybody with anything to sell who is not intent upon profiteering. It can easily be demonstrated that 'the price of any manufactured article in Australia to-day is almost equal to its London parity. In the face of these facts it is obviously prewise there will be a cut-throat revolution mature to talk .about the framing of a new Tariff. One of the paragraphs in the Ministerial statement refers to the proposed creation of a Bureau of Science and In dustry, and announces that a Bill to give effect to this object will he submitted for onr consideration.' I do not know what the Government propose to do in regard ito this particular bureau. But it is time that Australia copied the example which has been set by England and America. What has been accomplished in the Old Country? At the present time there is nO unemployment in Britain, and the wages heing paid to the workers there are much higher than they were in pre-war days. and women of all classes in the Motherland have put their shoulders to the wheel in an effort to save civilization and the Empire, will make one of the most stirring chapters in history when it comes to he written. ,Despite all the difiiculties which previously existed there between Capital and Labour, upon the outbreak of' war both sides settled down resolutely to the task which was before them. The Prime Minister of England is a very brilliant man, but I do not think that he ever knew much about tradeunionism. I do not think that he was ever very deeply interested in trade unions. His knowledge of these organizations has been acquired during his career as a public man. As the result of the appointment of the Whitley Commission, he has hecome impressed with the fact that when he war is over there must be a Letter relationship between the working classes But the and the great manufacturing classes of England than existed prior to the war. That is the keynote of the report of tlie Commission in question. Here in Australia, the condition of the workers has been materially improved by reason of the war, and also because of decisions that have been given by the Arbitration Court. But, after all, no award by an industrial tribunal can prove as satisfacat bf.tween the parties to* any industrial dispute at a round-table conference. When the war is over, the workers will no longer be content to be merely employees in industries-the y will insist upon becoming partners in them. Otherand the red flag will be hoisted. Sir.

There, Mr Wjll Thome, Mr Ben Tillett, and others recognise the responsibility which will rest upon their shoulders when this fearful struggle is over. They realize that the workers will never return to the drab conditions of life which obtained prior to the war. That, I repeat, is the keynote of the report of ^he Whitley The way in which the men Commission. Let us constitute an authority to cover practically the same ground as has been covered by that body.

212,A Partner I N A Mr Archibald,"I did not go intoThere are one or two portions of the report of the Whitley Commission worth reading. This is oneWith thiB end in view, we are of opinion that the following proposals should be laid before the National Industrial Councils :(a) That district councils, representative of the trades unions and of the employers' association in the industry, should be created or developed out of the existing machinery for negotiation in .the various tradeB. (6) That works committees, representative of the management and of the workers employed, should be instituted in particular works to act in close co-operation with the district and national machinery. I think that we should have a National Industrial Council in Australia, and that the Government should set to work to establish one. It will he no disgrace to them if they fail owing to opposition from the industrialists. However, I do not believe that they will fail, though I would still advise them to make the attempt, even if I thought that their efforts would have no result. party, we have no right to allow honorahle memhers opposite to assume that they represent the workers. We must show the people that they can trust the National' party to give them all they have a right to expect from their industry, and that they can get it without having anything to do with those revolutionary clap-trap people who talk so much and do so little. There are other points in the Whitley Commission's report of equal importance. Among the questions with which it is suggested the National Councils should deal, or allocate to district councils or works committees, the following are selected for special mention:(i) The better utilization of the practical knowledge and 'experience of the workpeople. That is one of the results to be obtained by bringing them closely in touch with one another(ii) Means for securing to the workpeople a greater share in and responsibility for the determination and observance of the conditions under which their work is carried on. (iii) The settlement of the general principles governing the conditions of employment, including the methods of fixing, paying, and readjusting wages, having regard to the need for securing to the workpeople a share in the increased prosperity of the industry. That is what I have said. I am certain that we should get more industrial peace by a joint agreement. From* 1894 until I Mr Archibald. was kicked out of the party through following Mr HughesI was an executive officer of the waterside workers of Port Adelaide, ' and during that time we did not once have a dispute with our employers, .the ship-owners. We made apractice of meeting them from time to time and fixing the wages and conditions of work. Notice was given on either side that a re-adjustment was required. That state of affairs continued until the workers in Port Adelaide joined the federation. Since then their time has not been such a happy one. What occurred in Port Adelaide could happen i in every industry in Australia if the employers and the workers were willing. What a saving would be effected! Look1 at the cost ""of arbitration. Look at the expense of the whole game. Look at the organizer, who, half his time, is engaged in.fomenting disputes. He was not required under the old system of agreements and round-table conferences, and he will not be required if this re-organizaAs a National tion to. which I have referred is brought about. Other questions suggested in the Whitley Commission's report for reference to district councils or works com.mittees are' (iv) The establishment of regular methods of negotiation for issues arising between employers and workpeople with a view both to the' prevention of differences and to their better adjustment when they appear. (v) Means of insuring to the workpeople the greatest possible security of earnings and employment without undue restrictions upon change of occupation or employer: (vi) Methods of fixing and adjusting earnings, piece-work prices, &c, and of dealing with the many difficulties whioh arise with regard to the method and amount of payment, apart from the fixing of general standard rates, which are already covered by paragraph (iii). (vii) Technical education and training. (viii) Industrialresearch, and the full utilization of its results. (ix) The provision of facilities for the full consideration and utilization of inventions and improvements designed by work people, and for the adequate safeguarding of the rights of the designers of such improvements.

The reason why a ballot of the organizations is being taken is that it was claimed that in two of the States represented at the Conference, namely South Australia and Tasmania; the organizations had not bjeen consulted upon a proposition of this kind. There were motions on the business-paper to which this scheme was a relevant amendment, but, in view of the representations of the delegates from the The resolutions read as foltwo StatesI have referred to, the Conference agreed' to a ballot heing taken of the members of the organizations. .

225,Mr Boyd,"Who says that?assistance of Prance."" This announcement, made public probably for the first time, has been said -to show that, there was a secret treaty. between Britain and Erance to war upon ' Germany for reasons of some secret and unworthy kind. To characterize such an understanding as an ordinary secret treaty -as a bargaining between nations -such as must lead to war-is not to fairly represent the position. It is exactly the same as if there was an arrangement between the TJnited States and Australia that in the event of a hostile fleet making an attack upon the coasts of Australia the disposition of the American Fleet to help Australia would be this,, that,and the other. From its very nature such an arrangement could not be made public, and it would be ridiculous to put it in the category of what are known as secret treaties. It is an arrangement between two Powers that if one is attacked there would be a certain disposition of the fighting forces of the other to defend their common and joint interests. ' If we had an arrangement with the TJnited States that in the event of an attack upon Australia by some Oriental nation there should be a certain disposition of our fighting forces, then, according to this line of argument, we should be expected to publish to the hostile nation, and to the whole world, what"" that disposition of our defending forces was to he. I , therefore, take this opportunity to put the other side of the question, so. that it may be read by Labour supporters in various districts. I consider what I was going to describe as the misrepresentation of the attitude of Sir Edward Grey and the British Government in regard to unconditional neutrality to be absolutely unjustified. That attitude does not in any shape or form vjtiate the honourable and unanswerable reason given to the world for Britain's entry into this world-wide conflict. member say that this misrepresentation came from a section of the Labour movement? Mr J. H . CATTS I said I had heard it used in some working class circles. member nothing better to do but to come here and attack his own party? Mr J. H . CATTS -If I think that my party is prejudiced by the misunderstanding or misrepresentation of certain persons, I have every right to avail myself of an opportunity to correct such mistaken views. The honourable member often makes statements' with, which I strongly disagree, but I recognise that he has, as I have, the right to his own opinion and to express it. There should be no separate consideration of the portion of the Labour policy being balloted for, apart from the other portion of the war and recruiting policy adopted as a whole. The Conference adopted an announcement of loyalty to the objects with which Britain entered this war, and I have to regret that there is any severance of these two parts of the united resolution carried at the Perth Conference. I come now to that part of the resolution which deals with the attitude of the movement towards recruiting. I ask honourable members to take particular note of the words, "" further participation in recruiting "" which are used in the resolution, because they have been thoroughly misunderstood in some quarters, and wholly misrepresented in others. It has been said that they mean that no individual member of the Labour movement would be allowed to enlist if the ballot were carried in the affirmative. Such a view is opposed' to the actual reading of the words employed. No such meaning can be read into them without a thorough misconception of the sentence. "" Participation in recruiting "" does not mean having to do with any person voluntarily offering himself for service; it has nothing to do with the enlistment of any individual. Chambers' English Dictionary, defines ""participator "" as "" one who partakes or shares in something with another."" "" Recruiting "" is defined in the same dictionary as meaning "" the obtaining of new supplies; the enlisting of recruits; the business of obtaining new supplies or enlisting new soldiers."" In other words, it means a joint sharing in the business of obtaining new supplies for the Army. It really has to do with the advocacy of a cause, and what the Perth Labour, Conference resolution actually declares by these words is that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the individual enlistment of persons in this country, whether they be Labour supporters or others. That is a matter for every man's judgment and",74,Labour Congress Perth 1918 Ference Shirked In Any Way Its Own Re

227,Mr Considine,"Has the honorableconscience. official participation or of the great Labour movement w it h the advocacy, the platform oratory, or other means adopted to persuade others to enlist. That is what the words mean, and they cannot bear the construction which some people are trying to read into them for the purpose, in some cases I think, of misrepresenting the actual position and prejudicing a f a i r interpretation of the whole "" W a r and Recruiting "" resolutions by the general public. The Conference declared that "" f u r t h e r participation in recruiting shall be subject to the following conditions."" It seems to be a crime in Australia for people to say that if they are going to participate in a scheme that participation shall ""be subject to conditions which they believe to be right. The participation, according to some people, should take place regardless of whether we t h in k ' it right or wrong. We must be guided by what others-ou r opponents-sa y is the right thing to do. We are to be compelled to participate in the advocacy of these things upon a basis which we may not think right Further participation in recruiting to be subject to a clear and authoritative statement -on behalf of the Allies. What is there wrong about that declaration? If there is confusion in the public mind, why should there not be a clear and authoritative statement on behalf of Great Britain and her Allies, so that we may know whether the objects of this war are to-day what they were at the outbreak of the war. pare with that of the British Labour movement, or of the American Labour movement? Mr J. H .

MrJ . H . CATTS -Ask the honourable member for Ballarat, who has come back from the Pront, and knows what is happening there. He is my authority for the statement.

Mr J. British history it has never been popular in war time to oppose a war or to criticise its conduct, although years afterwards the public has often altered its opinion. The Government, recognising that the public mind is confused,, and needs educating in regard to the war, appointed, almost as soon as tlie Perth Conference ceased to sit, a directorate of war propaganda, and set up a great department to educate the public, presumably concerning the objects of the war. So far, the only thing that has been done by the department is I o interfere in the conduct of this ballot; and I shall deal presently w i th some of the reasons given for that interference by the gentlemana University professor, I understand-in charge of the department. The Perth Conference asked for a clear and authoritative statement of the war aims of Great Britain and her Allies, and the Government has practically acknowledged the justice of the demand by setting up a great department to IssueM .

Yet these same persons complain that the Conference did lay down a policy. on the ballot-paper. H . CATTS -Throughou t MrJ . H . CATTS It did not.

He goes on to sayWhence this sudden enthusiasm for home defence on the part of those who clamour so insistently for repeal of .the Australian Defence Act? This propagandist of the Government might correct his information before he issues misleading statements of that kind. Does the Perth Conference ask for any repeal of the Defence Act? On the contrary, it insists on the maintenance of the Act. Yet this agent of the Government tells the Labour public, as a reason why they should vote against the resolution, that that movement is the same that advocates the wiping out of the Defence Act, and no defence for Australia. It is absolutely untrue. MrJ . H .

The leader of this movement is the Perth Inter-State Labour Conference, which, lays down the authoritative policy for the movement; and to that policy every member has to subscribe. of fact, the Conference declares that the DefenceA c t must stand, and that there must be Australian' defence. Further, the Director of Wa r Propaganda says"" I do most earnestly urge that to impose the. conditions of this ballot-paper upon Australia's further participation ih. the war is to both the Labour movement itself and the expose yourself to ""-so-and-so .
