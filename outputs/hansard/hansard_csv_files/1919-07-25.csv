10,Mr Corser,"Has the ActingA treceived and accepted the resignation of the Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffith, which is to date from 31st August next. No steps have yet been taken for the appointment of a successor, but I am sure the House will permit me to say that it will be learned with regret that His Honour is retiring from the high and dignified office whioh he has filled with such conspicuous advantage to the public and the Commonwealth since, the creation of the Court. Before accepting that office, he had a distinguished career both as a statesman and as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and had earned a wide reputation. pointment to the High Court .bench, he, with his colleagues of the Judiciary had cast upon him highly important duties associated with the interpretation of the Constitution, and the growth and development of the Commonwealth has been so rapid, that his work of recent years has been enormously increased. In the exercise of his functions, the Chief Justice has undoubtedly brought to bear upon every case heard by him the strictest impartiality, deep research, and profound learning, and a ripeness of judgment begot of great experience in many offices. As Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Samuel Griffith has upheld the highest traditions of the British Judiciary, and has preserved the noblest ideals of the administration of justice so well recognised throughout the British realm. His resignation will be received with deep regret everywhere in Australia, and the wish will go out from the people generally that the remainder of his life may be passed in peace and comfort. ney-General state whether the Government propose to follow the old practice of appointing as successor to the present Chief Justice a member of the Bar, or do they propose to give due consideration to the claims of present members of the High Court'bench? ment-the Government will take'.into consideration the qualifications of those whom they think to be best fitted to fill so high and responsible an office. f410]2 DAY SITTINGS OF PARLIAMENT . charge of the House aware of the extreme danger to which peaceful citizens who have to traverse the streets of Melbourne after dark are subject, and inview of that fact will the Government arrange for day sittings of Parliament so that honourable members may reach their homes before dark, and avoid the riskof being molested in the streets ? Failmg that will the Government take the necessary steps to provide honourable members with a suitable escort to insure their safety ? the conditions of the streets of Melbourne are as bad as the honourable member suggests. The only conclusion I can come to is that the honourable gentleman's beauty constitutes a source of risk to himself. ister-for Home and Territories state whether it is a fact that foreigners other than coloured persons are allowed to enter Australia without having to produce a passport, or any restriction being imposed ? ceptions, no person is allowed to land in Australia without a passport. The wives of returned soldiers, for instance, do not comewithin that rule, but, speaking; generally, not only aliens, but others;, are obliged to produce a passport before; being permitted to land.

37,Mr Glynn,"The position is nottaken by the Government up to the present to secure wire netting, for the reason that we could only buy in the open market exactly as any importer might do. The reason why supplies of netting are so scarce at the present time is that there is a falling market. one desires to operate in a large way on a falling market, since those who did so would find themselves landed eventually with stock bought at high prices which they would have to seli in competition with wire netting bought at low prices. The Government would be in exactly the same position if it purchased wire netting at the present time. able to eay, however, that within the next six weeks or so a very large plant will . be in operation in Australia which will be able in a very short time to draw sufficient wire to meet the whole of Australia's requirements in wire netting. Once the wire is drawn, the actual weaving of at into mesh is a comparatively easy matter. -NORTHERN TERRITORY . statement appearing in the press that it is proposed to introduce hares into the Northern Territory, I ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether this is for the purpose of increasing the food supply, or is it being done at the request of the pastoralists of the Territory? the intention to introduce hares into the Northern Territory recently.

I saw, some of the members of these parties, and they were all returned soldiers.

Further,-1 wish to say that the credit balance shown is the balance for 1918, and the Treasurer has that money.

It was also reported to me that some honourable members had been interfered with by military omcers on duty at the time, under the instruction, apparently, of officers placed specially in charge of the function on Saturday. prevent certain honourable members entering the building, even, in some cases, where they' showed their gold passes. I may point out that permission to use the steps of Parliament House for functions outside of those associated with Parliament itself, is given, always subject to the reservation that the rights of honourable members to free ingress to and egress from the building should be strictly respected. When complaint was made to me that members had been refused access to the building by military officials, I informed the officer in charge that such interference could not be permitted. Since honourable members informed me that interference with them had taken place I have written to the State Commandant, Brigadier-General Brand, bringing the matter under his notice, and expressing the hope that my intimation would be sufficient to prevent a recurrence of anything of the kind in the future. I may add that both the President of the Senate, and myself, have insisted on the observance of the condition regarding the rights and privileges of members in connection with previous functions for which we gave permission for the use of the parliamentary buildings. fore the Acting Prime Minister( Mr' endeavouring to arrange for such a ConferW a t t ) took ill I brought under the ment. notice of the House the case of patriotic societies, which it is sought to make liable KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A to the amusements tax, on the ground that the expenses of entertainments promoted by them exceeded 50 per cent, of the proceeds.

This deduction applies to all persons, whether married or single, who actually maintained children under sixteen' -years of age.

83,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [11.40],"The auditor in the case immediately before us has, as I say, practically defied the Commonwealth, and, apparently, the Government do not desire to apply any remedy. If all is honest and above board, there is no need for secrecy; but, unfortunately, our commercial life is not honest, and it is only by trickery and frau d and the manipulation of figures that many companies hide their true position. The Government are practically approving of the practice of allowing private accountants, rather than the Auditor-General, to deal with what is essentially a national matter. TheA u ditor-General should have f u l l and. complete power to audit all the Pools affected by this B ill , and that power will have to be given sooner or later, whether or not the Government are agreeable. with the honourable member for Franklin member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), that the proposed amendment is too narrow; it should be made to apply to all firms. W it h the approval of the mover ( Mr Higgs) I move That the following words be added to tlie proposed new sub-clause:"" The Auditor-General of the Commonwealth or his officers shall inspect, audit, and examine the books, vouchers, and documents of a ll persons, firms, or companies having contracts with the Central Wool Committee."" Any person who has read the last report of the Auditor-General will admit that that officer should have the power which the amendment seeks to give him. Last night the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond) said that the proposal for an audit by the Auditor-General would be all right if it applied to all firms having business with the Central Wool Committee. But the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and.Whiddon Brothers occupy a different position from that of any other firm, in asmuch as the Government have practically taken a partnership with them in the sale of wool tops. member was not correct in saying that the action of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) was preventing wool tops being made in Australia, and forcing the trade to Japan. The responsibility must be placed upon the Central Wool Committee and upon the Government, because of the action they have taken. Ab the present time the Government are suing the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, which is the successor of F . W . Hughes Limited, for the recovery of about £280,000. I have no quarrel with any manufacturers. A few years ago I visited the factory of F. W . Hughes Limited, and I agree that it would be to the advantage of the Commonwealth if we could convert all our wool into tops before exporting it . I had the privilege of supporting the first Bill to give a bounty for the manufacture of wool tops, and thus afford F . W . Hughes Limited and Whiddon Brothers a chance to establish their industries. amending Bills to extend the bounty and fix the labour conditions in the industry. But the question we are now dealing with is as to whether it is right that the Auditor-General should audit the accounts of these two firms which have made contracts with the Central Wool Committee. The Auditor-General and the then Treasurer (Lord Forrest) sought to get that power, but the Central Wool Committee insisted upon appointing their own auditor. When Lord Forrest said he was not satisfied and desired a further audit, the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee said that the report of their own auditor was final, and if the Treasurer desired further information he must apply to the companies. That is a humiliating position in which to place this Parliament. As partners in the business of wool top manufacture we are directly interested in all the transactions. I am informed t h a t Mr Allard, the auditor appointed by the Central Committee, is paid by the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and not by the Commonwealth. We should have an independent auditor, and nobody oould be more suitable than the AuditorThe honourable General, in whom honourable members have complete confidence.

It is a hopeless amendment, and is only put forward because, as certain suggestions have been made by individual members on this side of the chamber, the honourable member hopes to catch their votes, w i th a view to getting them to go the whole way with him. The Wool Committee made contracts w i th Whiddon BrothersLimited and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited. These contracts contained the provision : That all books, papers, and documents in the possession or under the control of the company and relating to the purchase, manufacture, or sale of the sheepskins or wool tops referred to shall be produced to an auditor nominated' by the Commonwealth Government for that purpose. It was also provided that it should, be the duty of the auditor to decide what amounts should be credited and debited, in order to ascertain the net earnings of the company, and his decision should be final and binding on both parties. auditor had power to disallow items. An independent audit was thus provided for. Agreement has been made with the Commonwealth with these two firms, and also with the Yarra Falls Company, and in each case there is provision for this in dependent audit. cept the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), as suggested to be amended by the honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr Tudor) ? would mean a violation of the contract made with these firms. An agreement has been entered into whereby a certain person has been appointed as auditor.

As a matter of fact, he is the accountant' of the Central Wool Committee, ' and that body has agreed to allow him to undertake the work. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) now asks us to set aside the agreement we have made with firms who have, on the strength of those agreements, accepted certain persons as their auditors.

A letter has now been received from the Auditor-General in which he stated he is prepared to formally appoint Mr George Mason Allard to act on his behalf in making audits. Mr Allard would also be required to certify to statements and prepare reports for the Auditor-General.

For some reason or other, certain honourable members want to tear up this agreement and put something in its place.

I would impress upon honourable members that this Wool Committee was constituted for the management of an enormous task. Every. one admits that it3 members have brought to bear very fine judgment, and have produced excellent results for the Commonwealth. All , or most of them, are business men who know their wprk, and the agreement is a proper The honourable business agreement that any one would be justified in making, and in providing for an independent audit in this way. I , therefore, ask honourable members to stand by the Bill as it is now, because it gives sufficient protection, and, above all things, to reject a comprehensive amendment which is evidently tabled in the ' hope of' catching somebody from this side; cannot understand why the Acting Leader of the Government has put so much vim into the endeavour to get the Committee to reject the amendment. His suggestion, that these gentlemen have shown their ability by electing their own auditors, reminds me of the Yankee who said he did not care what the electoral laws were so long as he was appointed presiding officer. 1 always understood ^ that the duties of the Auditor-General included the supervision of all transactions in which the Government were interested. If it is not so, previous Parliaments and Governments have made a great error. We all know that the gentleman who has been named is an estimable, citizen, and I have nothing to say against him as an individual. He is a keen business fellow, but he is also an earnest worker on behalf of the Liberal party, and never loses an opportunity to support those who are opposed to us in. politics. How can an outside auditor, appointed by these public companies to act for them, serve two masters? How can he serve the Government and the companies with whom he is in daily connection ? The Committee ought to be pleased with the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) for moving the amendment. If we had oryou did that, the dinary government, where vested interests did not so predominate, the Ministry would welcome the action of the Opposition in this matter, because it would give them the opportunity to see that the accounts were supervised in the interests of the general public.

118,Mr West [East Sydney] (12.19),"Icursory view, the ordinary citizen would be apt to conclude that there must be something behind the anxiety that has been shown to retain the present system of audit. W h y is the Minister so concerned ? He spoke longer on this clause than I have known any other Minister to take on any clause of a B ill going through Committee. all his legal talent and all the ability he possesses, if he has any, to prove to the Committee that the supervision of these accounts should not be handed over to the Auditor-General, who is the representative of the people of Australia, and, so f a r aa the accounts of the Public Departments are concerned, stands actually above Ministers. If the Auditor-General is not called in . what safeguard has Parliament got? I remember the time when the State Parliament had no Auditor General, but when the first Commonwealth Government was formed, one of 'its first acts was to appoint an Auditor General. That officer is necessary to watch the operations of these friendlv gentlemen who, the Minister says, are such keen business fellows. If I had transactions with the Government, I should like always to appoint my own auditor. I guarantee that he would be more favorable to me than to the other side. If he d i d not do the business just as I wanted it done, I would not keep him. these people, and the man in your papy performs the duties'you want him tx> perform. I am euro that when the time comes to go through the accounts of the various Boards that the Government have appointed, and that have been operating during the war period, two or three auditors-general will be required. So long as I am a member of this House, I shall always insist that no accounts involving any charge upon the Treasury of the Commonwealth be allowed to pass unless the Auditor-General is satisfied that they are correct. Otherwise, what is the good of having an Auditor-General? should supervise the accounts, not only of all Government Departments, but also of all public utilities in which the Government is interested. If the allegation is that the Auditor-General is incapable, and that these outside business gentlemen have greater abilities, why does not the Minister tell us so? Why should the in terests of outside people be conserved in stead of the interests of the people generally ? There must be something hidden, or why the anxiety displayed by the Government here this morning? To my mind there is something being covered He has employed up. It may be because the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) has been persistent in asking a number of ugly questions of the Government regarding a particular company. If that is the reason, why did not the Minister say so, and ask some other member to move for the appointment of the Auditor-General to supervise these accounts? The Minister should have the courage to tell U6 if that is the reason of his objection to the amendment. I do not believe the honourable member for Capricornia has any other motive than to conserve the in terests of the people of Australia. He is actuated by the best motives and intentions to secure the proper supervision of all accounts or expenditure in which the Government and the Commonwealth are concerned. There is a feeling in the public mind that we have not received a sufficient return for a great deal of the money that has been poured out during the war. It is our duty to satisfy the public that that is not the case, and we cannot do it better than by arranging for This auditor is the paid servant of the supervision of all accounts by the Auditor-General. The Acting Leader of the Government ( Mr Groom) has put some supposititious cases. I did not think that any Minister leading this National Parliament would sink to such a depth as the honourable gentleman sank to in making the comparisons he made this morning and suggesting the possibilities that would arise through the Auditor General going through these accounts. I am. only a humble representative of the people, and have never had the' experience of being a Minister of the Crown; He but I would never allow such a petty thought as the excuse put forward by the Minister to run through my mind. If the public generally could only learn of the struggle being waged in this House to persuade the Government to give the Auditor-General a free hand, we would have overwhelming sympathy behind our efforts. If the Government cannot be forced to accept the amendment, then honourable members on this side should -not be blamed if the people look upon the Federal Parliament as a decayed institution. The Auditor-General is one of the most important officers in the Public Service. In the matter of finance; and generally having to do w i th the expenditure of national money, there is no one in the land above that oflicial. No t one penny of the public's money should be expended unti l and unless the Auditor-General is satisfied that the people w ill get f u l l value for the outlay. It is a mystery to me why the Government should not accept the amendment. whether Mr Allard may or may not have done his duty satisfactorily is altogether beside the mark. That individual, no doubt, is a friend of the vested interests; and I am bound to say that if I have a friend I make it my duty to t r y and keep him out of difficulties. Buti t is the Auditor-General who should be doing the work in his capacity as the f r i e nd of the surer expresses the opinion that it is the duty people. Before the appointment of an Auditor-Generali n New South Wales, they used to buy wooden spoons out of loan funds. When an oflicial was appointed to the Auditor-Generalship, he was able to bring to light quite a lot of those little dealings. Human nature has not altered since those days im Sydney, and the greatest safeguard which the public could possibly establish is that of proper supervision. The only way to keep our national accounts correct is to eliminate every opportunity for them to become incorrect. We have an Auditor General who is above reproach, and I plead with the Government to accept the proposal to give h i m the desired supervision. The honourable member who has just addressed the Committee. ( Mr West) holds that the amendment should be accepted because otherwise the Government would be accused of endeavouring to cover up some transactions which should be open to the light. The suggestion is that there is crooked work going on under the cover of these Pools. A t first sight one might be inclined to support the amendment, but I draw attention to two statements of the Auditor-General himself concerning this matter. The Auditor-General, having considered the business of the wool tops, made the following memorandum:From many points of view this business is in a most indefinite and unsatisfactory position. Under the agreement between the Wool Tops Companies and the Government, the audit of the business of the Wool Tops Companies is to be conducted by an auditor nominated by the Commonwealtli Grovernment. Mr Allard, of Sydney, was appointed by the C r a l Wool ent -Committee as the auditor, the nomination by the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee The question being made on behalf of the Commonwealth Government (see clause 16 of the agreement). Correspondence has taken place between the Auditor-General and the Treasury in regard to the business of the companies concerned. The Auditor-General states that an outside auditor, not acting under his authority in oases where Commonwealth moneys are in-' volved, is not approved by him. Under the agreements large sums will be payable to the Commonwealth, and the Treaof the Auditor-General to make the audits. Tlie Treasurer also suggested that Mr Allard might be appointed by the Auditor-General to act as his deputy There the Auditor-General complains that the authority to audit those accounts is being taken away from him'; and if that had been so I would have been prepared to vote against the Government upon the amendment. But let us examine another statement, as presented by Mr C. J . Cerutty, Assistant Secretary to the Department of the Treasury, on the manufacture of wool topsOn the 6th November last the late Treasurer addressed to the Prime Minister a letter dealing with the audit of accounts of the firms who are manufacturing wool tops. A letter has now been received from the Auditor-General, in which he states he is prepared to formally appoint Mr George Mason Allard to act on his behalf in making .audits. The Auditor-General himself. has approved of the very man to whom he objected earlier. He asks that that party shall be appointed. The auditor concerned is appointed, and then the A u d itor-General complains, and states that he is not being given a f a i r deal. The state-",32,Smith Th E Auditor Not Only The Books Vouchers And Docu
119,Mr Fleming (Robertson) [12.40],"ment from which I have just quoted proceedsMr Allard would also be required to certify to statements, and prepare reports for the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General considers that the alternative course, namely, for one of the Audit Office staff to make .inspections from time to time, would be inadvisable. The Treasurer concurs in the appointment of Mr Allard as suggested, if no objection is raised by the Central Wool Committee or by your Department. The Auditor-General, whether wittingly or not, has placed the Government and its supporters in an. absolutely false position; and members of the Opposition are trying to take advantage of it . .it? do not say that the Opposition are proposing anything which might be deemed at all doubtful; but the course adopted by honourable members opposite, if it be based upon the second report of the A u d itor-General, becomes a false one, for the simple reason that the procedure taken is that which the Auditor-General himself laid down as proper. adopted by members of the Opposition is uot honest, because one of its members, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), stated a few minutes ago that he would break any agreement. One would think that we were back again in pre-war days. If an agreement is made by the Commonwealth, whether it be to the benefit or the detriment of the Commonwealth, Parliament live I cannot understand how any man with morals of that sort is able to retain a seat in this House. Are we not. to be men of our word? Are we to calmly advocate the breaking of a contract or agreement solemnly entered into by the Government merely because it is believed to be operating in some way against them ? To advance such an argument is to reduce ourselves to the level of the H u n . men went overseas to fight the Germans .because of an agreement which tliey broke, and which they spoke of as "" a scrap of paper."" [4H ] that to do with the Wool Committee? position if the violation of agreements in this way is to be advocated. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has deliberately recommended that the Commonwealth should break an agreement into which it has entered. The whole position put here this morning is absolutely false. I rose simply to place these two statements by the Auditor-General in juxtaposition, so that the people mightbe able to see for themselves what methods are being adopted by the Opposition to destroy the Government. W h a t have we to gain by fail to understand why the Government should object to power being given to the Auditor-General to investigate all these matters. If , as the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom) has said, everything is clear and above-board, why should there be any objection to this amendment? Everything, probably, is quite all right. I do not for one moment cast any doubt upon the Acting Attorney-General's statement that the position in this connection is quite satisThe attitude factory, but the A u d it Act provides that the Auditor-General shall investigate andv report upon all transactions and account* of the Commonwealth Government.

Such a position cannot stand. The Acting Attorney General has attempted tb justify his opposition to our proposal by pointing, out that Mr Allard has been selected by the parties concerned to audit the accounts. I do not think that the honourable gentleman informed the Committee that Mr. Allard's fees are being paid by the particular companies interested in this contract, Our and ""that the Government have no control over him.

Thus the intentions of the Act are set out clearly; and why should those intentions be put on one side ? As to the position of the Auditor-General, section 5 of the Act says(1) The Auditor-General shall not, during his continuance in such office, be capable of being a member of the Executive Council of the Commonwealth, or of any State thereof, or of either House of the Parliament of the' Commonwealth, or of any State thereof.

There is a splendid in my own interests, I should see that no one but myself paid him for his services. The speech of the Ministeri n charge of the B ill ( Mr Groom) was a hide-it, coverit-up, camouflage speech; and I use those terms in their strongest sense. When I asked the honourable gentleman who paid the auditor, he was conveniently deaf; but I say that he would not dare face an election, either here or in Sydney, on the question of who should.be trusted in such a matter-a n outside auditor paid by an outside body, or. our Auditor-General, Mr Israel. If the Auditor-General is not to be more depended on than an outside man, any member who thinks so should take steps to have him removed -from his position; but I do not think any one in the House would dare to impugn Mr Israel or his Department. The Acting Attorney-General would not dare to fight an election in Melbourne or Sydney when advocating that a private accountant and h o t the Auditor-General should have the supervision of transactions in which Commonwealth money was involved. The people know that there is so much bribery, corruption, and f r a u d existing at the present time that the M in ister, even with the aid of a powerful press, would be in a hopeless position. Every person who has experienced that the purchasing power of the sovereign has decreased during the last few years to 12s. 6d., knows the truth of what I have stated. allow these transactions to be controlled by our duly appointed officer, who is independent of the Government; and, while he is in the right, independent of even this Parliament. No one knows better than the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) that the criminal records of Victoria, following tlie bursting of the land boom, are f u l l of fraudulent balance sheets that had not been properly audited. Most magnificent balance-sheets were pro-rduced, but they represented nothing but frau d and flam. One man failed for the sum of £1,500,000, and offered a composition of ^d. in the £ 1 , Which was never I agree paid. A member of the Victorian Parliament at that time, when speaking of a particular balance-sheet, said, "" Everycredit balance and fine dividends on paper, but where is the money?"" Paragraph 10 of the agreement made between the Commonwealth Government and Whiddon Brothers Limited, of Sydney, readsAll books, vouchers, and 'documents in thc possession or under the control of the company, and relating to the purchase, manufacture, and/or sale of the sheepskins, wool and wool tops referred to in these presents shall be produced to an auditor nominated by the Commonwealth Government for that purpose D r .

The man who pays the piper has the righ t to call the tune, and if there is anything to hide it is well tp be the person who is paying the piper. That was proved in contestibly in the terrible land boom crash. Honourable members cannot gainsay that there is a widespread feeling among the people that they are being wronged. Let honourable members opposite go upon the platform and say that there is no profiteering. W h y w ill not the Government orable members on the Government side have not said so, but some have asked, ""Where are the profiteers?"" If the Government recognise that there is profiteering, why are they not fighting the evil as it is being fought in other countries? Do they wish to force the people into revolt?

Before the Royal Commission, in Sydney, Mr Darling said that the Georgeson agreement was made either hy a rogue or a fool. Afterwards, under cross-examination, he withdrew the word "" rogue "" ; but the fact remains that 6,000,000 bushels of wheat is said to have been lost, and much of it has been stolen. I cannot understand why any honourable member should vote in favour of having a public accountant to audit transactions in which Commonwealth funds are involved in preference to an audit by the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The Government have a great opportunity to do what is right. We have"" not yet touched the first penny of the last shilling that was promised by a former Government to win the war, but SO per cent, of the eligible fighting men were sent out of the country. What are we doing to safeguard the people's money ? Will any honourable member say that in respect of wheat, wool, or sugar all that should have been done has been done? Both parties in this House are to blame; but I shall never forget the breach of the pledge made by the Prime Minister( Mr high officials on the Wool Committee and Hughes), that the civil law would always be superior to the military law. Por one pin-pose only I would like to continue the War Precautions Act, namely, to control the prices of the people's food. our duty to safeguard the finances, and see that the .people are not robbed as they have been robbed too freely in the past.

After the muddle had been properly established the authorities hurriedly got together an army of accountants to get them out of it. I am yet to be convinced that the Central Wool Committee will not get into the same kind of muddle that has characterized the Wheat Board, particularly in New South Wales. I shall quote two instances proving how necessary it is to utilize the services of the Auditor-General to* enable this Parliament to know how the Central Wool Committee and the State Wool Committees are operating. Every honourable member has received from John Bridge and Company a pamphlet referring to ,an arrangement which was entered into between that firm and the Central Wool Committee, by which tlie firm was to put up a dumping plant for double-dumping wool bales.

I am surprised that when such an -important discussion is taking place those who know quite a number of the facts in connection with the operations of the CentralW o o l Committee are absolutely dumb. I do not suggest that there is any sinister or ulterior motive in their silence, but it is remarkable that on previous occasions, on the slightest, provocation, the honoraible member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has sprung to his feet to defend the Wool Committee from A to Z . During this protracted discussion of some of the most important aspects of the operations of the Committee he has remained absolutely silent, but for a few exceptionally irrelevant interjections, As the firm was made with a view to throwing off bhe track those who are trying to elicit the facts.

229,Mr Fenton,"The Acting Attorney tion. Matters have taken place in conterms exactly what a company director and a company auditor must and must not do. It is a difficult matter under the Victorian companies law for even an erring officer, where he is so inclined, to err. Many things are possible if a company is being carried on under a loose company law. Speeches from both sides of this chamber show that there is an air of suspicion abroad. pate it better than by providing that in all future contracts the Auditor-General shall have supervision over those conducting these concerns, and we should go further and apply the same principle to existing contracts and operations.' The Auditor General has to take an oath to the following effect, upon his assumption of office: I do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that according to the best of my skill and ability I will faithfully impartially and truly execute the office and perform the duties of Auditor-General (or as the case may be) according to law. In section 71 of the A u d it Act it is enacted thatThe Governor General may make regulations (not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act) for carrying out the provisions of this Act, and in particular for(a) the collection, receipt, custody, issue, be permitted to scrutinize the books and expenditure due, accounting for, cave' accounts, and to ascertain whether the and management of all public moneys, and the guidance of all persons concerned therein; (6) the more effectual record, examination, inspection, and audit of all receipts and expenditure, and the keeping of all necessary books and accounts. TheA u d it Act itself proclaims to the Government what are their duties in connection with the Wool Pool. The Auditor General is a greater custodian of the finances of the country bhan the Eederal Treasurer. He is the policeman, or the . detective, who must scrutinize all expenditure, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. He has the power to arraign the highest in the land if anything of a crooked nature in connection with the finances of the country should be disclosed. But here we are dealing with millions, and yet that official is not to be permitted supervision over the accounts. I know that there will be a spirit of amazement among the people when it is learned that such a reasonable and righteous reMr jFenton. quest as is contained in the amendment has been declined by the Government and their supporters. The Government themselves, for self-protection, should see that operations are conducted in an absolutely honest and straightforward manner. They should give to the Auditor-General power to scrutinize all such matters. Honourable members have just received a We cannot dissireturn having to do with tlie approximate receipts and expenditure of the Commonwealth for the financial year just closed. Why is the item of sugar included in a public balance-sheet such as that? Are the receipts from the Wool Pool, and the other pools, lost in those big amounts which total, for the year 1917-18, more than a million of money, under the head of Miscellaneous, and, for the' past year, a sum of £863,000? There is an amount in relation to the two companies which was to come to the Commonwealth Government totalling £250,000 sterling. I know that litigation is in progress with respect to some of the items comprised within that total. I shall not proceed further in that direction, therefore. Surely the Auditor-General should have something to say as to how that money has been made. A t any rate, he should Commonwealth has been getting a f a i r deal. If it were only the matter of a lOs -note, the Auditor' should have power to discover whether the money was going rightly or wrongly into the public or int o a private purse If he were to discover anything wrong, even in relation to such a small amount as that, there would be ample justification for his inspection of the interests involved. Looking at the matter from a political point of view, a decidedly retrograde step has been made by the refusal of the. Government to accept the amendment. Honourable members on this side are championing public financial morality. I do not intend to lay charges, but honourable members may go into wool houses in Melbourne and hear what business men have to say regarding the operations of the Wool Committee and its unjust methods and dealings. They will be told sufficient for them to demand the appointment of a Royal Commission in order to show exactly what the true position is. During the week I have heen in the company of men who know as much as, if not more thanj either the honourable member for Hume( Mr Falkiner), or the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), 'about the wool business, and those men are emphatic in condemnation of' some of tlie operations of the Pool. That being so, is it not as well to try and allay such suspicions, and to allow the Auditor General to get at the books of the companies involved ? The Minister cannot deny that if a Royal Commission were sitting to-day, and the Auditor-General were asked whether he sbould have access to those books, he would respond in an emphatic affirmative. If our request that the supervision of the Auditor General be granted means the breaking of an agreement-as has been allegedthen that agreement must be a very rotten affair. their own Auditor-General? Honourable members opposite stated yesterday that the Auditor-General was one of the finest public servants ' in the Commonwealth. Y e t there is Ministerial opposition to giving an officer of such superlative qualities his proper rights of supervision. . It is quite likely that, at some later stage, Parliament will be asked, not only to amend the present B ill , but to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the operations of all the Pools. I realize today, however, that the Ministerial whip has been cracked. Honourable members opposite must pooket their own views, and. their principles too-if they have themand must vote in a direction contrary to their beliefs. They have come to heel upon' a question which should be free from party bias or politics. statement of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) does not satisfy me-no t because it goes too .far, but for the reason that it does not go far enough. It is not sufficiently comprehensive to meet the position indicated by several honourable members opposite. While two specific firms have been singled out, there [413] are, no doubt, many other activities in which the Government are interested to a greater or less degree as a partner, and which should be subject to inspection and investigation. There is no question that the Government is committed to these agreements. If an amendment of the nature put forward by the honourable member for Capricornia were carried, it would undoubtedly be equivalent to a vote of no-confidence in the Government. 1 am not prepared to see the Government resign upon a minor issue. I want to see something larger before Parliament expresses an opinion of so serious a nature. If the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) will' introduce a comprehensive proposal intimating that this House desires 'an investigation of all concerns in which the Government and Parliament are interested, I will' give it my hearty support. W h y are they fighting General has power over all the other transactions and operations of companies, except in regard to these two companies. ther his power goes as far as that suggested by the honourable member's amendment. , It certainly would be advisable to put the position beyond question by definitely indicating the duty of the AuditorGenerali n regard to all these concerns. It is not sufficient to leave to his discretion the extent to which his investigations shall go. He should receive from this Parliament a precise direction, and I would certainly be glad to support a provision to that effect. ment would put such a proposal at the bottom of the business-paper. taining the opinion of the House are open to the honourable member, and I , again pledge myself to support him if he adopts any of those methods. There is no question as to the necessity for a careful supervision and investigation of many of these business interests into which the Government have entered.

239,"Best, Sir Robert Mr Groom (Darling Downs","Minisadvantage of ihe motion to direct the attention, of the Minister leading the House to a matter of urgent public importance. I raise the question now with a view to obtaining information from the honourable gentleman on the subject when the House meets on Wednesday next. It is known to every one that, owing to the present industrial dispute, a great number of people are out of employment, particularly in the metropolitan area of this State. Several deputations have waited upon bhe Acting Prime Minister( Mr grants for relief by the Commonwealth Watt) in connection with the matter. I was present with more than one of those deputations, and as a result of their representations the honourable gentleman granted the sum of £1,000 for the relief of distress in Melbourne. The Victorian Government granted a similar amount. When the matter was referred to, a fortnight or three weeks ago, the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond), similar assistance would be given in the other States. I ask tbe Government to see that the assistance given for the relief of distress in the metropolitan area of this State shall be the same as that given in New South Wales. I can assure honourable members that the distress here is acute, because I happen to live in a district in which there are a great number of unemployed at the present time, and have come directly in contact with some of the relief work. Whilst a grant of £1,000 was made by the Federal Government, and a grant of a similar amount by the State Government in Victoria, in New South Wales £5,000 was granted by the Federal Government and £5,000 by the New South Wales Gwernment, although I am glad to say that the distress has not been so great in New South Wales as, unfortunately, it ia in this State. The factories in New Sonth Wales are nearer to the coal supplies, and therefore can be kept, going more easily than can the factories here. I ask the Minister leading the House to see whether it is not possible for additional assistance to be given tb the Trades Hall Belief Committee in Melbourne, who have' been distributing relief granted here. There is one thing noticeable in connection with the distribution of relief by benevolent societies, [413]2 and it is that people wbo go to such societies for relief make a habit of going to them Robert Hunter has made-that statement in his book Poverty, and I am able to confirm it by personal experience, as my wife has been associated with the Ladies' Benevolent Society of the eity of Richmond for the past twelve or fifteen years, and it is the experience of that society that, once people come to them for assistance, they continue to do so, and are very reluctant to cease. It is possible that if the local distribution of and State Governments is adopted it may have the effect of sapping the independence of people who go to the relief committees for assistance, inasmuch as they may be led to believe that they will be entitled to such charitable relief at all times. It will be admitted that if that were the effect it would not be to the advantage of the community. Perhaps the Minister will see if it is correct that the FederalI think, . asked whether' Government has granted £5,000 for the relief of distress in Sydney, where,, apparently, the distress is not so great as in Melbourne, and only £1,000 for the relief of distress here. I believe that there has not been a single word in criticism of the fairness of the distribution of bhe grant for relief by the Melbourne Trades Hall Relief Committee. Any one .who has had anything to do with relief work must be aware that, no matter by whom relief ia distributed, there will be found people who will try to impose upon those in charge of it ; but I do not think that there will be a greater percentage of such cases coming before the Trades Hall Relief Committee than before the local committees. I hope that the Government will look into the matter with a view of seeing whether the relief of persons in distress may not be more fairly adjusted than it appears to be at the present time. After listening to the appeal mode by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), one is tempted to ask the Minister now leading the Government in. this House what they are doing to provide for the relief of distress in each of the States of the Commonwealth.
