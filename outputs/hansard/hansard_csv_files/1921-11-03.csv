As imports are recorded only according to official statistical headings, it is not possible, in the absence of more definite particulars regarding quality and quantity of particular classes of iron and steel -imported, to make a satisfactory comparison between prices charged for iron and steel imported from Belgium and those charged for local products. For the information of the honourable member, however, I have had a statement prepared showing quantity and value, according to Statistical Classification, of iron and steel imported from Belgium, or of Belgian origin, during the financial years 1918-1919, '19191920, 1920-1921, and the first three months of the present financial year.

40,Mr Fowler,"It is the opinion ofJapan are being gradually brought within measurable distance of war, largely through a purely imaginary state of affairs. There lis no doubt whatever that Australia, the British Empire, and America have every right to regard Japan as an 'ally, whose assistance was of inestimable advantage at a very critical juncture. I wish to quote the opinion of a writer in a public journal in regard to what the Allies owe to Japan in connection with the war. He points outIf Japan had been against us we should have lost the war; not a soldier could have come to America. So far as we can accept the us from Australasia, India, South Africa, or Canada-the y would have been needed at Home. And what of America.? Even with. Japan merely neutral and doubtful, Americawould not have dared to move her army and navy. In view of that correct statement o£ the position, I say that it is in. the highest degree regrettable that there are persons in this country, as well as in the United States of America, who persist in creating a largely imaginary Japanese scare with regard to the intentions and objects of that country. sort of thing now? that the honourable member has sufficient intelligence to perceive it. I do not wish for one moment to pose as the apologist of Japan; I wish to make that perfectly clear. Japan has done things that are open to grave objection, but sho is in a very difficult position at present. For many years she was patted on the shoulder as a very promising youngsterpatronized and applauded by all the white races of the world. It was only when she began to take a leaf out of the book of the occidental nations in the matter of the acquisition of territory that the trouble began. It was all right for Britain and other countries to acquire territory, but it was wrong for Japan; and to-day she is in the position of having hardly a friend im the world because of actions of hers, the equivalent of which can be quoted in the history of nearlyevery other civilized nation on the face of the earth. Japan is in a very difficult situation. She has a population which is increasing at the rate of nearly three-quarters of a million a year, with no space for 'them in their, own. country: Naturally, Japan desires territory where her people can make a living for themselves,, while remaining citizens Of the Japanese empire. She has looked, in places in her own immediate vicinity, and she finds what she requiresin countries like Korea, Manchuria, Eastern Siberia, and. Mongolia. But;.because she has taken, action in those countries, it is assumed that she is desperately desirous of acting, still further afield and sending her people into Australia, and the United States of utterances of Japanese statesmen, they do not desire the Japanese people to enter either of those countries}, but would rather keep them nearer,at home. There is at present an. agreement in operation, between the United States of. America, and Japan, which rigidly excludes the Japanese-r-an agreement entered into with the hearty consent and co-operation of the Japanese Government. There are, no doubt, many Japanese in the United States of America, particularly on the Pacific coast, but those Japanese came there with the hearty good-will and approval of the American people themselves. They were I am not; and I hope not only welcomed, but invited to come. Why? Because labour was required on the Pacific slope by the fruit and vegetable growers, who were very glad to see this Japanese immigration. I eould, if necessary quote numerous instances, which I have here, in support of my statement that the Japanese immigration was originally welcomed by the United States of America, but the fact is well'enough known to make the quotation of authorities quite unnecessary. comed in North Queensland, too. These labourers who went to America, being of a thrifty and industrious disposition, and in receipt of good wages, acquired money,, and,, naturally, looked, for opportunities tobetter themselves.

I have here volume XCIII . of the Annals of the American Academy of Politica l and Social Sciencef or January, 1921. This is an eminent magazine which publishes articles under the names of many brilliant authorities. In an article by Robert Newton Lynch, Vice-President and Manager of the .San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, the writer saysThe first instalment of Japanese immigration was rather welcomed in California. . . The history of Japanese immigration was marked, first, by a favorable attitude, due to the .prestige of their country, and the possession of the very favorable qualities which later were so strongly urged against them. Undoubtedly that was so. prevent the American people from reviewing their attitude. recognise the necessity for reviewing the position, ibut I point out that the authority or who wa's lecturing in the .Senate Club been any serious violation of the agreement. room last night put down the Japanese immigration troubles to the failure of the He speaks in another part of his article Japanese people to observe a ""gentleof the ""excited fablemongers"" who have men's agreement."" saysProfessor Hertsman told the story of the ""gentlemen's agreement,"" under which certain ber of Japanese people in the United restrictions on Japanese immigration into America were mutually recognised, but he asStates was 125,000. serted that the agreement was "" a subterfuge extract from an article written by Payand a fraud."" Everybody knew that to be the son. J . Treat, in the Atlantic Monthly, case, he said.

I have evidence, fro m reputable American authorities to snow that "" the gentlemen's agreement"" has been an effective one. In America's Foreign Relations, by W ill is Fletcher Johnson, Honorary Professor of the History of I am assuming the American Foreign Relations in NewY o r k University, author of a number of publications, saysMeantime our Secretary of State, Hoot, entered into negotiations with the Japanese Government for a modification of treaty relations which would restrict the immigration of coolies. Japan cordially responded, being herself strongly desirous of stopping such migration, since she felt the need of all her working men at home, for the development of her new estates in Formosa and Korea. He goes on to speak of "" a sinister, sordid, and insincere campaign "" waged by certain people in the United States of America against the Japanese, which I have already indicated as having brought the two countries within measurable distance of war. In the Annals of the American Academy of Politica l and Social ScienceI find another reference to the "" gentlemen's agreement."" Speaking of a somewhat sensational report sent in by the Governor of California on the subject of Japanese population, SidneyL . Gulick, D . D ., secretary of the Nationa l Committee for Constructive Immigration Legislation, NewY o r k City, saysA careful study of the facts, therefore, does not seem to substantiate the Governor's view, the implication of the report that there has The Age Teport been doing their best to create ill-feeling in America against the Japanese.

The lecturer last night also told us that the Japanese people own "" large tracts of the most valuable agricultural and garden land on the Pacific Coast."" I can supply the House with a little official information regarding their ownership of land. think that we knew nothing about these matters. come over to educate us upon them. The report emanating from the State Board of Control, California, saysThe report gives statistics of land owned and will recognise that I have spoken with leased by Japanese in each county in California, and also the total acreage of irrigated land. It shows that Japanese own 74,769 aeres; this is six-tenths of 1 per cent. (.006) of the total amount of cultivated land (11,389,894 acres). ""Farm lands,"" still ""unimproved,"" remain to the extent of 16,541,550 acres. The lecturer would have every one believe that the Japanese own large tracts of the most valuable country and garden land on the Pacific coast, whereas they hold not more than six-tenths of 1 per cent, of the total cultivated land of California, that is to say, they do not own more than 74,769 acres out of the total area of 11,389,894 acres. I wish to show that of land? in one tract, but the sensational statement made by the lecturer last night was intended to convey the impression that California was rapidly becoming possessed by the Japanese, whereas the figures show conclusively that they are not the active menace which I am telling him the lecturer made out they were to the people on the Pacific coast. I do not wish to labour the'-matter or follow the lecturer through the whole of his lecture.

I hope that this will be the last occasion upon which we shall have international relations discussed within the precints of Parliament in the manner in which, according to the Age report, this gentleman from America referred to them last night. am compelled to make some explanation in regard to the statements made by the honourable member for Perth( Mr. Fowler), because the accuracy of the Age's report of last night's lecture has been challenged by some honourable members. This morning the honourable member for Perth asked me whether the lecturer had been correctly reported, particularly in regard to the following passage: Professor Hertsman told the story of the ""gentleman's agreement,"" under which certain restrictions on Japanese immigration into America were mutually recognised, but he asserted that the agreement was "" a subterfuge and a fraud."" I told the honourable member, and I still maintain, that, to the best of my recollection, those were the words used by the lecturer. Other honourable members w ill , I think, agree with me. I appreciated the lecture very much. spoke ably and vigorously, and gave us a good deal of information.

H is remarks concerning Japan and the colour question might bear the significance given to them by the honourable member for Perth, but I was pleased to hear him dissipate at) least one fear we have had placed before us time and again in this Chamber, namely, that it is absolutely necessary for Australia to spend money in providing a Navy for Defence purposes in the Pacific, on the supposition that the teeming 'hordes of -Japan -can find Toom for expansion in no otfher spot but Australia. Minister's strong suit. it was refreshing to hear the lecturer state that Japan had sufficient scope in Eastern Siberia, Korea, and Manchuria for the whole of its surplus population, and, in fact, had a greater area in which to absorb their surplus than the whole of the United States of America. that they have been refused permission to remain in Siberia? the lecturer. ""resolved in all probability at the forthcoming Conference at Washington. learn that Japan has sufficient latitude for expansion in the countries I have mentioned. I am thankful for it . time and again that the Japanese scare, so far as Australia is concerned, is largely fake. to debate the subject at this stage, but my. feelings are somewhat in line with those of the honourable member. Now that the war is over, instead of creating ill feeling between nations by criticising one another, we ought to be exercising every care to do our utmost to create mutual feelings of respect between nations with a view to preventing future wars. I agree with what the lecturer said last night at the conclusion of his The lecturer remarks. Every public man should guard against saying anything offensive to another nation, and should do his best to build up feelings of mutual confidence 1 < and harmony between the nations so that we may be able to bring about, if not disarmament, at least a limitation of armaments. The lecturer last night did not go as far as I would like to go, but he made it quite clear that, although he did not think there was the slightest hope for disarmament, he agreed with the declaration of the President of the United States for a limitation of armaments. I contend that if we add our plea, not only for the limitation of armaments, but also for disarmament, we shall be working along proper lines, because even if we do not now achieve our definite object, we may prevent anything from being done to aggravate those feelings between nations 'which bring about is the Prime war. armaments for police purposes. that we should not have what is necessary for internal affairs.",25,Auglo Japanese Say So

If the leading public men of every nation would endeavour, as far as possible, to prevent war by bringing about disarmament, or, at all events, the limitation of armaments, they would do good service to humanity. That, I am sure, is the desire of the people of every nation, quite saying anything likely to offend other irrespective of colour. Much is made of the difference in colour, but that, after all, might be termed a mere accident of birth. There can be no division of opinion as to the desirableness of creating a good feeling as between the nations and endeavouring in every way possible to prevent the possibility of war in the future. Although the object of Professor Hertsman is to bring about a better feeling between the United States of America and Great Britain, it would appear that the time at his disposal last night was so short that his lecture gave rise to nothing brought into America in chains. but dissatisfaction on the part of at least one honourable member of this Parliament. I refer to the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler). MrM IRKS,-Who was not present. to think that if he had been present he would have taken exception to the lecturer's view, which appears to be that Japan, Great Britain, and the United States of America should enter into an agreement to police the world. It is impossible for those countries, in my opinion, to ignore the nations of the mainland of Europe, including France, Germany, Austria, and Russia. the lecturer that the agreement should retion might produce a black child. I relate only to policing the seas, and not the land? so, in any contemplated alliance for such a purpose the nations of ithe mainland 'of Europe, which I have mentioned, and, indeejl, our own birthplace, could not be ignored. I take no exception to the action of the honourable member for Perth in bringing forward this question, although'I should have been pleased if we had had more notice of his intention to do so. I can conceive of no more important subject for diseussion than that of our foreign relations; and if the Tariff were out of the way I should he glad if a day or two were at once devoted to its consideration. I doubt whether it will be possible, either for us or future generations, to adopt the suggestion of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), that we should refrain from nations. The question whether or not it is possible for the people of the East, and West to intermarry without loss of moral and intellectual strength is of such great importance that, at no distant date, I am inclined to think we shall have to candidly, discuss it. night that he wanted the Japanese cards to be thrown on the table. also that there were in the United States of America at the present time 15,000,000 negroes.

America to-day is suffering because the iniquities of the fathers are visited on the children unto the third and fourth generation.

There -may come , such a war; it depends upon our attitude. I suppose that if we had the courage to follow the command, "" Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature""-and act up to it-w e might avert the prophesied Armageddon; but if white capitalists will insist, as they are doing at the present time, in taking their capital into China and other Asiatic countries and exploiting the cheap labour there, with the object of cutting the ground from under the feet of their own fellow white peoples, no one can say what may happen in the future. I regard the ( East-West question as of the very gravest importance. It is one that we might discuss at any time with more profit than some of the matters, not even excluding the price of wheat, that come before this House. To get back to the point raised by the honourable member for Perth( Mr there is good reason to believe that even Eowler) as to the use of the parliamentary buildings for lecturing purposes, I would remind honourable members that the lecture delivered by Sir Ross Smith in the Queen's Hall some time ago was attended by a very large number of parliamentarians, pressmen, and others, and proved highly interesting. sees a better attendance of members at a lecture in the Queen's Hall, on the sugar industry, the banana industry, the Murray water conservation scheme, or similar subjects, than we sometimes have in the Parliament itself, where, according to Sir Hilaire Belloc, no one listens to any one else. Belloc complained that in the House of 'Commons on one occasion there was only one member who appeared to he listening to' the speaker, and that he discovered subsequently that this member was watching him intently only because he desired to catch Mr Speaker's eye as soon as he sat down. I see no harm in allowing the use of the Queen's Hall for a leqture on the sugar industry, cotton cultivation in would appear that there is no advantage to be gained in allowing the use of the parliamentary building for lectures on> controversial subjects. Such lectures would do no good, and it would be better for the professors and others who wish to deliver them to get a hall in the city. As for the musical entertainment that has been spoken of, I hope that you, Mr Speaker, and the President will reconsider your decision to give permission for it. If it is held, members of Parliament will be misrepresented in regard to it ; and we have enough adverse critics already, without adding to their number by giving opportunity^for the suggestion that we devote to musical entertainments time that should be given to our legislative duties.. am very much interested in the matter brought forward for discussion by the ler). Although my point of view does not coincide in all particulars with his, I agree with a good deal of what he has said I am not one of those who think that we should abstain from discussing international matters lest we might give offence to some foreign power, because should we hurt the feelings of the governing body of a particular nation, we might at the same time be giving expression to views strongly held by a not inconsiderable minority in its country. With regard to the lecture that was given in this building last evening, I must say that I One often am reluctant to place limitations on the right of any person to give expression to his-views on any public question in any place where he can find an audience. public place. ment, like all general statements, is subject to exceptions and limitations.

93,Mr Brennan,"That general stateused for much saner and more useful propaganda than that to which expression was given by the gentleman who is now being unduly advertised. It does not follow that because a person comes here and recites a part with tremendous self-assurance, the estimate which he puts upon his own importance is the considered valuation either of the country from which he comes, or of that by virtue of whose hospitality he speaks. PerhapsI should have said at the outset that I was not present at the lecture. I can only express regret that circumstances prevented me from being present. absence was not owing to any special prejudice against the lecturer, or to the fact that he was using the Senate club-room for its deliverance; it was due to quite other causes. But having had the advantage of discussing the lecture with members who were present, and whose word I am prepared to accept without qualification-and notwithstanding that I have read the newspaper reportsI claim to have a fairly accurate knowledge of what was said last evening by gentleman who lectured. ' I think that the phrase, "" Spread Eagleism,"" is, if I may quote the lecturer, "" 100 per cent. A m e r i c a n "" ; I am not so sure that the term "" bounder"" is of American origin; I think it is merely good English. But , again, to use a phrase of the lecturer, while I make no charges, I venture to remark that I have been considering the connotation of both terms since I have heard of the subject-matter of the lecture, and the manner in which it was treated last evening. very great admiration for the American people for many reasons, into which it is not now necessary to go: an admiration which is inspired' by some knowledge of their history, their beginnings, and their present status among the world's nations. I should be very sorry to think that the present phase of what is called Chatauqua. is in any real sense typical of true Americanism. The truth is that there is a certain kind of transported British reactionary who is more offensive to the spirit of Democracy in the country of his adoption than he was in the country of his origin; and there he was fairly offensive. The lecturer spoke of Japan as a blight. Every one knows that I belong to a party which stands for the ideal of a White Australia. all. to know, too, that I do not stand for gratuitous offensiveness to the peoples of other nations. I do not stand for the invitation by the guardians of this Parliament to a person to speak within this building and under our auspices in a spirit of blatant offensiveness towards an allied people. It appears that he i m ported into his speech a blasphemous coupling of the name of the Saviour with a policy of licensed outrage upon the My negroes of America. I take leave to say from my place in this chamber that I do not stand for that. The American people brought the negroes to their country in chains, and now,"" as an honourable member has said, by interjection, they burn them in kerosene oil. L i k e other ziations, they are reaping the f r u it of the tree that they planted. The lecturer stands for the limitation of armaments. I have heard the phrase, as we all have heard it, very frequently of late. There are two classes using it, particularly in connection with the more or less distinguished the Conference that is to sit in Washington. They are those who stand for the cessation of war and the. abolition of armaments, and those who stand for a continuance of bloody commercial wars. Those who stand for the destruction of armaments and an end of war do not advocate anything other than that,, while those who stand for the retention of the conditions of bloody wars advocate nothing more than the "" limitation of armaments."" That is the apparently harmless phrase-to some _ a hopeful I have a phrase, but to me an utterly hopeless one-in which they cloud their real meaning, their real international belief. It is a phrase which has been used in this chamber, and not infrequently by the Leader of the House. I rise only to let the public, know, and to let my constituents know, that the text of this lecture having been brought under my notice, we humble members of the Federal Parliament of Australia claim .to be at least partly aware, from independent sources, of what is proceeding on the other side of the world, in America, in Japan, and among the older nations. We take the trouble to inform ourselves a little on these matters. We do not close our minds to them, nor do we close our doors to visitors or their propaganda.

95,,"Mr BRENNAN I would like peoplevisitors to come here for the interchange of views, to ascertain honestly how far their views harmonize with ours, and to what extent they disagree. But we are tinder no illusions as to what the real America is, nor as to the class of persons for whom the representative of Chatauqua spoke in the Senate club-room last night. [3.35] I am somewhat surprised at the storm in the tea cup which has been raised over the address given last night by a gentleman from the United States of America. I heard what he' said, and failed to see in his remarks any antagonism, to the Japanese more than has always been displayed. I failed to discern anything in the lecture except a realization that. the desire to get the cheap labour of the black man has failed because of what it brings in its trail. However, the lecturer last night did not deal particularly with what might befall the peaceful capture of America by the Japanese, nor with the negro question. WhatI read into his address was a desire in GreatB r it a in and the United States to hold on tenaciously to the present economic system. One utterance alone revealed to me what he meant. He said that we were only talking about the limitation of armaments-that we could not talk about their abolition-for the reason that in Soviet Russia there were millions of trained men all waiting to be let loose on the other nations. That was the real tenor of his address last night. Japanese need have no fear of such, men as the lecturer, but the workers of the ^ world may have need for fear, because he is one of those men who are advocating broadcast the interests of the present system. talk is cheap! We on this side can pit good men against such as the lecturer of last night. During, the lecture, I should have liked to make two interjections, but refrained., I may say that I would not be on© to prevent gentlemen of this sort,, if they are allowed, by the authorities to> do so, addressing, members of the House. We are not compelled to-go-and hear them^ and I can quite understand that if I were to get permission from the President of the Senate for an advocate of the Soviet system to deliver a lecture, horror would be expressed by honourable gentlemen opposite. would be allowed even a seat in the gallery. Personally, I would encourage the delivery of addresses such as we heard last night, but I hope that all sides wil l be heard. such visitors were allowed in here, and we could have a "" go "" on fair terms. only for representatives of the people. I am going to apply to the President for permission for a gentleman called Kiminoff to address members of the House on Soviet Russia, and I shall be surprised and disappointed if he is not allowed to do so. ShouldI get permission for such a. lecture, I shall be annoyed if honourable members opposite) do not attend as largely as they did last night, to hear a true exposition of Soviet Russia without disfigurement by any of the lies which appear in the press. I hope that you, Mr Speaker, wil l assist us in having further entertainments of, thel kind, but. I trust that those who advocate the wiping out of our present economic system will be heard as well as others.

It is a, subject connected with the limitation of armaments, and one that we might debate for hours; indeed, in a few days' time, we shall be discussing whether there shall be a continuance or However, I have no. fear, for a limitation of the Australian Navy. As regards the lecture of last night, only one member, so far, seems to hold a brief for the lecturer, and that is the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr. Mathews)-, who has just sat down.

He said that the people of the United States of America did not think that Japan was "" playing the game "" in sending Japanese to America, and that the time had arrived when President Harding desired Japan to lay all her cards on the table. Personfirmly of the 'belief that everything that ally, I was delighted to be .present at the is going to happen in the future of great lecture, which was most instructive from many aspects.

A few days ago I had a quiet chat with the Deputy Leader of the Dpposition ( Mr Charlton), and told him of some of my beliefs as to some of the happenings in the future. I ask honourable members to listen to me without interjecting, because I am not able to catch all in the robe of a tattered beggar and thief. that is said in that way. I am going to talk on a matter that may bring a smile to the faces of honourable members; but when I tell them that I am speaking on the authority of the Bible> their smiles may disappear. The honourable member for Capricornia asked if the Armageddon were going to come between East and West. The Bible would lead-me to say [494] "" No ."" Many things that I am going in the Bible, and if any would like to follow this matter up later, outside the chamber, I should-be delighted to give chapter and verse from that book, showing what has happened in the past and what is to happen in the future. I am importance is there for us to look at if we care to find it. The next war, which is the Armageddon, will happen in the year 1934. Three nations will attack the British Empire. Two of those nations I The am going to name now, the third I would rather not name. The two nations are Russia and Germany, who, combined with the other, will be at war with the British Empire in Palestine. The battlefield is mentioned in the Bible-the battle takes place at Jerusalem, and the part that the British Navy will play is distinctly mentioned. The cemetery, the time for collection of the dead, the time for the collection of the arms of war to be destroyed are all mentioned. The part that Australia plays is also mentioned. ""Australia,"" because that name was not known at the time, but certain names are mentioned so far as the British Empire is concerned. We read of "" the merchants of Tarshish and all the little lions."" The ""little lions"" are the British Empire colonies. The British Naval Base but a stone's throw from the British Naval Base we have at Malta. 'This battle of Armageddon is the last-it is the millennium-Christ' s return to earth. The battle is being fought-the words are clear in the Bible-and the British Forces are in danger of being wiped out. When Christ re-appears, it is said it will be on the spot on which He left the earth, just east of Jerusalem, and That means thatHe will quietly and silently come into the British headquarters. There will be great storms, tempests, deluge, and fire-no doubt from the air-coming down and wiping out the army opposing us.

I do not say that colossal' expenditure should be incurred to-day, or for the next few years, on great armies and navies, but the British Empire must, under _ Christ's direction, keep her A r m y and ' Navy up lo a certain level in readiness for the great day. So far as we can see, the Japanese will not invade Australia. As a matter of fact, many believe that, according to the Bible, great numbers of Japanese and Chinese, on Christ's return -the millennium following Armageddon -ar e to go to Palestine with Christ and the Jews, because the Japanese have always been looked upon as a people who are immortal. aware that the Japanese love to fight, and enter battle without fear or misgiving, because they know that on their death they will go to Paradise. They look to a higher future, and, so far as we can ascertain, they will, at the millennium, go into Palestine with Christ. Honourable members may or may not believe me, but when I remind them of that Book, and of the prayer that is said here every day, they w ill agree that there must be something in what I because not one link of any importance is missing from the chain. Winston Churchill was warned, so I am informed, by a man who thinks as I do. that his premeditated attack on the Dardanelles would fail, because that was not the place where it was ordained that the -Tiirks should be driven out. were to be driven out of Palestine; and I am delighted to know that it was the Australian Imperial Force that practically did it. I could go on for some hours on this subject, which is highly interesting, because it has, in my opinion, a vital bearing upon the matters in regard to which this Parliament has to legislate. able member's time has expired. speech to which we have just listened brings me great peace of mind. I know now that I need not trouble about the future or anything that may happen. WhateverI may do or may not do, I know it was so ordained. Therefore, I am not concerned as to what may be the result of this discussion. I know it is useless to debate even this motion, useless to discuss armaments or disarmament. An y expenditure we may incur in sending delegates to the Washington Conference is a ll wasted, because we know that first there is to be Armageddon, which will be followed by the millennium and the return of Christ. Whether we vote ourselves. £600 per annum or £1,000 per. annum, or whether something inspires us to vote ourselves £2,000 to-morrow, we know that we do not do these things of our own volition; we are the mere creatures of circumstance, and are predes[494}2 tined to do these things for ourselves. Therefore, I am not in the least concerned in regard to the fate of this motion, or as to whether you, Mr. Speaker, do or do not leave the chair. But I understand the motion is made the Honourable members are vehicle for objection to a lecture delivered by a certain gentleman in this building last night. The honourable member who last spoke ( Mr Marks) said that he would like to listen to all shades of opinion. to the honourable member if he is throwing what is vulgarly called ""chiac"" at the Book to which I have referred. 4s, let him say so, and I shall leave the chamber. that matter later. The honourable member has said that he would like to listen to all shades of opinion expressed within the precincts of this House. Whether he The Turks wishes it or not, his wish cannot be gratified, because only one set of opinions is permitted to be voiced in this building, and those are the opinions acceptable to the Government of the day. Therefore, it would be futile of me to expect anybody holding opinions identical with my own to be allowed to speak here. I did not listen to the lecturer who spoke in this building last night, but if I had done Order ! The honorso I would have said to him, "" Y o u 'are an American citizen. Y o u are a visitor to this country. Y o u are tolerated in this building, not because you are a free and intelligent individual who holds certain views, but only because your opinions are acceptable to the Government of this country."" I might also have told him, "" Y o u are an American citizen, and there are other American citizens who are permitted to come into this country. They also hold those free opinions which we claim every man born under the British flag has a right to express. Men of your own race and blood, born under the Stars and Stripes, accepting the invitation which we extend to all races, came here and dared to express their opinions.

110,Mr Anstey,"No ; I shall come today."" SoI might have told the lecturer last night that he was permitted to speak in free Australia only because the character of his opinions was acceptable to the Government. I take this opportunity of pointing out that the other day there returned to this country a man who was bom on Australian soil, but left these shores thirty years ago. He went to America, lived there for many years, and became an expert in oil geology. He went to Mexico, and became a big proprietor of Mexican oil properties. He was a man with money, but he held radical opinions. He was the representative of a big American company, and its agent throughout Southern America. After an absence of thirty years he returned with his son to the land of hiss birth. In one of our cities he gave a lecture, and, because he expressed radical views, he was told that he would be free to live in or travel in Australia as long as he liked, but, if he was not careful as to the views he expressed, he would be handed his passport. That instance was typical. I agree with the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), that of all the farces perpetrated by the nations there has been none greater than that of meeting to discuss so-called partial disarmament. What do the proposals mean? Only that the nations may agree to reduce their relative strengths. They do not mean to abolish armaments, annihilate armed forces, demolish their navies, and put an end to war. They simply say, "" We will fight on a lower strength level. Let us agree upon a 9,000,000 man power basis, or a 20,000,000 man power basis."" But the outstanding fact is that, no matter what basis is agreed upon, the United States of America means to have armaments that shall not be less than those of any other nation on the face of the earth. The nations may decide the basis of their fighting strength, but there are still to be armaments which will enable them to. achieve their principal object-the suppression of the industrial populations within their own boundaries. Therefore, it is a waste of time for any one to discuss these disarmament propositions, because no one intends to regard them seriously. As soon as I entered the chamber and heard what was being discussed, I was reminded of a story Mr Anstey. written by Guy de Maupassant. He was travelling in the Mediterranean in hi3 yacht, and this is how he describes the scene:A t the same moment that I leave the ship to get aboard my cockleshell, I hear the sound of firing on shore. It is the regiment at Antibes practising rifle 'shooting on the sands and among the pine woods. The smoke rises in white flakes, like evaporating clouds of cotton, and I can see the red trousers of the soldiers as they run along the beach. The naval officers suddenly become interested, point their glasses landward, and their hearts beat faster at this spectacle of mimic warfare. A t the mere mention of the word war I am seized with a sense of bewilderment, asthough I heard of witchcraft, of the Inquisition, of some far-distant thing, ended long ago, abominable and monstrous, against a l l natural law. When we talk of cannibals, we proudly smile and claim our superiority over these savages. Who are the savages, the true savages? Those who fight to eat the vanquished, or those who fight to k ill , only to kill? The gallant little soldiers running about there are as surely doomed to death as the flocks of sheep driven along the road by the butcher. They w ill fall on some plain, with their heads split open by sabre cuts, or their chests riddled by bullets; and yet they are young men who might work, produce something, be useful. Their fathers are old and poverty stricken: their mothers, who during twenty years have loved them, adored them as only mothers can adore, may perchance bear in six months or a yearthat the son, thechild, the big fellow, reared with so much care, at such an expense, and with so much love, has -been cast in a hole like a dead dog, after having been ripped open by a bullet, and trampled, crushed, mangled by the rush of cavalry charges. Why have they killed hei* boy, her beautiful boy, her sole hope, her pride, her life ? She cannot understand. Yes, indeed, why? W a r ! fighting! slaughter! butchering men! And to think that now, in our own country, with a l l our civilization, with the expansion of science and the height of philosophy to which the human race is supposed to have attained, we should have schools in which we teach the art of killing, or killing from afar to perfection, numbers of people at the same time; poor devils, innocent men, fathers of families, men of untarnished reputation. The most astounding tiling is that the people do not rise up against the governing powers. What difference is there then between monarchies and republics? And what is more astounding still, why does not society rise up bodily in rebellion at the word "" w a r "" ? Ah, yes, we shall ever continue to live borne down ""by the old and odious custom, the criminal prejudices, the ferocious ideas of our barbarous forefathers, for we are but animals, and we shall remain animals led only by in stinct that nothing w i ll ever change. 0 Then he quotes the following extraordinary words of Moltke: War is holy and of divine institution; it is one of the sacred laws of nature; it keeps alive in men all the great and noble sentiments, honour, disinterestedness, virtue, courage. In one word, it prevents them from falling into the most hideous materialism. Commenting upon this, de Maupassant saysTherefore, to collect a herd of some 400,000 men, inarch day and night without respite, to think of nothing, study nothing, learn nothing, read nothing, be of no earthly use to any one, rot with dirt, lie down in mire, live like brutes in a continual besotment, pillage towns, burn villages, ruin nations; then meeting another similar agglomeration of human flesh, rush upon it, shed lakes of blood, cover plains with pounded flesh, mingled with muddy and bloody earth, pile up heaps of slain, have arms and legs blown off, brains scattered without benefit to any one, and perish at the comer of some field, while your old parent, your wife, and children are dying of hunger : this is what is called "" not falling into the most hideous materialism."" I need not read any more of de Mau passant's words. My honourable friend who preceded me says, "" D o not refer to' the Book in mockery "" ; but how does the honourable member dare to speak in the name of the Christian faith when he flouts the doctrine of peace on earth and good will towards men, and joins with those who put the sword of war in the temple, and use that holy structure and the name of Christ to urge the waging of war among the nations of the world! Who desecrates the name of Christ but those who dare to use H is house for the purpose of urging the maintenance of a cruel animal materialism ? called civilization of to-day we have statesmen and churchmen doing this very thing, defiling the name of Christi n the very institutions they uphold to carry on a bloody warfare that can have only one purpose-the destruction and annihilation of all that is best on the face of the earth. able member would have uttered these remarks if I had had the opportunity of completing what I was about to say. I have just received a note from Mr Speaker pointing out that a mistake was made by him in informing me that my time had expired. tlie remarks the honourable member has made, and if he says I am referring to him disparagingly he is mistaken. I can assure him that no prophet has honour in his own country; but it is not disrespectful on my part if I tell him that his remarks can gain for him no respect in this Chamber or in the country' generally, particularly when he contends upon any authority he may put forward that the year 1934 will bring about the Millennium or Paradise. I do agree with the honourable member that there will be a war in the future. It may be in Jerusalem. But it will be the eternal war waged by the bulk of the human race against those who have become the money changers within the temple and have subjugated a ll the nations of the eartfh to the money-bag. Those gentlemen who are talking of effecting twopenny-halfpenny economies have heen answered by the reply given by a Minister the other clay to an honourable member on this side of ,the chamber, that Australia is called upon, "" as a result of the war""-th° e Minister did not say that, but we know that it is the faot-to pay £21,000,000 per annum . to -the Jews and money changers of the world. In the hour of its need, when the country was supposed to be struggling to maintain its liberty and freedom against oppression and tyranny, it was called upon to sacrifice its manhood; and now, in the days of peace, it is again called upon to drag fro m the produce of the field and factory the wherewithal to pay a perpetual annual subsidy, not to German conquerors, but to victors within our own In our soborders, and living beneath our own flag. This £21,000,000, equal to the total cost of governing this country in the days before t i e war, which is to be extracted annually from the produce of the fields or the factories of Australia, is not to be spent for the purpose of education, or .the building of homes, or in order to make the lives of our citizens happier, o r to. extend man's knowledge and develop his I do not think the honormind, thus saving h i m from ignorance or poverty, but it is to be handed over to money-lenders. It is our fundamental problem to-day that these money changers in the temple are the true enemies against whom Armageddon must be fought. It is wrong to say that the enemy w ill be Russia or Germany, or an unmentionable We l l , I shall deal with nation. There is no need to hide one's head in the sand by refusing to say the",33,Honourable Member Does The Australia Or Any Like Subject But It

If that be so, then why not let the will of God prevail, and that is, "" Peace."" due respect, that I do not worry about any of the complaints we have heard today about the use of the precincts of this House, because when men with other views occupy those benches opposite they will follow the improper precedent set them by the present Government, that of making use of the precincts of this building spectable American gentleman, in my for the purpose of giving expression to the views entertained by a particular ijlass of men. The precedent thus established will always be open, to abuse; and when other men take the place of those who are at present in power, the precincts of this building will assuredly be invaded by men who will utter views in opposition to those we hear to-day. Not the slightest harm has. been done; but the Government ought not to provide grounds for those who succeed them to 'use tlie precincts of this House for the -delivery of lectures by men of any shade -of opinion. There are plenty of places outside which can be used by anybody who wishes to trade his particular wares or give expression to his'particular shade of political opinion. If this practice is followed, no one will be able to accuse the Government of partiality, or of abusing its privileges, and no opportunity will be afforded to any honourable member to speak as the honourable member for Perth has done to-day. I did not rise with the least intention of making any objectionable remark to the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks). you follow me.

I am sorry that there was any report of the lecture, or that the whole of the lecturer's remarks were not reported, instead of tit-bits given quite apart from their context, a method of reporting which gives rise to misconstruction of the sentiments of the lecturer by those not present to hear him. This reopinion, spoke in a distinctly friendly way of the British race, and I am sure he said nothing offensive to the Japanese, or any other nation. He expressed his appreciation of a book recently written by Owen Wi3ter, and seemed to envy the author, contending that he had entertained the same views at an earlier stage. However, more harm has been done by taking any notice of the lecture. It would have been better if an arrangement had been made to exercise a censorship over the report of what might be regarded as matters of diplomatic or international importance. sorship re-established ? preferred a full report. I was pleased to see the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) at the lecture.

We have heard many informative lectures given in the precincts of the House. many years without these lectures. greatly benefit by the information they derive from these instructive lectures, and I hope no embargo will be placed upon them.

Because the lecture was given under the patronage of members of both Houses it might possibly be construed that the auditors were in flliisolute agreement with every sentiment uttered by the lecturer. danger of that. chapter and verse in the history of the various countries of the world in support of the sentiments to which he gave expression.

I admire him for his outspokenness. preamble he told his audience that what he was about to say that evening he had said, in even more emphatic language, on the platforms of his own country during the war. speaking during the war the world would have been the better for it. Many of the evils from which the nations are suffering to-day have been evolved from their secret diplomacy. What we need is more plain speaking and the laying of the cards of every nation on the table. this Parliament we deny ourselves the right to discuss subjects that ought to be discussed by us, and which are dealt with very freely in all the great magazines. In many of the leading American magazines to be found in the Parliamentarv Library there appear from time to time articles translated from the Japanese as well as by British and American writers, in which questions of this character are discussed in the clearest and most emphatic language. I merely object to this building being used for such a purpose. special privileges for another branch of the Legislature, but we may protest until doomsday, although without effect in regard to meetings held in rooms in that part of this building which is under the control of the President of the Senate. We look to our Presiding Officer to protect our interests in respect of the use of rooms on this side of the building; but the rooms on the Senate side are controlled absolutely by the President and his officials. When the lecturer complained of the Japanese becoming the possessors of land in and about California, I had the temerity to interject, "" Why were American citizens prepared to sell land to them?"" I thought that he was making a palpably weak statement in regard to some of the actions of his countrymen,, and felt impelled to interject. ber who has attempted to defend the lecturer this afternoon has deprecated some part of his speech. equipped a lecturer may be, his utterances are not likely to meet with absolute By way of approval when he is lecturing before a somewhat critical and mixed audience.

AlthoughI dare say I disagreed with the lecturer's remarks to a greater! extent than did any one else in the room, I certainly would not support the placing of any restriction on the giving of lectures of a similar character in this building. thing if honourable members heard more lectures of the kind. I do not suggest that every lecture delivered in the parliamentary'buildings should be of the particular type of that which we heard last night, because I also plead guilty to the charge made by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) that every honourable member disagreed with one part or another of his lecture. As a matter of fact, I disagreed with practically everything the lecturer said. We should not refuse, however, to listen to a man merely because we differ from the views expressed by him. I always believe in giving "" the other fellow "" a hearing. I was particularly anxious to hear this gentleman, because I wished to know what sort of a propagandist the Yankee"" boodleiers "" had sent out here.

The lecturer last evening was Let this Parliament and this at great pains to point out the conditions prevailing in the United States of America..

It was due to the Democratic party, he said, that the United States of America did not come into the war as early asi she might have done. He told us that he made no charges. He simply stated facts, leaving his hearers to draw their own conclusions'. He went onj to tell us of the racial problem in the United States of It would be a good America, and how they had educated the negroes up to keeping their place by shooting them. cated race riots, and at the close of his lecture told us that he believedi n the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Jesus Christ, but I do not think he included the negro in that brotherhood. In order to complete his statement that he believed in the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Jesus Christ, he should have added that he believed also in the supremacy of the Anglo-American Navies.

To-day the American Imperialist is out in his own interests.;' what he desires is an end of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, and that is what our friend, the lecturer, was playing for last evening. The lecturer threw bouquets to Lord Northcliffe, whom he described as a great statesman, and commended him for his statement at'Honolulu. If Lord Northcliffe previously had any claim to be a statesman, that speech ought to destroy that claim for ever.

185,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [5.6],"friendship as no other nation has done. I recall to the minds of honourable members the monument erected by the Japanese in the Bay of Yokohama. A man named Richardson was killed. Immediately the British Consul called the American; French, and Butch Consuls together, and they made a hurried demand on the Japanese for an indemnity. By a system of loans the Japanese were able to pay the sum which was demanded, but when later investigation showed that Richardson was such a scoundrel as to deserve the fate that befel him, America handed back the whole of the indemnity, and with it Japan erected in the Bay of Yokohama a lighthouse or tower to welcome visitors to Japan. America also showed a splendid example in handing back the indemnity paid by China in connection with the so-called Boxer rebellion -Again, the people of the United States of America have fed the starving ones of other lands as no other nation has done. Butthe greatest monument to her character is the 3,000 miles of frontier between the United States and Canada without a gun or a soldier, to protect it. of friendship to Australia, we should grasp it. Some honourable members have said that if a war occurred between Japan and America, involving the British Empire, they would not fight against the American people. Neither would I. I am past the age limit, and was rejected when I volunteered for service in the late war; but still every man can do a little in the time of need. In a little pamphlet I published in 1905 I expressed these sentiments, which seem appropriate to the question we are discussing to-day:So far as we in Australia are directly concerned, 1 sea, first of all, and more important ture that will not interfere with our parthan all, though ultimately worthless unless liamentary work, I shall be glad to attend knit with all, ono effective ally, one union that it, no matter how I may disagree with the will beget a confident hope, or, rather, a sure opinions that are enunciated.

The road thither may be very distasteful to much that is agthe lecturer lost night for the purpose of g ressively rather than self-sacrificingly British; strengthening the 'bonds of friendship ut even if, with cap in hand, it were better between America and Great Britain. thither, and with that purpose than ultimately, Honourable members may recall the words with sackcloth on our loios and ashes on our heads, to put our neck beneath the heel of the of Admiral Sperry, who, when some New Eastern conqueror. That was my opinion then, and I glory from the North, replied, "" Y o u needin the idea that is responsible for the never be afraid so long as the Stars and Conference in Washington to try to put Stripes float above the seas."" If it should an end to war. In-the issue of Stead's Dr. Moloney. Review of 15th October, 1921, statistics were published to show that in the late war ' 3,340,000 French, 6,300,000 Germans, and 5,800,000 Austria-Hungarians lost their lives, while upwards of 35,000,000 deaths occurred in Poland and Russia as a direct or indirect result of the war. I have never advocated war, because behind every soldier I have seen the women and 'children, who suffer most. I loathe the very idea of war, and cannot understand why the good God permits it. I sometimes become disgusted with preachers who.call themselves .Christian ministers when they are advocating the bloody course of war. So, if America and Great Britain, those two great English-speaking nations, will shake hands and agree to be friends, such an understanding will do more than any other combination of nations to insure the peace of the world. I believe in the future. I believe that the human being is not such a fool as to desire to continually massacre and blow into perdition his fellow beings. If we are fashioned in God's likeness, surely the destruction of each other is the worse thing we can do. I thank Professor Herbsman for his discourse last night, and I would be glad If America stretches out the hand to hear him repeat it in the Melbourne TownH a l l Speaking with some knowledge of university professors, I say that of all professors I have heard he is the finest orator. He speaks quickly, but every word is distinctly uttered, although his ascent sometimes is a little strange to Australian ears. With the tribute he paid to the British Navy, any student of history will agree, and the splendid words of Tennyson with which he concluded his speech must have appealed to every listener.

In Committee (Consideration of Senate's requests, resumed from 2nd November, vide page 12351) : Item 161Agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery and implements, n.e.i.; including cane loaders, cane unloaders, and cane harvesters; . . . ad vol., British, 22£ P cent.; intermediate, 30 per cent.; general, 35 per cent.

That the requested amendment be not mode. night I expressed regret that milking machines were included in the group under this item, because it is my desire that they should be dealt with separately. When the Tariff was before this Committee on the previous occasion the Minister( Mr Greene) promised to give further consideration to the duties on milking machines before the Tariff went to another place, and I ask him now if there is any reason why he cannot give special consideration to this class of machinery'( the machines are being made in Australia by three separate manufacturers. be dealt with separately from the others included in this group. machinery can be manufactured in Australia more or less satisfactorily, but to provide that all the machines thus grouped should bear the same amount of protection does not appear to bo practical or satisfactory. Inasmuch as these machines are grouped in this item with other agricultural machinery, the only course open to me is to ask that the 'Senate's requested amendment to lower the duty applying to the whole item be made. I am particularly anxious that milking machines should be admitted at as low a rate as possible, while allowing a reasonable protection for the manufacturers of the machines, if they are made in Australia. My information is that only parts of them are made here, and the assembling of parts made elsewhere is not the local manufacture of the whole article. My information is that oer-i tainly the engines are imported. However, it is an important matter to ascertain whether the whole of a milking machine is manufactured in Australia. that there are thirteen firms in Australia making milking machines, and twenty engaged in the manufacture of parts. that thirteen manufacturers are making e r absolutely'every part of a milking machine ? parts, and some are making machines. If there are some parts that cannot be made in Australia they will be admitted free of duty. milking machine is an Australian invention. machine, which was one of the first put on the market, is, I understand, an Australian invention. made in Australia some protection is necessary.

It is a very difficult matter, in fact, it is almost impossible, for those engaged in Some of this the dairying industry to get manual labour, unless wages are paid which the industry eannot stand, and the production of butter depends very largely upon family effort.

As a matter of fact, it would be wiped out to a considerable extent hut for the use of machinery, and that is where I come to the point at issue. If milking machines can be got at a reasonable price they will be installed in the very near future in the majority of our dairies. I know from a close association with dairymen that the machine of to-day is regarded as a success. Some years ago it was not so regarded, and many machines that were installed were afterwards abandoned for various reasons, hut in Tasmania, where I reside, there is a small butter, factory, with an output of 1#2 tons last year, which is surrounded by a dairymen have installed these machines. Tasmanian districts, people engaged in the industry are installing these milking machines, and I want, them to get them at a price which w ill enable the smaller dairymen to buy them, thereby overcoming the difficulty of securing suitable labour, and perhaps preventing the use of child labour. arguments which, I am now using apply also iu a lesser degree to all classes of machinery' covered by the item. It is unnecessary for me to repeat what was said last night-that we. should not, for the sake of bolstering up one industry do something detrimental to equally, if nob more, important. milking machines should be admitted free? them free, because they are included in the group of agricultural machinery upon which the Senate has asked us to reduce the duty. The Minister does nob see fit to accede to the Senate's request, but if the Committee do so, they will only be doing justice to an industry in which the people engaged in it will have to face x> lower values for their produce. Butter is practically a drug on the market today. the vicinity of Is. per l b . , and those who are marketing it are not quite sure that they can afford to pay even that amount to the producer because of the uncertainty of the British market. Dairymen are confronted with serious difficulties. It is impossible to pay high wages and huge profits to those engaged in the manufacture of machinery at the expense of the users of the particular articles. I know that, without the support of the Minister, we have no possible chance of having the Senate's request acceded to, but I seriously appeal to h i m to give every consideration to the aspect of the question which I have just put before him. One would think that honourable members were asking for the admission of milking machines free of duty, whereas they are merely splitting straws as to whether the item shall be admitted under the general Tariff at 30 per cent, or 35 per cent. I district in which thirty-three do not know the prices of American machines, but there are many articles I know also that, in other mentioned in this item which have a very long life. F o r instance, the life of a garden roller has no limit, but the average life of an ordinary piece of machinery is ten years. If an article costs £ 1 0 0 , and the difference in the duty is £ 5 , it represents not more than 10s. per annum over the whole period. Y e t we have been talking all yesterday and The to-day about such a trifle as this. will last for ten years? credible authority that there are machines that will last for fifteen years, and still others be serviceable.

Let us get to a vote. We' have only a few weeks in which to deal with a number of important matters before the Christmas vacation. We all want zo get home before Christmas, but unless the Minister applies the ""gag,"" I am afraid'we shall not be able to do so. -The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) has urged that we should proceed without delay to a vote. Our party will'agree to go to a division immediately if the Minister will accept the Senate's request. Member after member has said that this is only a small matter, that the duty in respect of certain implements in the item amounts to only 5s., 10s., £1, £5, or £10. In the case of a reaper and binder, however, it amounts to 45 per cent., and involves in the aggregate some millions of pounds. All the implements covered by this item are most necessary to our primary producers. The use of milking machines, for instance, should be encouraged to the fullest extent. I gave evidence before a certain Commission some tune ago as to the cost of producing butter, and although I was cross-examined for a couple of days I made it abundantly cjear, in the opinion of those who heard my evidence, thai; it cost some five or six years ago from 2s. 4d. to 2s. 6d. a lb. to produce butter. The cost to-day is even greater. If dairymen and their families who are employed in the industry were subject to the awards of Wages Boards and Arbitration Counts-if they received time and a half rates for overtime and double rates for Sunday work-wha t would be the cost of production? The wholesale selling price to-day is Is. 2d. per lb., and I am afraid that there will be a still further drop. Dairying is a. sweated industry, and is kept going mainly by the farmers' children. The Minister has read a lot about child slavery, and I suggest to him that he has a chance of relievI suggest to honoring Australia of a little of that slavery by freeing a machine that will help to reduce the work Of the dairyman.

By means of such a machine a woman and a child, after The only Free Trade vote I a little practice, can milk upwards of fifty cows in an hour and a half. ber using a milking machine? Protectionist, but many of the duties under this Tariff are prohibitive, and they will have the effect of driving hundreds off the land and into the cities in search of an easier job. The dairying industry shoiild be encouraged. It pulled Australia through in a time of need, and must be looked to for substantial help in the future. Although the price of butter to-day is low, the dairying industry is a God-send to thousands of producers who would have little or nothing coming in but for the money they receive for their milk. The Minister ought not to hesitate to agree to the Senate's request. Surely the views of another place are entitled to consideration on our part. The Minister views favourably a request from another place for increased duties; why should he not accept this request for a reduction? It has been said that if the Country party and the Labour party combined it would be an unholy alliance, but the Government has received the solid support of the Labour party in carrying this Tariff. Supporters of the Government in another ^place have joined in making this request, and the Minister should agree to it. When the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) was debating this question a few minutes ago, he made a remark which, taken with an interjection made by the Minister( Mr Greene), sums up the attitude of the Government and its supporters towards this proposition. The honourable member urged that this was only a little increase in the taxation of the man on the land, and the Minister interjected, "" If we do not get £30,000,000 by indirect taxation we shall have to get it by the direct taxation of the man on the",46,Customs Tariffbill

I ask the Committee to accept the Senate's request, not so much with a view to lightening the burdens of the men on the land as to giving them renewed hope. What they need today is more sympathetic treatment on the part of the Administration. They wish to .have their troubles recognised. The man on the land is now getting very low prices for his products, and sees little be prepared to pay a fair price for the chance of prices rising. During the war, prices were good, but they have since got down to bedrock. throughout Australia who bought stock at *v> high prices are now having to sell it at low prices. Men who bought store stock to fatten, thinking that they would make 40 or 50 per cent, on the original purchase price, are selling to-day for 40 or 50 per cent, less than the stock cost. Merino wool to-day sells well, but the price of all other grades of wool is low. Men bought sheep carrying wool for which they hoped to get fair prices, and to-day some of that wool is hardly saleable. In view of the disheartening trend of the world's markets, Parliament should show more sympathy with those on the land, many of whom are getting tired of the business, and are leaving the country districts to live in towns. I do not object to members of the Corner party making the speeches to which we are listening, 'because they have to look after the interests of those they represent -the people in the country. But I ask them not to be too longwinded. This is the point of view that I would put to them. Is it not in the interests of the farmers that the machinery that they need should be manufactured in the Commonwealth? If there were no local manufacturers, the farmers would be at the mercy of the importers, who could charge what they liked, without fear of competition. That there are thirteen manufacturers of agricultural machinery in Australia, and likely to be more, keeps down prices. much, these manufacturers will be unable to pay wages and get a return on their capital, and, not being in business for the woollen, linen, and cotton goods; on boots, sake of (their health, will abandon the inhats, foodstuffs, and narcotics, have to be dustry, leaving the fanners at the mercy of the importers. We hear of farmers coming to the city, and a good many are doing so; but they are men who have made a competence, and are retiring. On the other hand, there are thousands of persons wanting land. The Minister is not putting a burden on the farmers. When farmers buy machinery, they buy it to save labour, and thus to increase their profits. I do not blame them for wishing to save expense, but they must machinery that they use for that purpose. It is to the interest of the farmers Thousands of men that they should get the best machinery, which is the machinery made in the country, the manufacture of which employs Australians. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) says that the farmers have to pay all the taxes, but he forgets that they get their necessaries at bedrock prices, producing what they consume, so that they have no profit to pay on it, whereas a factory employee has to pay highly for all he consumes. think it costs the farmer nothing to produce what he wants? his necessaries at cost price. The honourable member for Robertson told us that the prices of stock have fallen, but so have the prices of boots and clothing, and many other things. Yet those who have bought merchandise to sell it again are not coming here with long faces, telling us that the world is coming to an end. Everything is falling in price. Labour has come down in price. enough there to come down. Our friends say that we need population and a local market, but we cannot get population unless we provide for the employment of our people. When the farmer buys a machine to cheapen his production he charges its cost against the consumer of his products.

256,Mr Fenton,"No .ber believe me if I say that in the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission there is one to the effect that this 2-^ per cent, shall be put on. that; I have the report of the Commission here, and propose to read it. I may say that this is one of the few occasions on which the Minister( Mr Greene) has let us know anything about the report of the Inter-State Commission. report the honourable member is referring to, but it is in the reports of the InterState Commission. a blacksmith, in Tasmania, who was about to put on the market a potato digger and a peg-tooth harrow, submitted that his trade was on the increase, and was profitably carried on, but he desired a higher duty in order to expand his business more rapidly. The report of the Inter-State Comnnission saysTho most notable feature in connection with this industry .is the fact that, except in regard to these comparatively unimportant branches, manufacturers' have refrained from approaching the Commission, either in regard to unsatisfactory conditions, which may exist in the manufacture of machines and implements in which they arc at present engaged, or in respect to an extension of their operations to machines and implements which hitherto have not been commercially made here. It is a fair inference that the local manufacturers were satisfied with the 1908-11 Tariff. The information I have is^that, notwithstanding that no evidence was adduced, the Commission did make some recommendations, chiefly in the direction of raising the general Tariff in order to give a preference to implements, and so forth, of United Kingdom origin, which may partly account for the preference in the 1914 Tariff, brought in twenty-one months before the Commission's report was presented to Parliament. I am not quite sure, but I assume that the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Tudor), was aware of this report of the Commission. I know that the evidence was taken by the Commission from March till October in 1914, though I forget when the Tariff was introduced. It is only fair to assume, however, that the then Minister would have the advice of the Inter-State Commission prior to its introduction. The great fact stands out that the machinery manufacturers did not ask for increased duties, evidently not considering them essential. We are I was coming to, always given to understand that as time goes on Protective duties can be decreased; that as businesses are built up, and a wider market obtained, manufacturing can be conducted on a larger ""scale, with lower prices as the result. Surely we are now justified, after years and I do not say it is in the years of Protection, in expecting to obtain agricultural machinery more cheaply than in the past. Even at the present time, there -is large natural protection, and there was even more a few months I am informed that ago, in the shape of heavy freights, insurances, and so forth. In the case of goods from America and Canada the exchange at the present time is so much against us that, taking the figures of two months ago, we have to pay £117 for £100 worth of goods. were dealing with, the Tariff on the last occasion. other charges included. tioned that there are freight, insurances, and other risks. Further, although wages have been reduced in Canada recently, they are still considerably higher than in Australia. honourable member's help to get higher wages in Australia. Parliament was determined to adopt a Protectionist policy, the first step should be to reduce the cost of living. I sought to either put commodities like tinned fish and cotton socks on the free list or admit them at low rates of duty so that the cost of living would be reduced. I do not desire wages to be reduced unless there is a reduction in the cost of living, but we have a right to demand from the employers and workers in this country a. service equally as good as that given by the manufacturers and workers in the United States of America and Canada. In point of natural ability and resourcefulness the Australian workers are equal to any in the world.

The Canadian farmer can buy a reaper and binder for £ 6 0 , whilst the Australian farmer has to pay £ 1 0 0 for a similar article, and if this 40 per cent, duty had been operating last year, the cost of the machine would have been £130. Surely the Australian manufacturer should be able to produce the article at something near the price at which the machine is sold in America. The member is not in order in discussing that matter on this item. member placed those pearls of wisdom before the. Committee when the Tariff was previously under consideration. which I think it worthwhile to impress upon the Committee. The honourable member claims that he is always endeavouring to do the best he can for the worker, but the only person who will gain by these heavy duties is the manufacturer; he is the "" k in g p in"" a ll through this Tariff, and we have usually found him a good deal in evidence about this building. In regard to the comparative rates of wages paid in Canada and Australia, tlie latest information I am able to obtain from the 7 ear-Books relates to the year 1918, and it shows that in the agricultural machinery industry the average wage paid in Australia was £12 9 18s., whereas in Canada it was £ 1 9 2 12s., or about 34 per cent. more. parative costs of living? quoting wages unless the honourable member contrasts what the wages will buy in each country. ber will realize the difficulty of making such a comparison for the year 1918.

A comparison of the values of outputs is very significant, and shows that there must be something wrong with the Australian conditions.

Senate's Request -British, 15 per cent.; intermediate, 25 per cent.; general, 30 per cent. for Trade and Customs) [8.0] I move That the requested amendment be not made. It may shorten the debate and assist honourable members if I indicate, at this stage what the Government propose in respect of the requests of the Senate dealing with agricultural machinery generally. I shall ask the Committee not to agree to the request upon the item immediately under discussion, but upon the four following items I shall move for the acceptance of the requests, raising the British preferential duty, however, in each instance to 22$ per cent. Honourable members will note that my reference is to the four items Nos. 163, 164, and 165 A and B . They cover such implements as combined corn shellers, disc cultivators, drills, stump-jump ploughs, winnowers, parts of agricultural machines, churns of all kinds, refrigerators other than for household use, reaper threshers and harvesters, and stripper harvesters. The effect of accepting the Senate's requests, with the addition of 2$ per cent, to the preferential rate, will be to. bring all thel duties on agricultural implements into line-that is to say, the same British rate will rule throughout. with the views of the Senate, and at the same time afford reasonable! protection to Australian manufacturers. mention why I have suggested the addition of 2$ per cent, to the preferential rate. When discussing the. previous item -that , having to do with agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural ments-the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) drew for support upon the reports of the Inter-State Commission. Those, reports were his justification. I propose to justify the imposition of an all-round British duty of 22$ per cent, also by the reports of the Interstate Commission. If honourable members will turn to page 39 of the majority report of that body, dealing with iron and steel, they will note a paragraph which reviews the general effect of the adoption of she Commission's recommendation. The recommendation was for the imposipig iron. This was proposed as a basis in respect of the iron and steel industry. However, a departure has been made from that recommendation, and the duty is 20s. per ton. The Commissioners sayIn reviewing the relation of the proposals made herein to their efTect on other industries, it is gratifying to be able to state that tlie increased duties required to protect local manufacturers using iron and steel products are generally comparatively unimportant. The necessary increase over existing Tariff rates ranges from 2£ per cent, to 5 per cent. Of the £7,000,000 imports of all engineering, mechanical, electrical, and agricultural manufactures, not less than 75 per cent, require only 2* per cent., and the balance not more than a per cent, addition of duty -. There is the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission, to the effect that 2$ per cent, should be added if 12s. 6d. is to be adopted as the basic' duty upon pig iron. As I have just pointed out, the departure' from that recommendation is to the extent of making the preferential duty 20s. per ton. Upon that basis the Government should have made the added duty in the instances now under discussion equal to about 4 per cent. However, the proposal is to add only 2$ per cent. -I hope the Committee will not depart from the request of the Senate. There should be a fixed rulei that the tools of trade of all workers should be kept as My proposal should meet free from the imposition of duties as possible. That is a principle by which the Country' party stands. I have always adI desire to vocated it. Before the war farmers were able to buy the ordinary light doublefurrow plough for'between £10 10s. and £11. To-day the cost of the implement is about £26 10s. The same story implemay be told with regard to the reaper and binder. In fact, prices have been multiplied by three. The enhanced cost amounts to the payment of a tribute by primary producers to the wealthy city manufacturers of Australia, and it is time the practice was ended. I have been afforded an example of what this rotte°n Tariff means.

The dredging work was hung up for nearly five years, owing to the fact that the dredge could not be constructed in England while the war was in progress.

Is it fair that the Australian primary producer, who is having so bad a time to-day, should be called upon, before be can buy an ordinary implement of trade, to pay tribute to rich city manufacturers? I invite honourable members to consider the price of ploughshares to-day, and, in fact, of everything that the farmer must use. I invite honourable members,further, to remember that these inordinate costs are facing producers at a time when they are confronted with the worse market known in this country for many a year. bread, with wheat at 9s. per bushel. MrM c WILLIAMS I am afraid that the price of wheat this year will be between 4s. and 4s. 6d. per bushel, f.o.b. There are very few farmers in Australia who can produce wheat to-day on the basis of that price. But what care honourable members? What do the renegade low-Tariff advocates care? What care those who previously fought for moderately low duties? What care they that I ,um dealing our farmers, in the special circumstances existing at this time, should be forced to pay more than double the legitimate price for their necessary implements? Of course, when one sees the Chamber of I am afraid I Manufactures, as represented by the Government, and the Trades Hall, as represented by the Opposition, shaking hands across the table in this chamber with the common pui'pose of robbing the primary producer, one is bound to realize Perhaps that his protest is as the voice of one crying in the wilderness. What is wrong with Australia that we cannot manufacture in competition with other countries? We have, I suppose, the richest iron mine in the world, situated for working under the . most'favorable circumstances. Cargoes of coal can be transported to proximity to that mine and sold readily as a profitable venture; and the ships, after ° discharging the coal, can return with cargoes of iron ore. We have to-day, I believe, the cheapest coal in all the world for our manufacturers. What is wrong with Australia? Why must the people pay to Australian manufacturers something in the nature of a bonus of 5s., 6s., and 7s. in the £1? The productions with which Australian manufacturers are called upon to compete come chiefly from Great Britain, Canada, and the United States of America. Respecting the implements dealt with in the item under discussion, Canada and the United States of America are our principal competitors. In those countries wages are as high as in Australia. Canadian manufacturers pay more for their coal and iron, and the",54,Pairs

288,Will Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [8.23].,"( Mr Greene). A little over an hour ago he was ridiculing the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) for quoting a seven years' old report of the Inter-State Commission, but now he is using the same report to support his proposal to reduce the duty on this machinery by 5 per cent. Inter-State Commission's report I quoted was its justification for the 1\ per cent, which the honourable member for Dampier had discovered in it. that the honourable members of the Country party really believe they represent the whole of the population of Australia; but there are at least 1,000,000 Australians whose living depends on the manufacturing industries. Is this million of consumers of no value to the primary producer? Do they not provide him with a ready local market for his produce? Under the duty as agreed to by this Committee previously, within the next two years two great factories would have been established in Australia capable of turning out £2,500,000 worth of machinery which is now imported; but the .Minister's proposal to accept a reduced duty may cause these people to decide not to commence operations in Australia. The variation of the rate in the British preferential column will not make much difference, because very little of this class of machinery comes from Great Britain. Our competition comes from America. The Minister is willing to reduce the duty against America by 5 per cent. amount to very much? of the Country party say that it will make a great deal of difference, but on a previous item covering a great variety of material used on a farm I showed that an extra 5 per cent, in duty would not mean more than £550 to the whole of the farmers of Australia. Honourable members are not capable of being brought to a reasonable frame of mind, and to understand that protective duties, while building up a local market for them, will also provide them with cheap tools of trade unknown to them forty years ago. The inventive genius of Australians and* the wisdom of our mechanics have provided the farmers with more labour-saving machinery than has been known to agriculturists in any other part of the world. This is the reward that the Country party would give the men who, by their inventive genius, have helped the farmers to work their land more cheaply than in days gone by. If they had their way they would wipe out the secondary industries; and, but that it would result in disaster to our workers, I would be prepared to give them a dose of their own physic, by voting to bring Free Trade into operation for two years. After such a dose of their Free Ti-ade physic we should find the Country party on bended knee praying for a return to a Protective Tariff, on the ground that the importers were fleecing them. would lead the country into disaster. They are wreckers, and would pull down industries that have been established here at enormous cost. One would imagine, from their attitude, that they believe that -every farmer's son will follow his father on the farm. do so if the honourable member had his way. member has four sons, I will undertake to say that at least two of them will not follow him in his farming pursuits.

Honourable members of the Country party would deny to the sons of farmers the right to choose their own employment. They would give them no opportunity to follow their natural bent. I am prepared to assist rural interests iby voting for decentralization. I would vote to-morrow for an expenditure of at least £2,000,000 per annum., to increase postal, telephone, and other facilities for our rural population.

But when we come to an important item dealing with agricultural machinery, he says to the Country party, ""Don't shoot, I ' l l come down.""

The tactics of the) Corner party seem to have been i nstrumental in bringing about a fatality, due to what is regarded as the undaunted spirit exhibited by them in. their attack on the Ministry. I am in an unfortunate position. The Minister knows that because of my beliefs I am bound to support him in obtaining the highest duties possible, and he, therefore, feels that he may play fast and loose with me. and hand me over to the tender mercies of the gentlemen in the corner. That, I submit, is not a fair way to treat a loyal supporter like myself. I suppose, however, that I shall have to do without the in formation. The Corner party, havin? tasted blood, will desire more, and will "" s to n e w a l l"" until they get it, and it may be that we on this side may have to resort to a similar course. I can quite understand the attitude of the Country party towards these items, and I have no quarrel with them on that score. I do, however, object to the attitude of the Ministeri n his handling of these requests from the Senate. These related items were voted on by this Committee, and in the particular case before us the duties were fixed at 27$ per cent., 35 per cent., and 40 per cent, by a twoto-one majority. When these requests come before us we are entitled to more in formation than has been given us in regard to the altered attitude of the Minister( Mr Greene). This particular item was separated from the others for the special reason that the machines are. most of them, Australian inventions which have been pirated in America; but the Minister now states that he is prepared W ill the honourable memto accept the requested amendments of the Senate, merely raising one duty from 20 per cent, to 22$ per cent, against I think the Corner Britain. The whole thing is a fiasco, because these machines do not come from Britain, but from America, where our ideas were pirated. Our whole care throughout the consideration of the Tariff has been to give Britain .a preference and develop Empire trade; and the Minister, to blind honourable members on this side, now proposes to increase the duty against Britain by 2$ per cent., though the real .competition comes from America. This is playing fast and loose with the Tariff. Just before the dinner adjournment we refused to accede to a request made by the Senate, and adhered to the Tariff as it left this House. Then no suggestion was made by the Minister about British preference. As I have said, the disc cultivator, the fertilizer, and the stump-jump plough are purely Australian inventions, which we selected for special treatment. I regret to see the attitude of the Minister, especially when he knows that, if honourable members were left free to vote as they think, there would be a strong majority against the proposed amendment. I move That the motion be amended by substituting for the modification proposed by the Minister the following modification:-""British, 20 per cent.; intermediate, .35 per cent.; general, 40 per cent."" This w ill increase the B r it i sh preference by 5 per cent, over the request made by the Senate, and the suggestion should be accepted by the Minister. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton). It is all very well to say that we have sympathy for tlie Old Country; but action is worth an ocean of prayer or a thousand sermons. Surely our manufacturers can turn out these goods well enough to suit our farmers; at any rate, I know that when my son was farming in the West he and his mates were men enough to get their machinery from the Government State works.

B y the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), we are offering Great Britain a paltry preference of 5 per cent. We know that Germany in the future will possibly have the most up-to-date labour-saving appliances for the manufacture of machinery of any country in the world.. I said before the war had been in progress many months that it would be the duty of this Parliament to allow goods from the Mother Country to be imported at as low a duty as possible, just insuring our manufacturers a fighting chance to compete. That would mean maintaining a system of co-operation with the. Mother Country, and, at the same time, a healthy competition between her manufacturers and ours.

The amendment meets the Senate's request to the extent of reducing the British preferential duty by 7$ per cent., but restores the in termediate and general duties that were previously agreed to by this Committee.

Although the wages in ' America may be a little higher, good tradesmen who ""have worked there for some years, and have returned to Australia, have told me that they prefer to worki n Victoria, or New South Wales at wages 20 or 25 per cent, less than they received in the United States of America, because the climate, particularly in San Francisco and the Californian coast, had an exhilarating effect upon them, they were pitted against each other, and the hours worked were often longer than' in Australia; so that although the pay was better, they could not continue at work so long. Honourable members have heard me relate previously that when Foster Fraser asked the American employers to point out their tradesmen who were past fifty years of age, he was shown the cemetery as the place where the workers were planted when they reached that age. We do not desire that condition of affairs in Australia. I ask the Minister to allow this Tariff to prove that we are in sympathy with the HomeL a n d, and will allow her the f u l l 15 per cent, preference as compared with the intermediate Tariff, and 20 per cent, as compared with the general Tariff.

353,Mr Mathews,"The Minister's rethat be the case, there is no reason for reducing the duty, even by £ 2 , unless it might induce a certain amount of importation which would bring in revenue. I can hardly believe that the Ministry are afraid that senators will become annoyed at the refusal of a l l their requests, and see an opportunity of giving way to them when it really does not matter whether their request is granted or not. But that appears to be the case. Australian manufacturers of agricultural implements had. only been sensible, and asked originally for a £ 1 6 duty, they would have got it, and now we are told that despite the all-round rise in prices a duty of £ 1 2 is not necessary. I am not very conversant with the cost of production of every item, covered by the schedule, but I know that pig iron can be bought in the United States for £ 5 per ton, whereas it costs £ 1 1 per tan in Australia, and that, in the United States, steel can be bought for £8 per ton, while it costs £ 1 6 10s. per ton here. that big difference between the two countries in the price of pig iron? the honourable member glorying in aji attempt to pull to pieces an argument based on the fact that pig iron can be produced in America 100 per; cent, cheaper than in Australia, but he would rather have men at work in America producing pig iron at £ 5 per ton than provide employment in Australia in the production of pig iron at £ 1 1 per ton. I do not think that the Minister is afraid of the Senate. We have spent years in trying to encourage the manufacture of these implements in Australia. This very duty has really made history in the Commonwealth. Y e t , after all our trouble, we are now told that, despite the increase of prices all round, the local manufacturers can do with a duty of £ 2 less per machine. more to-day than it did in earlier days, and so does wheat; in fact, every article the farmer produces. When the Country party persist in parading their increased costs of production, let them not forget the fact that the people of Australia have cheerfully been paying Is. I d. and Is. 2d. per 4-lb. loaf of bread, and that they in turn are expected to submit cheerfully to the higher charges of which they are so frequently complaining. now eating butter at half the cost of production. produced within; the last few weeks has been so enormous that the factories can scarcely handle it. The natural consequence has been a reduction in the price of butter. I am told that the price the grazier gets for his stock is below the cost If the of production, but as the consumers are not getting any advantage from that fact, some one else must be getting «it. Possiblyi t is the middlemen and profiteers who range themselves at election times alongside honourable members opposite. Prices all round have increased by 70 per cent, and even 80 per cent., and yet we are asked to believe that at the present time a £10 duty is as good as an £8 duty in days gone by. I do not know why the Minister has put forward such a contention. I doubt if the Corner party ever hoped for such a reduction. How is it that a Minister, who has been patted W h y should there be on the back for being so strong in his Protectionist proclivities, should now go back upon that great strength of mind he displayed in the earlier stages of the I can well imagine consideration of the Tariff? If I am permitted to address a question to him, will he tell me why he has done this?

Whilst reapers and binders became dutiable on 1st January, 1921, the hay rakes and mowers did not become dutiable until the. 1st July, 1921. It was intended by the amendment which the Senate has requested us to make that the metal parts of hay rakes should be dutiable only as from 1st J u l y ; but the form of words used does not carry, out that intention. I am asking that the request be so amended as to give effect to the real intention of the Senate. I move That the requested amendment be made, with the following modification:-Omit sub-item (D), and insert the following:(D) Metal parts, n.e.i., of(1) Reapers and binders, on and after 25th March, 1920, ad val., British, free; intermediate, 5 per per cent.; general, 10 per cent.

It will be seen that we are not proposing to interfere with the rates that were passed by this Committee and another place, but are making the necessary adjustments as to the dates on which they shall apply. like to know from the Ministeri f it is possible to protect the farmer from misrepresentation in regard to duplicate parts. The duplicate parts that are made from ' the imported hay rakes, reapers and binders, and mowersare generally fashioned of splendid material, and give great satisfaction; but I myself have purchased parts for reapers and binders which have been represented to be i m As the item was ported parts, and which I have discovered by the manner in which they have worn were locally made. This has been acknowledged by the person who sold them to me, after a complaint had been made to him about them, and substantiated.

On one occasion I purchased fingers for the carrying device on the Woods reaper and binder, which were represented to be imported but were locally made. agent of the imported machine? that in many cases duplicate parts made in Australia are sold to the farmers as imported parts, and the farmers are charged for them as if they were imported parts. They thus pay an exorbitant amount for them, and often get a very poor article into the bargain. Can anything be done to prevent that? for Trade and Customs) [10.18] -The Commonwealth has not the power to legislate for the sale of goods within Australia, or to lay down the conditions under which articles should be sold, but the State Parliaments can legislate to prevent articles from being sold under false trade descriptions. Whether there are State laws which should prevent what the honourable member complains of, I cannot say. would be for the manufacturers abroad to put their trade mark on each part sent here. tralian manufacturers to do the same.

This duty is intended to apply to a simple trap which can be made almost by anybody, and a heavy duty on it will prevent the destruction of for the spring. D o the opponents of the the vermin. I support the amendment. the amendment will be carried. this item was before the Committee previously, I spoke at some length regarding the devastation caused by rabbits in the States with which I am familiar. There is no doubt that it is necessary to attack only by dogs and shooting. As a'matter that pest by every means a.t our disposal -traps , guns, dogs, poison, wire netting. I submit that without the combination of the wire netting and the trap'we can hardly check the pest. I suggest that the protection proposed of 20, 25. and 30 per cent, is quite absurd for a. rabbit trap. It is an absurd protection, which no member of the Committee will say is necessary. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) has correctly said that any blacksmith could make these traps; therefore, their manufacture cannot be dignified with the name of an industry. Of all the duties we have been"" asked to agree to, this on rabbit traps is the most unreasonable, having regard to the necessity for providing all possible means of destroying vermin. If the arguments of honourable members who are in favour of a reduction of the duties-were correct it would not matter if the duty were 100 per cent., because every blacksmith in the country would be making rabbit traps. The fact is that a special steel is required for the springs, and at the invitation of this Parliament the best makers in the world are now manufacturing these traps in Australia, and they are entitled to a little protection, as is any firm which is induced to establish its business here. trust that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wakefield will be carried. . In various parts of Australia the rabbit pest has been the means of driving many good pioneers off the land. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) has argued that the additional duty will not mean very much extra expense to the farmer, but I sa> that it will not mean a very great addition to the returns of the manufacturer. [496] Any ordinary blacksmith could make rabbit traps, but it would not pay him to do so. There is waste material in every iron foundry in Australia which could be utilized for this purpose, and there is no need to utilize a special quality of steel amendment know what rabbit traps cost per dozen at the present time? In the When southern portions of Western Australia the rabbit pest is very serious at certaintimes of the year. Some honourable members tell us that we should use poison, and: others say that the pest can be coped with of fact, it is necessary to use both poison) and rabbit traps. A t certain seasons ©ff the year trapping is ineffective. H a d the people who were driven off the land in New South Wales and Queensland treated the rabbit pest scientifically as it is now being treated, they would still be on their holdings. If this duty of 10 per cent, is imposed we shall add 2s. in the £ 1 to the cost of' rabbit traps to the farmer, because we know that every time a. duty is imposedon any commodity somebody has to pay for it . No t only the manufacturer, but also the consumer, should get a fair deal. The honourable member for Newcastle has given the Committee no idea, of the local cost of production. On the other hand, the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) told the Committee on a former, occasion what rabbit traps are costing the users. I accept his definite information, and I have personal knowledge of the effect of the rabbits in a portion of Australia. If the Government wish to do anything to foster the manufacture of rabbit traps, let them give a bounty for every trap locally made, but if they place a further impost on the users of these traps they will be acting unfairly. B y wiping outthese duties the Committee will be doing only a f a i r thing to people who have been on the land for many years under adverse conditions, and are at last beginning to do a little good for themselves. If they are prevented from further helping themselves by the extermination of rabbits, they w ill have to leave the land, and Australia will then have even fewer people in the back country than we have now. This is a question which particularly affects the. remoter districts of Australia. I should be glad if , even at this",70,Chairman Hon J M Tion Is An Irritation To Those Unfortunate

422,Mr Poynton,"5. The roll was compiled by the Darwin Town Council, to whom the new franchise conditions were duly communicated several weeks prior to the closing of the roll. Whilst only three days elapsed between the public notification issued by the,council and the closing oi the roll it is not a fact that only three days were allowed for enrolment. The greater portion of the enrolment under the new provisions of the law WHB effected prior to the public notification. It is not considered that the shortness of the notice was a cause of disfranchisement. 6. The information I have received indicates that, since the passage of the new Ordinance, conditions in Darwin have assumed a much more peaceful aspect than hitherto, and that, in particular, there has been a marked improvement in the handling of ships' cargoes. 7.

The same number of men will be employed on the wharf, and they will work the same hours as previously, but the number of men to be employed in the Borting shed will be reduced to four or six, who will work ordinary railway hours.
