The first is Carrum Downs Football Club. I attended the Carrum Downs Football Club presentation night a few weeks ago. This club is not very old and has not yet found its feet on the playing field. It has not won very many games over its few years but, off the field, this is a very impressive club. I was particularly impressed by the commitment every person at the presentation night has to the club and to each other. I am talking about the players, the coaches, the team managers, the partners and, indeed, all of those associated with the club. The presentation night was a very busy night, and the highlight was the best and fairest awards for the reserves and the senior team. The winner of the best and fairest for the reserves was Chris Rodrigues, with Sean O’Toole and Jason Villis coming in second and third. The best and fairest award for the seniors was won by two men-Colin Gough and Brett Kidman. I have known Colin for a long time, and it was really good to be able to present him with his award. The second extraordinary club I want to talk about is the Seaford Junior Football Club. This club held their presentation ceremony one Sunday morning a few weeks ago. The morning they chose was actually Father’s Day, and there were still literally hundreds of people in attendance, which is in itself a tribute to the club. It was a fine demonstration of the place this club holds with all these families. Seaford fields 16 teams and has over 350 players on its books, with ages ranging from seven to 16 years. It was quite moving to watch the older players receiving their last awards as players at this club, knowing that they had to move on next year to a senior club. Some of those players had been with the club since they were six or seven years old. The presentation ceremony was very efficiently run by President Garry Woolard, and I was privileged to be asked to present the award to the player voted most courageous. This award went to a young man, Aaron Miller. I again congratulate Aaron. The third extraordinary club I want to talk about is the Mordialloc Women’s Football Club. This club is very new. It started in 2001 with two young ladies-Natalie Cardamone and Stacey Lovell-who had both played with another club but wanted to start a women’s club in the Mordialloc area. After talking to lots of people, Natalie and Stacey found enough women to field a team in 2002. They found two senior players in the club who were prepared to take on the role of coaches and a trainee. Local business Light Alloy Engineering of Mordialloc became the sponsor of the team. The team played in the third division last year and did not lose a game. This year, the team moved up to second division and were runners-up in their first year in this division. Clearly this is a very extraordinary club, and I am looking forward to presenting it with a sport achievement certificate at its presentation night this coming Friday. Education: University of Western Sydney Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (9.43 a.m.)-I congratulate the member for Isaacs on her footy teams, but nothing comes close to the Penrith Panthers’ win last Sunday in the NRL grand final.

340,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 9.40 A.m.,"those clubs that she mentioned may enjoy similar success. It has taken the Panthers a long time to do it twice, and the town is truly celebrating-and will be for this week. But something far more important in the scheme of things in Penrith is the education of our young people. Sport will inspire us, but education is the critical thing which will help our many young people move forward. I believe that something is terribly wrong in the administration and HR departments of the University of Western Sydney. In recent years we have seen depart from the university Professor C. Duke, Professor J. Falk, Professor G. Bailey, Professor G. White, G. Browne, M. Wilson, K. Freemantle, A. Barlow, S. Rawlings, R. Bowerman, M. Charlton, D. Kelly, J. Dennis, H. Tindall, P. Seers, Professor J. Walker, Professor D. Barr, Professor G. Alcorn, R. Jackson, J. Noak, J. O’Brien, M. Fernandez, L. Ligertwood, Professor J. Clarke, Professor B. Carey, Professor B. Mackenzie, L. Benton, G. Baldwin, L. Gray, M. McCormick, J. Poulson, V. Conrick, S. O’Keefe, S. Randall, Professor C. Ewan, L. Poolman, Professor G. Gray and J. Steele. And that is just the list I have been able to compile. I know that there are many more, and I know that there are confidentiality agreements around a lot of those departures and that there are a number of reasons that, to me, suggest very bad HR management. These people have gone on to extraordinary positions elsewhere, yet the University of Western Sydney could not accommodate them. A teaching department at US Penrith has spent tens of thousands of dollars on casual staff in the 2002-03 financial year. Why was that necessary when there was a full complement of full-time staff in that department? How many days have been claimed on stress leave over the past five years and, in particular, over the last three years? Why is it necessary to have an increase in stress leave in an organisation such as US? All of that evidence aside, this is the style of the emails that I am getting in my office: Dear Jackie, I read the article in today’s Telegraph about US and can I say a big thankyou for exposing US’s complete lack of organisational skills in dealing with courses and timetabling. The uni seems to be too busy in fighting the government about funding cuts to focus on their own inefficient use of money and organisational skills. If these payouts are correct, an enormous amount of money is going astray here. The email continues: This is my first year at US and I am extremely disappointed in how the uni runs, so much so I am considering transferring to another uni next year. Both semesters have had major problems with timetabling with scheduling a lecture at 8am and having one tutorial at 5-7pm on a Friday! No consideration is taken into account for students travelling. (Time expired) Chief Executive Officers: Payment Fortune magazine April 2003, made some valid points about CEOs having no shame. In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote: But the pigs were so clever they could think a way around every difficulty. That certainly is an apt quote for failed CEOs.

341,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (9.46 A.m.),"Some CEOs have no shame. Jerry Useem, indeals by failed CEOs in the United States. Dick Brown from EDS served for four years and got a pension valued at $US19.6 million. Mike Armstrong from AT&T served five years and got a pension worth $US17.4 million. Gary Wendt from Conseco served for two years and got a pension valued at $US17.3 million, despite the company going bankrupt in 2002. Interestingly, his pension was paid by a solvent subsidiary. As Orwell said, the pigs are clever! Stephen Wolf from US Airways served for six years and received $US15 million in pension at the same time that pilots’ pensions were cut. Leo Mullin from Delta served for five years and got $US11.5 million as pension cuts were applied to workers. Celen Tilton from UAL served for six months and got $US4.5 million three months before UAL filed for a chapter 11. What about the situation in Australia? Take as an example two big Australian companies, Telstra and Qantas, which so many Australians have a stake in. Telstra plans to sack 5,000 IT staff, both direct and contracted employees, while outsourcing their work overseas. Taking into account Telstra’s profit of $A3.6 billion in 2002-03 and Ziggy’s salary being increased by $1.5 million to $7 million, with performance components and options, isn’t that a bit rich? And what about Qantas? Qantas plans to reduce its overall labour force and to bring its percentage of casuals from eight per cent to 25 per cent in 18 months. Some 2,000 staff were laid off in April 2003 at a redundancy cost of $120 million. Geoff Dixon, on a $3 million salary package, missed a performance based bonus in April of $1 million as Qantas’s profit fell from $429 million to $343 million-poor Geoff! But One.Tel, with 1,400 employees, really took the pigs’ top prize. However, there are other challengers, and in future speeches I will point them out. Investors downgraded One.Tel stock when they found out that $7.5 million in salary and bonuses paid to each of the two directors had not been disclosed. In addition, 19 executives were paid $23.6 million, leading to a $138 million half year loss. The One.Tel employees-the people who actually do the work-were on average paid $28,000 each a year under contract. That says it all. That says it all about the failed CEO class in this country as well. Other companies worthy of investigation include Franklins, HIH, Impulse, Ansett, BHP, Tabcorp, Lend Lease, Suncorp Metway, AMP, Southcorp, Coles Myer, National Textiles and Oakdale Coal Mines. (Time expired) Telstra: Privatisation question of the privatisation of Telstra. I guess I have made my feelings very plain, not just in this House but in a previous life with the New South Wales Farmers Association. The one thing that has always come out is that the issue is not really who owns Telstra but what services it provides. My support for the sale is dependent, as is the support of my colleagues and the government, on quite a few things, one of which is the implementation of all 39 recommendations of the Estens report. Until those things have been carried forward, until broadband has been fully laid out and until the service guarantees are utilised, we are not going to sell Telstra. A Senate inquiry was recently held in Dubbo. I was not informed about it until about four days before it was held. Having a previous engagement with the finance and audit committee looking into security at airports, I could not be there. It was very disappointing to see the Independents in particular not wanting to address the real issues of Telstra but simply beating this up as something to have a go about in the media. I know there are a lot of country people MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Statements By Members
342,Mr John Cobb (Parkes) (9.49 A.m.),"I have spoken several times in this House on thewho have concerns about it, but they listen when you sit them down and explain to them how we can regulate a privatised industry, how we can fine it if it steps outside the guidelines and how the oversight committee for the government looking into Telstra’s performance can recommend to government that we may have to tighten parts of the legislation to enable Telstra to be fined $10 million every time it steps out of line. Those things are happening, and Telstra will not be fully privatised until we are totally satisfied about them. Future proofing and community service obligations are the things we are trying to deal with to provide a service for New South Wales, for Australia and for country people. We are not simply trying to play cheap politics about it as the Independents are. As I have said before in this House, I am more concerned about looking after country people, whether they are my direct constituents or not. I have previously made an offer to the Independents that they can bring any of the concerns they have before the oversight committee, and I make it again: if they want to bring those concerns to me, I will endeavour to make sure they are dealt with. And that is the issue-thus far they have not come near me once on them, which must lead you to believe they are far more interested in politics than in trying to serve their constituents. (Time expired) Electorate of Capricornia: Yeppoon Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (9.52 a.m.)-This morning I would like to speak about the town of Yeppoon in my electorate. Yeppoon is a very special part of the electorate of Capricornia. It is a beautiful little seaside town on the Capricorn Coast, and at the moment there is a battle for the heart and soul of that town. There is a southern developer who has found a loophole in the Livingstone Shire Council’s planning by-laws, and that southern developer is taking advantage of that loophole to seek to go ahead with plans to build a 12-storey unit complex on the esplanade running across the front of the beach at Yeppoon. As those people who have been to Yeppoon will know-and I know the shadow minister for regional development was there recently-it is a very traditional Australian seaside town. That is something the local residents are very proud of and something they are very keen to preserve because, as you hear from many people in Yeppoon, we do not want Yeppoon to become another Gold Coast. We want to preserve its special character, and the building right on the beachfront of a 12-storey unit complex, completely unlike the buildings around it, will destroy that special character that Yeppoon now has. The community are really up in arms about this, as you would expect. This is their town, and they do not want some southern developer coming in and telling them how their town is going to look and progress in the future. There was a strong statement about how the community feels about this project a couple of months ago. About 2,000 people marched through the main street of Yeppoon for a rally to send to the Livingstone Shire Council and the developer-the proponent of this project-a very clear message: ‘We don’t want this. This is our town. We like it the way it is. We see the value in how it is right now and we don’t want this 12-storey development imposed on us, as it will potentially spoil the special character of our town.’ I congratulate the Livingstone Shire Council for listening to the residents. The Livingstone Shire Council is taking up the fight against the developer in the planning and development court, and a decision is pending on that action. The Livingstone Shire Council has also undertaken extensive community consultation on the issue of building heights and the issue of MAIN COMMITTEE where the residents want to take the town of Yeppoon, and development in Yeppoon, in the future. I am firmly on the side of the local residents in this, and I hope that the character of Yeppoon is preserved. (Time expired) Farrer Electorate: Latipsoh Day Ms LEY (Farrer) (9.55 a.m.)-TodayI stand here to speak about an extremely worthwhile local fundraiser for hospitals in my area called Latipsoh Day. ‘Latipsoh’ is ‘hospital’ spelt backwards. The total amount of funds raised in 2003 was over $120,000, which was an enormous effort for a local initiative. This year I was privileged to open the day officially. It is a day that gives people a real opportunity to contribute in a tangible way to their own local hospital. Latipsoh Day was launched on 10 July 2003. This day highlights the importance of community support to keep services viable. The day has a Mexican theme, with hospital and WAW Credit Union staff decked out in colourful T-shirts and sombreros. It is an initiative of WAW Credit Union and also Telstra Country Wide, which jointly sponsor the appeal. One hundred per cent of donations go to 11 hospitals. Each hospital undertakes many fundraising activities, such as raffles, bike rides, dances, dinners, cake stalls et cetera to help keep the fundraising going. WAW has weekly meetings in the lead-up to Latipsoh Day to allow for a coordination of fundraising efforts. Latipsoh Day provides a wonderful vehicle for them to raise money. The community recognises that these individual hospital activities are good opportunities for them, and the hospitals use the proceeds to directly pay for much-needed equipment in their particular facility. It may not be essential equipment, but it is the sort of equipment that makes staff and patients’ lives a lot easier. Local businesses have really warmed to the event and this year contributed close to $28,000. The coordination of the day is undertaken internally at WAW Credit Union, Telstra and the hospitals. The concept of Latipsoh Day has the structure and attractiveness to be a long-term hospital fundraiser-based on the Good Friday Appeal, which of course has an 80year history-and we look forward to it continuing to gain community support and continuing to send a positive message about sustaining health services in the area. To the thousands of groups, individuals and businesses that contributed go our sincere thanks. A special thank you goes to WAW Credit Union and Telstra Country Wide members, who made such an unprecedented contribution. In a year of major bushfires and drought, the local communities around Albury Wodonga have managed to find another $21,152 on top of last year’s effort to take the tally for the second year of Latipsoh Day to over $120,000. In what we thought would be a tough year, the concept of Latipsoh Day seems to be working, as the communities continue to support their local health services. Last year we collected just short of $100,000 and this year we increased that by 20 per cent. If we can continue to build this fundraising effort, we will go a long way in raising awareness and sustaining crucial services. Last year, hospitals used the funds collected to purchase electric beds, a mobility scooter, new computers and a reverse cycle heating unit plus new equipment for a paediatrics ward. The idea of the day was born from the staff focus group in WAW. The Telstra Country Wide and WAW teams are passionate about helping regional hospitals. Again, I congratulate all those involved. der 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded. MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Statements By Members
343,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),"Order! In accordance with standing orSecond Reading Debate resumed from 27 March, on motion by Mr Anderson: That this bill be now read a second time. position’s support for the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003 in its amended form. In doing so, however, I intend to move an amendment to the second reading to identify the Minister for Transport and Regional Services’ failings with respect to aviation policy in Australia generally. The minister does not have an aviation policy; instead, he is running this portfolio through a disjointed series of decisions and directions, leaving the industry always secondguessing the next step. There is no integrated approach to aviation policy in Australia, be it with the regulation of the industry or, importantly, the need to ensure with the provision of airport facilities that we have an integrated approach to transport policy in Australia. It is important to note that, without opposition intervention, this bill would have been unacceptable and would have been opposed in the Senate by the opposition. I remind the House that the minister has argued that this legislation would overcome the industry perception that CASA operates as judge, jury and executioner. However, without significant change to the operation of regulation 269(1)(a) of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988, that would not be the case. Without the amendment that the government has now agreed to, following detailed consultations with the opposition, the power to cancel a licence or authority without a proven charge would have been retained. So far as we are concerned, that would have been unacceptable. We believe that that power was unnecessary and would have sat like a black cloud over the industry. It was also important that regulation 268 be deleted. That was delivered not on a promise that it would be deleted but as a result of this bill. To be fair, the minister listened to the opposition in the industry, and he agreed to amendments that would address our joint concerns. The new government amendments are not the only reflection that the minister has listened and learned from the opposition with respect to sound aviation policy reforms. In this respect, I point to the fact that this bill picks up and implements a commitment made by the opposition, in the lead-up to the 2001 election, to remove the CASA board and, in doing so, to make the Minister for Transport and Regional Services more directly accountable for aviation safety. Over too many parliaments, the relevant minister has had the capacity to hide behind the CASA board when things went wrong or when CASA was being criticised in the media. There was, to be fair, a school of thought that suggested that the minister was therefore capable of hiding from his or her responsibilities. I always adopted the view that if there was ever a major accident, regardless of the reasons or the nature of the accident or the structure of the CASA board, the minister would be held accountable by the parliament and the Australian community. In this context, the opposition believed that the minister might as well have the responsibility and the authority that goes with that inevitable accountability. In this way, the minister at least has some control over his or her-I dare say that, at some point in the future, we might get a female minister for transport-destiny. As I have indicated to the House, the opposition have long held the view that the CASA board is an unnecessary level of bureaucracy. All too often it has been used as an opportunity MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Statements By Members
344,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (9.59 A.m.),"This morning I rise to express the opto appoint mates-for the purpose of additional remuneration rather than being based on expertise with respect to the aviation industry. The board has the capacity to get between what the community expects and what should be delivered by CASA operating in accordance with the requirements and expectations of the aviation industry and the travelling public. The opposition have held the view that, whilst CASA must consult in a proper way with and involve the aviation industry in its operations and in forming its strategic directions, CASA must not be run or managed by the industry or be perceived to be run and managed by the industry. We must remember always that CASA is a safety regulator. It performs a critical role for the Australian public and for the travelling public; if it is not doing that job effectively, the government of the day will pay. The minister acknowledged in his second reading speech to this bill that, whilst he remains publicly accountable for CASA’s performance, he lacks the necessary direct authority to improve its performance as he has general powers of direction only. This bill very clearly changes that. While CASA quite correctly will remain an independent regulator, the minister will now clearly and transparently be more responsible for its actions. We believe that the transparency issue is important because it is, if anything, the check and balance to ensure that the minister is influencing CASA’s performance in an appropriate way and for the right reasons. It is necessary to ensure that the minister’s involvement and direction relate to improved safety outcomes and not to looking after mates, as we have seen in recent times in other policy areas such as fuel and ethanol policy. The record shows that the coalition government did not advocate the policy to improve CASA’s governance arrangements at the 2001 election. Labor did, and we are pleased that this governance reform has now been adopted and will become law with the passage of this bill. I would also like to acknowledge, for the record, that Labor’s support for the removal of the board is not an indictment on board members past or present, although I have correctly reflected on the fact that, in some instances, I have questioned whether or not some people were the best persons for appointment to that board, based on a proper understanding of the aviation industry. It is also important that we do not forget that it was the last federal Labor government that initiated the current structure when CASA was formed in July 1995. It was right to establish CASA, as the regulator, separate-and we should never forget this-from the service provider functions such as air traffic control, the construction and maintenance of the national airway systems in aviation, and fire and rescue services. The structure was an appropriate one at the time for the new organisation, but I believe that time and experience have shown that further improvement could be made by these government changes. On behalf of the opposition, I express my appreciation to all those who have served on the CASA board for their time and commitment. With regard to the government’s instructional arrangements for CASA, there is also a question about whether these reforms go far enough. CASA remains, unfortunately, both the writer of the aviation safety laws and regulations, and the enforcer. The investigator role is quite correctly separate from CASA. There remains an active policy question-one that we must all give some consideration to-about the efficacy of one organisation both writing and enforcing the rules. The same question remains alive with respect to aviation and maritime security. In that case, we have the Department of Transport and Regional Services writing the rules, enMAIN COMMITTEE forcing the rules and investigating breakdowns in the rules with no transparency at all. In essence, the department presents itself as the jack-of-all-trades on aviation security but unfortunately, I believe, it is the master of none. These are important debates for another day, but they must not be ignored by the minister. This bill must not be the start and finish of aviation regulation reform, especially as it relates to governance issues for aviation security policy and its enforcement and delivery. The bill also implements far-reaching changes to CASA’s aviation safety enforcement and compliance role and responsibilities. A new automatic stay of CASA decisions that do not involve a serious and imminent air safety risk will be a breath of fresh air for the industry. It is something that is welcomed generally. If the industry operator applies for a review of the decision, then the stay will remain in place for either 90 days or until the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision comes into operation. There are, quite correctly, avenues to extend the stay in certain circumstances. If the operator does not seek a review of the decision, the stay lapses at the end of the fifth business day. The bill also introduces stronger and fairer provisions in cases that involve a serious and imminent risk to air safety. The law as proposed will prohibit an operator from engaging in conduct that constitutes, contributes to or results in a serious or imminent risk to air safety. The act will therefore provide for the immediate suspension of all authorisations under the act and regulations. This is different from the status quo: when an air operator’s certificate is suspended under the act, all other authorisations are suspended under regulation 268. In fact, regulation 268 is now not required and, as I said earlier, the minister has now agreed to amend the bill to delete this regulation. When CASA suspends an authorisation because of serious or imminent risk to air safety, it must seek an exclusion order from the Federal Court within five business days of the decision, or the suspension lapses. The Federal Court will be required to hear both parties and issue the exclusion order if it is satisfied there are reasonable grounds to believe the operator is breaching or likely to breach the new prohibition on activities that pose a serious or imminent risk to air safety. The effect of the exclusion order is to restrain the authorisation holder from engaging in conduct that without authorisation would be harmful. The bill contains appropriate time limits and rights to apply for extensions for the parties, while keeping-correctly so-the pressure on CASA to demonstrate its allegation or leave it alone. When CASA takes the next step to issue the show cause notice, again specific time limits apply. The system proposed will, prima facie, apply more clarity, transparency and natural justice to CASA’s operations and decision making. It is about transparency and accountability. If it applies as planned and as agreed, this is a change that is fully welcomed by the industry. I also note that the bill introduces a demerit points scheme that is based on the New South Wales system that applies to car-driving licences. In general, it will also apply to offences against the regulations. The penalty for each offence will also be specified in the regulations, and each operator’s status will be monitored in a demerit points register. At the end of the day, in accordance with the rules applying to this system, an authorisation holder can therefore have their licence suspended. To be honest, whilst it might appear at first glance to be a fairly convoluted system and its benefits might seem questionable, I am hopeful that this will actually be of tremendous assistance to the industry. It is welcomed by some in the industry, especially small operators and MAIN COMMITTEE private pilots, and therefore the opposition is prepared to give it a go. It is now the responsibility of the industry and the regulator to prove that this is the best way forward. If it is proven that it is not appropriate then we are back to the drawing board to try to work out what weaknesses might come into play as a result of its application. I also note that there are still issues to be resolved, such as the industrial relations impact if, for example, a small-aircraft maintenance engineer loses all their points and has their licence suspended. There will be, rightly, questions about their future and the extent to which any violation of the regulation has been as a result of employer demands. I am also interested to see how it will apply in practice to the larger operators. The explanatory memorandum says that the scheme is largely non-discriminatory and non-discretionary-a self-executing system of dealing with repeat offenders. In my view the simplicity of the system will be believed when it is seen and proven to be capable of being operative in the industry. As I said, the opposition will not oppose the scheme. However, we will be interested to see if it can be effective in improving compliance. I hope so. The other two changes to CASA’s enforcement and compliance relate to a scheme of protection from action for voluntary reporting and a system of enforceable voluntary undertakings. The latter was first mooted in an earlier bill and was rejected by the opposition. I can confirm today that the necessary changes have been made to remove our earlier concerns and those of the aviation industry, whom we consult with regularly on these matters. The opposition, therefore, now supports the revised system of voluntary enforceable undertakings to help ensure more compliance with the aviation safety regime. The system of protection from administrative action for voluntary reporting protects an authorisation holder if they voluntarily disclose to a reporting body separate from CASA that they have committed a minor offence. It must be notified within 10 days of the misdemeanour and before receipt of any CASA communication on the matter. More information on this scheme will be forthcoming in the regulations, including the nature of the reporting body and the reportable contraventions. It is noted that the scheme is not intended to be a whistleblowing scheme and that the protection will only apply to the person who reports the contravention. That may be so, but perhaps it is some government acknowledgment of the need for, and it is at least a first step towards, proper whistleblowing provisions and protections to now be put in place. This scheme may also have significant use in furthering a ‘no blame’ approach to improving aviation safety outcomes. I think it is fair to note that, while some in the industry are sceptical that this proposed scheme is as good as the American system, the opposition will support the scheme and consider any changes to improve it if they emerge during the commencement and operation of the scheme. I now go to a second reading amendment, which I propose to move this morning. In doing so, I think it is exceptionally important that I remind the House that the government’s performance on aviation airport policy since 1996 has not been appropriate; if anything, it has been a disgrace. There are a litany of examples to demonstrate this-some of which I intend dealing with this morning. I believe that the Howard government does not have a national aviation policy or plan. Decisions are made in a disjointed, piecemeal way, with no overall constructive and comprehensive approach to aviation regulation and reform in Australia. That is unacceptable to the inMAIN COMMITTEE dustry, unacceptable to the Australian community and unacceptable to Australia as a nation. We need a safe and efficient aviation plan, a safe and efficient aviation system, because we as a nation need an aviation industry. We need an aviation policy setting that instils confidence, that says the government knows where it is going, that relies on a regulator that can be trusted and that has the confidence of the community, government and industry. The record shows that the minister has sat back and allowed this to not be the case for almost seven years. Today’s bill is the only genuine sign that the government has listened to the issues and concerns being raised by the industry, the opposition and the community. But that is not enough. Now the minister has decided, for today at least, that he will stay in the job. He must start listening to other calls for change with respect to aviation regulation and reform in Australia. Rather than playing politics, he must also listen to the opposition’s announcement that Badgerys Creek is no longer a suitable site for Sydney’s second airport. Instead of sniping from the side, he should use the resources of government to join with the opposition and the state government in a bipartisan way to identify a suitable second airport site in Sydney. In that way, he would put both the member for Lindsay and the member for North Sydney out of their misery. We have the member for Lindsay saying the airport will not be built at Badgerys whilst the party policy is that it will be built at Badgerys. The member for North Sydney is loudly reminding everyone that will listen-when he is not playing football-that it is current coalition policy to build the airport at Badgerys Creek, but quietly he also knows that the site is no longer suitable. It just suits his North Shore political representation duties. The minister for transport must do the right thing by Sydney and Australia and front up to the need for an integrated transport and urban development plan for Sydney. The minister cannot continue to mislead the public and he cannot continue to ignore the needs of our largest city. Part of that planning process must include the important future needs for general aviation in the Sydney region. I commend the Victorian government, as it did not wait for the federal government to do the job; it developed its own aviation plan for the Port Phillip region. Sydney, in a joint effort between the New South Wales government and the Commonwealth government, should follow the lead of the Victorian Labor government with respect to its response to the need for a proper aviation plan for the Port Phillip region. Instead of facing up to his responsibility for Sydney airports, the minister’s only plan for airports and urban aviation is to sell the general aviation airports. With no plan for its aviation heritage or future aviation uses, I also note, with respect to Port Phillip, that the Howard government is hocking Point Cook Airport. The Howard government does not have an aviation and airport plan or strategy for our major cities; it only has a strategy which is about a fire sale of assets without any consideration of the consequences of that sale on the operation of airports in our capital cities. These are important issues that the minister should take responsibility for. As we all appreciate, general aviation is important to Sydney and the aviation industry, but we have a minister who is not willing to work out an integrated general aviation plan for Sydney. He merely wants to hock Camden Park, Hoxton Park and Bankstown airports in a cash grab with no plan for their future operations. It is also interesting to note that, with respect to these sales, the minister has allowed the operators to avoid their responsibilities to develop master plans, as required by the act, in the lead-up to the sale of those airports. He has said that these plans will flow from the sale process rather than requiring the master plans to be MAIN COMMITTEE undertaken prior to the sales so that local communities know what is intended with regard to the operation of these airports. These important airports in Sydney and Melbourne and their future role will be in the hands of private sector buyers, not the government, the local communities or the affected aviation industry. I do not believe this is good enough, and I think it is about time the minister started listening and acting rather than merely being engaged in a cash grab with the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Treasurer and, more importantly, walking away from his responsibilities for aviation and airport policy in Australia. In the same way the minister must also bring forward his planned review of Sydney’s aviation needs. He must have independent, rigorous and current data and advice to hand when he considers the draft Sydney airport master plan, which will probably be handed to him on or about 31 December this year. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services will then have three months from 1 January 2004 to decide whether he supports or opposes the Macquarie Bank’s ambitions to double aircraft movements over Sydney over the next 20 years. Let us be plain about this: the master plan for Sydney is driven by the needs of Macquarie Bank, not the needs of the aviation industry and the Sydney community. If this review is not brought forward, I pose this question: how is the minister’s decision to have any credibility? Already the minister and the Prime Minister are close to the line in reported public comments expressing their support for the master plan before any independent, accountable and transparent government assessment has been made. I regard those comments as unacceptable in terms of accountability and independence of government decision making with regard to these matters. I suggest to the House that, with regard to the Sydney master plan, the government has gone very close to already expressing a predetermined view. That potentially raises questions about the master plan process in Sydney being challenged legally. The government can only redeem credibility by now bringing forward the 2005 review as part of this process. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services must also start listening on other important safety and security issues if he is to revive any credibility in this portfolio. The Airservices board have decided to close the terminal control units in Perth, Adelaide, Cairns and Sydney. They have ignored the Prime Minister’s announcement to spare Cairns and they have ignored the concerns about this action expressed by members on both sides of the chamber. The Airservices board made a decision to close the units and only gave ground on the time frame for electoral purposes. The minister should take these issues up and keep the control units open in all of those operating centres. I also do not accept the manner in which the minister is wiping his hands of responsibility on airspace reform. The record shows that the minister does not trust his own department and agencies charged with the legislative responsibility to design airspace to do their job. Instead, it has been outsourced to enthusiastic amateurs, for political reasons. The press in recent times has been full of industry concerns about the national airspace system reforms championed by an enthusiastic amateur, Mr Dick Smith, but the minister has sat idle and let it go. I believe the minister is ignoring the concerns of pilots, air traffic controllers and the airport owners, who are saying that the NAS has warts. Instead, we have a minister who is merely prepared to go along with what his mate Dick Smith tells him. This bill gets rid of the board of CASA to ensure more direct ministerial responsibility for aviation safety. It is time the minMAIN COMMITTEE ister considered, for the same reasons, getting rid of the Airspace Reform Group and making Airservices and CASA directly accountable to him for any changes he wants. I have sought to raise a number of serious issues today. I could go to a further range of issues going to the failure of the department to correctly act on previous Audit Office advice in terms of aviation security in Australia. There are also issues going to the need to make sure that proper security operates with regard to the operation of the Department of Transport and Regional Services-issues that I have raised in the House previously on a range of occasions. In conclusion, I simply say that, as a result of the amendments, the opposition is able to give support to the bill, as amended, today. This bill represents the outcome of a detailed endeavour by both sides of the House in close cooperation with the industry to get CASA right. On that basis we give our support. I will also move a second reading amendment which puts on the record our ongoing concerns as an opposition about the failure of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to take seriously his responsibilities for aviation reform and regulation in Australia. I only hope that, now he has decided to remain in the job as Minister for Transport and Regional Services, National Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister, he applies his mind to the job before him. I commend the second reading amendment to the House, and I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failure to match its promises in respect of air safety with comparable decisions, as demonstrated by its: (1) refusal to overturn a decision to close the air traffic control terminal control units in Perth, Adelaide, Cairns and Sydney; (2) failure to deliver an effective and rigorous aviation security regime for the travelling public and those living under flight paths, especially in regional Australia; (3) taking a great risk with the lives of the travelling public by outsourcing the design of Australian airspace to enthusiastic amateurs; and (4) approach to airservices which demonstrate, in the case of Bankstown, Hoxton Park, Camden and Point Cook airports, an approach which reveals a grab for cash, rather than a priority to aviation safety”. industry is important, both to our national economy and to our work force. Because of the physical size and geographic make-up of Australia, air transport is an essential factor not just to our business interests and our tourism industry but also to the very existence of regional Australia. Furthermore, our safety record is critical to the sense of security and confidence that Australians in general, and overseas visitors in particular, have in using aircraft in this country. Not only does the industry’s good safety record have to be apparent to the public, it also has to be perceived as an integral element of Australian air travel. Therefore, we need to ensure not only a safe industry but also that confidence in the mechanisms for guaranteeing safety is ongoing. The Howard government is committed not just to Australian air safety but also to having a world-class aviation regulator to ensure continuity of that safety.

346,Mr Hatton,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,179,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003
347,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (10.29 A.m.),"This government recognises that the civil aviationAs Minister Anderson said in his second reading speech on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003: ‘This bill represents a significant milestone in the implementation of the government’s aviation reform agenda.’ It reinforces the role of the Civil Aviation Safety AuthorityCASA-as Australia’s aviation safety regulator and introduces enforcement tools that better match the regulatory action to the seriousness of breaches of those regulations. The bill has two main purposes: firstly, to abolish the CASA board, retaining CASA itself as a statutory authority but under more direct ministerial control; and, secondly, to revise some of CASA’s investigatory and enforcement powers, providing it with a more effective range of tools so that the regulatory action can better match the seriousness of the breach-that is, to try to make the system better and fairer. Let us look at the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It was established in July 1995 as an independent statutory authority under the Civil Aviation Act 1988 with responsibilities that included the operation and safety of civil aviation in Australia and the promotion of high safety standards within the industry. CASA is currently governed by a board of seven directors appointed by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The board is responsible for strategic decision making but, unfortunately, over the years there have been a number of very public management controversies and personality conflicts within its membership. The Director of Aviation Safety, who is both chief executive officer and also a member of the board, has overall administrative and operational responsibility. This bill abolishes the CASA board and makes the Director of Aviation Safety directly accountableA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.33 a.m. to 10.46 a.m. and makes the Director of Aviation Safety directly accountable to the minister for CASA’s performance. The director will continue to be the CEO responsible for safety regulatory functions, but he or she will also have the added responsibility for matters such as the corporate plan and terms and conditions for staff. Currently, while the minister is publicly accountable for CASA’s performance, he only has general powers of direction. He has no direct authority for strategic planning or performance improvement. Under section 12 of the act, the minister may only give general directions to CASA regarding its performance of a regulatory function. Let me repeat that: currently, the minister, who is publicly accountable for CASA, can only give general directions to CASA regarding its regulatory functions. At least CASA must comply with such a section 12 direction. That is not the case under the current section 12A. Under section 12A, the minister may notify CASA of his or her views regarding an appropriate strategic direction, but CASA need only ‘take into account’ such notification. It need not heed it. So currently the board sets strategic directions. The minister, who is publicly accountable, can notify CASA of his views regarding those strategies, but CASA can decide to ignore his views if it wishes. Item 12 of this bill eliminates that discretion by CASA and requires it to ‘act in accordance’ with such a notification from the minister. The two new sections inserted into the act by item 13 of this bill give the minister stronger, more direct powers over CASA’s governance and accountability. Section 12C allows the minister to enter into a binding agreement with the director regarding the performance of CASA’s MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003
348,Mr Somlyay,"As I was saying before the division, this bill abolishes the CASA boardpowers and the execution of its functions. While such an agreement is likely to cover policy directions, priorities and performance standards, this section also carries a safeguard specifying that the minister cannot interfere or direct CASA in particular cases or with regard to an individual authorisation holder. That is an important point. On one hand, this bill empowers the minister to actually have input into strategies and policy directions for a statutory authority for which he is responsible; but, on the other hand, in the interests of fairness and justice, it also specifically forbids the minister from interfering in individual cases. This is yet another example of the Howard government working towards enhancing responsibility and justice in our legislative system. Section 12D provides the minister with a new and explicit power to direct CASA to report specified matters either to the minister or to the departmental secretary. This will ensure that the minister is informed of potential problems or sensitive issues so that action can be taken to deal with a matter before it escalates. It is hard to believe that currently the responsible minister cannot direct CASA to alert him or her to particular issues. In the interests of good administration and of good government, we seek to rectify this omission. The remainder of the bill introduces new enforcement measures and tools to assist CASA to enforce its regulations fairly and allow it to match the regulatory action to the seriousness of the breach. It is a risk based approach to safety management which gives CASA a range of options. These options include varying, suspending or cancelling aviation authorisations such as licences and air operator certificates. I note from the speech by the member for Batman, the shadow minister, that the opposition supports this bill and I thank the House. fore the House, which was moved by the shadow minister. It runs to four specific provisions, two of which I seek to speak to in particular: they are the third and fourth matters dealt with in our amendment, and they go to the questions of the safety of those people in the area surrounding Bankstown Airport and the regimes of airspace management and usage that this government would seek to bring in at the behest of Mr Dick Smith, who made a one-time donation of $1 million to the Liberal Party in 1996. I think he has finally got the access which I think he originally sought to get from the minister. As the shadow minister pointed out, having an enthusiastic amateur determine the airspace requirements and regulations for general aviation throughout the whole of Australia is not the best approach. I would have thought that, in a case where there is an open declaration of support for the government and where there is a significant donation of $1 million, the government would have been wise, which they have not been of course, and would have been without gall, which they have not been of course, not to directly give over effective responsibility in the civil aviation area to just one man-albeit that he is very good at marketing himself, albeit that he is very good at cloaking himself in the Australian flag to flog all sorts of different products. The safety of Australian citizens should not be bought for what is, effectively, the cheap price of a $1 million donation made to the then opposition; it should not be bought at the cost of all of those people who are affected by general and civil aviation in this country. Ask any of the professional pilots flying for Qantas or Virgin-or those who used to fly for Ansett-and I think you will get a pretty quick response about their attitude towards having civil aviation safety in this country determined by just one man, a man outside the formal structures of responsibility. They knew what the situation was when he was put into a position MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003
349,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (10.50 A.m.),"I am happy to have seconded the amendment beof responsibility. They know the enormous problems that occurred for the industry and for the government when just one man was put above all others and his obsessions were allowed to run government policy. Where is the minister for transport and aviation with regard to these matters? He is relaxed about it. He is not particularly concerned about it. He takes into account the representations made by significant people in the general aviation community but thinks that they are going on a bit too much about it. These are matters of ultimate concern to those people, whose lives could be affected because just one man outside the normal course of government responsibility can have his particular approach imposed on everyone else. I think it is completely and utterly reprehensible that the safety and security of our flying passengers, on regular services and also on our GA services in the Sydney basin in particular, are being put at risk because there is a government that is so weak-kneed and so determined to give in to people who are close to them-people who have, effectively, bought their way in by donation-that we end up with the kind of propositions we have in this Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003. Given the disasters there have been over the years, you would think that-just possiblysome things might have been worse, but they have not been. Hence, the third part of the amendment we have put forward, in which the House condemns the government for: (3) taking a great risk with the lives of the travelling public by outsourcing the design of Australian airspace to enthusiastic amateurs … As the shadow minister was happy to name him, I am happy and willing to name him as well. It is irresponsible to do this. Any government charged with aviation safety and security in Australia should not have taken this course. People can have their whims, their desires and their drives and, normally, they can be listened to-a bit of a nod, ‘That’s interesting’, ‘We are taking that into account’, and all that sort of stuff. Normally, you would not see it sanctified as government policy. It is just not good enough to effectively genuflect to the power of a person’s capacity to market themselves as someone who is all about Australia and Australia’s interests. I think it is reprehensible, it should not have been done and it is about time this government stopped doing it. The fourth part of the amendment we have put forward reads: … the House condemns the Government for its failure to match its promises in respect of air safety with comparable decisions, as demonstrated by its: … … … (4) approach to airservices which demonstrate, in the case of Bankstown, Hoxton Park, Camden and Point Cook airports, an approach which reveals a grab for cash, rather than a priority to aviation safety”. What is at the core of this? Bankstown Airport is at the geographical centre of Sydney. I know because it is in my electorate, which is in the geographical centre of Sydney. Bankstown Airport has had up to 400,000 movements a year. Over the last few years, that number has declined; we went back to about 350,000 and at one point back to about 280,000. All things being equal, if the government had had its way, as of 13 December 2000 the very safety, security and certainty of all of the 180,000 people who live in Bankstown, including the 83,000 constituents that I have in Blaxland, in the top half of the city of Bankstown, and the 83,000 constituents in the electorate of Banks, in the bottom half of the city of Bankstown-and the member for Banks will be following me in this debate-and the people in electorates bounding ours, such as the electorate of Fowler, would have been put at risk beMAIN COMMITTEE cause this government was determined to bring regular passenger services to Bankstown Airport. It wanted to make Bankstown Airport Sydney’s second airport. This is a government that put Max Moore-Wilton in charge of the Sydney Airport Corporation-the person who rode shotgun with the Prime Minister in Prime Minister and Cabinet. Maybe Max got the job himself-who knows?-but he is running it in his own inimitable way. The Sydney Airport Corporation advise, ‘We don’t think much needs to happen here until 2010, 2015 or maybe 2020. We don’t think the demand is so great. Just because the numbers that’ll use Sydney airport will triple in the coming years, we don’t think all that much needs to be changed; we can accommodate a bit more. There are more wide-bodied aircraftthe A300s and A380s are being bought from Europe. We’ll expand the runways a bit, we’ll deepen them a bit and we’ll make sure that General Holmes Drive is covered off. We can take all that capacity. Don’t worry about it. If we need to do a bit more, we’ll do it here and there.’ This government is determined to follow through on what we started with the Airports Act 1996, leasing airports Australia wide. The Australian Labor Party have gone full circle on that: the shadow minister has announced that, if we come to government and it is still possible for us not to, we will not sell Bankstown, Hoxton Park or Camden airports as a job lot, as this government seeks to do before the end of this year. There is no fundamental, structured, government-endorsed business and management plan for this airport. As the shadow minister has put forward in argument, there is no general transport plan for the whole of Sydney. This is a government that is clueless when it comes to the transport demands of the four-million-plus people who are in the Sydney basin. Those people’s demands in terms of road, rail and air traffic have been left to whatever state responsibilities are there. Apart from a few flicks here and there from the transport minister about what might happen with improving the rail corridor for freight, there has been no concerted effort, no concerted plan, no determination whatsoever. On 13 December 2000 this government said it wanted Bankstown Airport to effectively become Sydney’s second airport. It considered that Bankstown Airport could become the overflow airport. It considered that aircraft of up to 737 capacity or maybe more-767s or possibly even higher than that-should run into Bankstown Airport and use an airport where they had mandated that the runways had to be lengthened, deepened and strengthened. The effect of that was that, instead of having three runways, as we have now for general aviation, we would have had to have one jetway at Bankstown Airport. In 1949 a committee was charged with working out what the international airport and major domestic airport for Sydney would be. It had the sense to realise that Bankstown was not the place to put an international airport. Years later the minister for territories, I think it was, made the announcement last year that they had given up on the idea that Bankstown Airport should be the overflow airport and given up on the idea that there should be any specific provisions demanded of the people who buy this airport. There is no safety and no security whatsoever for the people of Bankstown in how the government have handled aviation safety or aviation planning and provision. We do not know what they will rule in and rule out for the future. I do know that Bankstown is right in the centre of Sydney-at its geographical heart. It is 22 kilometres, or 13 miles in the old measurement, to the general post office, but it is only nine kilometres to Kingsford Smith airport. MAIN COMMITTEE WhatI do know is that, if it had not been geographically impossible, they would have put regular traffic transport into Bankstown Airport, and damn the consequences. They wanted to pump it up with capacity, move the regionals to there and, laughably, thought that when the M5 was finished people could motor from Bankstown into KSA to interconnect in a quick 20-minute trip. If you do it at 3 a.m. it is possible, but if you go at peak hour from Bankstown Airport to KSA you have to allow an hour and a half. I know, I drive it. It is a longer journey now than it has ever been. The alternative is that, when you have to do it, you go the old way. You miss the total congestion that the M5 is-the road that was supposed to fix the transport problems of south-west Sydney. The motorway is a complete joke. It should have had an extra lane. It certainly should have a regulated single speed, and you need some psychological distance so that people will treat it as a normal road. We probably should also prohibit trucks coming from, in particular, east to west, because they slow the whole process down. That is an artery that does not work. That makes it unlikely that any government, even one as dumb as this government is, might actually reconsider the whole process of trying to lump a second airport at Bankstown. There is safety and security in that. The other element of safety and security is provided by geographical proximity. We are too close to Kingsford Smith. There is a stub of an east-west runway at Kingsford Smith that stops any government-even a government as full of gall and guile as this government isfrom imposing regular passenger transport out of Bankstown. The simple reality is that there might be two parallel runways running north and south but, as long as that east-west stub is there and has to be kept in operation to be used in difficult wind and weather conditions, that means safety for the people of Bankstown. There have been arguments that the people of Bankstown could be wiped out by jet passenger transport. I said on 13 December 2000, when this idiotic government presented this proposal to effectively turn Bankstown into the second airport for Sydney, that it was a dumb and crazy scheme that was incapable of operation. I said that they would put through the hoops more than 500,000 people in the area while they attempted to put it into place. They used every means possible. It was faulty and it was failing and, even after they said they had no real intention at all of doing what they proposed in December 2000, they still will not show proper regard to residents and sign out any future possibility of regular passenger transport out of Bankstown. There is a direct correlation though between the proximity of Bankstown to Kingsford Smith and the proximity of Bankstown to the central business district of Sydney with regard to the question of airport security-not only perimeter security but security in the airport itself-and the situation we have faced since September 2001. There have been concerns voiced before the Joint Public Accounts and Audit Committee by a number of different agencies about the proper regulation of security at Bankstown Airport. The Commonwealth government says: ‘It’s not up to us; doesn’t have anything to do with us. We’re flogging it off and, even so, because it doesn’t have regular passenger transport then it’s not under the same aegis as Kingsford Smith airport. So it’s under a different general aviation aegis and, therefore, it’s got nothing to do with us. It’s not our responsibility; let a new owner work out what they’re going to do.’ MAIN COMMITTEE On 23 September 2003, the current general manager of Bankstown Airport Ltd, Kim Ellis, wrote to me that evidence would be given by the Bankstown Airport Ltd to the government committee. He mentioned that difference in security because the airport does not currently handle regular passenger transport operations. What we need to do is wipe that out for the future, to give certainty to general aviation in Sydney and to country people who think that a government in the future might rope them into that. Mr Ellis is dealing with what the reality is. This government has not wiped out any of that. Mr Ellis also said that, despite not having to have that higher security classification, Bankstown Airport has itself taken a series of measures to beef up security. They include: (1) a 2.1 metre protective man-proof fence surrounding all aviation areas; (2) keypad and electronic access gates; (3) regular updates for customers and the community on security matters; (4) seven-day-a-week security and perimeter controls; and (5) photographic ID access cards and licences. They are a series of specific provisions. There have been a number of situations in the past where people have just walked onto the perimeter and gained access. These were not people of evil intent choosing to use the helicopters or the general aviation aircraft or the Dakota DC3s, which are pretty large aircraft, or the ‘Connie’, which is not only a very large but also a very loud aircraft. There are also in the vicinity of 16 executive jets based at Bankstown that are used by a number of people who operate Australia wide out of the CBD. All of those are flying bombs in the heart of the biggest city in this country. All of those have not been regulated effectively enough in security terms. It is time for this federal government to properly take responsibility for national security-not to just give us words, rhetoric or propaganda but to do the fundamental things that need to be done; not to leave it to Bankstown Airport Ltd to take this up. It is not only a very big and active airport but also one of a string of airports where there are no future plans to deal with their needs or demands. Mr Ellis points out that there are a whole series of other airports, including Hoxton Park and Camden, of course, where there are no security provisions; but there is also Albion Park, Wedderburn, Warnervale, Newcastle and Wilton, where there are significantly higher security demands. In terms of proximity, use and ease of access, Bankstown needs to be locked up in a secure fashion, but it needs to be locked up with a key that has ‘Commonwealth of Australia’ attached to it, not just Bankstown Airport Ltd or whoever chooses to buy a privatised, leased airport and would have responsibility for it for the next 99 years. I totally, completely and utterly endorse the amendment put forward by the shadow minister; in particular, I endorse paragraph (3) with regard to the reprehensible way in which this government has sold whatever soul it had to Dick Smith in terms of air safety and air safety provision. Lastly, to drive this message home: Bankstown Airport needs to be Commonwealth owned and controlledA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.11 a.m. to 11.22 a.m. 2003 is to abolish the CASA board and bring the governance of CASA under the control of the transport minister to a greater extent.

350,Mr Melham (Banks) (11.22 A.m.),"The purpose of the Civil Aviation Amendment Billtion identified in its policy statements prior to the 2001 election. In this respect, the government has adopted Labor policy. CASA is the safety regulator protecting the interests of the travelling public and it must be held accountable for that role. This bill will provide the appropriate accountability. For those of us living near airports, and for our constituents, civil aviation safety is vital. We have recently seen this government present a Sydney airport master plan. In terms of safety matters, it is incumbent on me to make some comments on that master plan and its potential ramifications for my constituents living near Bankstown Airport. The residents of East Hills, Milperra, Panania and Revesby have lived next to the airport and have been closely involved with its operation for over 50 years. The residents of Padstow, Peakhurst, Lugarno, Penshurst, Mortdale, Narwee and Oatley have been affected by flight movements from Kingsford Smith airport. The master plan for Sydney airport closely affects my constituents and their lifestyles. Matters to do with airport and aircraft safety are intertwined with the future of both Kingsford Smith and Bankstown airports. My colleague the member for Batman has previously spoken to this House on Labor’s position on the master plan, specifically in terms of Kingsford Smith airport. I will not reiterate his comments, except to say that I welcome the fact that the plan includes the retention of the cap of 80 movements per hour, the curfew, access for regional airlines and noise-sharing measures. However, the master plan also predicts an intensification of air activities at Sydney airport, and that in turn raises concerns to do with noise amelioration. The government must make clear whether it is its intention to continue the noise amelioration program. This will become urgent if the plan is implemented. The plan does not seem to envisage a second airport during the planning period of 20 years. This assumes that the projected growth of aircraft activity will be acceptable to the Sydney community-by that I mean the entire community not just those in coalition-held seats. Frankly, I doubt that. The opposition believes that a second airport is needed and that the type and location of that airport must be determined through a transparent process. In the same vein, the government should bring forward the planned review of Sydney’s aviation needs. In the absence of any current and independent data, there is a risk that the master plan will be supported without proper government assessment. We require a second airport to be part of an integrated transport approach that involves all tiers of government-local, state and federal. The opposition does not accept that the projected growth will be acceptable to the people of Sydney. Labor has articulated its position in its integrated Sydney transport plan. This not only provides a strategy for a coordinated approach to transport but is an important part of federal Labor’s interest in sustainable growth and development. Specifically, on the issue of the future of Bankstown Airport, Labor advocates that Bankstown should not become the overflow airport for Kingsford Smith. There should be no large jets at Bankstown, and the airport should not be sold. Labor’s position on Bankstown has been in place since prior to the last federal election and was reaffirmed by the Leader of the Opposition on 27 July 2003. The leader also committed Labor to exploring options to reduce the impact of training operations at Bankstown Airport. Certain commitments were made to the Bankstown community in 2001, and Labor has no intention of backing away from them. Unfortunately, there have been some misrepresentations in recent months about Labor’s policy on Bankstown Airport. I want to reassure the people of MAIN COMMITTEE the Banks electorate that I will honour my commitment to them, as will the Labor Party. The community deserves not only honesty over the future of the airport but also some certainty about its future. A key objective of Labor’s airport master plan will be to reduce the impact of aviation training operations on our community and to involve the community in decisions about appropriate industry and operations at the airport. In the interests of aviation safety, thorough and objective analyses of airspace management issues for Sydney airport will be undertaken where these arise from any changes to Bankstown’s operations proposed in the master plan process. This study will be available for a community consultation process, to enable informed discussions and decisions. Federal Labor will involve local families in the Bankstown area in decisions about their airport. Labor’s master plan development process will canvass cessation of aviation operations at Oxford Park airport; rule out large-jet traffic and explore options to reduce the impact of training operations at Bankstown Airport; assess the capacity to increase general aviation operations at Camden Airport; and explore with the Department of Defence and the local community options to introduce civilian general aviation operations at Richmond airport. This government is selling off Bankstown Airport, together with Hoxton Park and Camden airports, simply as a cash grab. Local communities are left out and their needs ignored. The Labor Party take air traffic safety seriously, and therefore the opposition intend to support this bill despite its limitations. We note, however, that there are limitations and we promise the Australian community that we will continue to consult. We are developing policies which will maintain high safety standards as well as ensuring that the interests of the community are heard. refers to the ‘safety Nazis’. Since September 11, they have really been running amok. They have had their Kristallnacht-their night of broken glass-and now they are exercising powers that could not have been dreamed of previously. But, in the name of safety, the executive arm of government believes that it can do virtually anything that it cares to. This Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003 contains the most extraordinary powers. Legislative proposals before the House, read in conjunction with existing legislation, deliver really quite incredible powers to the executive arm. I think we were all taught at school about the Magna Cartahabeas corpus being one of its central themes-that the king or, if you like, the executive arm of government could not simply take a person into custody without due process of law. There can be no more fundamental violation of your freedom, your rights and your privileges than when executive government can act without any proper process of law. This bill, upon the advice that has been offered to me, completely obliterates that concept. One is curious to know what is lacking in the education of the people at CASA and the minister in that they have been able to get through primary, secondary and tertiary education in Australia and still not understand the most basic principle upon which all of our rights and freedoms are built: the executive arm cannot simply seize a person off the street with no recourse to due process of law. But that is what is occurring here. Let me quote from a case that I think all of us have been provided with. Others may have written it into the public record, and I most certainly intend to. A pilot wrote: To my Federal Member of Parliament. I am a pilot, and so is Denis Grosser. I am most concerned by what has happened to Denis because the same could happen to me. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003
351,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (11.28 A.m.),"P.J. O’Rourke, the American humorist, constantlyI am equally concerned by what appears to me to be unconstitutional-and not just unconstitutional but cutting at the very basis of the building blocks of freedom upon which our society stands-and exceptionally unjust legislation. The letter continues: Broadly speaking, Denis had a difference of opinion with a CASA officer. I have been in politics long enough to know that it probably was not quite as simple as that. He goes on: His pilot license was summarily cancelled without Denis having the opportunity to go to Court-not suspended pending a court case, but permanently cancelled. That is the fundamental difference here and why this transgresses the most basic freedoms upon which all of our institutions in a democracy are built. He continues: Civil aviation regulation 269 empowers CASA to do that, and I want you to amend CAR 269. There is no process by which a cancelled license can be re-instated, so Denis took out a new Student License. There was no trickery in that, he even wrote to Mick Toller (boss of CASA) telling him about it. Denis then embarked on the processes necessary to obtain a new license. Long after his licence was cancelled, Denis was prosecuted in respect of the same events. He was fined. This is absolutely just because it happened in Open Court. The Magistrate was told about Denis’s new Student Licence and specifically declined to cancel it. However when Denis walked out of the courtroom he was hit with a demand that his license be surrendered under CAR 301. CAR 301 does not require that CASA have any reason to demand the surrender of a license, so no reason was given. CAR 139 forbids a person from acting as a pilot, even a student pilot, unless he has his license with him. Thus CASA was able, quite legally, to do the very thing that the Court only moments before had specifically decided not to do. It cannot be any more specific than that. I do not want an explanation saying that Mr Grosser was an unfit person. We want an explanation as to how and why a person can be summarily tried by a jury of his prosecutors-an absolute contradiction in terms and a denigration of the most basic building block of freedom. If in this place we do not make every single diminution of those rights and freedoms a battleground then we are grossly treating our forebears with contempt. For those who like reading books, I always suggest that they read Winston Churchill’s History of the English Speaking People-which probably contributed as much to his fame as anything else he ever did, with the possible exception of his stand in the Second World War. From that book, you will realise that every one of those freedoms that you enjoy was bought with the blood of hundreds of thousands of martyrs who gave their lives to deliver those freedoms and rights to you. If we in this place in a cavalier manner walk away from those principles, we are most certainly betraying those people and returning to the jungle from where we emerged many thousands of years ago. I am deeply troubled by this bill. There are two other things that I want to say about CASA. I will not beat around the bush again; I will simply read from this Air Safety Australia’s document because it is a really excellent document. It says: AIR SAFETY AUSTRALIA does not call for leniency in the enforcement of the law. Far from it-for example we say that there should NOT be a discretion to relax the penalty provisions of the new demerit scheme. If a person commits offences that have foreseeable consequences, we say that the person should bear those consequences. MAIN COMMITTEE AIR SAFETY AUSTRALIA calls for a system of enforcement that is firm, predictable and transparent. Criminological studies have shown that consistent moderate enforcement is far more effective than occasional ferocious enforcement. I will return to that theme a little later. CASA does in fact have that attitude. It is not an acceptable attitude; it is a very foolish and dangerous attitude. The document continues: As an example, the Melbourne-Geelong road is very smooth and very wide and is an invitation to travel at 120kph. But drivers do not-not because of ferocious penalties but because of the CERTAINTY of being penalised. Ferocious penalties which are rarely applied are ineffective because of the human’s belief that “it will not happen to me”. In the days of my youth when selling insurance, you never ever sold an insurance policy on the basis that a person was going to die-because ‘it’s never me that is going to die; it’s always going to be him that is going to die’. My living depended on understanding how people think in that respect. Air Safety Australia goes on to say: When the occasion arises, AIR SAFETY AUSTRALIA calls for an open, independent trial of any of its members accused of an aviation offence. It never calls for charges to be withdrawn. Nor does it seek to influence the outcome of a trial. Nor does it call for mercy. All that AIR SAFETY AUSTRALIA ever seeks is an open independent trial. And the very cornerstone of a civilised and orderly society is that the members of that society be confident of an open independent trial when accused of wrongdoing. For those of us who like reading history books, it is habeas corpus, it is Magna Carta and is the most basic principle of freedom and protection that you have-a proper jury trial or a proper judicial process at the very least. There is no judicial process here. The prosecutor appoints himself as the judge, jury and executioner. That a minister and a department of senior public servants could come forward with such a proposal is quite extraordinary to me. As I have mentioned on previous occasions, we make allowances because there is a very small gene pool here-there are only 300,000 people here. As a long-serving minister in the Queensland government, numerous approaches were made to senior public servants in Queensland but they simply would not move to Canberra. I understand that that is exactly the same in Sydney and Melbourne. So you have to get along here with a very, very small gene pool. But, even allowing for that, there is no excuse for the colossal ignorance and trammelling of basic freedoms that is proposed in this bill. I will go to one other matter. We had the prosecution of a little, privately owned helicopter mustering company in Queensland. This company was singled out. They may have been excessively naughty boys. I do not know whether they were or were not, but the thing that intrigued me greatly was that everybody knew-CASA knew; I knew; every cattleman in Queensland knew-that the logbooks were not being kept in a proper manner. There were excess hours being done and the logbooks were not giving a true and accurate presentation of the hours that were being flown. The letter of the law was applied and brutal aggression, as referred to by Air Safety Australia, was shown to that one person. It was quite clear what CASA were doing: they were making an example of him. But you cannot treat one person like that-throw the book away and destroy him completely-leave everybody else in the industry unassailed and then be regarded as a responsible body; that is not possible. I had considerable difficulty in pointing out to CASA that they could not do this. You cannot single out one person. Another thing I thought was a considerable manifestation of their stupidity was that, if they prosecuted one single very bright and successful operator, MAIN COMMITTEE they would look like they were doing the bidding of some of his competitors and it would raise the ugly spectre of corruption. I do not for one minute think that CASA was motivated by thoughts like, ‘I will help that bloke by damaging this bloke.’ But what they did not realise is that they were acting under pressure from his competitors and that, by its very nature, is a corrupt arrangement. I had enormous difficulty in pointing this out to CASA. Let me give you an example of a similar situation. In Queensland we had livestock hauliers, all of whom had rigs that were too long-they were all breaking the law. They submitted paperwork that would indicate that they were not breaking the law, but I would say that there would not have been a single rig in Queensland that was not. They had to do it because the Northern Territory rigs were coming across the border and taking all of their business. In that case, the Queensland Department of Main Roads, which was run by very intelligent and sensible people, realised they could not single anyone out, even though some of the bigger operators wanted some of the smaller operators, who were making a bigger welter of it, to be singled out. They realised they could not do that. It was either everybody got prosecuted or they changed the law. So in their wisdom they changed the law. They did not refuse to listen to people pointing out that they were going to prosecute on a discriminatory basis; rather, no-one had to point it out to them, because they did not even think of doing that. Singling out a person and hitting him with ferocious penalties to make an example of him to everybody else never occurred to them. Doing that is not acceptable conduct, by this or any other government. Compare that to Queensland, where they left the rigs that were on the road at their current length and gave them a fouror five-year phasing out period, which was quite reasonable, and introduced a longer rig, which was still considerably shorter than a lot of the rigs that were on the road at that time. We got through a very difficult and dangerous situation on the Queensland roads without anyone having to go forward and argue about discrimination, possible corrupt influences or the most basic elimination of our freedoms. I cannot think of any government department in Queensland that would have cast themselves in that role. I should not say that, because there have been a number of occasions where public servants have got a bit carried away with themselves. No matter how stupid this sounds, their argument is invariably, ‘Trust me, I am from the government. I am here to ensure that you act in a safe manner.’ Of course, people laugh at that and it is a standard joke, but these people are not joking when they say it-and that is what CASA are saying to us here. They are saying, ‘I can choose to act as prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner. Trust me because I am a good bloke, I really would not do the wrong thing.’ John Quiggan, the famous economist, has a great saying which comes up in a lot of his books. He said, ‘It is my experience of human nature that when people are allowed to do the wrong thing sooner or later they end up doing the wrong thing.’ If we allow CASA to do these things, even though they may start with good intentions, then I would agree with John Quiggan that if one has the ability to act with excessive power then some time in the future one will act with excessive power. I have seen people enjoy the exercise of power. CASA has the power to completely destroy the lives of an awful lot of people in Australia. It has the ability to completely extinguish the communications system and to reimpose the tyranny of distance on Australia. I received a MAIN COMMITTEE letter from a member of one of the most famous aviation families in Queensland-the Fysh family were the founders of Qantas Airlines and are great people-Duncan Fysh. He is a very decent person and thinks highly of CASA, but he does not think highly of these laws. He has great respect for CASA. He himself is at the moment pioneering another venture which is of very great value to the Australian economy. He makes a very good point that, if safety impositions reach such a level, we will simply not be able to afford aeroplanes anymore. I would say that the number of light aircraft between Charters Towers and Mount Isa has gone from about 100-I want to put on the record that I am only guessing here-to no more than 20. The reason for that is excessive cost. I nearly die when I see my accounts and find out how much it costs me to do a charter from Charters Towers to Townsville, which is only about a 25-minute trip in a light aircraft. I cannot believe the prices that we are now paying. A very large part of those prices has come from CASAA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.47 a.m. to 11.57 a.m. probably the predominant form of mustering these days, there is an unacceptably high level of deaths in this industry. In the Queensland court case involving the prosecution over logbooks, CASA maintained that there was a fatigue factor involved in helicopter mustering. I examined the details of the last seven deaths in North Queensland relating to helicopter mustering and found that not a single one of them could even remotely be attributed to fatigue. There was no fatigue factor, so CASA was addressing a problem that was not about safety insofar as there were no deaths attributable to it. I am not saying that CASA should not keep an eye on these things-far from it-but five of those seven deaths were caused by powerlines. Helicopters can be fitted with a device that will warn a chopper pilot when powerlines are nearby. I have to admit that the industry itself has been reluctant to provide these warning devices. They are on the market for about $5,000 to $7,000, but a bulk purchase arrangement via the government would probably reduce that to about $3,000. That is not a great deal of money when you consider that the helicopters used for mustering purposes cost $200,000 or more. (Time expired) allowing me to speak early. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003 puts into effect a commitment by the governments of Australia and New Zealand to mutually recognise each other’s safety standards and certificates in aviation. It makes an allowance whereby safety certificates issued in one country will be recognised for use in another. The relationship between Australia and New Zealand has always been very close. Some people would suggest that, in 1901, New Zealand should have become another state. It was not to be, but the bonds that we established as part of ANZAC obviously bring the two countries together in a very significant way. This year is also the 20th anniversary of the CER, which is the free trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand. We also have an open skies agreement with New Zealand in relation to aviation. This legislation is a natural progression from the free trade agreement, the CER, and the open skies agreement between the two countries. It is important that we recognise each other’s safety standards. MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003

353,Mr Baird (Cook) (11.59 A.m.),"I would firstly like to thank the members opposite forThere is also the importance and growing nature of tourism between the two countries. I am glad to see the member for Petrie with me in the House, because she has a strong interest in tourism. The No. 1 source of tourists in Australia is New Zealand and vice versa-in terms of the number of Australians who go to New Zealand. In fact about one-third of all the tourists who go to New Zealand are from Australia. This bill has been developed concurrently with New Zealand legislation, whereby their regulations and privileges will be compliant with ours and vice versa. It has been designed to take out the duplication and complexity that currently exists for airline operators. It has been designed because current rules and regulations are not consistent with the intention of the open skies air services agreement to promote competition between Australian and New Zealand operators. The CER, which is so important between the two countries, has over its life proved to be one of the most wide ranging and successful free trade agreements in the world. In the last year, the New Zealanders did a review of the CER and had wide discussions with their industry, with people in government and with Australians. Their conclusions about the success of the free trade agreement were very positive. We are hoping that in the next 12 months we might do a similar review of the CER and its relationship with Australian trade. This bill goes to the very heart of what we are trying to do in terms of expanding free trade by eliminating barriers to trade and promoting fair competition. This lies at the very heart of the bill. I mentioned the importance of tourism between the two countries. One-third of the total number of visitors going to New Zealand are Australians, and 17 per cent of the total number of visitors to Australia come from New Zealand. Last year 700,000 New Zealanders visited Australia; by 2012 this figure is expected to be approximately one million. It is also important to recognise that approximately 10 per cent of visitors to Australia also visit New Zealand. All members would be aware that tourism is an important contributor to the national economy and represents 10.4 per cent of total employment. Safety is of paramount importance to the aviation industry and it has taken on heightened importance since September 11. It is important that our friends across the Tasman have very similar safety standards to us. The mutual recognition terms are therefore going to allow for eligible aircraft operators to carry out aviation activity in either Australia or New Zealand, whether international or domestic, passenger or cargo, based on an air operators certificate, the AOC, issued by their home country. The terms state: ... an operator that is the holder of an air operator certificate ... and other associated certificates and permissions, issued in one country will not be required to hold an AOC, or other certificate or permission, to conduct air transport operations in that country. This program is going to be phased in. Initially, only AOCs held by eligible operators will be mutually recognised, and then consideration will be given to other certificates not already covered by other recognition arrangements. It has also been agreed that priority should and will be given for operations of aircraft with more than 30 seats or equivalent. Currently the bill makes allowances for the recognition of AOCs. There are provisions in the act, however, to allow for the mutual recognition of more certificates in the future The issue of safety by way of an added guarantee is categorically put to rest through the fact that the host regulator has the power to issue a temporary stop notice to an aircraft operator issued with a certificate by the other safety regulator if that operator is perceived to present MAIN COMMITTEE a serious risk to aviation safety. Operators will still have to comply with rules of the air and certain laws of the country in which they are operating. That particularly relates to security, the environment, curfew and the carrier’s liability, to name but a few. It is widely regarded that both Australia and New Zealand have world’s best practice airline operations with similar standards and consistencies. Of course, as two independent nations there are going to be discrepancies over the harmonisation of safety standards; however, whilst the overall safety of each system is recognised and achieved, the differences can be accepted. These changes to mutual recognition are going to promote aviation and competition in Australia and New Zealand by reducing the regulatory burden on aviation operators from having to hold dual AOCs while maintaining the safety standards and records we currently have. It is more than feasible to foresee that the changes announced in this bill could result in lower airline costs through fewer administration issues and less bureaucracy and, therefore, lower ticket prices. Pacific Blue, which is part of the operations of Virgin Blue, are planning to start operations between Christchurch and Brisbane and then expand their network. I am sure they will be looking for this type of arrangement, particularly as some of their aircraft will be based in New Zealand and a lot of their crewing will take place in New Zealand. There have been concerns about staffing levels. Currently, Australian cabin crew operate on a ratio of one to 36, compared with one to 50 for New Zealand cabin crews. Obviously this has been a basis of contention. CASA has stated that this level of service is going to remain. New Zealand staffing ratios have support mechanisms and administrations which are geared towards crew-to-customer staffing levels. This bill is about mutual recognition of safety standards between the two countries, as part of the air services agreement between Australia and New Zealand. In November 2000, when this agreement was initially negotiated, it was suggested that a single aviation market between Australia and New Zealand was worth $6.8 billion. Mutual recognition will undoubtedly create significant opportunities which will add further to the relationship between our two countries. It is only through the joint understanding and commitment of CASA and CAANZ that mutual recognition is feasible and possible. The force of law given to CASA and CAANZ under the provisions of the act underpins mutual recognition. Without acceptance, commitment and communication, mutual recognition would not be achievable. This bill is further evidence of the shared background of our two countries on this 60th anniversary of the ANZAC agreement and the 20th anniversary of the CER trade agreement. This bill will coordinate safety arrangements between the two countries. This is an area in which we see a growing aviation market and continued growth in terms of tourism, the No. 1 markets in both countries. We have new participants in the market, such as Pacific Blue and Emirates Airline, which is flying Sydney-Auckland; and there are plans for Air New Zealand to have a low-cost operator which will venture onto the market quoting new prices which undoubtedly will stimulate travel between the two countries. There is a great tradition between Australia and New Zealand. We come up against each other each year in the Bledisloe Cup, with varying degrees of success. We should note the success of the Wallabies in past competitions. This year I witnessed the All Blacks win. We hope that is turned around when we have the World Cup in Sydney. Most importantly, the CER agreement between the two countries means that free trade is an absolute imperative. MAIN COMMITTEE Arrangements ensuring that we have appropriate safety standards in terms of the operation of aircraft within the two countries are also significant. This is a step forward in the arrangements between the countries. If we allow aircraft to operate so freely between the two countries-for Australian airlines to establish in New Zealand and vice versa-then it is appropriate that we take this further step. We will undoubtedly argue about the ratios of staff to passengers. It works well in other countries with these types of ratios and arrangements. Safety is predominant in both countries; both countries have excellent standards. I believe this is a significant step forward which will do much to coordinate the two countries’ aviation systems, and I commend the bill to the House. ment Bill 2003. There are two main purposes to this bill: firstly, to abolish the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority-CASA-and bring CASA more under the control of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services; and, secondly, to revise various CASA investigatory and enforcement powers, particularly regarding suspension and cancellation of licences. CASA’s previous role as a dual regulator and law enforcer had a possible conflict of interest. It must be acknowledged that, while the maintenance of safety is its main aim, CASA also has a responsibility to the viability of the airline industry as a whole. CASA’s grounding of Ansett’s entire fleet of 767 aircraft during the Easter 2001 period was seen as a significant factor in that airline’s collapse. It is recognised in the industry that, while Ansett suffered as a result of bad management decisions by several previous owners and managers, management at the time of the grounding was getting its house in order. As the editorial in the Canberra Times on 22 November 2002 said: CASA’s actions were seen as heavy handed, despite the fact that it was merely moving to force an airline to address a maintenance schedule that was not being met. Whether CASA can carry the blame for Ansett’s demise and subsequent loss of 17,000 jobs will long be debated. What is clear however, is that CASA’s responsibility placed it as judge, jury and executioner. CASA is responsible for the safety regulation of civil air operations within the Australian territory, the operation of Australian registered aircraft and the promotion of high standards of aviation safety. CASA regulates some 16,000 aircraft and 34,000 pilots and flight engineers. It is hard to see how these responsibilities can be carried out effectively, considering CASA management’s controversies, personal conflict, resignations and general lack of continuity of board membership and unfavourable reports over the past several years. To list some of these impediments to effective decision making, I refer to information provided in the Bills Digest on this legislation. Following the election of the Howard government and after wide criticism of the board, the then Minister for Transport and Regional Development introduced changes to the board’s membership. In May 1997, after new legislation expanding the CASA board to seven positions, Mr Dick Smith was appointed CASA deputy chairman under the chairman, Justice William Fischer. In June there were two further replacements of retired board members. In August 1997 the Broderick-Willoughby report into the relationship between the Director of Aviation Safety and the CASA board made recommendations on corporate governance. In September CASA director Mr Keith left after the board passed a no-confidence motion in his management strategies, and he was replaced by Mr John Pike.

354,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (12.10 P.m.),"I rise to speak on the Civil Aviation Amendmember Dr Pollock both resigned in protest at the board’s handling of the former director. In January 1997 Mr Smith was appointed chairman and Dr Paul Scully-Power, the first Australian to travel into space, was appointed as deputy chairman. On1 August 1998 Mr Mick Toller became the new Director of Aviation Safety. In all, there were some eight resignations or retirements over the period, including those of chairmen Justice Fischer and Dick Smith. These controversies and lack of continuity of board membership were not conducive to sound management decisions. It is surprising that the government did not act sooner, although it has been argued by some that many of the problems have resulted from government and ministerial interference and that the problems with CASA really started when the Howard government came into office. What is necessary in this legislation is that Australia continues to maintain our low record of aviation fatalities in both civil and private aviation. I would also like to address some remarks on an issue outlined in the second reading amendment moved by the member for Batman. This is of concern to the constituents of Greenway and, indeed, of all Western Sydney. That issue is the government’s proposed second airport site at Badgerys Creek. Since the Leader of the Opposition emphatically ruled out Badgerys Creek as an option under Labor, the government have been silent on their policy for a second airport. However, they have had a lot to say about Labor’s decision to abandon Badgerys Creek. I was, quite frankly, disappointed that government members had a field day rubbishing Simon Crean’s decision to abandon Badgerys Creek as an airport option. For what reasons? Most of them had opposed Badgerys Creek airport anyway. Here was the Leader of the Opposition saying that that was going to be Labor’s policy. So the only reason why they made an issue of that decision was political opportunism. We had dorothy dix questions, private members’ motions and adjournment debates all rubbishing the decision of the Labor Party. I now want to respond to that barrage of criticism of Labor’s decision by members on the government side. The language used by government members since the announcement has been very curious indeed. The members for Mitchell, Macquarie and Macarthur all spoke on the private member’s motion regarding Labor’s policy. The member for Macquarie also spoke in an adjournment debate and asked two dorothy dixers on the subject. The member for Doister for Transport and Regional Services. Despite all these opportunities, nobody on the government side spelt out what the government’s policy was. They all took the opportunity to ridicule Labor for taking Badgerys off the table once and for all, but not one of them outlined what their own policy was. Even given the opportunity of three dorothy dix questions, the minister for transport did not definitely rule out Badgerys as an option, nor did the Prime Minister. Certainly, the minister for transport said that there may not be a need for a second airport any time soon, but he did not rule out the need for one eventually and he certainly did not rule out Badgerys Creek as the site for an airport which presumably he would build if the need arises. Indeed, the minister devoted some time to rubbishing all other alternative sites as an option, thereby leaving only Badgerys Creek as a viable site. At the last election the member for Lindsay campaigned hard on Badgerys Creek, as well as on issues like the ‘children overboard’. It is surprising that she has had absolutely nothing to say on this issue this time around. The government members who have spoken on this issue MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003
355,Bell Also Asked A Dorothy Dix Question Of Mr Anderson,"the Deputy Prime Minister and Minhave been very careful with their language-too careful, one might say. They have taken great pains not to outline their own policy on the issue. Not once did any of these speakers say, ‘Our policy is to rule out Badgerys as an option for the second airport,’ and it appears to be for a good reason. All we have to go on with regard to the government’s intentions is what the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the member for North Sydney, said in this House on Wednesday, 20 August: ... this government is committed to a second airport in Sydney. Existing government policy is to commit to a second airport in Sydney at Badgerys Creek ... That is the policy that we have had for the last two elections. That is the commitment that we have made, and that is our existing policy. It is a commitment to a second airport in the Sydney basin at Badgerys Creek ... There you have it: an unequivocal statement that the government intends to proceed with Badgerys Creek at some time in the future. The minister let the cat out of the bag. He went on to say, inter alia: While some members of the government may have different views about the matter ... our policy has not changed. I think the member for North Sydney was upbraided for his announcement on government policy by people saying that he was only a junior minister. With his statement, the member for North Sydney was telling the people of Australia: ‘Forget what the member for Macquarie has told you. Forget what the member for Lindsay or the member for Mitchell said at election time. They might say that they are opposed to Badgerys but we are going to build it anyway, according to government policy.’ The government are keeping the land. They are not selling it off like they are selling off everything else. They are keeping the land for a possible airport and saying that they are going to build an airport at Badgerys. Quite clearly, the Labor Party is recognising that that land cannot remain unused, and there is now a proposal, which the party is discussing internally, that has been drawn up by the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board to turn the land at Badgerys Creek into an employment, technology and education precinct. That is a project which I certainly strongly believe in. Members of the Labor Party have in the past supported the Badgerys Creek proposal but have since been convinced by arguments against it. One of the major reasons that the general public in Western Sydney opposes the building of an airport at Badgerys Creek is due to the massive protest campaigns organised in the inner city against aircraft noise. This, quite frankly, scared the residents of Western Sydney, who said, ‘If these are the problems caused by having a major international airport in our backyards, then we don’t want it either.’ I believe that any attempt to build a second airport anywhere in the Sydney basin will be met with the same strong public opposition. The fact is that Mascot is ideally suited for an international airport. Overseas travellers arriving in Australia want to land close to the CBD, not miles away, as would be the case with an airport at Badgerys Creek or Wilton. The Labor Party have examined the issues and we are convinced that an airport at Badgerys Creek would be a bad idea, and we have said so. It is interesting to note the differences between what Minister Hockey claimed was the government’s policy and what the member for Lindsay campaigned on at the last election. I MAIN COMMITTEE would like to refer to a campaign pamphlet distributed widely in Lindsay during the election. Some households received it at least three times and it again highlights the tricky language that has been used recently by government members. The pamphlet read: ‘Jackie Kelly asked the Prime Minister to ditch Badgerys Creek airport-and he did.’ The sentence should have ended with the words ‘just for now’ but the intention is obviously clear. The government’s policy was not to make a decision just yet and then the member for Lindsay has run around and told her constituents that the Prime Minister was ditching Badgerys. The Prime Minister ditched Badgerys-for now. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism has rescued the policy from the ditch, dusted it off and put it back on the agenda. But deciding not to make a decision allows members like those for Lindsay, Macquarie and Mitchell to phrase their own propaganda in such a way that it leaves their constituents totally confused-and confused they would be if they were aware of all that has been said about Badgerys in this House. For example, in 1993 the member for Mitchell moved a private member’s motion which read in part: That ... this House ... endorses the immediate construction of a private/public airport at Badgerys Creek with a full international capacity including a 2900 metre runway. That motion related to the upcoming Olympic Games and the member might suggest that he moved it to take account of the influx of visitors at the games, but I do not think he was suggesting that the airport should be built for just a one-off event and then become a white elephant. In fact, in his speech he refers to the increase in aviation over the previous four years and to the FAC, which claimed that the fact that the growth in aviation would continue until the turn of the century meant that there would be a need for a second airport not, as originally predicted, in 2002 or 2003 but by the year 2000. That is understandable-that may have been an appropriate motion for the time. However, according to an article in the Penrith Press on 22 August, the member for Mitchell was quoted as saying that he ‘always opposed’ and ‘never supported’ a second airport at Badgerys Creek. It seems that history has been rewritten and the Hansard ignored. The truth is that only Simon Crean and Labor have stood up, looked the public in the eye and said, ‘We will not build an airport at Badgerys Creek.’ The coalition fiddles around the edges, uses misleading language and never comes out and says what its policy really is-all except the minister for tourism, of course. Only Labor has listened to the people of Western Sydney. Labor members have argued the case at every opportunity and only Labor has taken Badgerys Creek off the table as an option for the second airport. All the while the coalition members hide behind barricades built of half-truths and illusions. The only one with any honour on this issue is the member for North Sydney-the tourism minister-who at least had the guts to put on the public record the government’s real policy: to build a second airport at Badgerys Creek. Labor’s position regarding Badgerys Creek is crystal clear; the government’s decision is as clear as mud. I have argued for a second airport, when it is needed, to be built outside the Sydney basin. Regional New South Wales centres would benefit enormously from such a project. In any case, there would always have to be strong commercial, community and local government support for such a project, wherever it would be built. The regions that have already been mentioned are Goulburn, Williamtown and Canberra. In each case, a very fast train link with the Sydney CBD would be of benefit but not essential. I have argued that an MAIN COMMITTEE integrated rail and aviation network is a better social and environmental option for New South Wales than expanding our aviation industry at the expense of rail would be. Canberra airport has put in a bid to become Sydney’s second airport. In an article in the Canberra Times last month, the airport’s Managing Director, Stephen Byron, put in a bid for Canberra to be the long-term solution to the second airport controversy. Mr Byron’s argument was that a large number of people fly to Sydney from regional centres to go somewhere else and that Canberra would be an excellent place to take over as a regional hub because it has capital city connections with more than 100 flights a day. Mr Byron’s vision is, first, to see Canberra as a regional hub and then to see it develop into a domestic hub for the south of Australia, with increased numbers of international flights. He sees New Zealand as an international destination within three years and Singapore within seven, with direct flights to the United States further into the future. Mr Byron’s argument is that, with Badgerys Creek being rejected as Sydney’s second airport site by the Labor Party and a ban on jet flights out of Bankstown as a condition of sale, the dynamics of the airport debate have changed and have now swung in Canberra’s favour over the long term. I support the amendment moved by the member for Batman. electorate and Hoxton Park Airport at the other, I have a special interest in aviation safety. With flight paths from both airports crossing densely populated areas of the electorate that I represent and with both airports being among the busiest in Australia, you will appreciate that any compromises in air safety can cause alarm. But my main concern in this debate is the effect of the sale of Bankstown and Hoxton Park airports and what those sales mean for aviation and urban development in the Sydney basin. To begin with I will talk about Bankstown Airport, the busiest airport in Australia. While it is largely used for general aviation, it should be noted that Bankstown Airport is completely surrounded by urban development. As far back as the 1940s, Bankstown was rejected as a site for a major airport for Sydney because of limitations of the site. Since then, urban development has completely surrounded the airport. Whilst some of that development has been industrial, areas such as Lansvale East in the Fowler electorate lie less than one kilometre from the main runway at Bankstown Airport. Whilst the majority of movement involve light aircraft, the frequency of those flights is a factor in the impact of movements on surrounding industrial and residential areas. Bankstown also carries a significant number of helicopter operations, and in terms of noise problems arising from operations it has been said that helicopter operations are among the most intrusive. My concern with the impact of operations at Bankstown, however, is that whilst the Minister for Transport and Regional Services now rejects the idea of regional services operating from Bankstown it should be noted that already a large number of movements into Bankstown involve charter flights to and from regional centres in New South Wales. My concern is that charter operations involving larger aircraft will be just as intrusive as scheduled regional services would be. I have already mentioned Lansvale East, which is under the flight path and less than a kilometre from the western end of the main runway at Bankstown. Another kilometre west and again directly beneath the flight path is the business centre of Cabramatta. I know that MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003
356,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (12.27 P.m.),"With Bankstown Airport at one end of the Fowlerbecause my electorate office is under the flight path. What is more noticeable is the heavier charter aircraft that are operating out of Bankstown and their impact on residential areas. I mention this because at the present time Fairfield council is looking at development and planning in areas close to railway stations and commercial centres. In Fairfield the council is looking at developments of up to 12 storeys, and Liverpool is looking at 14 storeys. Both town centres and Cabramatta could have developments of up to 14 storeys in the next few years. So in the case of Liverpool and Cabramatta we face the prospect of high-density residential developments directly beneath the flight paths of Bankstown Airport. With the airport in private hands, we can expect little by way of cooperation between the airport operator and councils to minimise the impact of airport operations on residents. I am not aware of flight paths being considered in assessing the suitability of developments, but they certainly should be. This leaves us all asking why Sydney’s aviation needs have not been planned in a way that suits urban development. I can remember driving past Bankstown Airport in the 1950s, when I was a very wee lass, when there was very little development in the areas around the flight paths. Faced with the potential problems caused by further development at Bankstown, I can only wonder what would have happened if governments had given greater attention to planning for Sydney’s aviation and development needs. So today we are left with a situation where the demands for greater access by larger and noisier aircraft at Bankstown will come up against the development of high-density, tall residential buildings in areas of high demand. We need to carefully plan any developments at airports which can sterilise development sites and we need to make the hard decisions about the future of airport operations near highdensity developments, aircraft operations around the clock at airports surrounded by residential development and the development of new facilities planned to be out of the way of future residential growth. If we do not take the hard decisions now, we will continue to be faced with these same problems over the next decades. When Bankstown was first developed and during its heyday in the Second World War it was miles from the nearest urban development. But Sydney’s urban sprawl has long since caught up with Bankstown. The cries of ‘we were here first’ may seem understandable, but we need to ask if we can continue to allow airports to sterilise large areas of scarce urban land. The same can be said of Hoxton Park-although, in recognition of the change to the urban environment surrounding Hoxton Park, the sale proposal considers that its closure in the medium term is accepted by most people. It was of some concern to me that in a recent Stateline program Hoxton Park was presented as a sparsely settled area. That may have been the case 60 years ago during the Second World War when Hoxton Park was an emergency strip for aircraft operating from Bankstown-and even 20 years ago Hoxton Park was surrounded by small farms-but for the past decade or more Hoxton Park has been gradually surrounded by urban residential development. Today operations at Hoxton Park consist mainly of training flights, with circuit practice of take-offs and landings being most common. This form of training is now carried out over fully developed residential areas and the danger posed to homes and schools in the area is not remote. Over the past five years we have seen at least one serious accident each year-two involving fatalities. Hoxton Park is no longer the place for L-plated pilots to be flying over homes and schools. I would also mention again the noise of helicopter operations. While these are MAIN COMMITTEE mostly light helicopters, occasionally heavier types use Hoxton Park and, when performing tight turns, can be very noisy. While Hoxton Park is limited to light aircraft, its impact on the urban environment is mainly that it sterilises more than 100 hectares of land. I should point out that Hoxton Park airport is adjacent to the Western Sydney Orbital, which is under construction at present. In fact, the route of the orbital runs parallel to the runway. The environment impact statement for the orbital noted that modifications to the lighting on the Cowpasture Road overbridge would need to be made to allow for the flight path of aircraft using Hoxton Park. So here we have an airport surrounded by residential development, a valuable site for commercial or industrial development which would provide a much-needed employment opportunity in the area. But the ‘we were here first’ claim is still being made. It is long overdue to fully consider the needs of urban planning and balance the needs of general aviation operations with the demands for scarce development sites. But, because responsibility for urban planning is held by state governments and responsibility for aviation needs is held by the federal government, there seems to be little or no coordination. That means that we will continue to face the problems of the impact of existing airports and the march of urban development; the meeting between the two appears to be over the question of land value. As a training airport, 89 hectares of land at Hoxton Park would not even meet the cost of operations. But as a development site Hoxton Park would net many millions of dollars for the Commonwealth government-and obviously this government finds the opportunity to sell Hoxton Park hard to pass up. But, as I have noticed with the development of Bankstown airport, there is opportunity for commercial and industrial development on areas of the airport not needed for operations. I do not think this kind of development is suitable for Hoxton Park. As I have said, Hoxton Park is surrounded by residential development and to develop the site while continuing operations of even light aircraft would not allow for appropriate development on such a sensitive site. That leads me to ask the question: just where do the present 100,000 movements at Hoxton Park go? Clearly no-one in this government is prepared to answer that. Planning for the proposed Badgerys Creek airport envisaged the closure of Hoxton Park-not the least because of interference in flight paths. As far as Labor is concerned, Badgerys Creek is off the agenda; it is definitely off the agenda. But Labor is in the process of suggesting alternative sites. That is the type of planning that this government should be engaged in. When I have placed questions on notice concerning airports in Sydney’s south west, the answers all seem to suggest that air traffic would simply be shuffled to Bankstown, Hoxton Park or even Camden. The government keeps ducking the question: if Hoxton Park is closed or there are changes to the operations of Bankstown, just where will the overflow go? The government will not answer the question. At least Labor is prepared to come clean on airport planning. Having decided not to go ahead with Badgerys Creek, Labor will be proposing an alternative site-but this government will not face up to the need to make a decision. In the meantime aviation growth goes ahead and urban development encroaches on every existing site. The government just keeps putting airport planning into the too-hard basket. The Liberals have a long history of putting airport decisions off. They are all looking for an alternative to Kingsford-Smith and have been since the 1940s. It was Labor that took the original decision to build Badgerys Creek and it was MAIN COMMITTEE Labor that built the third runway at Mascot. But this government seems to think that it can sit on its hands and do nothing about aviation planning and the problems will take care of themselves. State and local governments need to make decisions about urban planning, and they cannot do that in a climate of uncertainty. They need the Commonwealth to take the lead and plan for aviation developments to allow urban development planning to take place with some degree of certainty. Unless the government takes the lead with aviation planning, we will continue to see the planning disasters that have left hundreds of thousands of Sydney residents affected by aircraft noise, we will continue to run the risk of high loss of life from an air crash in the approaches to our main and general aviation airports and we will finish up with a patchwork of transport and aviation links that cannot serve the demands of the community. Airports are the most intrusive of all public facilities. Their siting needs to be planned well in advance of urban development-that should be the lesson of Badgerys Creek. We need to be planning now for our airport needs half a century from now. If we had done that properly 50 years ago, we would not be in the mess we find ourselves in today. 2003. I was moved to speak on the bill by the contributions of a couple of my colleagues from Western Sydney: the honourable member for Fowler, who has just finished her contribution, and the honourable member for Greenway. I just want to try to get a few things on the public record. Badgerys Creek has been raised as an issue in the debate on this bill-in particular, on 20 August 2003 by Mr Hockey, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism and also acting cabinet minister. I thought he made a very significant contribution to the debate and I would like to quote his words. He said: The second point in relation to Sydney airport is that this government is committed to a second airport in Sydney. Existing government policy is to commit to a second airport in Sydney at Badgerys Creek, with a review in 2005. That is the policy that we have had for the last two elections. That is the commitment that we have made, and that is our existing policy. It is a commitment to a second airport in the Sydney basin at Badgerys Creek, with a review of the need for it in 2005. That is the policy that we have had since the 1996 election, and it is entirely consistent with the fact that we legislated the cap of 80 movements per hour at Sydney airport ... He goes on to talk about Sydney airport. This is a highly significant contribution by an acting cabinet minister, a senior minister in the Howard government and someone who has lived and breathed airport issues because he is also the member for North Sydney. He is saying, quite clearly, that the government is committed to building Sydney’s second airport at Badgerys Creek. I would be misinforming the House if I did not say it has been a long struggle to overturn the Labor Party policy in favour of building Sydney’s second airport at Badgerys Creek. I have made many contributions in this place and in the forums of the party on that issue. But, to his eternal credit, the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, came out to the Mount Druitt Workers Club and said: ‘Badgerys Creek as Sydney’s second airport is dead. It will not be built under Labor.’ What Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney, is saying quite clearly is that under the Liberal government, and subject to that review, they will be doing it. If a second airport for Sydney is to be built, under the coalition it will be, without a doubt, at Badgerys Creek. The review in 2005 is not to look at other issues or other sites; it is to determine when the green light will be given. I say to my parliamentary colleagues from Western Sydney who are memMAIN COMMITTEE",198,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003
357,Mr Price (Chifley) (12.41 P.m.),"I rise to speak on the Civil Aviation Amendment Billbers of the Liberal Party-people like Jackie Kelly, the member for Lindsay; Kerry Bartlett, the member for Macquarie; Pat Farmer, the member for Macarthur; Ross Cameron, the member for Parramatta-please have the integrity and honesty about this issue that your ministerial colleague Mr Hockey has shown. He has said it unambiguously. We can have differences in Western Sydney. We often agree about things in Western Sydney, even though we might come from different political parties. But let us not get into games, let us not dissemble; let us tell the people of Western Sydney the truth. The truth is that under the coalition there will be a review in 2005 but that will be a review not to determine whether Badgerys Creek is an appropriate site anymore-and, after all, it is located in the middle of Western Sydney; in 2016, more than half of Sydney’s population will live in Western Sydney-but to determine whether or not the green button gets pushed in 2005, 2006 or whenever. The coalition is committed to the Badgerys Creek site. That is the default site for the second airport. There is now quite a clear distinction between the Labor Party in Western Sydney and the Liberal Party in Western Sydney on this issue. Mr Hockey has belled the cat. I must say that from time to time. I have been told, ‘We can say one thing in one part of Sydney and say another thing in another part of Sydney.’ That just does not work, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know, with modern communications, with faxes, with the Internet, with emails. Political parties cannot play those sorts of games anymore. You have to have a policy that is integrated, that suits all parts of Western Sydney. Labor are committed, through a cabinet subcommittee, to identify what looks like an appropriate site. Of course, there will have to be due process. No-one from Western Sydney would be arguing that politicians should be selecting the site. There will be due process. But we can stand up in this parliament or in any part of Western Sydney and say that Badgerys Creek is dead as far as the Labor Party is concerned. Simon Crean has come specifically to Western Sydney to rule it out. We will not be building at Badgerys Creek. If voters want an airport in Western Sydney, it is very clear what they need to do. They need to support Jackie Kelly, the member for Lindsay. They need to vote for the member for Lindsay, they need to vote for the member for Macquarie, they need to vote for the member for Macarthur and they need to vote for the member for Parramatta, because they belong to a political party that is committed at some point in time to building Sydney’s second airport at Badgerys Creek. It is no good the Prime Minister weaselling away and saying, ‘Maybe it will be needed, maybe it won’t be needed.’ This is what the Liberal Party policy is. I have no better authority for that than Mr Hockey in his contribution-a very honest contribution. I admire him for his honesty and his forthrightness. I might say he delivered that speech with a great deal of vehemence, if not anger. You could see that he was deeply committed to the subject matter that he was making a contribution about. Thank you, Minister Hockey. But now you have belled the cat. It is up to those members that I have previously named, who represent Western Sydney, to come out and to be consistent, to be honest and to be open with the people of Western Sydney on this issue. They certainly deserve it. I have three more things to put on the record, and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this. First, the member for Cook raised the collapse of Ansett and in particular pointed out that the changed arrangements in this bill effectively would give the minister a greater direction and say. Let me say that there have been many reforms in civil aviation-much like teleMAIN COMMITTEE communications. It is a heavily regulated industry and, yes, you may wish to blame CASA, or CASA may need to step up to the mark and take some responsibility, as should the management of Ansett-I do not try to whitewash them-but let me make the point that, if Ansett had collapsed under a Labor government, there would have been utter outrage at the collapse. We would have been pilloried for our inaction, for failing to prop it up. The aviation market in Australia is not huge; it is not like the American market or the European market. We are a huge continent with great needs. It is important for the constituents in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, to have access to aviation services, just as it is important for the constituents in my electorate and in the electorate of my colleague the member for Oxley. We should not be deprived, but I am amazed at the way the coalition have been able to get away with this utter catastrophe in civil aviation-by allowing a duopoly and then letting one operator collapse. I am not saying that they are totally to blame. Like any incident, there are always a number of issues involved. Second, because there will be greater ministerial responsibility under these new arrangements I must express my concern that the Deputy Prime Minister himself now will have a measure of responsibility for aviation safety that he might have otherwise argued he did not have. We have got a marvellous record in this country, and we really need to work hard to preserve and maintain it. But should something catastrophic happen in the future-and I certainly do not wish that-we ought to be clear that the Deputy Prime Minister will accept a greater measure of responsibility than he might have otherwise. Last but not least, I am a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and we have had a watching brief on terrorism. I regret to say that all of the witnesses who have appeared at a Commonwealth level have given evidence in camera. Interestingly, the state witnesses have not appeared in camera. The shadow minister, Martin Ferguson, has moved a second reading amendment to this bill that raises serious issues about aviation security. I am not at liberty to divulge the details of the evidence given before the committee because it was in camera-and it is unfortunate that it was in camera, because I think it could have been on the public record-but I must say that as a result of a number of witnesses appearing before us I, for one-and I cannot speak on behalf of the committee-had some serious concerns about aviation security. I certainly hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services will be able to assure us that aviation security is being addressed at a rapid rate and that those who fly in Australia can be confident of the absolute security of those aviation services. I support the bill and I support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman. and Regional Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade) (12.55 p.m.)The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003 will amend the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to revise CASA’s governance arrangements and introduce a package of new enforcement measures that will ensure that regulatory action can be more appropriately matched with the seriousness of the breach. Abolishing the board will create the necessary direct line of authority between the minister and the director of aviation safety over CASA’s policy directions and priorities, performance standards, reporting and consultation processes. This will make it clear who is responsible for CASA’s performance and accountability.

The new measures will strike the appropriate balance between retaining CASA’s powers and providing prompt review and redress of its decisions without jeopardising Australia’s high standard of aviation safety. The government amendments being moved today are necessary, firstly, to alter the commencement of the revised governance arrangements in table items 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 in clause 2 from 1 July 2003 to the date on which the act receives royal assent and, secondly, to omit subclauses (3) and (4) in the application and savings provisions in clause 4. These provisions were included in the bill on the basis that the board would be abolished on 1 July 2003, making the director responsible for the preparation of the CASA annual report for the financial year ending 30 June 2003. Thirdly, the amendments are necessary to correct an omission from the bill. Fourthly, they insert schedule 2, which will amend the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 by repealing regulation 268-relating to CASA’s power to immediately suspend an authorisation in cases of serious and imminent risk to air safety-as a new provision dealing with this power has been created in the act and amending regulation 269 to insert new subregulation 1A. At present, paragraph 269(1)(a) allows CASA to vary, suspend or cancel an authorisation where it is satisfied that the authorisation holder has contravened a provision of the act or the regulations. Proposed subregulation 1A provides that CASA may exercise a power to cancel an authorisation under paragraph 269(1)(a) only if the authorisation holder has actually been convicted or found guilty by a court of an offence against the act or the regulations in respect of the contravention. Where CASA cancels an authorisation under subregulation 1A the decision will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, CASA’s decision will not be subject to an automatic stay under the proposed automatic stay scheme as it would be unwarranted and inappropriate given a court would have found the authorisation holder guilty of the offence. The authorisation holder would have already had the opportunity to put a case to, and be heard by, an independent arbiter. The amendments to the governance and application and savings provisions are necessary as the bill was not enacted in time for the new governance arrangements to take effect from 1 January 2003. The amendment that inserts schedule 2 takes on board representations from the aviation industry. I would like to refer to points raised by two speakers. The member for Batman made the point that repealing regulation 268 under the bill was of concern. The government acknowledges the opposition’s involvement in the amendment to repeal the regulation. It was originally to be repealed by regulation amendment because a new provision was introduced under the bill that replaces the current power under regulation 268. I would also like to acknowledge points made by the honourable member for Kennedy. He was concerned that everyone should have the right to due process. The bill does enhance procedural fairness. For example, Federal Court adjudication of decisions to immediately suspend an authorisation, as well as the automatic stay of decisions on non-serious and imminent breaches, allows operators to continue operating. The regulation 269 amendment will also only allow CASA to cancel an authorisation if the holder has been found guilty or convicted of an offence. In closing, I would like to acknowledge the opposition’s cooperation and constructive input to the development of these amendments. Passage of this bill will ensure that the already excellent aviation safety outcomes in this country are maintained and further improved. MAIN COMMITTEE be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Batman has moved an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

(2) Can the Minister confirm that the Commonwealth agreed to pay Dr Short common law damages if she stopped requesting a coronial inquest; if so, (a) when was this agreement made, (b) who made the agreement, and (c) what is the content of the agreement. (3) Has common law compensation been paid to Dr Short, if not, when will common law compensation be paid; if so, how much was paid. (4) Can the Minister confirm that under the former Government, there was a policy about the Commonwealth being a ‘model litigant’; if so, (a) what were the details of that policy, (b) is it still in place, and (c) what statements has the Minister or other members of the Government made about this policy. (5) Does a ‘model litigant’ policy still apply to government litigation; if so, what are the details of the policy and to which areas of the Government does it apply. (6) Has the policy been changed since 1996; if so, in what manner. (7) Can the Minister confirm that the Government supported the Commonwealth being bound by ‘model litigant’ rules before the administrative tribunals. (8) Was the Department of Defence operating under these ‘model litigant’ rules when dealing with Dr Short; if not, why not; if so, how are the Government’s actions in respect of Dr Short in compliance with the ‘model litigant’ rules. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) There has been no such agreement. (3) Any amounts paid by way of common law compensation to Dr Short are subject to the confidentiality agreement signed by the parties. (4) Yes. (a) The policy was set out in the Attorney-General’s Department Legal Practice Manual. The major principles were: the Commonwealth must not act dishonestly or oppressively, for example, by declining to pay a legitimate claim, by engaging in delaying tactics, by taking advantage of the fact that a claimant does not have the resources to pursue legal proceedings or by instituting vexatious appeals; being a model litigant means being fair but firm; and the requirement of fairness does not mean the Commonwealth is precluded from taking all legitimate steps to pursue claims by it and to test/defend claims against it. (b) Yes. The model litigant obligation is contained in AppendixB to the Legal Services Directions issued by the Attorney-General under the Judiciary Act 1903 (available at www.law.gov.au/aghome/legalpol/olsc/) (c) I have spoken about the Commonwealth’s obligation to act as a model litigant in its handling of claims and litigation on numerous occasions, including to emphasise the importance of the obligation. It would not be practicable to identify each of those occasions. (5) Yes. AppendixB to the Legal Services Directions sets out the Commonwealth’s obligation to act as a model litigant. The obligation requires that the Commonwealth and its agencies act honestly and fairly in handling claims and litigation brought by or against the Commonwealth or an agency by: dealing with claims promptly and not causing unnecessary delay in the handling of claims and litigation; paying legitimate claims without litigation, including making partial settlements of claims or interim payments, where it is clear that liability is at least as much as the amount to be paid; acting consistently in the handling of claims and litigation; endeavouring to avoid litigation, wherever possible; where it is not possible to avoid litigation, keeping the costs of litigation to a minimum, including by not requiring the other party to prove a matter which the Commonwealth or the agency knows to be true, and not contesting liability if the Commonwealth or the agency knows that the dispute is really about quantum; not taking advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim; not relying on technical defences unless the Commonwealth’s or the agency’s interests would be prejudiced by the failure to comply with a particular requirement; not undertaking and pursuing appeals unless the Commonwealth or the agency believes that it has reasonable prospects for success or the appeal is otherwise justified in the public interest; and apologising where the Commonwealth or the agency is aware that it or its lawyers have acted wrongfully or improperly. The obligation applies to Commonwealth departments, other FMA agencies and CAC agencies (excluding government business enterprises and Corporations Law companies controlled by the Commonwealth). (6) In 1999, the model litigant policy was incorporated into the Legal Services Directions, making the obligation to act as a model litigant legally binding on all agencies to which the Directions apply. (7) Yes. The notes to the model litigant policy in the Legal Services Direction expressly state that the policy applies to litigation in tribunals as well as in courts. (8) Yes. In responding to Dr Short’s claim for compensation the Department of Defence at all times complied with the obligations described in AppendixB to the Legal Services Directions. Education: Socioeconomic Status Index (Question No. 2267) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 14 August 2003: (1) Is the Government’s supplementary funding for private schools based on the postcode indicator of parental socio-economic status (SES); if not, can he explain on what basis the supplementary funding is determined. (2) What is the total cost of SES index-based funding. (3) Does this funding ensure that the beneficiary schools reduce their fees to parents; if so, by how much; if not, why not. (4) How many private schools have (a) significantly reduced, (b) increased, and (c) not changed the level of their fees since the introduction of SES index-based supplementary funding and what is the average change in private school fees since the introduction of SES index based funding. (5) Which private schools in Sydney have (a) significantly reduced, (b) increased, and (c) not changed the level of their fees since the introduction of SES index-based funding. (6) Does the Government intend to withhold SES index-based funding from private schools that do not pass on the benefit of this funding to parents in the form of lower school fees; if so, when; if not, why not. (1) The SES funding model involves linking student residential addresses to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) national Census data to obtain a socioeconomic profile of the school community and measure its capacity to support the school. Student residential addresses are mapped to Census Collection Districts (CDs) and each school’s community is defined in terms of the CDs from which it draws its students. The school’s SES score is calculated on the basis of the average socioeconomic status of these CDs. The SES Index that is used to calculate schools’ SES scores measures the income, education and occupation levels of residents within a CD. The CD is the smallest spatial unit in the Australian Standard Geographical Classification. In urban areas CDs average about 220 dwellings. In rural areas the number of dwellings per CD reduces as population densities decrease. (2) Total general recurrent funding under the SES funding arrangements for non-government schools in 2003 is estimated at $3.7 billion. (3) to (6) Schools are accountable to their parent bodies. It is the parents who will decide what level of private investment they will make towards their children’s education and whether they are receiving value for their money. Fee levels are not solely affected by changes in Federal funding arrangements or the SES arrangements more generally. Decisions taken by State Governments with regard to non-government schools may also have an impact on fee levels. While some preliminary analysis indicates a downward pressure on the rate of increase of non-government school fees in some sectors, this is based on only one year’s data for the partially implemented SES funding model. The SES funding model was introduced in 2001 and is being phased-in over the 2001 to 2004 quadrennium with full implementation in 2004. Financial data from non-government schools are collected annually, and are generally available in the second half of the following calendar year. For example, data for 2002 are expected to be available in September/October 2003. Data for the first year of the fully implemented SES funding model should be available in late 2005. Definitive analysis of the effect of the SES funding model will not be possible therefore until several years of data for the fully implemented model are available. Non-government schools are independent organisations and their governing bodies are responsible for setting fee levels. Fees are determined separately by each independent school on the basis of their cost structures. The Government is not in a position to set or limit school fees. To do so would be to interfere in the operation of independent entities. Defence: Vietnam National Order Awards (Question No. 2322) Ms King asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 September 2003: Is she aware of any correspondence between the Holt Australian Government and the South Vietnamese Government indicating that the South Vietnamese Government intended to bestow Vietnam National",205,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003
361,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Order awards to members of D Company for their brave service at the Battle of Long Tan at a parade that was to be held at Nui Dat on 2 September 1966; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) where is the correspondence. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Immediately following the Battle of Long Tan, South Vietnamese Generals Thieu and Khang (Commander III Corps) planned a surprise visit to the Task Force to make individual awards to Australians involved in the Battle of Long Tan. After seeking advice from the Australian Ambassador concerning the foreign awards policy as it existed at the time, the South Vietnamese Government, through General Thieu’s office, was informed that Australians could receive awards, but the permission of Her Majesty The Queen was required for them to be officially accepted. In view of this advice, General Thieu decided against making awards but to mark his visit to the Task Force by the presentation of a plaque and gifts of souvenirs. There is no evidence that an award of a South Vietnamese Unit Citation was ever intended to be awarded. This is highlighted in the Defence Principal Administrative Officer’s Committee meeting minutes of the time in which it states that no comparable South Vietnamese Unit Award to the United States Presidential Unit Citation had been offered in connection with the action at Long Tan. Defence: Honours and Awards (Question No. 2323) Ms King asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 September 2003: (1) Can she explain why the Department of Defence Directorate of Honours and Awards was moved from Melbourne to Canberra and then to Cooma. (2) Can she confirm that systems are now in place in the Directorate of Honours and Awards to alleviate any further delay in the issuing of National Service Medals. (3) Can she explain why, when my constituents have requested in writing that their medals be forwarded to my office, this year the medals have been posted directly to the applicants. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) When the Directorate of Honours and Awards (DHA) was first created in 1997, it consisted of a number of disparate elements; the headquarters element was located in Canberra, ACT; Navy and Air Force Medals Sections in Queanbeyan NSW; and the Army Medals Section in Melbourne, VIC. Co-location in order to achieve more cohesive management of the functions and to improve the internal processes had been under consideration for some time. Suitable accommodation became available in Canberra and all the elements were finally brought together in February 2003. DHA has not moved to Cooma. DHA utilise the services provided by the Defence Service Centre at Cooma to deal with incoming correspondence, and the mailing address has changed to facilitate that process. (2) Yes. The new establishment in Canberra has enabled DHA to restructure and implement many new initiatives. Recruitment and training to replace those Melbourne staff who elected not to relocate to Canberra has been a priority. In regard to the Anniversary of National Service Medal (ANSM), all outstanding applications transferred to Canberra have now been acknowledged. A dedicated ANSM section was re-established in May 2003 and over 13,000 medals have been processed since that time. (3) Unfortunately, it appears that prior to the move of the ANSM Section to Canberra, the processes in place to capture the requirement for medals to be sent directly to them, rather than the applicants’ home address were not adequate. With the establishment of the ANSM section in Canberra, new processes have been put in place to ensure this does not occur in the future. Defence: National Service Medal (Question No. 2363) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 10 September 2003: (1) Does the Government intend to introduce a Defence Force Service Medal for all people who served in the Australian Defence Force; if so, what is the implementation timetable that the Government has decided upon. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Defence Force Service Medal (DFSM) may be awarded to a member of the Australian Defence Force who has, on or after 14 February 1975, completed 15 years efficient service, either continuous or aggregated, as a member of the Australian Defence Force. The Government was mindful that the 1993/94 Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards (CIDA) had investigated the possibility of reducing the 15 year qualification period for the DFSM. After much deliberation, CIDA considered that 15 years was now fully entrenched in the Australian System of Honours and Awards and did not support any variation of this time. In its 1996 election policy statement, this Government stated its acceptance of the CIDA report. At this time, there is no intention to change the criteria for the DFSM. Fuel: Diesel Shortage (Question No. 2482) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 18 September 2003: Further to the answer to question No. 2112 (Hansard, 12 August 2003, page 18190), is he prepared to support the funding of a study to ascertain what would be the effect on the demand for diesel fuel if (a) 10% of road freight movements, (b) 25% of road freight movements, and (c) 40% of road freight movements were transferred to rail; if not, why not. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: This information is not held by the Government. The Member for Lowe could approach the Minister for Transport and Regional Services with a request that this analysis be added to the work programme of the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics.",209,Questions On Notice
