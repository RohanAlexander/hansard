In that impasse we, shall continue. Of course, it is a simple thing for the Australian people to eat meat out of the cold stores, but they will not do that when they can get fresh meat. If we are to interfere in this matter at all, why should we not fix the price of fresh meat? the Government's policy in reference to imports is dictated, not, as it was in England, by a desire to restrict import tonnage to the carriage of munitions and food, but rather to encourage thrift amongst the Australian people, does the Prime Minister propose to restrict the subsequent manufacture in Australia of the articles the importation of which he prohibits ? phases of this problem with which the Government is confronted.

40,Mr Orchard Asked The Minister Re,"training Camps? orable member's question is as f o l l o w s : It is not considered practicable to grant week-end leave to members of the Australian Imperial Force concentrated in Victoria from New South Wales, for the reason that a similar privilege would have to be granted to soldiers from other States, and such leave would .seriously interfere with the training of the troops. All such men were granted final leave before being sent to Victoria for concentration and final training before embarkation. They obtain the same week-end leave as other soldiers, namely, from Saturday, 1 p.m., to Sunday night, 12 p.m., and in cases where family circumstances are distressing additional leave is granted, each application being considered on its merits. The thorough training of the troops cannot be effected if men are allowed additional leave to that which is now authorized. senting t h e M in is t e r for Defence, u p o n notice-1.

This wheat is worth somewhere in the neighbourhood of £30,000,000. It is well known that, owing to the depredations of mice and weevil, a considerable amount of wheat has suffered deterioration, and some of it has been destroyed. I wish to point out very shortly the relaand walled with bagging reinforced, sometimes, with netting, and the bulk handling of wheat, as distinguished from the conservation of the grain. The proposal I £30,000,000, and whicli by next February w ill , probably, owing to the new crop, be worth nearly £50,000,000.

I wish to t u r n now to the question' of storage, and to consider it on its merits, apart from the circumstances in which we are placed, although these circumstances are, in themselves, such as to distinguish this country from any other in relation to such a proposal. Every country that produces grain in any quantities, as, for example, the TJnited States of Americaand Canada, has resorted to the erection of permanent silos. A distinction has to be drawn, and I draw it at once, between Australia and Canada or the TJnited States of America, that, owing to our drier atmosphere, the tendency towards weevil arising out of excess moisture is less here than elsewhere. That, of course, is a matter on which Australia is to be congratulated. This condition applies, however, only to certain parts of Australia, and does not apply to the sea coast. It may be said, on the other hand, that wheat has been kept at Williamstown for a very considerable period, apparently, without weevil being generated, but however that may be in this particular case, this exception is not general. It may even be that there is something other than mere humidity responsible for the generation of this in sect pest. cannot sit down and contemplate the destruction of £50,000,000 worth of wheat. guided by the experience of all other nations, we proceed to the erection of these permanent structures, in which wheat may be kept for an indefinite period In this relation I desire to direct the attention of honourable members to another phase of this most important question, which has a direct bearing on the industrial life of this country. The British Government were approached a little while ago and asked if they would take a portion of our 3,500,000 tons of wheat in flour, and they agreed to do so. When this information was given to the mill-owners they said they were prepared to work the mills three shifts in order to deal with the extra demand. Unfortunately almost immediately afterwards the supply of shipping fell off, and wo were unable to find ihe necessary freight. That had a direct bearing on the milling industry, and the shutting [9]2 down of many flour mills is now-threatened. I am informed that flour w ill not keep in ordinary storage more than six or eight months. I do not express any definite opinion as to how long it will keep when put into bags and placed in a silo. Buti t may be taken for granted that ib will keep longer in silos than in ordinary storage. The proposition to construct silos must) be considered in relation to 'the storing, not only of wheat, but also of flour, if we can make our wheat into floxir, we shall give employment by keeping our mills going, maintain a supply of offal, and thus provide an abundance of cheap food for stock, and at the same time reduce the space needed for export on slr^board by anything from 25 to 33 per cent. The Government have considered this question of wheat storage carefully, both generally and in relation to bulk handling. Very much may be said in favour of bulk handling, and perhaps almost as much against it , and I am not to be understood as committing myself now to bulk handling. Undeniably, bulk handling has been adopted in all the great wheat-producing countries of the world, although it is not therefore necessarily suited to our present requirements; but our position is such as to call for One thing is certain: we special treatment. We have to store wheat which we cannot yet send away. This wheat belongs to us, we having We must do something; and, received payment for the greater part of it , and although the risk in respect of it will pass to the British Government on .the 1st day of January next we shall have to deliver the-, wheat r in good order and condition. We should show ourselves ill fitted to manage the affairs of this great country if we, were ,to permit £50,000,000 of wheat to deteriorate and were thus to slam the door in the face cf the only customer who can buy our next season's crop. I should not care to take the responsibility of endeavouring to sell the next wheat crop if our customer were to be treated in that way. No private firm would treat a client in such a way, and we musb not do it . That is the purely commercial aspect of the matter. It is one of great importance. But there is the national aspect, and this is of infinitely greater importance. We must remember that without this wheat the armies of Great Britain and the Allies w ill be most seriously handicapped. I ask honourable members to look at rthe proposal broadly, and not to direct on iti merely the kind of criticism which, under ordinary circumstances, it might invite. I hope to show before sitting down thab it is based on sound commercial foundations, and that it is such as would recommend it self to any body of business men. I repeat that what we now propose has no necessary relation ,to a bulk-handling scheme, though the silos will be erected at such places and of such a design that, should bulk handling come to be adopted, they would form part of the scheme. is no way in which we could provide for the storing of our wheat more effectively and cheaply than that now proposed, even should bulk-handling of wheat never come to be adopted. It ia proposed under this Bil l to provide for the storage of one-third of our norma] crop, or, roughly, for about 49,000,000 bushels. ject that that is insufficient should remember that there are districts possessing so dry a climate that wheat may be stored there almost indefinitely, if precautions are taken against the devastation of mice. Scientists assert that weevil will not generate in wheat which has a moisture of less than 10 per cent., and our wheat normally does not contain that quantity. Wheat has been stored in some parts of the country for two years without weevil being generated in it . Honourable members are asked to direct their attention to these salient points of the scheme. The storage will have to be provided for, even if the bulk-handling comes to be adopted. not committed scheme, and I express no opinion about it. the problem .of wheat storage in respect of wheat which belongs to us, the will pass to Great Britain 31st December, and, of course, the new season's crop, which may run 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 tons, has also to be considered. last season's wheat, and it alone can buy next season's crop. The wheat is needed to feed Great Britain and her Allies, and it is the business of Australia to see that it is delivered in good order and condition as and When ships can be sent here to take it away. The silos are. to contain in the aggregate nearly Mr Hughes. bushels, and are to be erected at the seaports and in different parts of the country, at points convenient for transport by r a i l and discharge into ships. They are to be constructed of a uniform design, at a uniform price, and the charge to be debited against the wheat stored is to be fixed at so much per bushel per annum. It is proposed to create a Commission, whose members will be a representative of the Commonwealth Government and a representative of the Government of each Statei n which silos are erected. The Commission will deThere termine, as honourable members will see by referring to clause 7, the design of silo to be adopted generally, or the particular design to be adopted in any particular place; the number of silos to be erected, the places where they are to be erected, the .cost of each, and the cost per bushel to be charged for storing wheat therein; Those who may oband it will arrange with the Governments of the respective States for the construction and erection of silos by, or under the supervisiou of, the proper authorities of those States. The .Commonwealth Government w ill, through its representative and its right of veto over expenditure, supervise the whole matter. The Commonwealth's control over the expenditure is plenary. It will lend moneys to the State Governments, which w ill construct the silos to the. design approved by the Commission, either directly or through the agency of the contractor. The Commonwealth Government is the financier; the State Governments will We have to store our wheat. carry out the work, and will pay us in terest on the money borrowed, at a rate to scheme never be fixed, which will be that which we pay The Government is for the money. It is proposed to debit the to (the bulk-handling wheat with a charge sufficient to create a sinking f u n d that w ill extinguish But we are compelled to face the liability in . ten years, and it has been calculated that a charge of £d. per bushel per month on the legal responsibility for which wheat stored will do this, but as the on the charge will be debited against not only the wheat stored, but all the wheat, and from as we propose to store only one-third of the crop, it will be one twenty-fourth Great Britain has bought of a penny per bushel per month. The question of wheat storage was referred to a Wheat Storage Commission, on which were represented the States of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales and the Commonwealth. The report of the Commission was issued on 50,000,000 the 20th June last. The Ministers of the several States and experts were present. They made certain recommendations, and with the exception of the recommendation that the capacity of the silos should be 50,000 bushels, the recommendations were adopted in their entirety. perts wheat men ? Ministers who sat on the Commission were Senator Russell, MrW . T. Graham, MrH . McKenzie, and Mr C. Goode. The experts were MrJ . H . Butters, an engineer of the Tasmanian Government; MrJ . Erazer, Chief Commissioner of Railwaysi n New South Wales; MrF . W . Box, and Mr Graham Stewart, Engineer-inChiefi n South Australia. It has been estimated that the amount of money necessary for this scheme will be £2,858,333, and the B ill provides for the appropriation of a sum not. exceeding £2,850,000. garded as a war measure, as it properly is. The money will be advanced to the States, and the Commonwealth will have the right to veto all expenditure. Commission, upon which the Commonwealth has representation of course, will determine the sites, cost, and design of the silos, and will be able to insure their expeditious construction. The guarantee of repayment! is on the same plane as ordinary transactions between the States and the Commonwealth. The States incur a liability, and they are to meet it as agreed upon between the parties. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE W h a t do the Government propose to do for the protection of the wheat which is not stored in silos ? plain that owing to the happy circumstances of this country a certain. proportion of our wheat can be stacked in dry districts almost indefinitely. proportion cannot be, and we must have enough wheat at the seaboard and on the railways in order to be able to ship it as transport becomes available. As regards the wheat stacked under present conditions, I should like to say that, made wiser by not think the mice problem need be regarded as insuperable. ever, is. a problem of a different character, and is not; to be solved so. easily. Still we have the assurance of scientists that the weevil cannot develop where there is less than 10 per cent, of moisture, and that with the arrangements contemplated under this scheme the conditions favorable to the generation of this pest will not exist. I should just like to make a brief the exreference to the position of the States. As honourable members know, the control of the wheat pool has been in the hands of the Australian Wheat Board, which is composed of representatives of the four wheat-producing States and the Commonwealth. The Commission to which I have referred was appointed as a result of a .recommendation by the Wheat Board, and with the apEngineer-in-Chiefi n Victoria; proval of the Commonwealth Government. Some of the wheat-producing States are not in agreement as to the details of this scheme, and one of them now disagrees as to the principle of permanent storage. No useful purpose can be served by going into The measure is to be rethe details of those differences at this stage. We have the authority of the wheat-producing States, with the exception of Western Australia, to proceed with the The scheme. A t any rate the Commonwealth is doing its part in the matter. If the States are unable to agree, somebody must do the work, and the only authority that can do it is the Commonwealth. I should be most reluctant for the Commonwealth to accept this great responsibility, but, after all, there is a responsibility. The work must be done, and men must be saved in spite of themselves. This expenditure of £2,850,000,. spread over the tremendous asset! it will cover, which will be £50,000,000 in February next, and over the aggregate value of the wheat crops of the next ten years is really an insignificant amount. A t any rate, it is a premium for an in surance against risk; it is a necessary corollary of our Wheat Pool. It is imA certain possible to finance wheat crops which we cannot ship unless we can preserve in good condition the asset on which the money is advanced. It is an essential part, too, of our policy for the vigorous prosecution of the war that we should, on our part, do all things necessary to conexperience, I do serve this invaluable asset, without which Britain and our Allies will be most The weevil, howgrievously handicapped. I commend the measure to the House, and trust that it will be adopted. I shall be glad to supply any further information",12,Second Reading

69,Mr Hughes,"I have tried to exImat may be considered necessary, but I ask bonorable members to treat the B ill as an urgent national measure. tainly not even by the most vivid imagination can it be regarded as a party measure. It is one which possibly may involve Commonwealth action as opposed to State action, but in that matter, I take it , honourable members will not find opportunity for party differences. I do not say for a moment that honourable members may not suggest amendments. If any amendment tending to promote the smoother working of the scheme is put forward we shall welcome it , but I invite honourable members to proceed to the discussion of the B ill in that spirit of recognition of our national needs which the circumstances demand. I think we shall all hail this measure as one of great urgency and as absolutely necessary in order to preserve our wheat. The explanation of it which the Prime Minister has given will meet with general agreement. But it appears to me that, in one respect, the provision which the Government proposes to make is inadequate in this exceptional period. The Prime Minister proposes to provide silos for the storage of one-third"" of the normal Australian crop, and yet he has told us that we are likely to have the whole of the last crop purchased by the Imperial Government on our hands at the end of the -year. In other words, we shall have approximately 6,000,000 tons of wheat in Australia, and if the scheme provides silos for only one-third of the normal crop, probably at the end of the year there w i ll be 5,000,000 tons of wheat for which there will be no storage accommodation whatever. outlined by the Prime Minister is based on estimates which have been framed from time to time by various Commissions that have dealt with the question of the bulk handling of wheat in Australia. All these Commissions have told us that the proper thing to do is to provide for silo storage to the extent of about one-third of the normal year's wbeat crop. cient shipping to take away the grain, we will need, in normal years, storage accommodation at the seaboard to the extent of one-third of the year's crop. We can cordially support the scheme put forward, not only because of the peculiar circumstances of the war that have forced it upon Australia, but also because it w ill be the foundation of a bulk-handling scheme Cerwhich would, in any case, have had to be introduced in the Commonwealth before very long. The farmers will be prepared to pay whatever charges are necessary for keeping in good order that wheat which has already been purchased by the Imperial Government, and for making provision for the new crop that is coming in ; but I hope that, side by side with this scheme, the. Government will see that the administration of the wheat pool next year will not bring about a repetition of the conditions that we have had this year. The silos that are to be built will be filled mostly by the wheat already purchased by the Imperial Government, and this will mean that next year's crop will need to be stacked at the railway stations close to where it is grown, or brought to the seaboard and stacked in bags, as it is at present. It is a question whether larger storage facilities should not be provided to enable the great bulk of the proposed new season's grain to be poured info stores at a very much cheaper rate than is now, and which, at the same time, w i ll conserve most of the wheat already stacked unti l it can be taken away. I regard and support tbe present proposal as only a step towards the handling of the large quantities of wheat that w ill be required to be stored until shipping can take them away. If the proposal were merely to make 'provision to deal with the balance of the two pools already waiting to be taken away, the House would hardly be justified in undertaking the expenditure in connection with it , because of its in adequacy, but the expenditure can be justified when the scheme is considered as The scheme which has been being a step towards the bulk handling of wheat in Australia. as to the way in which wheat has been carried overseas in bulk ? gation has been made in the wheat-growing States in Australia as to the advisability of bulk hapdling of wheat.

I -do not know thab there has been any proper test of the bulk shipment of wheat from Australia. We have had evidence that, in tlie case of one ship's cargo from New South Wales, there was a little t r a c e of sweating, but there has been no proper experiment such as would justify us in -saying tliat wheat cannot be shipped in bulk to Europe less advantageously than from the other countries that I have named. ister has said that arguments can be raised against the bulk handling of wheat almost as weighty as those which can be advanced in favour of it . I have given the question a close study, and I have read the reports of experts and various Commissions that have taken evidence in f u l l upon the question. In my opinion, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of bulk handling, as compared with the carrying of wheat in bags. In Canada the wheat is very much.more humid than the grain grown in Australia, and it has to be carried over the railway lines in large quantities, as has to be done in Australia. The export from Canada is certainly greater than that of Australia, b u t not so much greater as to show any great disparity in the conditions of the two countries. As I have already said, the bulk-handling -scheme has been adopted in the TJnited States of America, Canada, India, and part of Russia, and in no instance has any country which has adopted it reverted to bag handling. hand, they are not enthusiastic in regard to bulk handling. are continuing its use. I have seen no -evidence to show that where it has been adopted their faith in the efficacy of the -system has been shaken. there are very few places in the TJnited Kingdom where provision is made for receiving wheat in bulk ? reports on this matter is that of Met-ealfe aiid Barnard, as well as other official sent down by some wheat-growers of rreports. Metcalfe .and Barmard, who came out When honourable members rise to speak -3aere with thousands of pounds to splash upon this matter I hope that they w ill about in order to get the bulk-handling system adopted by the Australian States. reviewed by the Victorian Railways Commissioners, who some time previously had reported against the bulk-handling scheme, and they declared thab the report generally was one upon which reliance could be placed. According to this report, provision is made for receiving bulk cargoes of wheat at London, Liverpool, Birkenhead, Glasgow, Birmingham, Leith, Manchester, and Cardiff. Similar provision is made iat Marseilles and Bordeaux, in France, and at Belgian and The PrimeM in Dutch ports. Sometimes the wheat received in bulk is bagged on arrival, and at other times it is discharged into barges, which are taken to the flour mills, which have their own elevators, and l if t tlie wheat from the barges by pneumatic 1 pumps. Our maximum Australian crop was that of the 1915-16 season, when about 179,000,000 bushels of wheat were garnered. If we could heave got all that wheat away our export would have been greater than that of Canada. I think that it will be easy to adapt the bulkhandling system to Austnaliau conditions. There are certain differences between the conditions of Australia and America. Most of our wheat is taken off by the stripper or harvester, a very small portion being cut by the reaper and binder and ultimately threshed by a threshing machine. If we adopt the bulk-handling system, we will not only have a better crop, but we will also be relieved of considerable labour difficulties. Under the present system there are strikes at the dumps, where the wheat has to be handled in and out of the nailway trucks, and at the ships' sides. The use of elevating machinery controlled by skilled labour earning high rates of pay will relieve us of much' of this danger from industrial disputes, while at the same time the general cost of handling will be lowered by about four-fifths. The lumping of wheat bags into ships' holds, which is not the best class of work tliat men should be engaged in , will also be avoided.

Another important matter is the question of the cost of cornsacks. Australia spent from £1,250,000 to £1,500,000 last year on cornsacks. Under the proposed, bulk-handling system the sacks, especially if they be of superior quality, could probably be used for four or five years. This scheme, unlike those adopted in other, countries, will not call for an alteration in the whole system of harvesting the grain and transporting it by waggons to the nearest railway stations. Underi t we shall continue the use of bags. The wheat will be bagged and conveyed' on waggons to the railway stations, where the mouths of the bags can be readily cut open and the wheat poured into the silos erected there. From the silos the wheat will be loaded into trucks and carried in bulk to the sea-board. One of the most potential means for the destruction of bags is the dumping that takes place while they are being filled at the winnowers. necessitate new railway rolling-stock? 1 trucks employed on the Victorian railways could be adapted to the purpose of this scheme at a cost of a few thousands of pounds. honourable member is an authority on many subjects, but on this I prefer to take the report of the Victorian Railways Commissioners. In Victoria-and the conditions operating here do not differ widely from those prevailing in other parts of the continent-the adoption of this system will lead to a great saving of time, because, in the first place, it will not be necessary to sew up the bags. They will simply be tied at the mouth, taken by means of waggons to the various railway stations, and emptied into the elevators there. The wheat will, in due » course, ""be loaded into the trucks, in bulk, from the elevators, carried to the seaside, and transferred by pneumatic machinery from the trucks into the silos, and thence .into the ships. effected, as well as the saving in the use of bags, which must result from the adoption of the bulk-handling system, will probably represent upwards of £1,000,000 per annum. The system will tend also to an improved sample, and should make for more expedition in the handling of the wheat. It should likewise make for cheapness, not only' in conveying the wheat in bulk on our railways, but for a saving in shipping freights. coming here be prepared to take wheat in bulk? growing countries, where wheat is handled in bulk, no difficulty has been experienced in that regard, and surely the vessels coming to Australia would be no less enterprising than they are in respect of the grain carried from other parts of the world. What they are prepared to do elsewhere they will do here. The adoption of this system would lead also to economy in wharfage space, and the great saving of time in connection with the loading of ships would lead also to a reduction in the wharfage fees that are paid under the present bagging system. I think that, apart from any question of laying the foundation of the bulkhandling scheme, the Prime Minister's proposal is one that can well receive the support of the House. If it were part of a general scheme to store the whole of the wheat, and to conserve it until it can be taken away, then I should say that it was quite inadequate for the purpose. The criticism that I have to level at this scheme is that it has been adapted almost wholly from the recommendations made by various Commissions which have sat in Australia, and which have reported on a system of bulk-handling under normal conditions of wheafcgrowing and wheat transport. These Commissions have stated that in such circumstances provision must be made for a storage capacity equal to about one-third of the season's crop, and their recommendations have been based upon the assumption that there would be no lack of vessels to take away our supplies. If the wheat could be removed overseas at reasonable intervals, as it would be under normal conditions, then a storage capacity equal to one-third The saving of time of the season's crop would be all that waa reasonably necessary to enable the system to work smoothly.",17,Second Reading

Minister regards this as, an absolutely necessary war-time scheme apart altogether from any consideration as to whether it should form part of a general scheme for the bulk-handling of wheat. He stated that it was to be quite distinct. machinery, as compared with the rate It is to be equal to about one-third of a normal year's crop, and is to provide storage for the wheat purchased by the British Government, which we have to hand over in good condition on 1st January next, as well as for the next season's crop. I hope that, in connection with this scheme, the Government will take -into consideration the necessity of going into the whole question of the administration of the Wheat Pool. If this proposal is to represent the total storage to be provided by the Government in respect of the crop purchased by the Imperial authorities, as well as for the crop to be harvested at the end of this year, then it seems to me that it will be absolutely necessary to stack the whole of next year's crop at the railway sidings, just as was done last year. If that is to be the position, we should, at once, so perfect our administration of the Wheat Pool as to enable the wheat to be preserved from the ravages of mice and weather. The question of making provision for next year's crop, as well as for the balance of the crop of 1915-16, also involves the guarantee which the Government are to give our wheat-growers in respect of next year's crop and that of the following year. In some quarters there has been an agitation to secure a reduction in the normal price of wheat, so as to enable the consumers to obtain cheaper bread. I hope that every representative of a rural constituency will strenuously oppose any attempt to reduce the price of wheat below its par or normal level. In the early stages of the Wheat Fool, as a matter of fact, the price of wheat'came down several pence below the par price, and that was at a time when the shortage of shipping was not as great as it is to-day. Calculations which have been made by wheat growers and organizations of farmers, with experience to guide them, go to show that under present conditions it is impossible to grow wheat, even with a fair crop, for less than 4s. a bushel. calculation. the conclusion which has been arrived at by representative organizations. We are all aware that the.farmer to-day has to pay a largely increased price for his ruling in previous years,, This is largely due to the substantial increase in the cost of the raw materials. In addition to that, the price of cornsacks has largely increased, railway freights are to be raised, and farming requirements generally are dearer than ever. These costs are enormously higher now than they have been during the last four years. During the last few years wages have likewise increased to the extent of about one-third. wages have been doubled. The wages of wheat-stackers, for example, have been increased by fully one-third, and in some cases their claims have been quite impossible. If the Government, by adopting the price-fixing policy advocated in certain quarters, are going to bring down the price of wheat below what might be regarded as the normal value, it will tend only to put land out of cultivation"". It is a well-known fact that schemes adopted in different parts of the world for the purpose of unduly reducing prices, have, in the ultimate result, served only to increase prices by reducing the area put under cultivation. The experiment has been tried in Germany with ghastly and disastrous results. The people of Great Britain are profiting by the experience of some of the Continental countries. The authorities there declare that, in seeking to encourage an increase in primary production, theirfirst consideration must be to secure for such production a paying price. Unless that be secured, land will go but of cultivation. Price-fixing at a rate below that which might be called the normal value is sure to bring about a reaction in this country, as it has done in every country where the experiment has been tried. per bushel will pay.",18,Second Reading

The farmers of Australia are prepared loyally to do their best to help the Empire.

In order to illustrate the necessity for the careful handling of this question, I would point out that in Victoria during the last four years the population of our agricultural districts has been reduced to the extent of 7,000 or 8,000.

The report goes on to say that, with the growth of the normal crop the rate is likely to democrease, but still the Commissioners aro satisfied that a charge of one farthing per bushel should be made on the storage provided. It is further said that this charge does not include handling, which is a separate consideration, and that the Commissioners are of opinion that the charge should not exceed one farthing in the first instance, and one-eighth of a penny on subsequent handling that may be found necessary <I am in favor of the Government getting through their business as quickly as possible; but, in my opinion, the Prime Minister would have been better advised to have postponed the debate on ths second reading of this B ill , and brought I must ask the the other measures foreshadowed up to the same stage.

The only amendment made by the B ill of the Act is that the person accused must satisfy the Attorney-General that he is a natural-born British subject, born in Australia. It is merely putting the onus on him to prove that he has been born in Australia-whic h he ought to be able ito do easily enough. ' I do not think that there can be any reasonable objection taken to that provision. TheB ill makes it an offence against the Act to contribute money or goods to an unlawful association, or to receive or solicit subscriptions either in money or goods for an unlawful association. this disinterested band of reformers proceed on their way is by instituting raffles for the relief of those patriotic persons who were imprisoned for endeavouring to set Sydneyi n . flames. They organize a raffle, and, by representations to the State Attorney-General, obtain permission to do so, probably on the ground that the proceeds are to be devoted to the relief of the wives and families of these men. They tell the nublic, in whose in terest, of course, they are sleepless in their efforts, that they propose to give them a perfectly good piano, worth £88 or thereabouts, for Is. And then they conspire with one another to buy a perfectly useless piano, fake it up, and unload it on the poor unfortunate who draws the winning ticket. Of such is the kingdom of the Industrial Workers of the World. Unfortunately for them, this scheme went agley, owing to the fact that the gentleman who drew the winning ticket said he would rather have the money. There are now "" wigs on the green,"" I understand, as the money, I assume, has gone the way of all moneys such circumstances, ' and there are very few tunes to be got out of tbe piano. I would be the last man in the world to deport the perpetrator of an amusing swindle of that kind. Anybody who goes in for raffles must expect to be raffled.

I regard the proposal to erect silos for the storage of our wheat carry-over as an excellent one. There seems to be a diversity of opinion as to the value of the bulk-handling system, and itlooks as if some Governments are likely to lose their heads over the question. If tbe debate this afternoon is an indication of the state of mind of those individuals who have so recently come together in one party, the happy family created on the 5th May is likely to break up on this matter. From the manner in which the debate was nearly allowed to lapse, one might infer that this was either a stop-gap measure, or one prepared in order to give the represen tatives of country constituencies an opportunity to make speeches with which to tickle the ears of their electors. I , however, do nob regard the ""measure in that light. To my mind, the proposal in tlie B ill represents a good policy, and if we utilize to the fullest' extent those powers which society should be able to exercise in its own interest we shall not stop at the siloing of wheat, but w ill take steps to ensure that the brigands of commerce are not allowed to juggle w i th our products as they are doing, even to the extent of dumping the surplus at sea in order to make a market.

The honourable member for Balaclava referred to Australia as one of the greatest democracies in the world. Who made it so? That boast is possible only because of the work of the walking delegate. There are walking delegates on the Government side -me n who first entered public life through being walking delegates for the much abused Australian Workers Union. I suppose these references arose out of the discontent of honourable members opposite in regard to the amount paid to the men who lumped their wheat. It was left to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, when a Minister of a former Government, to make his name immortal by reducing the loads which the lumpers were supposed to carry. The employers did not mind filling a wool bale with wheat and ordering men to lump it . AgainI say, God speed the walking delegate, because such hardships w ill never be allowed while he is on the spot. The honourable member for Hindmarsh is one of the men indicted by bhese charges against the walking delegates, because be was president of the Port Adelaide Working Men's Association, which comprises the men who do all the wheat lumping at that port. member man enough to stand up in defence of walking delegates when they are this impugned by men on his side of the House?

That does not look as if the ' ' walking delegaje"" has killed the industry.

We have the wheat here for their supply, and want to take care of it. If the attitude of the South Australian farmers is maintained, there is no provision for them to come in under this Bill. Committee. to do so if it becomes necessary, but I am sure the Prime Minister and the Government will be prepared to hear the South Australian position. If the South Australian farmers make out a good case, it is inconceivable to me that the Government or Parliament would stand in their way. unanimous on your point of view? Prime Minister's statement that the three wheat-growing States-Ne w South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia-were in unanimous agreement at the Conference is perfectly correct, but the previous Government in South Australia were determined, by hook or by crook, that the State should have the bulk-handling system instituted. They went so far as to make a deal with. Metcalfe and Company, and paid a very big sum for the plans. They submitted the matter to Parliament, and Parliament turned down the scheme. Possibly no question of public interest has been more exhaustively and critically discussed by the farmers in that State during the last eighteen months than the question of bulk handling. It is claimed by one of the farmers' organizations that 90 j>er cent, of the farmers of that State are absolutely against bulk handling for South Australia. multiplicity of ports in South Australia? sonal opinion is that quite 90 per cent, of the fanners of South Australia are against bulk handling. The honourable member for Wimmera quoted Metcalfe's. Metcalfe and Company, or their agents, represent about the cleverest men that ever came from either Canada or Yankeeland, and their position was put by them as applicable to South Australia equally with Victoria and New South Wales. Mr SA MrsoN I also quoted from the exhaustive report of the Royal Commission in Victoria. seen that report, and agree that if bulk handling is good anywhere it is appropriate for Victoria and New South Wales, because they concentrate all their wheat shipping at about two ports. We do not object. In fact, the South Australian farmers hope that Victoria and New South Wales will take it on, and we will stand by and see how they get along. Why should all three States take on the experiment? Why not let one State try it? It is not my business or South Australia's business. South Australia objects because it has a port about every 12 miles all round its coast-line, and if the principle of bulk handling were adopted in that State, it could only apply effectively to Port Adelaide, Port Pirie, and Wallaroo. silos at the other ports also. not pay. A gentleman in South Australia took this matter up with great skill and industry. He obtained facts and figures from every part of the world, and was ""supported by the grain merchants right up to the hilt. He knocked the Metcalfe peopie kicking, nnd they could not come at it again. The experience of bulk handling everywhere goes to prove that a State which is shipping wheat all round its coast cannot have it. It costs too much. I want to dispose of another fallacy. ""All thc great wheat countries have not bulk handling. Most of them have, but when you come to deal with the United Kingdom in the matter of selling your wheat, you find that they have not provision there at all the great centres to handle wheat in bulk. Indeed, they have provision at relatively few centres. for bulk loading very expensive? very big thing.

229,Mr Richard Foster,"It is acf the cost of the machinery for bulk loading? When the wheat goes to London to be distributed in the provinces, a big proportion of the buyers in the provinces cannot take it in bulk, but must have it in bags, and a shipment of wheat in bags w ill bring a little more than a shipment in bulk. If South Australia does not intend to adopt bulk-handling, bufc is prepared to submit to the Prime Minister a scheme that will be equally effective, and less expensivea scheme, in short, that will do for her a great deal more than would result from her entering into an arrangement with the other Statesf o r the construction of silosI trust that -the Government will give some consideration to her representations. The right honourable gentleman has admitted that the provision for silos under this B ill will meet the requirements of less than a third of a normal harvest.

We are dealing with .this question not a moment too soon, and should make the protection of our wheat as complete as possible. There is exposed in Australia to-day a lot of wheat which ought to have been reconditioned and properly protected long ago. I am referring more .particularly now to wheat in my own State, but I believe my remarks will (apply to some of the other States. It is heart-rending to see in South Australia wheat stacks-som e of them comprising not less than 100,000 Sometimes we store our bags-in such a condition that one can hardly distinguish them from a heap of refuse. One can scarcely see the bags. If in South Australia we From the top to the bottom of these stacks one can see more grain than bags, and for some weeks, notwithstanding their condition, there has been only a handful of men at work on them. ' of wheat at country stations in South Australia ? within the last ten days I have been informed of attempts being made to recondition some of them with a single winnower and by the employment of four or five men. If these men worked twelve hours per day .they could not recondition some stacks in the next seven months. producers knew so much more than other f £11*211 G ITS mers have nothing to say in the matter. This is a question for the Central Wheat Pool; but I point out that the stacks are not suffering one fifth as much from the depredations of mice as from exposure to weather, and if labour had been commandeered-as ought to have been the case-and 16s. per day paid, and if the Railways Commissioners had been obliged to run the trains nighfc and day to get this The three silos wheat away, the loss would not have been nearly so serious.

It seems to me that this responsibility only existed in the imagination. plague that could not have been foreseen. that, but then we had a statement in the public press that there would be a limitation of this responsibility under these abnormal conditions.

I should like the representative of the Central Board to remind the authorities in my own State that valuable produce-upo n which Great Britain and some of our Allies are dependingshould be more effectively protected than has been the case during the last few months TheB ill before us, perhaps with some amendments, will probably receive practically the unanimous support of tlie House. From the remarks of the honourable member who preceded me, I understand the producers in his^own State do not wish to participate in a scheme for silo construction for the storage of wheat. I trust that this storage scheme, introduced in these abnormal times, will be adhered to as long as Australia is a grain-growing country. I have no doubt that many honourable members opposite believe, not only in the storage of grain in war time, but that this is an excellent opportunity to adopt the system as a protection against seasons of drought. We all hope that Australia will never be in the straits she found herself in as the result of the 1914 harvest failure, when at least half the grain required for gristing purposes had to be imported. W it h a proper system of storage there is no reason why Australia should not be thoroughly protected against any contingency of that kind in the future, for it is well known that if we send abroad for grain, very often we get an inferior article at an enhanced price, and have to consume bread of inferior quality. 1915. and I do not wish that experience to be repeated. also be applied to other foodstuffs. I do not know whether,, as a result of a shortage in freight during the next two or three years, we shall be able to export as much beef and mutton as Australia has formerly, but it is not likely, and as a result we shall be able to build up our herds and nocks again. I come now to another serious aspect of this question. Australia, I believe, is going to play a very important part in the feeding of Great Britain and her Allies in the near future. It is well known that wheat production shows a considerable falling off in the United States, Canada, and the Argentine, and with Russian wheat still locked up, Australia with her two last great harvests, will be an important factor in provisioning Great Britain and her Allies on the Western and other Fronts. The figures for production in the United Statesf or 1915 give a total of 126,000,000 quarters,, while the 'estimated yield for 1916 was only 75,000,000, so that in stead of having close on 1,000,000,000 bushels, of which 400,000,000 bushels could be exported to other lands, the Republic may have to import to supply her own requirements. Canada, -instead of having 250,000,000 bushels for export this year w ill have only 80,000,000 bushels, and the Argentine, we know, is short of wheat. I should like to show how France, above all other countries, took time by the forelock in the way of providing grain and other foodstuffs for her own people. Some of us have used eulogistic terms in describing the action which our Prime Minister took in the way of the purchase of ships, but the Commissioner of foodstuffs in France, and other authorities there, were quite early in ithe field in this regard, with a view t b obtaining sufficient grain for the needs of their country. A t the beginning of the war the French Commissioner had an absolutely free hand in this direction, and took immediate action? I believe, without even consulting the other members of the Cabinet. France, of course, is a large producer of wheat, but in the first' year of the war, in order to meet her own requirements, she had to import1,400,000 tons, and in the second year 1,600,000 tons, while it is estimated that this year it w ill be necessary for her to acquire some 2,500,000 tons. I presume that the British Government w ill operate with or through the Commonwealth Government!, with a, view to seeing that Australia supplies our All y with a This storage principle might large proportion of the grain she requires. I mention these facts to show how keenlv France realized the necessity for action of this kind.

These facts show that the fixing of prices, combined with organization, is a blessing tb the nation, and I hope that, in connection with our own storage scheme, attention will be paid to the consumer. Farmers, as a section of the community, have a right to a legitimate return for their labour, and when t h at return has been fixed there should be no greediness. It is strange that we in Australia, who have enjoyed two of the most bountiful harvests we have ever seen, should be paying more for our bread now than we have ever paid before, even more than in 1902, when there was one of the most serious droughts in our history.

The fact that so many millions of bushels of wbeat are stacked in the Commonwealth is no reason why the price should be reduced below what is fixed by the operations of the world's markets. It is the shortage in the world's supply that controls the fixing of prices. In referring to the mice plague,",40,Fosteb No Able Member Desired On The Committee

It ia proposed to appoint a Commission consisting of a representative of the Commonwealth and a representative of each of the wheat-growing States. Now, one of the reasons why the administration of the Wheat Pool has been a failure is that it has been too much in the hands of politicians. The State Boards have been Caucus yesterday, but I take it that the controlled by politicians, and the Central proposed Commission will be constituted Board is composed of the Ministers of similarly to the Central Wheat Board. Agriculture of the various States, with the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth tends to erect silos for the storage of as Chairman. These politicians are good enough in their way, but they know nothing about wheat growing, as is evident from their administration. In this matter I confirm what has been said by the honourable member for Wakefield. I have just been through my electorate, There must have been about and I say that the,manner in which the wheat has been destroyed by mice is disgraceful. Much of the grain looks more A t the conference, 120 branches like oatmeal than wheat. The scheme is to be debited to the Wheat Pool. A leading member of the New South Wales The average cost given was Wheat Board, with whom I was in conversation on the subject, argued that this was fair, because, he said, the wheat belongs to the farmer, who has been given a certificate for it ; that it is as much his as the money which a man places in a depositor. The real position is, however, dition to the political members of the Commission, there should be an equal number of farmers' representatives. That would ensure the careful storage of the wheat. not say that he would be Chairman of the Commission and that its other members would be politicians.

291,Mr Pigott,"I did not attendwheat, whicb, if necessary,"" can be used at some future date for handling it in bulk. about 49,000,000 bushels of wheat, or for about one-third of a year's crop. The sheds at the country railway stations in New South Wales would store about one-third more of the wheat produced in the State; the remaining third will have to be shipped away as quickly as possible. We hope that the present block to the export will not long continue. I cannot understand why the bulk handling of wheat should be objected to. ference of New South Wales wheat growers unanimously favoured the bulk handling of wheat, and most wheat growing countries handle their wheat in bulk. About 60 per cent, of the Argentine wheat is handled in bulk, and 90 per cent, of the wheat received in London comes in bulk. I do not know where the honourable member for Wakefield obtained the information that they are not prepared to receive wheat in bulk in Great Britain. All the wheat received in Liverpool goes there in bulk, and recently when a shipment came in bags, these had to be cut to pieces to enable the cargo to be unloaded by means of elevators. The farmers are victimized under the bagging system. On looking through the figures furnished by Mr Knibbs, I find that for the last two years we imported £4,000,000 worth of jute goods, including, I suppose, £800,000 worth of wheat bags each year-that is, £1,600,000 worth for the two years. I recollect that not many years ago, when I was farming in New South Wales, we used to get 4-bushel wheat bags of extra quality for about 4s. 6d. per dozen, whereas to-day the farmer gets a 3-bushel bag-that is a Chapman bag-a t 10s. 6d. per dozen, and bags of a very inferior quality indeed. It is high time, I think, that some action was taken in this respect. For that reason, I advocate the principle of bulk handling. Under the present system the Government allow about 2£d. per bushel to the farmer or. the agent for the handling of the wheat from the railway truck right up to the steamer. In the United States of America, under the bulk-handling system, the cost is £d. per bushel. By adopting the bulk-handling system we will save something like 500 per cent, in the cost of handling. I have [10] here a note showing that American steamers containing 10,000 tons of grain This storage is to provide for in bulk are loaded and discharged in ten hours. In otjier words, it takes one hour to load and unload 1,000 tons of wheat, or one-third of the time which would be required if the grain were bagged. I wish now to point out the advan' tages of the bulk-handling system as regards the capacity of the ships. One ton of American bagged wheat, which is equal to 2,000 lbs., disA conplaces 53 cubic feet in the hold of a ship, whereas 1 ton of bulk wheat displaces 46f cubic feet, showing a difference of 6^ cubic feet in favour of shipping the grain in bulk. In other words, there is a saving of 12 per cent, in space. I think that at this particular time, when shipping is so scarce, this point should weigh very heavily with the Ministry. I learn, on the authority of Sir Thomas Price, that at the London Docks the cost of unloading wheat in bulk is about one-fourth of that which it costs to unload bagged wheat. The honourable member for Wakefield stated that hardly any of the English ports have adopted the bulkhandling system. I remind him, as I did early in my address, that 90 per cent, of the wheat received in bulk in London, and also the whole of the wheat received at Leith, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Hull, and numerous other minor ports in the Old Country, is unloaded by means of the elevators. I hope that the people in the various States will adopt the bulk-handling system. I am very pleased to be able to mention that a Bill for that purpose is now before the Parliament of New South Wales. I be_ lieve that that system will be adopted by that State, and I expect that before very long the farmers of South Australia will perceive the advantages accruing from the system, and realize the necessity for taking steps to effect a saving of about £1,500,000 a year for the Commonwealth farmers Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [9.21] I am very pleased that the Government have introduced this Bill. The question of the storage of wheat under the silo, or elevator, system has been the battle'dore and shuttlecock of politics for many years, and now, under the necessity caused by the war, the promises which were made to the farmers year after year are being and to reimburse the farmers' wheat pool brought to fruition. The Bill contains some imperfections, responsibility, as he should do, the onus which I hope will be -remedied in Comis on the Government to subsidize the mittee. Calare has just mentioned an imperfechas been delivered by the farmers to the tion whioh was in my mind, and in pool in good order and condition. connection with which I had framed an amendment.

Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member has my support in connection wibh this Bill. The honourable member and myself worked together in the party for a considerable time, and I suppose we are both as reasonable as we were then. Thisis not a party measure in any shape or form, as has been evidenced by the discussion in the House to-night. making bitter party attacks on me already. Mr J. H . OATTS -It is hard to think, of the honourable member without thinking also of the party issue. It is very difficulty for him to get away from it.

CATTS -The honourable member might like to see them get 30s., but he would oppose every means iby which they might get it . I hope the improvements that have been suggested will be made in the Bill as it goes through Committee, and that it will be an instalment of a very useful reform. think the Government does well to approach the question of the storage of grain, even though the Bill be merely an instalment of what I believe to be an ill-thought-out scheme of storage or a scheme in connection with which the House has not been sufficiently informed. There is not a more important question for the Australian Legislature to deal with than that of storage, because we have in the Commonwealth at least one and two-thirds normal harvests, of wheat banked up and stored with no immediate prospect of transport, in all, 165,000,000 bushels. In the language of the Commissioners, it would take 900 ships each of 5,000 tons capacity to get it away. We also have the prospect within a few months of another normal harvest. Upon the general question of storage, the Government cannot do too much, but it has the right to take the House into ita confidence as to what is really designed by this Bill. It is entitled "" A Bill for an Act relating to Wheat Storage,"" but it does not go far before it indicates in what way it proposes to deal with storage, for it uses the term "" silo,"" and thereby cuts out the system of storage that has been in operation in the past. It will not be amiss to review the methods by which wheat has been handled and stored in the past. The system in operation hitherto has been that in some country districts the farmers, either themselves or through their organizations, have built farmers' stores. Some States have also built storages in the country, butthere is little internal storage in the States under the control of the Government, and the main storage of wheat in Australia is of the crudest and most inexpensive kind possible. That is the system of providing dunnage and iron on top, and in a normal year that wheat gets through with infinitesimal loss, and even gains weight. The question of wheat storage has been exaggerated by reason of the visitation of the mice plague, and experienced farmers will look back twenty-five years for a parallel season. In fact, in the history of wheat-growing in Australia there has never been a parallel season so far as destruction by mice is concerned. I mention this at this stage because a lot of people run away with the idea that the provision of storage will prevent the recurrence of what has just been happening.",48,Fosteb No Able Member Desired On The Committee

325,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [9.58],"II have gone most carefully through the report of the Commissioners who hacve been intrusted with the task of advising the Government on the question. No practical man will say that this is a report upon which he can cast an intelligent vote for the adoption of the bulk-handling system. This Bill, and the debate which has ensued on it, has elearly shown that what is now before the House is an instalment of the bulk-handling system. It cannot be said to be anything else. If the Government are going to deal with the bulk-handling system, let them come right out with the proposal and give us all the fundamental principles upon which that system is based. Let them go into primal costs, storage costs, handling costs, and transport costs, and let the producers and the country generally know which of the two systems is the more acceptable. I have some sympathy with the remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield, who feels his farmers are not yet prepared to accept the bulk-handling system, because the principle has never been thoroughly threshed out in Australia. The Commission says it has arrived at its conclusion from the evidence taken, but nowhere in the report is there evidence that the Commissioners have sat down to the fundamental problems of the bulk handling sysr tem, which, if it be adopted in Australia, must be adopted in to to. If this Bill passes, Australia is in for a dual system of'handling wheat. have them. Here is provision ""to deal with the storage of only one-third of a normal harvest, although we have 165,000,000 bushels of wheat in Australia,, or one and two-thirds normal harvests, with another harvest four months off. All the statements made by the Prime Minister, and all -the reasons given by the Commissioners in their report, would be good and sufficient if advocated in respect of the major portion of the wheat to he dealt with. If only one-third of a normal harvest is to-be protected from the weevil at a time when there is no shipping in sight, by the time the shipping comes here the weevil will lave consumed the bulk of the wheat. I take it that the only possible reason for the introduction of the silo system of istorage would be to protect, at any rate, that portion of the wheat which has been sold to the British Government. I should be prepared to debate in every one of its aspects the bulk-handling system as well as -the present system, and this House should be given the opportunity of going into every one of the phases of the question. This Bill will authorize the expenditure of £2,800,000 in the provision of silos. I agree that the location of silos must be left to the Commissioners. It is the farmer's business to produce wheat, and in the ordinary way to deliver it. He cannot be a business man, and he is certainly not in the transport business. Mr J. H . CATTS -He ought to be a business man. opposite, who is usually a great exponent of State enterprise, apparently believes the State to be incompetent at the present time to deal with the question of transport. The storage of wheat along the railway system is a link in a complete system of transport. In this Bill, whioh is a Bill for the provision of silosj there is no provision for the conversion of any portion of the rolling-stock to deal with the bulk handling of wheat. show that it cannot be rebagged out of the silos. have a rebagging system bulk handling. have the storage of wheat in the bag, we shall not get rid of the weevil. the cylinder is usually operated by the elevator. If we are 'to have what the honourable member says, then we shall not secure economy in the handling of gi-ain in bulk. We are asked to impose on Australia, by an instalment, the bulkhandling system, which has been ill thought out and ill-digested. There is not in the House a man sufficiently expert in the two methods to be able to cast an intelligent vote on this Bill. I have investigated the question, but I could not tell honourable members to-day, without further investigation-and that investigation would have to go beyond Australia-whic h is the better system. We must have regard to the question of the arrival of Australian wheat at Home, and to the handling of it abroad. There are men who have-",49,Fosteb No Able Member Desired On The Committee

334,Mr Rodgers,"In a cylinder, andlooked carefully into the question, but who are not prepared to say that, unless Australia controls some bulk-handling space at the other end, the system should be adopted here. I am familiar with the operations in connection with wheat production from the time the seed is sown u n t i l the producer receives his cheque, but I have never yet been able to satisfy myself completely that it would be possible, without tremendous cost to Australia, to convert the present system of handling wheat in packages of 200 lbs. into the bulk-handling system. If , at the present time, we are merely f o go to the extent of providing storage for one-third of the normal harvest, the rest of Australia's wheat will be exposed to all the dangers anticipated in the report to which I have referred. It seems to me that, in this proposal, we have the introduction of the t h in end of the wedge to bring about the adoption of the bulkhandling system before the House has been taken thoroughly into the confidence of the farmers and the country, and before it has been provided with particulars as to the fundamental difference between bulk handling and dealing with wheat in packages.

The honourable member said, in effect, t h a t we should t r y the system first of all in Victoria and New South Wales, and that, if it were successful, South Australia would adopt it . It is, so to speak, a case of trying it first of all on "" the other dog."" That is the South Australian attitude. When the wheat of Australia is pooled, however, and when every grower in each State obtains exactly the same terms, I fai l to see how it is possible for one State to stand out and to refuse to bear its share of the expenditure which may bring to it increased rewards. Under this system there must not only be a conversion of the methods of handling the wheat itself, but a conversion of rolling-stock, and of the ships that trade with Australia. Unless the owners of those vessels get a port option, we shall have to pay more for our freights. The whole question of bulk handling bristles with difficulties. Expert knowledge is required in respect of transport, as well as in the other directions I have indicated. We have in Australia men who are conversant with transport, with overseas shipping, and with the methods of disposing of the wheat on the other side. This report anticipates that the bulk-handling system is coming in . It justifies the present proposal on the basis that it is an in stalment of what is to be the ultimate adoption of the bulk-handling system. If that is the intention of the Government, they should have told us straight out that handling system. Had they done so, we should have known where we were.

Damp grain, arriving during the winter, will' keep until summer. That is practically six monthsArriving in spring^ or summer, will keep 15 or 20 days, and must be re-elevated.

I am nob one to put blame for the damage in connection witb the loss of wheat either on tlie Wheat Commission or the agents.

Hundreds, if not 'thousands, of tons of prime hay is rotting throughout Australia, having been rendered almost useless by the mice plague. It is wrong, therefore, to visit upon men who are the trustees of the farmers' wheat responsibility for the damage that has been done.

The latter system has been well t r i e d ; and if bulk handling is adopted, the present storage must be put to some other use. I urge on the Government not to l i m it the question of storage to wheat, but to remember that, as shipping is. scarce, there are many other products of a more perishable Expertsi n this business gave the nature worth consideration. Recently, in the rural development of Australia, I should say that more families have gone in for dairying and fruit-growing than for any other branch; and these people, in a few months, will be faced with an over production.

In this, I think, the Commonwealth should co-operate, and, if necessary, afford, ample assistance in order to cope with those products we cannot ourselves consume. adjourned.

Motion (by Sir JOH N FOBBEST) proposedThat this House do now adjourn. the debate on the Wheat StorageB ill , I referred to the question of industrial conditions, and said that one of the newspapers in Melbourne had flouted the award given by the Court. I was asked to which newspaper I referred, and I said that it was the Argus; but I am now informed that I was somewhat unfair to that publication seeing that it was not the only one that had so acted. I do not desire to be unfair to any newspaper, however unfair it may be to me, and I should like to quote the following extract from the Australasian Journalist, of the 15th June this yearTHE AWARD. Brief intimation was given in the May Journalist of the steps certain newspaper proprietaries were taking to evade the provisions of the award. The facts were then stated, and readers were invited to form their own conclusions as to whether these proprietaries were acting honorably in accordance with their undertaking .given to the Court, that they would accept and obey the decision of the Court, both in tbe letter and the spirit. Not content witb dismissing employees, some proprietaries are stooping so low as to refuse the payment of money already earned. Iney are compelling the employees to seek the verdict of the Courts. They knew well that for an employee to proceed in Court against an employer is to cut off his chance of continuing his employment. In this matter they take a cowardly and unspeakably paltry advantage of their position. In Sydney sixteen or seventeen members of the A.J.A. have been dismissed. Most of them are district correspondents. The Adelaide proprietors waited to see how the cat was going to jump. timidly, and up to date there are five or six casualties. The majority of them are in the Advertiser office, an establishment which has »ot been noted fpr generous treatment to its employees in the past. In Perth, the Daily Veu>8 has re-engaged the men it dismissed, and trouble seems to have ceased. But the West AustraUan, an office which has been in the habit of working its men long hours, and then compromising with them o.n their claims for overtime, has now joined the ranks of the establishments that are repudiating their promise to the Court. It has So far as the Victoria district is concerned, the dismissals from the three daily newspaper -on e in each office. In the case of the Herald, compensation to the amount of £180 was paid. Several of the members of the staff of this proprietary have been "" warned "" as to the future. The three proprietaries have dismissed their district correspondents, but have invited most of them to send "" copy "" forward as contributors-a n ingenious way of defeating the clause in the award which provides that district correspondents shall be guaranteed £4 a week. Hitherto the Age and the Herald have required their district correspondents to look after everything happening in, the suburbs given into their charge. The Argus, on the other hand, made arrangements with suburban newspaper proprietors, chiefly to cover certain work, such as Police Courts and council meetings, for which fixed payment was made. Now all the proprietors have adopted the method of recognising "" copy"" from the suburbs as coming from contributors. Of course, the same service as was given before is required, and the practice now adopted is a device to escape guaranteeing the payment of a living wage. Though the district correspondents, who, by force of circumstances are attending to their districts as before, are not getting the guarantee of £4 a week, they are receiving an increase of i d . on what is published from them, which is exceedingly limited. Whilst re-organization of the staff has been going on, there has been disorganization and dissatisfaction. The authority I had was the statement. I read in the Australasian Journalist. I have the issue for May with me here. I said this afternoon thafc one newspaper had done this kind of thing, and now so far from withdrawing the statement as applied to that newspaper, I have only to say that the same thing was done by practically every other newspaper in Australia. I bad thc Argus particularly in mind, because on Saturday night when I spoke at a smoke night gathering in Melbourne I found that the Argus had denounced the members of the Austnalian Workers Union and other unions for nofc obeying the awards of the Arbitration Court, and at the same time ifc was doing the verything it denounced.

I wish briefly to refer to a question I put to the Minister representing fche M i nister for Defence to-day, and his reply thereto. The question I asked was. Will the Minister state by whose orders, and for what purpose, a military band played for some time outside the main polling booth in Brisbane during the recent Federal election. To this question the Minister gave me the following replyThe military band that played outside the Town Hall, in Brisbane, on Sth May last was used by the Recruiting Committee for recruiting purposes. This band played outside the enlistment depdt, and not outside a polling booth. I want to say that the Minister gave me a misleading and incorrect reply to my question. 03 mild a way as possible. I was tempted to use a word that is unparliamentary. candidate for election throughout AusThe answer given me was a false answer. tralia had a similar experience to mine. member say that the Minister knew it to I left Melbourne that if it was possible be false. could not have known the facts. gave a misleading answer that was supplied to him by some one else. I am told that the military band played outside the TownH a l l on the day of the election. I did not ask where the band played at any particular time of the day, but put a question which showed that a I ask the Argus and band played outside the polling booth. In spite of the Minister's reply to my question, I tassert that a military band played outside the main polling booth in Brisbane on the day of the election, and we know for what purpose. Any sane man will assume that it was bufc one of the dirty little tricks that the National party played in order to influence the result of the elections. The Minister sayb thab the band played outside .the enlistment depot and not the polling booth. I point out that the enlistment depot is in the same place that the polling booth was on that day. The answer given to me is misleading on the face of it , because if fche band did nofc play outside the polling booth it could not have played outside the enlistment depot, which was the same place. play at the same place every day? known to play there either before that day or since. The Minister says that the Recruiting Committee ordered the band fco play there, and if that be so I should like fco know who inspired the committee to send tbe band there on that day. If it is necessary for a band to play outside the enlistment depot, why was not the idea sugeested by the interjection of the honourable member for Denison carried out, and that place made a regular recruiting depot ? The ,only impression left on the minds of the people of Brisbane was that fchis was one of those sly, clever tricks to catch votes by stirring up the patriotic feelings of the Win-the-war party, and fco make people believe that plenty of noise and plenty of talk, such as we get from the Ministerial party, was going to w in the war.

FINLAYSON "" of what he has heard. Of course, he does not know everything; no one is in that position. General Birdwood, heing a British Imperial officer, had no right to interfere in Australian affairs, as he did by issuing an address to the men in regard to conscription. That action was an i m pertinence which should not have been overlooked. It is only because he was carrying out the instructions of the Prime Minister that he has not had a hard rap over the knuckles for what he did. An y other man would have been treated differently ; and he had better take the hint to mind his own business. We can manage our own affairs.

But I rose to speak of the playing of a military band outside a polling booth, and have been drawn off the track. Electoral Act very properly tries to prevent corrupting influences from entering into the conduct of elections, and I ask honourable members if they think that it was righ t for a military band to play outside a polling booth on election day ? Even though the Recruiting Committee had the best intentions, and thought that it would gain recruits by having the band playing, does any one here regard it as fair or proper that a military band should be used for political purposes? There is no denying the fact that either the Recruiting Committee or the military officers used the band for political purposes. purpose ? the Brisbane Recruiting Committee, and It is a statement know thab its members were not supporters of Finlayson on election day. They have as much right to their political opinions as I have to mine, and I am not complaining because bhey did not support me. But when they used their recruiting facilities to t r y to influence votes, they were going beyond what was legitimate and proper. I call attention to the matter, not because I feel in any degree annoyed, but as an indication that of late there has been creeping into our electoral administration influences that bid fair to destroy the fairness that has hitherto characterized itA l l over the world the Australian secret ballot, and our method of conducting elections, has been looked upon as constituting the high-water mark standard. But what happened during the last election and the conscription referendum caused a good deal of uneasiness and suspicion to creep into the minds of many persons in AusN o t at all.

This is a serious matter,, affecting the rights, and, I might say, the privileges of Australian citizens. I hope that, in that manner which is so characteristic of him, .the Minister will see that justice is done, and that the rights and privileges of Australian citizens are preserved to them. MrJ . H . CATTS (Cook) [10.57] I received to-day a letter from, a soldier at the Eront, who went from my electorate, which I desire to bring under the notice ol the House. It is dated 22nd M a j , 1917, and reads as follows: Dear Sir, You will forgive me for writing to you, but I see this is the only way of getting my grievance remedied. Prance, leaving Australia eighteen months ago with the 7th of 20th Batt. Reinforcements. Before leaving I made an allotment to my aged mother and invalided father, which amounted to about £3 fortnightly. Included in this £3 is £1 for being the sole support of the both of them. Everything appeared in good order, and the money was paid by the Military authorities for the first twelve months; but in January of this year my money was reduced to £1 2s. fortnightly for no reason whatever. My allotment of £1 for being sole support, and another £1 to make up for tbe back money my people had received, was stopped. Now, this means that they will have to carry on with l is . weekly for both of them, which is nigh impossible at the present high cost of living in Sydney. They are entitled to the money, and it hurts me very much to hear of them being deprived of the little comforts in the last days of their lives, and I think it is a' lack of judgment on the Military authorities' part. My father is 77 years of age, and for the past six years he has been bedridden witb paralysis. My mother is ten years his junior, and they are both natives of Australia. So, sir, I do hope you will grant me a favour, and see to this grievance of mine. My people's address is 18 Almastreet, Darlington, and mine is 5th Pioneer Batt., A.I.F.

I noticed that his the Government are administering these statement varied a good deal from the matters. attended to I should thin k that the best thing would be to submit it to the Minisfc©T MrJ . H . CATTS -The honourable gentleman will please understand that I have been dealing w i th cases of"" this kind sufficiently long to know how to put a case before the Department without hia assistance. I will see that not only does this case go before the Parliament and the people of this country, but that it goes before fche Minister, and that he gives me an answer. This is nob a solitary case. It is typical of a number of cases. I have brought cases of this kind under the notice of the Department on a number of occasions. ment which you are giving to the country. MrJ . H . CATTS It is a soldier's statement. It shows how our soldiers at the Front are being worried by the administration of this Government. It shows, I am on active service in also, how the conscription Government administer fche voluntary system. It gives one of the reasons why the Government cannot get recruits under the voluntary system in satisfactory numbers. Because, with fchis soldier writing back to Australia like this, and other soldiers writing back to relatives and friends, pointing out the treatment meted to them by the Administration, the news is percolating through the entire population, and there aregrave doubts about theattitude of the Government towards the men. stop the letters now. MrJ . H . CATTS It is a wonder to me that this letter got through. I was quite surprised to receive it to-day. Apparently it escaped the censor, as some other letters did.

398,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am not awareI understand that he occupies a position in this Ministry much the same as that which Sir George Reid occupied in an Administration. He shares with the honourable member for Bendigo in the leadership of the Government. The fact that his statement of policy very often differs materially from that of the Prime Minister, indicates that he has some authority of leadership in the Government. I will hunt up his statement. I forget exactly what the words of it were. I noticed that there was a big variation from the statement of the Prime Minister as to the conditions which would have to be brought about before conscription was re-introduced. If we did have conscription, there would be no chance of remedying these grievances against the Administration. We only get some show of fair dealing in regard to these soldier cases to-day because the Government are absolutely dependent upon this administration in order to get recruits. If they had recruits guaranteed under the voluntary system we would not get much consideration for cases of this kind. that it is time that you ^stopped these sinister insinuations? You have hardly said a word to-day which has not had some sinister import. Why do you not take a "" p u l l "" at yourself? Mr J. H . CATTS -When the right honourable gentleman was on this side one never heard anything but a grumble from him. vided with loaves and fishes one would expect a more cheerful disposition from him, but he cannot help getting something to grumble about, even when he is sitting on that side. I supported the Government's proposal in a Bill before the House to-day, and it was the honourable member who really (introduced the lack of harmony into the proceedings. it, and immediately you proceeded to try to make political capital out of it. Mr J. H . CATTS -The right honourable gentleman's mouth is always very ful l of platitudes about political capital. No one else in the political arena can say anything or attempt to do anything but it is called an attempt to make political capital. He alone is the one sincere man in politics. Nothing he ever does is done with any ulterior motive; everything is straightforward. He went over to Sydney the other day, and explained the position of the Government when it had no business before the House, and then said that the Government were refused permission to go on with business. Mr J. H . CATTS -The right honourable gentleman knows the reason why I objected. should have said was that the honourable member did his best to stop them. Mr J. H . CATTS -And succeeded, too, the right honourable gentleman might have added. gloated over the fact that you stopped business. Mr J. H . OATTS -If it was possible for the right honourable gentleman to put a correct interpretation before the public, he might know that the Prime Minister was asking for concessions at the hands of the Opposition. He was asked whether he would be prepared to meet requests on this side for concessions in kind, and he said positively that he was not prepared to do so. It is all contained in the Hansard report of the proceedings. The Minister for the Navy knows perfectly well that it was because of the deliberately unfair treatment of this side by the Government that the objection was taken. side ati all; it was only the honourable In fact, now that he is well promember. He is not that side of the House. Mr J. H . CATTS -He is one of this side, and, as a member of the House, he is entitled to the same rights as any other honourable member. to control the House. Mr J.

The right honourable gentleman thinks, when he' is in power, that the minority have no right to any consideration. a minority; you are one-on e only. Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes.

Home and Territories) [11.6] I think the cases the hononable member for Dalley referred to are those of men who obtained permission to go to New Zealand for service in connection with the meat season. If the cases can be brought before me I will be able to have them inquired into. my notice is that some men who had remained in New Zealand longer than six months were not permitted to return to Australia. I have asked for some particulars of the cases. If the men were in New Zealand eighteen months the New ZeaLand Government may have considered that they had changed their residence, and that therefore they came under the compulsory law. On this matter, if cases are mentioned, I hope to get information from the New Zealand Government. In regard to tbe complaint of the honourable member for Brisbane, there could not possibly have been any allotment of votes outside the provisions of the Act. The gist of the honourable member's remarks was that there had been some corrupt apportionment of the soldiers' votes. We must assume that tihe Administration could^not be guilty of such a thing as that. Mr J. H . CATTS -It is a pity we cana statement which he did not believe to not have an inquiry into the matter. tion that the Act prescribes that the divijustifiable suspicion on the honesty of sions to which votes were to be allotted were to be those suggested by the addresses on the military roll. Of course, it Electoral Officer by any Minister during may have followed that in some cases men were allotted to divisions in which they were not originally resident and electors. I do not wish to discuss now the reason for the wording of the Act in that way, but that was the only provision that was workable for the reasons stated when the Bill was introduced. Does the honourable member for Brisbane suggest that any electoral-officer, or the Administration, through any agent, wilfully and in defiance of the Act allotted votes to a division in which the return of a supporter of the Government was doubtful? that there was a suspicion of that being done. member think that it is worthy of his position as a member of the House to make an allegation like that on a mere surmise and without any proof? I tell the honourable member that I never heard a suggestion which would afford the slightest shadow of justification for his assertion. The Leader of the Oppospecial agent of his party to look after the scrutiny in England, and, by my All that has come under direction, his scrutineers were paid. The Government also appointed a gentleman who attended to the scrutiny in their behalf, and both gentlemen were there to see that the votes were allotted in a proper manner. Following tlie publication of a statement by Mr Mahon which cast a suspicion on the genuineness of the alloteverything was perfectly fair, and remonstrated against the same aspersions as the honourable member for Brisbane has put before the House to-night. Does the honourable member think that' he is acting fairly in casting this suspicion on the Administration ? I do not think any other honourable member will support his remarks. matter again. ence will be on facts. I do not suppose the honourable member would put forward be correct, but I ask him not, on the import of a single letter, to place an unthe Administration. There was no interference with the discretion of the Chief the recent campaign, and I tell the honourable member that I do not believe for a moment that his leader would justify the remarks which he has made to-night.
