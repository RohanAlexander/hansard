I do not know whether any explanation can be given of the reason for raising the salaries of officers in another Chamber. I would be loth to make any adverse reference to the omcers concerned, b u t considerable objection has been taken to the raising, unde'r the present circumstances, of the salaries of officials who are already highly paid. I , too, regard this policy as open to objection. I suppose this action has been taken in order to bring the salaries of the Senate omcers on a par with those paid to the omcers of this Chamber. would not take such serious objection to the raising of the salaries of highly-paid omcers if it were not for the fact that there seems to be a smooth passage always for the highly-salaried man to a higher salary, whilst difficulties are placed in the path of the rank and file of the service when they ask to have their meagre emoluments increased. instance of the letter carriers having to fight their way through the Arbitration Court before they could obtain even a modicum of redress. I noticed that an oflicer of the Public Service Commissioner's office made a general statement before the Court that the men in the Service are slowing down, and Mr Justice Powers, in delivering his award, said that that oflicer had not given one item of evidence to support the statement he had made. opportunity to make a reference to the position in the Service generally. There are some men in the Service who are doing valuable work, and yet who have not been -receiving fair salaries, and have not been granted an increase since they entered the Service. It is not fair at this stage to give increases to men already receiving high understand that when certain salaries in this Chamber were increased in the last Estimates it was thought u n f a i r to pay. lower salaries to officers occupying member said that he did. similar positions in another place, and that it was decided to grant these proposed increases at that time. creases had been paid long before these Estimates were framed. I make my protest against that policy. I have the greatest respect for the oflicers concerned, and I believe they are doing their duty reliably and well, but I am pointing out the difference in the treatment of the highly-paid men on the one hand, and those on the other hand who are earning just a meagre salary. A t this time of high cost of living, if any officers are entitled to consideration, they are the lowlypaid men. McAnderson should be paid more than 7 guineas per day? that payment I desire to know what Mr. McAnderson is doing, and if I think that I he gets too much for the work he performs, m y protest -will be heard.

41,Mr Josephcook,"The n he oughtonly so much "" smoodge"" to the people outside. Every member knows the value and the purpose of those statements. That line of conduct earns the contempt of all manly men. The honourable member protests against the high salaries, and then says that he does not wish to reduce them.' That is typical of a lot of the reforming zeal on tbe Government side. The explanation of this item is very simple, but who can have anything but contempt for conduct like that of the honourable member for Maribyrnong? The honorablo member mouthed a speech about high salaries, and then said that he did not wish to touch them. of the kind. tion of this matter is very simple. last year's Estimates provision was made for an increase in the salary of the Clerk of tlie House of Representatives, on a joint recommendation from the then Speaker, the honourable member for Lang, and the President of the Senate, that the salaries of the clerks should be augmented. that corresponding positions in the State Parliament were rated more highly than in our own, and that neither of the officers mentioned had received any increase in his salary since Federation began. They further urged very strongly that the proposed increases were long overdue. Accordingly I agreed to provide in the Estimates for the increases. submitted his recommendation properly to the House, but the President omitted to formally submit the proposed increase for the Clerk of the Senate, and, consequently, the latter was not voted. Subsequently the President sent me a strong protest against the exclusion of his own officer; and, of course, I took the responsibility of correcting the error, and asking the Treasurer to provide for increases to both clerks. doing now is merely to regularize the payments which have how been going on for, I think, about eighteen months. W h y the honourable member opposite should at this stage introduce a discussion about the Public Service, the Arbitration Court, and all the rest of it , I cannot imagine. He knows very well that such subjects have no relevance whatever to the item now before us, and he could take an opportunity later on to discuss the Public Service and other subjects. If the honourable member can show a case in which any officer has been too highly paid for his work, I think he w ill find some sympathetic consideration on this side. It is time we dropped what I cannot help regarding as a ""smoodge"" to people outside, and addressed ourselves seriously to the discussion of the Estimates. There is no doubt that the Estimates are swollen and high, but I guarantee that the honourable member for Maribyrnong opposite will not propose to reduce them a penny. I am prepared to accept the challenge of the Leader of the Opposition in reference to the ""smoodging"" to people outside. I did not sav anything Indeed, I am prepared to go further, and, if in order on the vofe before us, to move that there shall be no increase in the In salary of any officer receiving over £ 3 00 per annum, while the war lasts. is a time which demands courage on the part of every honourable member. Those gentlemen pointed out favours a reduction of salaries? gesting any reduction, but I contend that we are not asking too much when we say that omcers with over £300 per annum shall not be entitled to any increase during the war. under the -present Estimates would be Mr Speaker affected by this motion? I have gone through the list as carefully as is possible considering the way in which the Estimates are made up. If honourable members look at page 92 of the Estimates they will realize how dimcult it is to arrive at the number of officers who would be affected. It w ill be seen that last year there were seventy-four officers, and this year there are eighty-three, or an increase ""What we are of nine, while the increase in salaries is £20,000. A similar state of affairs may be found right through the Estimates, particularly in the Defence Department, both military and naval; and it is practically impossible for honourable members to arrive at an exact knowledge of what increases are-being proposed to individual officers, or how many are affected. With' the Leader of the Opposition, I believe that we are faced with a very critical state of affairs in our national existence; and",7,Estimates 1914 15

The honourable member for Maribyrnong does not overstate the argument, or even exhaust what might be said as to the position outside. The cost of living has increased enormously! Men who are receiving anything fro m £ 3 to £ 4 a week are finding it very difficult to make both ends meet, and a man in receipt of less than £3 a week is pushed to live within his income, and act honestly. H o w some of the poorer classes are able to live at the present time completely puzzles me; and the facts show that some of the ladies must be better treasurers and financiers than are the men. receipt of over £300 a year should, at any rate, be able without much difficulty to get along under the present circumstances.

In the Prime Minister's Department increases are proposed for eleven offioers; in the Treasury fox seventeen officers; in the office of the Attorney-General for three omcers; in the Department of External Affairs for sixteen officers; in the Department of Trade and Customs for thirty-two officers; the Department of Home Affairs for twenty-six offioers; and in the Postmaster General's Department for forty omcers. 1 shall not go through the whole list in detail; but there are 183 omcers, and the amount involved is over £5,000. other Departments there are eighteen offioers receiving increases up to £100, and the amount involved there is £1,790. The question, as I say, ought to be discussed quite apart from any particular oflicer or officers; our only consideration should be the greatest good of the greatest number. I am unable at the present time to go beforo my constituents, and justify increases from £25 to £100 to officers who are receiving £600, £700, and £800 per annum, while ordinary working men, who are the great mass of the people, and on whom we have to depend to see us through the crisis by keeping our works going, have to scrape along on £ 3 or £ 4 a week, which is only too difficult to get. One of the saddest sights in the capital cities of Australia to-day is the procession of unemployed; and yet here we are to-day shovelling away money to men who are receiving in salaries practically more than they know what to do with. I should like to know, Mr Chairman, whether such a motion as I have foreshadowed is in order on the vote before us? the rules of debate, and under those rules the Committee may consider only matters Teferrcd to it. The question now before us is the expenditure in connection with the Senate; and, therefore, the motion would not be in order, inasmuch as it covers the whole of the Estimates. However, the honourable member's object might be gained by moving the reduction of one item in the vote for the Senate, the decision being accepted by the Minister as applying to the whole of the Estimates. the matter in another way. I move That the item "" Clerk of the Senate, £1,000,"" be reduced by £100. as an instruction to the Government that no increase of salary be granted during the continuance of the war to any officer of the Public Service receiving over £300 per annum. In submitting this motion, it is not my desire to single out the Clerk of the Senate for special treatment. Unless' the principle is to apply in all cases where ofBcers are receiving over £300 per annum, then I do not desire that it shall apply to the Clerk. Mr MoDONALD (Kennedy) [11.17]. I think I shall bo able to explain this matter to the Committee. The In increases covered by this division were made, not this year, but in 1913. . In that year, this House agreed to certain items in the Estimates providing for increments to certain officers of this House. Later on, when dealing with the Estimates, the Senate felt it was in duty bound to see that its officers were similarly treated. I have already explained the matter to the House. Senator Givens, brought the matter before the Treasurer of the day. Senator Givens, and the honourable member for Lang, who was then Speaker of this Houso, made a joint application to me for these increases. mates provided for increases in the case of certain officers of this House, there were no similar items in the Estimates relating to the Senate. on the part of Senator Givens. fault it was, hut the fact remains that .these increases did not appear on the Estimates for the Senate. They were granted in 1913, however, and the money was paid out of the Treasurer's advance.

I take no exception to the views expressed by the .honourable member for Brisbane, but it is my duty to tell the Committee that, if his motion were agreed to, the saving so effected would be practically negligible, even if the war were to continue for a considerable time. If we are going to try. tb meet the war expenditure in this way, we shall utterly fail. Mr J. H . CATTS -That is not point of the criticism. criticism is that, owing to the war, there should be no increments in respect of officers receiving over £300 a year. This Parliament has remitted to the Public Service Commissioner the power to make regulations providing for the payment of increments on a graduated scale according to the efficiency of officers and the .services rendered by them.. If the payment of these increments were dropped for a yearor two, the effect would, in many cases, be felt by the persons concerned, not only during the time that they were withheld, but throughout their lives. The saving would be quite paltry, and' would not be in keeping with the dignity of the' Parliament. I do not think our Arbitration Courts have seriously taken into account the refusal of increases because of the war. Mr J. H .

The Secretary to the Treawould it be of any practical utility in the sury receives £900-per annum; the Clerk financing of our war expenditure, to reof the Senate, if this increment be consort to either expedient. I wish to take firmed, will receive £1,000 per annum. this opportunity to. repeat a statement In the name of Heaven, how can it be that I made earlier in the session, that said that the responsibilities of the Clerk it will be the duty of Ihe Treasurer in of the Senate are greater than are those -future to require that all recommendaof the Secretary to the Treasury!

The Government' can see their way to finance the affairs of the Commonwealth without resorting to any the extraordinary means during the present financial year. If any action of the kind is to be taken, it should follow systematic lines, and should be in connection with the new Estimates, which are almost due. Nothing would give a worse impression here and elsewhere than would be gathered from the laying down of a hard and fast rule that no increments' shall be granted to officers receiving more than a certain sum per annum. The honourable memher himself, in the case of his own employees, would feel that he was as much entitled to grant increases to men receiving £6 a week, if they were doing good work, as to grant increases to men of capacity and industry who were receiving only £4 or £5 per week.

I have my own table here. to me officiallyThe increases to officers receiving between £300 and £400 will amount to £4,236; to officers between £400 and £500, £1,426; from £500 and upwards, £587; making a total of £6,425. hope the House is not going to make any departure from the arrangement made by the Speaker and the President with the then Prime Minister. This is merely ratifying an arrangement, as the honourable member, ought to know. But what surprises me is that a motion of this description should have come from a. gentleman who since the war started has had increases to his own salary from this Chamber in the shape of fees. If the gentleman will come along with a suggestion that his own emoluments should cease, and that members of the House should accept some reduction of their own salaries, he will have my support. I feel in a position similar to that of the honourable member for Barrier. . The honourable member in this motion is committing us to preventing increments being paid to any civil servants. We haye, however, the Public Service Act, which provides for certain increases to.be paid to public servants from time to ""time. I have a recollection that honourable memhers of this House Have criticised very severely the Public Service Commissioner for not giving effect to that Act-in not providing increments to those who were entitled to them. If we carry this motion it will he taken as an instruction-to the -Government that no increases shall be paid at all, and, to my mind, such an action will not stand any test. The Act provides that the increases shall be paid, and if they are not paid the officials who are entitled to them have only to bring the matter to a test, and you will find that we have done wrong. If we pass an Act of Parliament, we ought to adhere to it . Nobody cries oub more than we do ourselves if the law is nob carried out, and yet we are here asked to carry a resolution practically setting aside an Act of Parliament regulating the salaries of civil servants. I do nob think such a proceeding would be legal, and it would leave . the. Commonwealth open to any action that might be taken by the public servants themselves; and they would be perfectly justified in taking that action. I cannot see eye to. eye with the honourable member in making his proposition apply to every one. If we had time to go through the different positions held by public servants, many cases might be found where officers were doing more for the money they are receiving than they should, and where increases are really justified. While, however, I am prepared to deal with any particular matter on its merits, I am not prepared to vote for a resolution giving an instruction to Ministers to refuse increments due to a large body of public servants. [11.40] -S o much has been already said upon this matter that I think a view ought to be expressed by each person who. intends to vote on a subject of this importance. I want to say ab the outset that I hope no Government will ever set up £300 a year as a standard of efficiency, as it would do if this motion were given effect to. The work the clerks of Parliament have to. do has been referred to, and I think quite unthinkingly.. We know if a Bill passes this House the responsibility rests upon the clerks of Parliament to see that it is given proper effect to. .A mistake made in the passing of a Bill might result in endless litigation. Consequently, work of considerable responsibility rests upon the shoulders of the clerks in this Parliament. The honourable member for Brisbane alsp suggested that the action he proposes is necessary as a result of war. Personally, I cannot follow him in that argument. I may not be as optimistic as some people, but I do not think it is the war that is troubling Australia at the present time so much as the drought.

Mr J. H . CATTS -Possibly, but not probably. But they would certainly resent increases at present. Other honourable members, perhaps, do not get each day in their mail letters such as I do from men who are out of work and in need and distress, and are pleading for jobs.. If we cannot provide sufficient work .to put bread in a man's cupboard, surely it is not the time to give an extra £ 2 a The four southern week to a person already receiving £900 a year. Such increases create very considerable irritation among the people. The honourable member for South Sydney states that he does not wish to set a bad example to private employers, but I doubt if any private employers are now giving increases to men who receive over £300 a year. If there are such cases they must be exceptional. The honourable member for South Sydney, unwittingly, I think, did injustice to the Premier of New South Wales, probably through a general misunderstanding that seems to have there come about.

'The honorahle member for Barrier, who is present, w ill know that when thousands of men were put off the mines at BrokenH ill , and thrown o n the resources of the State, the Premier of New South Wales, instead of leaving all these men in want, provided that there should be a sharing of the loss of employment by a reduction of hours on railway works, in order to find employment for these BrokenH ill men. 'That method was infinitely the preferable one to adopt as against the cast-iron method of some men being employed f u l l time, and others being thrown out of employment altogether. If the Premier of New South Wales caused a reduction in wages and hours in any other way I am not aware of it . The honourable member for South Sydney, who sits by me, now tells me that he agrees w i th me, and that what I have outlined is quite correct. I was sure that he did not wish to do any injustice. The statement has been made that if -any increments to our civil servants are blocked, the effect w ill be permanent on the officers concerned. the dissolution of Parliament, we lose so many weeks' salary from time to time we suffer a permanent loss. If a man loses -employment, he can never make good the consequent loss of wages, however hard he may work in the future. a permanent reduction in salary for the remainder of the term of service.

A number of honourable gentlemen who have spoken to the amendment seem to be in harmony with its mover on many points, but have stated that they w ill not vote for it because it does not exactly meet their views. Probably no proposal ever comes before a . Parliament that exactly meets the views of every honourable member who supports it, and we are forced generally to take the nearest expression of our views that we can obtain. Although the amendment does not quite represent my views, I shall vote for it , because, at a time when the Government cannot find money to provide work for the unemployed, and to carry on necessary public undertakings, public servants whose salaries are well above the living wage should not be given increases. , I hope that the honourable member for Brisbane w ill stick to his guns, and w ill give honourable members an opportunity 'to show their constituents what are their real views on this matter.

When the increases were agreed to, the honourable member for Lang, who was then Speaker, revised his Estimates, but the President omitted to do the same. Both Senator Givens and the honourable member for Lang wrote protesting against the omission of the Senate increases, but when we promised to pay them out of the Treasurer's Advance, as a mistake had been made, the President and the members of the Senate were mollified. There will be plenty of opportunities for testing the question which the honourable member for Brisbane wishes to raise; though I should like to draw attention to the absolute f u t i l it y of his proposal. Members sitting near hinf, who have been in Parliament many more years than he has, have seen many attempts like his f a i l , and must know that what he proposes can achieve nothing. has told him that the amount involved is negligible. His desire is that the men at the top should contribute specially to the cost of the war. among such men, which is unjust. There are men working for wages for the Government who receive more than £ 6 a week, and his proposal would not affect them. differently fro m men who are working for salaries? docks, at the Small Arms Factory, and elsewhere whose wages come to more than £ 6 a week. W h y should they be treated differently from other workers whose remuneration is termed "" s a l a r y "" ? one but the Government can undertake the reduction of items in the Estimates. I am not sure that the whole of the Estimates do not need revision. There is an increase of about £2,000,000 this year, and I do not know where we are going to stop, though I cannot point off-hand to the source of the trouble. What is needed is patient and continuous investigation, and I hope that the inquiries of our Committees and other investigations will enable us to pare down the cost of administration without decreasing efficiency or lowering salaries. I have never been in favour of cutting down salaries, holding the opinion that, as a rule, the higher the wage paid the more effective is the labour given. But I am not in consistent in saying thab there should be a thorough investigation of the Estimates Thei n as a whole, in view of the large increase of expenditure on the ordinary departments of Government. What the honourable member for Brisbane proposes would not make any material reduction. At best it would reduce an increase of over £2,000,000 by £60,000 or £70,000. the more ludicrous. The honourable member for Brisbane ought to raise the question some other way. If he does so, the Government may be able to do something to give effect to his views. that the honourable member for Parramatta was officially informed by the Senate that that body would delay the Estimates if this increase were not provided for? not made in exact words, but the hint was conveyed. The honourable member for The Prime Minister Maribyrnong said that I was w ill in g enough to cut down the.salaries of officers who were not in the Chambers. That is an absolute and unqualified misstateB u t he discriminates ment, and I am not going to allow the honourable member to send out to his constituents "" gags "" of that sort. If the honourable member for Brisbane wishes to undertake a thorough revision of this expenW h y should they be treated diture, he should raise the question in another way. He might move a motion There are men at the on some otlier item in another Department, and let the decision of the Committee be an instruction to the Government to reduce these Estimates, but what the honourable member is proposing now No is to do an absolute injustice. There are a number of officers in the Service who are getting £300 per annum. The honourable member's idea is that a man receiving £280 may have his salary increased to £300, but the man already receiving £300 shall get no increase. The effect of that would be to place two different grades on the same salary, so that one man might be controlling others, and yet receiving no greater pay. we drew the line at £900. there is only one just thing -to do, and that is to make sure that we get the equivalent of the salaries we pay.",16,Estimates 1914 15

125,Mr Josephcook,"It would, andTreasurer-Wid e Bay) [12.18] I take this opportunity of communicating to the Committee the following official figures regarding the increases in salaries in this and previous years. In 1910-11 the nominal increase in salaries was £12,070, and the actual increase £11,724; in 1911-12, nominal increase £14,424, actual £13,888; 1912-13, nominal increase £15,431, actual £14,781; 1913-14, nominal increase £25,896, actual £25,055; 1914-15, nominal increase £19,404, actual £18,546. The difference between the nominal and actual increases is accounted for by the fact that some of the omcers provided for were not employed until a later period following increased amounts were provided for officers of all divisions within the range of salaries mentioned: Between £200 and £300, £12,297; between £300 and £400, £4,236; between £420 and £500, £1,426; and between £520 and upwards, £587. From those figures it will be seen that the total of increments to officers receiving over £300 was £6,249. I hope the honourable member for Brisbane will not proceed with his proposal, because it has been the custom ever since this Parliament was brought into being for the Speaker and President and the Clerks of both Houses to be on an equality in regard to salaries, and I believe there is on record a resolution of the Senate insisting upon equal treatment in that respect. I believe the custom is the same in all the Parliaments of Australia. These increases appear on the Estimates now in accordance with the promise of the previous Government to comply with the request of the Speaker and President in regard to the salaries of the oflicers concerned. It is not easy, nor is it I think usual, for any Government to refuse compliance with the wishes of the President and Speaker in regard to the salaries of Parliamentary officers-in fact, they look upon the Parliamentary vote as being independent of the Government of the day. especially the servants of Parliament, and Parliament, not the Government, must look after their interests. My experience has been that when any such question comes before Parliament, the House always sides with the Speaker and President against the Government. Therefore it is the wish of every Government to comply, as far as possible, with the wishes of the responsible officers of the Senate and House of Representatives. That the increases were not granted to the Senate oflicers at the same time as they were granted to the oflicers of this Chamber was due solely to an inadvertence; fresh Estimates were not sent forward by the Senate, although they were sent forward by the House of Eepresentatives. As soon as this omission was pointed out to «-the Government, it agreed to rectify the disparity which had been created. If would point out to honourable members that, however much they may*claim that this House is than was estimated. The supreme in regard to the Estimates, in practice that is not found to be so. We desire the assistance of the Senate in every way, and if it is the wish of the Senate that tliese increases be paid, I am willing to grant what is asked. I hope we shall not open up any dispute between the two Chambers in regard to the salaries of their respective officers. I understand that the honourable member for Brisbane has taken action to-day in order to give expression to an idea in regard to salaries that is permeating Australia. After a long experience of political life, I think I may fairly say that those omcers who are in contact with honourable members, and particularly those in Departments who come into contact with Ministers, have rapid advancement, as a rule, and frequently are placed over men who are their seniors, and equally competent to carry on the work. There are Departments of the Commonwealth Service in which the officials are not receiving fair salaries, and I think that the present method of granting increases does require careful consideration, in order that we may introduce a more, direct and equitable system. Any official who is in receipt of a salary of £500 and upwards is very well able to meet the exigencies of the present extraordinary situation. I Those officers, they say, are would remind the right honourable member for Swan that this House is all powerful in this matter, and I personally have no regard for the precedents of past Parliaments.

I think this discussion has raised a greater question than can be settled on a single item of the Estimates. It is a matter sufficiently important for the House to take into f u l l consideration, so that no member of the Public Service may feel that h© has been passed over unjustly in favour of some other official with whom a Minister has come closely in contact. Affairs Department two officers have been unjustly promoted over other officers who had been longer in the service, and were more deserving. One officer to-day is receiving much less than his abilities and past work entitle him to. My remarks on this subject have particular reference to two Liberal Ministries of the past. discussion appears to have arisen from a statement of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, in reference to the increment granted fifteen months ago to the Clerk of the Senate. bers opposite have on every platform advocated the principle of equal pay for equal work; and if that holds good in the case of the working classes, it ought to hold good in the case of the high officials of the Commonwealth. member mean by ' ' working classes "" ?

As to the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane, no one can seriously think that at the present moment the Government contemplate entering upon an orgy of extravagance. This is no time to give all kinds of increments to public servants, considering that we are going through one of the worse droughts we ever had. However, at such a time as this, we should give the Government all reasonable support, leaving increments and similar matters to their intelligence and good sense. I believe that in the HomeI n my opinion it would be very unwise to adopt the motion of the honourable member for Brisbane. If there were a brilliant young fellow drawing £300 a year in the Public Service, and it was felt desirable to promote him to another position in another Department, carrying with it an increment of £ 1 0 0 a year, surely it would be good policy to make the promotion. In my opinion the motion, if passed, would very much i m pair the efficiency of the Public' Service. The little exhibition we have had this Honourable memmorning is, to my mind, proof, if any were needed, that Parliament is essentially and entirely an inconsistent place. In three minutes we passed a resolution for a SupplyB ill involving £3,500,000 without any discussion, and now we have honourable members opposite holding up W h a t does the honourable the Estimates of their own Government, and detaining us for hours, while we discuss whether some item shall be reduced I mean working men. by £100. principle. ciple?

Why not treat all according to the same "" principle,"" which was the word used by an honourable member opposite when I asked the honourable member what he was really after? The honourable member for Brisbane states that he has no objection to Mr Boydell, but, at the same time, he moves that Mr Boydell's salary be. reduced. This reminds rae of another motion which was moved by the honourable member for Brisbane, and was the occasion of much wordy warfare, voicing his particular objection to an institution of this House. The honourable member moved the complete abolition of that in stitution, but it is still here. the 6 o'clock rule applied to that institution now. that, if that happen, we shall soon have a movement in favour of day sittings! I ask the honourable member to realize that the motion he has submitted is not fair, but seems to pick' out in the most invidious way a particular officer. The proposal cannot have a general application of any utility, because, after all, the Government are from day to day -appointing men at very high salaries to do specific work. If the Government are allowed freedom of action in regard to putting their own supporters outside into the fattest billets offering, it is not reasonable to propose to cut down the salaries of individual officers in the way now suggested. However, I am satisfied that the House w ill stand behind this particular officer, and see that he gets the same salary as the occupant of another similar, position. work, and I hope he will not be victimized in consequence of any f a d or any desire for cheap advertisement outside. not intended to speak, but, under the circumstances, I desire to show exactly where I stand. Wentworth has not done the honourable member for Brisbane justice in charging him with having singled out any one individual. H a d the honourable member [88] been present when the motion was submitted he would have known that the mover was confined to one particular item. The principle behind the motion has W h y not treat much to commeud it ; at any rate, to the. electors of Australia. As the honourable member for Cook has said, the increases in„ salaries proposed in the Estimates have shocked the electors; and as to this view I can at least speak on behalf of my own district. While reductions in wages and so forth are taking place in every walk of life, we are asked to docilely approve of increases to public servants. It has beeu suggested by some honourable members that the motion means robbing people of what is rightly theirs, but we must remember that the operation of the motion isconfined to the duration of the war. orable member agree with private employers who cut down salaries? propose to cut down salaries, but merely to stop increases, and there are very few private firms who have given any in The n all I can say is creases during the present war. On the other hand, in many cases wages and salaries have been cut down, and further, the time of employment has been reduced, even by a Government. The burden of the war is fallin g heavily on the working section of the community, using the words in their narrowest or industrial sense. These people are feeling the pinch very much; and I know that, in my own district, at any rate they are wondering how much more they w ill be asked to bear. The unfortunate lot of some of the women whose supporters have gone to the fron t has been brought prominently under notice in my constituency; and the people of Adelaide are beginning to rise in in dignation because of the fact that a section of the community have to be fed w i th bread from the TradesH a l l .

148,Mr Yates,"The motion does notdesire to attack any individual salary. While I cannot go as far as the honourable member for Brisbane has done in fixing a certain margin, I feel that, in supporting his proposal,we shall only voice the opinion of our constituents that, while those enjoying high salaries have not been called upon to submit to any reduction, the pinch of the war is being felt by those least for the Labour party to be restive, but able to bear it. The burden of the war is not being equitably borne. We have passed Works Estimates for £4.,300,000 in respect of the current financial year, but, although eight months of the year have elapsed, only £1,500,000 of that amount has yet been expended. sufficient is not being done for those who have to succour the women and children left behind by our soldiers. I do not wish to see any man underpaid. Such a thing is foreign to the desire of honourable members on this side; but when sacrifices have to be made, we wish the burden to be equitably distributed. By agreeing to this proposed vote without offering any protest, we should not be doing our duty to our constituents. all due respect to the mover of this amendment, I cannot refrain from expressing -the opinion that it is a somewhat hollow pretence. He cannot hope to accomplish what he claims will follow the acceptance of his amendment, and, in the light of recent happenings, it is certainly a very hollow proposal. Only yesterday we were informed that the Treasurer had agreed to pay a fee of £7 7s. per day to an examiner of accounts. fee of £ 8 8s. per day when away from home. tion, I admit, is only a temporary one. T had expected the Government to come down with a comprehensive scheme for equalizing conditions. that we members of Parliament, at £600 a year, are receiving much more than we would if conditions were equalized. If the Government intend to equalize conditions, then , I shall be with them. I dare say I should not have seen the inside of this chamber but for my association with the Kvabram movement, which was primarily an attack upon the tall poppies of the Public ""Service. I am, therefore, in sympathy ^vith any movement to prevent those who have a little more than they want receiving still more while there are in the community many who are receiving less than they actually need. In consequence of tlie war and the drought, the conditions in Australia are bad all round, but the position is worse in the States that are under Labour dominance. There is good reason they should give expression to their restiveness in Caucus, where their protests would have some effect in inducing the Government to bring down a comprehensive scheme. If they did that, they would show that they were in earnest. The We feel that Labour Government in Western Australia has proposed a reduction of salaries in respect of the very class that they were supposed to uphold and benefit. In the West Australian of 24th ult. there appears this statementA railway employee at Brown Hill summed up the position when he stated that last fortnight his pay was £5 17s. 6d., in place of £7 ls. 3d. That means that he is receiving l is . 10Jd. per week less than was previously paid to him.

The Onposition have promised to assist the Government in every proposal incidental to the war, and we shall be found behind them in every proposal that will benefit the great mass of the people.

The only matter to which I take exceptionand it is more a matter of account than anything else-is that there seems to be a disposition to mix up in the Treasury -accounts the expenditure for war and the expenditure for ordinary purposes. I think that is undesirable. I know the position, and I have spoken to the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Allen, about it, and he has explained to me the difficulty, which, I have no doubt, is a real one.

Such a system as the honourable member indicated is adopted in the various States, where loan expenditure is charged against loan funds, and ordinary expenditure against revenue account. That system has been -adopted all over Australia, and I do not see why some means of similarly dividing the expenditure could not have been devised by us. We should have loan Estimates for loan expenditure, and ordinary Estimates for ordinary expenditure, instead of which we are treating the whole of this as ordinary revenue expenditure. We want to avoid making charges against revenue when they are properly charges for loan, regarding which we have to pay interest and sinking fund. I only mention the matter to my right honourable friend so that he may give it his attention. sult the honourable member. be some means of dividing the expenditure hereafter if it cannot be done as we go along. I should like to see th© two things kept separate, so that we may know what we have spent on the war which is properly chargeable to loan, and what we have to charge against the ordinary revenue.

I should like to be quite sure exactly as to the position, because on turning to the Estimates in chief on page 65, I find, according to the figures given there, that the total amount which is made available for war expenditure, and which appears elsewhere as coming out of loan funds, is £11,742,750. Apparently the Prime Minister has, in these figures which he has given us, simply included the pay of the Take a Expeditionary Forces which appear on page 65 under two items, and has left all the other items alone. figures that have been handed to me. The expenmates of expenditure shows similar items which go to make up the estimated expenditure consequent upon the war, whicli is set down at £11,742,050, which expenditure is shown elsewhere as being provided out of loan money.

The note issue, which must be taken into consideration in the financing of the war expenditure, is £26,664,323, and the gold held is £10,109,165, of which £3,000,000 presumably is money borrowed from the banks. The Treasurer admitted in his statement the other day that in order to -increase the volume of the note issue by £10,000,000 more he must avail himself of the £7,000,000 not as yet drawn from the banks, and he proposed to extend the note issue to between £40,000,000 and £50,000,000. long the war will last. much worse if the war extends, and we will need to borrow more;, but no matter how our expenditure may increase, we",24,Supply Bill No 5

Our aim may be defeated by circumstances, but we should be able to state approximately in advance the revenue we -expect from certain sources, and the expenditure we must be prepared to meet. I cannot conceive from the memorandum of the Treasurer what our position will be at the end of the year. We are actually -carrying on by borrowing to some extent from the banks. might raise this discussion better on a general debate. At any time. I shall be glad to afford him a day on which to -debate the matter, but to-day we are dealing with a special war vote. -of any apprehension that exists in the minds of the Opposition. nexion with this war vote. is in relation to a sum which is portion of the total amount of £28,000,000 that is to be got from the Imperial Government, as now disclosed by the memorandum which the Treasurer has placed before us. The additional borrowing is to -be for additional expenditure in connection with the Expeditionary Forces, and we are now asked to sanction part of that additional expenditure, and I ask for a particular explanation as to how we are going to carry on. Undoubtedly the note issue is increasing out of proportion to the reserve. When the war is over we shall find that we cannot contract this great volume to.the normal conditions of a note issue without a great strain on our fluid assets. The banks may require their £10,000,000 at any moment, and at present our gold reserve is only £7,000,000, if we leave out of consideration the £3,000,000 received from the banks. As a matter of fact, the disproportion between the gold reserve and the volume of the note issue is increasing. On the 29th December last, the note issue was £16,365,336, and we held against it gold valued at £7,016,216, and there was about £9,300,000 odd which was uncovered and available for investment with the States on interest-bearing loans which produce a profit. The Treasurer made a statement which I saw in the press on the 3rd March, and he gave the total volume of note issue as £25,232,463, and the gold reserve at £10,133,227. Now, with practically the same gold, we have nearly £1,600,000 added to the issue, and we are only commencing. We are increasing the volume by the ordinary payments for public purposes, and as that increase goes on we shall arrive at a stage when the gold reserve will be nearly 25 per cent. Treasury. never be secure if we approach the statutory limit. As a matter of fact, the Bank of England now has a much smaller note issue than the gold held against it. I have the figures for the Reichsbank, the Bank of France, and the Bank of England. Not even the Reichsbank, with its volume of £250,000,000 before the war, has in reserve only the proportion of gold that we have. I am not going to surmise from what sources the gold reserves of Germany have been obtained. We must be very careful in the financing of the note issue. The total issue of the Reichsbank at the end of last December was £250,000,000, and there was a total reserve of 59 per cent., with a gold cover of 42 per cent. The American banks under the banking system of last year are supposed to have a cover of 42 per cent. I do not wish to be led into a discussion as to how it is that the Reichsbank has got that money. As a matter of fact, it is at the present time a. subject of inquiry, and people do not know whether the money has been lent by Austria or not. takes no notice of current accounts and deposits. disregarding any factor affecting my argument.

207,Mr Glynn,"I have not said thatfigures do not throw sufficient light on the financing Government operations during method proposed for balancing at the end of the year. The right honourable gentleman admits that the note issue is likely to expand to £40,000,000, and it is not clear how, if that happens, he will be able to keep a gold reserve which will maintain even the statutory backing of 25 per cent, to which we ought never to approach. There has been a large increase in the volume of the note issue, and I acknowledge that in war times the increase above the normal volume demanded by commerce must be substantial. crease in Great Britain, but it, as a substantial addition, lasted only for a few weeks. I do not wish to go into the commercial side of the question. I do not in any way condemn the financing of the right honourable member, but I repeat the expression of disquiet which I and others uttered some six months ago as to what may occur if there is a very large increase in -the volume of the note issue, and it should become necessary to reduce that volume to something like what was the normal limit before the war. How can that be done without destroying the gold reserve? If you have to depend on a gold reserve, the greater part of which is at the call of the banks, under the arrangement _ you have made with them, the position may become, not serious in regard to our solvency, but embarrassing to the Treasury. ister and Treasurer) [2.50] I regret that this question should have been raised on this particular occasion, when, as I have already explained, the Committee is being asked to sanction expenditure necessitated by the hurrying away of a larger expeditionary force than was anticipated when the original Estimates were tabled. We require a special appropriation, amounting to £3,500,000, plus the amount provided for already, to enable the present estimated expenditure to be met. No man in the country can tell whether this sum will be sumcient to meet our requirements to the end of June, but the estimate is the best that the Defence Department can make, and I am sure that I speak for Parliament when I say that if more men can be provided more money will be supplied. No one would welcome more than I should a discussion of the financial position and of the best manner of these dimcult times. I join issue with the honourable member for Angas on his statement that the private banks, which have been generous and straightforward in their transactions with me, are in any way embarrassed or suffering injustice, or weaker because of the arrangement with me. in regard to the financing of importations, and my remarks were based on some authority. There was a temporary indoes not wish me to turn aside from the direct question of tlie financing of the Commonwealth to discuss whether the margin of exchange lies here or in Great Britain. One of the difficulties of the position was that the rate of exchange was against Australia, and we had to consider how best to get over that difficulty. The proposition was that the Commonwealth should raise money in London, if possible. I suggested that we should appeal to the British Government for a loan of £18,000,000 for war purposes if the banks would co-operate with us and give us a loan of £10,000,000. I thought that in that way we could finance the States and get rid of the exchange difficulty. It is a remarkable fact that', immediately the transaction was carried out, the financial credit of Australia altered, and every person interested infinanceconsidered that the trouble was ended, not for a day, but for a year, and, perhaps, until the end of the war. The banks have given us £3,000,000 in pursuance of an arrangement with the Commonwealth whereby both their interests and ours were protected. I have expressed, again and again, my opinion of their patriotic and business like action. works of the country to be carried on through State instrumentalities. ber for Angas spoke of the difference between the amount of gold held against a note issue of £25,000,000 and that held against a note issue of £27,000,000.

The suggestion was made that we should reduce the gold reserve to 25 per cent., but I have never supported such a reduction. We have said definitely and distinctly that the statutory reserve should not be less tlian 25 per cent, at any time, but with such a statutory reserve it would be impossible to reduce the proportion of gold held to 25 per cent. 33 per cent, as a sound working margin, but at the present time it is from 35 to 38 per cent.

As to the £10,000,000 lent by the banks, to be repaid at the end of the war, I do not think that there should be the slightest difficulty in wiping off the debt, or in coming to some satisfactory arrange[89] Y e t the honourable ment regarding it . There is no reason to fear that the Commonwealth credit will not be as good then as it is now, unless, of course, our enemies are the victors, in I said that you'will borrow which case nothing will much matter, though we shall have the satisfaction of having done our best. We have lent £18,000,000 to the Governments of the T w o instalments are States, which they are to repay at the end of the war. The British Government has lent us the same amount for an indefinite period, which may be from eight to fourWe have had teen years. What we are to get returned from the States will be a great help. for the purpose of repaying the banks and reducing the note issue ? would be a fool to say so far ahead what he is going to do with any particular amount of money, because no living man can tell at this time what he will be required to do at some future date, any more than can any honourable member know what will be the position of the money market a year hence. repayments by the States. the States are due to be repaid two years from the time the loans were entered into. Whenever the war ends, the settlement will not be much earlier than the date I have indicated. The £18,000,000 which the Mother Country has loaned to us is not due to be repaid at that t i m e; therefore, that amount will be available, and I have the best of reasons for saying I have always advocated that the bankers themselves will be quiteanxious to make conditions regarding the£10,000,000 they have lent to the Government. There is a false impression that the gold reserve in Australia is being depleted; as a matter of fact, it is in creasing. If we continue as we are doing at present, there will be no embarrassment of any kind when the war ends I shall come to that is whether the money to be repaid by the States to the Commonwealth is to be used to reduce the note issue and for the repayment of the amount borrowed from To discuss a side issue might the banks? would be the duty of any Government at the end of the war to reduce the note issue to normal. repaid by the States to be devoted to that purpose ?",27,Supply Bill No 5

That money will be paid ' into Consolidated Revenue, and dealt with as. may be decided by the persons appointed by the people to carry on the business of the country. anything to do with the matter, the agreement entered into wit'h the banks will be strictly carried out, and th© note issue will be reduced to its normal proportions as soon as possible after the war is over. That matter can soon be adjusted at the end of hostilities. I can again tell the Committee that the Government are in favour'of a convertible note issue. are in favour of a safe gold margin to be held against the notes. pelled to take those notes, although the banks have entered into arrangements in certain cases to hold the notes during this period of crisis. that if this matter is to be raised piecemeal, I would much prefer that it should be dealt with on a separate motion so that it may be discussed in detail, and so prevent any persons, who may wish to do so, damaging the credit of the country by saying that there is danger. is no danger, nor is there likely to be any, so long as we have a convertible note issue. to increase the note issue to £40,000,000 without the slightest danger or difficulty, and in saying that I am uttering not only my own opinion, but the opinions of some of the best-informed and most patriotic authorities in Australia. [3.5] I did not hear the early part of this discussion, but I heard the latter remarks of the right honourable gentleman, and I hope that he does not include me in the category of enemies of the credit of the country. colleague who has raised this matter is also entirely out of that category. May I suggest that in discussing these matters it would be infinitely better if the right honourable gentleman would cease raising the cry of "" wolf "" every time reI have already said ference is made to a financial matter. Somehow the right honourable gentleman seems obsessed with the idea that anybody who asks a question about the finances or the Commonwealth Bank is sum of an enemy to the credit of the country. That sort of fustian should cease. terday. Do not spoil your record now. ing my record, it is because the right honourable gentleman has set me an example. He should give others as well as himself credit for wishing to conserve If I have the credit of the country. He should be the last to complain about anybody on this side of the Chamber wishing to do anything to damage the credit of Australia. As I understand the issue which has been raised, the honourable member for Angas makes a clear distinction between the note issue and tlie solvency of the general finances. He has made it clear beyond We possibility of cavil that the credit of the country is unassailable; but that is not Nobody is comthe point. The question he raised is pertinent, and w ill have to be met some time or other, although, personally, I should not have raised it at this stage. I desire to say again The position is that very shortly the note issue will have reached £25,000,000 or £50,000,000. how the right honourable member is going to escape that result. He will have to go There far beyond the £40,000,000 at the rate he is travelling at the present time. Let us suppose that the note issue shortly I believe it will be possible reaches £40,000,000. Immediately the war is over the right honourable gentleman will be under his first obligation to reduce the volume of notes, and, therefore, the volume of the gold reserve. And , as he has only £4,000,000 of gold, which was in the reserve originally, plus the £10,000,000 which he has received from the banksa total of £14,000,000 to set against the £40,000,000 worth of noteshe must realize that he will require to make some tremendous adjustments of the finances the moment the war period I am certain that my is over.

The balance was in the coffers of the banks. Therefore, if there was that actual circulation of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 in ordinary circumstances, the right honourable gentleman, in order to meet the. present extraordinary circumstances, will require to extend the issue to £45,000,000 or £50,000,000.
