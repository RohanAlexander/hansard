34,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"About threeMonday, because I do not suppose any one intends that they shall work on the SundayI think it is clear that the House should take into consideration whether they should not yield up to the Ministry one other day. I do not think this state of things should be allowed; and I feel that I cannot blame the Ministry, as I otherwise would blame them, when I recognise that we have four sitting days, and that there is so little time left for them to do their work outside the House. I therefore ask the Ministry if they intend to reserve for themselves tbe Fridayi n each week, or to continue sitting as we now do. No self-respecting House would allow the present state of things to continue. The Acts Interpretation Bill was recommitted twice, and the Public Service Bill contains more amendments than original clauses, and one Bill after another is brought down in such an imperfect condition that it becomes wearisome to discuss them. I consider that tlie Ministry is disgraced when a junior of this House, and an inexperienced member, should be able no less than a month ago to point out tlie defects in the measures which they have brought forward. I think under all these circumstances we should go through these amendments clause by clause. Clause1 amended to read as follows, and agreed to :1.

When the matter was viously the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, urged that something should be done in the interests of women employed in the public service, and pointed out that if we took any steps that would give female emyloyes the right to the same payment as male employees we might, in trying to benefit the women, do them serious injury. A t that tune the honourable and learned member for In di proposed an amendment or made a suggestion which was adopted by the Government, it being felt that we ought to protect female employee's from any undue loss. It is a remarkable incident that nine of the young women who have given their time, without payment to the postal department in Victoria, have suddenly received notice that they will receive 10s, a week for the time they have been working, and that their services will not be further required, as the department does not intend to use females for this work in the future. statement 1 sure of that 1 read the notice from the head of the department. I will not impute motives to the head of tlie department, but it looks to meverymuch like a determination on his part to do exactly as he likes and thwart the desire of honourable members-to see justice done to the female operators. I hope the Government will make inquiry and see that these young women are not made victims to any resolution of the House, and further, wil l see that if the policy of tlie department is to changed until those who have tionary workers have had an opportunity of working in the department. To my knowledge, a number of these young women gave up their situations, and devoted their time to the Government without any payment. examination, and should certainly not be treated harshly.

Under the Constitution it is provided that when a public servant is taken over by the Commonwealth he shall enjoy all the privileges he enjoyed in his particular State. The letter sorters in so me of the States are included in the clerical staff, and in one or two of the States-Ne w South Wales and Victoria, I think, if not morethey are treated as a separate class and excluded from the clerical class. I have been waited on by tbe same class in both New South Wales and Victoria, and it appears that whilst the letter sorters of Queensland will be considered part of the clerical staff by right under the Constitution, the letter sorters of the two former States will be excluded. The letter sorters of the Commonwealth, if they happen to be taken over from Queensland, will be treated as belonging to the clerical staff, but if they come from New South Wales or Victoria they will be excluded and paid accordingly. honourable member is It may be that this matter would more properly come under the Postal Bill, but I should like the honourable gentleman to consider, as I have not seen that Bill yet, whether it should be dealt with in tbe PostalB ill Ori n this Bill.

72,Sir William Lyne,"No t that I amhighly necessary that we should have a clear understanding with regard to tlie question of the employment of women in the public service. I was not present .yesterday, but I understand that tlie Government then gave the House an assurance that no change in policy would be adopted with regard to the employment of women. In view of the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I should like to say that when the Public Service Bill was brought down to the House, the Government had in contemplation, according to clause 71, the facilitating of the employment of women, rather, it seemed to me, giving the preference to women where they could possibly give them the pi«£erenee. coupled with a schedule in the Bill, from which it appeared that women would be paid at a less rate"" than men in all cases, and that whatever the excellence or capabilities of a woman might be, she would receive less money. That seemed to me unfair on both sides, unfair to men that the employment of women should be facilitated, and unfair to women, wherever they could do the work properly that they should get a less wage than men. The clause eventually adopted by the House seemed to me to be a very fair course to adopt. Buti t carries with it as a necessary corollary that we are not to turn our backs upon the employment of women. We are not necessarily to give them the same salaries as men receive, but we are to give them equal salaries up to the top of the 5th class where it is certified by the commissioner that they can do the work as well as men. If that is a clear understanding, whatever difficulties may arise in connection with individual cases can be cured by individual attention. But we want to be assured that there will be no general policy adopted of shunting women from the public service merely because they are women, and of employing men merely because they are men. I am glad this matter has been brought up, because it is quite possible that the eight or nine ladies whose services have been' dispensed connection with the telephone department may have been dismissed, not because of the increased salary which would have to be paid them undeithis Bill, but from another cause. that some time ago there was a protest against Sunday labour on the part of the telephone exchange operators, and it is quite likely that that may have been the cause of the dismissal of these ladies, and that it is not the act of tlie Executive in consequence of the opinion of Parliament that women should be paid a salary equivalent for work done. We have recognised the principle that the wages should be equivalent to the work done, and that the Government should not take advantage of the accident of sex to to give women less remuneration for the same amount of work as is performed by men. That is at once a direct violation of the principle which we laid down in committee when that clause was passed. I hope That was that the Minister will inquire into this matter. If the telephone operators in question have been dismissed because of the protest which was entered against Sunday labour, the answer is that that protest was not made by the probationers, but by the staff, and therefore the blow has fallen on the wrong shoulders altogether. It is therefore a breach of faith with these young ladies, many of whom have given up good positions and incurred tlie expense of getting medical certificates, as to their fitness for their offices, when they are summarily told now that their services are no longer required. It is a breach of faith, and a pieceof maladministration, and is opposed to the principle ""recognised by the House that the salary should be equivalent to the labour performed, whether that labour be performed by men or women. WhilstI quite agree with some of those gentlemen who have raised this question of the employment and the payment of women, that it is desirable that there should be an opening for the employment of women in the public service, especially in the post-office, I cannot altogether agree with the argument that if women are less capable of performing the work, they should receive a salary similar to that paid to men. member misunderstood tbe argument. stand it, and I will give the reason why. with in This House has determined that there shall be equal payment for men and women in certain grades of the public service.

By fixing the same rate of pay to each, I am afraid that there is a great danger that injustice may be done to the female employees. I quite admit that if they give similar service they should get similar pay, but what I wish to point out is that if in some cases they do not give similar service, but still can be usefully employed at a lower rate of pay, by restricting'the right of the departments to give that lower pay, we are restricting the opportunity for female service in such an institution as tbe Post office. A t any rate, most of the hecids of the departments, who have bad women under them in my experience, have said that there are cases in which women can give an equivalent service, but that in the great majority of cases they can not. cases they can not, and if they are to be employed, there must be some lesser rate of pay given than is provided for men. able member that women were put on to Sunday -work, because they could be relied on more, and did it better than men. the honourable member alludes, there may be a very good reason for his statement and representation to the House. But I am not taking into consideration any particular instance. I am only saying that, taking all things into consideration, such as capacity for long continuance of work, and also for continued employment over a number of years, the male employd is move reliable than is the female. There are many things that take women away from their employment, which do not operate in the case of men, and which thus make women not so suitable in the majority of cases, as employees of our public departments, as are men. ' [168] women can perform services equally with men, and in those cases they ought to get an equal rate of pay with men. But, if such is not the case in other branches of work, and if we do not desire to restrict the employment of women, there has to be some difference in the wages paid, or the active head of the department will say, "" I am going to conduct my department on the best principles, and therefore I must employ the labour most suitable for producing the best results."" I am very much afraid that in making a hard-and-fast rule that each shall be paid alike, the House is unintentionally injuring tlie prospects of the employment of women. It has been said that in New South Wales and Victoria there are certain employees who are classed with the clerical division, while similar employees in other States are classed in the general division. If that is so, there is some just cause for complaint, because, as a matter of fact, they are very often employed at clerical work. In any case, the knowledge they require as letter-sorters is more of a clerical description than are the mere qualifications forwaiting, such as are possessed by. attendants in offices, who are classed with the general division. I think there is some good reason why they should be considered. Probablyi t will, have to be considered by the commissioner under tbe Public Service Bill. I think there is some just ground for complaint, as regards tbe fact that some of the transferred officers have to pay 4 per cent, of their salaries into the superannuation fund, and others only 3 per I can assure the honorcent. I say that if there is an inequality of payment and an equality of benefit, then the regulation is decidedly wrong, and ought to be altered. If the benefit is the same in each case, and tlie payment is unequal, there ought to be some alteration made. But if, on tlie other hand, there is some superior benefit secured by tbe higher payment, then, of course, those officers who are called upon to make it are not being unjustly treated. It has been said that there is not that difference in the benefit which would, account for the difference in the payment. If that is so, I have no doubt the matter will receive the attention of the Minister, and that he will submit some proper proposal for an alteration-.. If the payment is equal, the benefit should' be equal. If there is an inequality of payment, there should be some superior beneThere may be isolated cases in which fit for the higher payment.",23,Public Service Bill

85,Mr Thomson,"In the case to whichthis Bill was last before the House two or three matters have cropped up, some of more or less importance. The first of these-and I desire to secure tbe Minister's particular attention to it, because it affects his own State-is the definition given in the Bill of "" temporary employees."" The New South Wales men, or a large number of them, are employed under a definition of ""temporary"" service in that State, which does not harmonize in any sense with tbe definition in this Bill. I am informed that men have been kept on there for years, and called temporary hands, whereas this Bill provides that a temporary hand cannot be employed for move than nine months in tbe Commonwealth service. find out is whether these men who have been acting as temporary hands are to get any rights at all, or whether they are to be retained fov another nine months and then -be dismissed. It would be obviously unfair to permit that. within the natural meaning of the words, they are permanent emploj'es. If they .are permanent employees, it will be necessavy to insert some clause which will conserve the rights of those particular individuals. As to the question of letter sorters, I am inclined to say that that is a matter for the Public Service Commissioner to detevmine. He will have to set anomalies right, and to see that men performing similar work receive similar rates of pay. But my principal object in rising was to emphasize the position which appeal's to have been taken by the heads of departments in respect to the employment of female labour. I do not know whether tbe statements appearing in the press ave to be considered official or unofficial, but it seems to me that the permanent heads of the departments have made up their minds that they will not pay the minimum salary which the House has decided shall be paid to female employees. In a conversation I had with one permanent head only recently, he was quite frank and open in dealing with the matter, and said that he would not recommend the payment of salary at the rate of £ 1 1 0 per annum to the females m his department. If he were to be expected to run his department as a commercial concern, he told me that be would avail himself of the provisions of the clause and would withhold bis | recommendation. Now, if that course is pursued, the intention of the House will be entirely disregarded, and women will not be recommended for the salary which the House has fixed, or if the department is to have its way, the women will be dismissed. I do not think that is fair at all. I can conceive very well of a number of .circumstances in which women can give adequate sevvice fov the minimum salary which the House has fixed and where they would be well worth the money, and the officers to whom I have referred have no right whatever to set aside the will of Parliament. I desire to obtain from the Minister some kind of assurance, before he replies to all the matters that have been referred to, as to whether these statements that are appearing in the press are in any way recognised or supported by the Ministry, ov whether the plain intention of Parliament is to be carried out, so that persons in the State employment;, irrespective of sex, may receive the salary that Parliament has fixed as a fair minimum vate of wage. This £110 It is quite clear that a year is not to be regarded in any other light than as a minimum rate for any male or female in the service of the Commonwealth who may have reached the age of 21 years. I heavtily suppovt the contention of other honourable members in connection with this matter, and I hope the departmental heads will be told that they must carry out the intention of Parliament and that it is not their business to say what salary should be paid. I desire to specially emphasize the remarks that have been made with reference to the positions of letter sorters, railway line repairers, and others following similar kinds of employment in the service of the Commonwealth. It does seem to me that these two classes of sevvants of the State are not placed by any means in a satisfactory position, and that this is an opportune time to level them all up, and to take care that they shall lose none of the privileges they have now, and that they shall all be placed on tbe same footing as those following these classes of employment and who are most privileged in the other States. So far as the position of the letter sorters is concerned, I beg leave to doubt whether the commissioner will be able to take the necessary action to place them in a satisfactory position. He may appoint these men as",24,Public Service Bill

They are classified in some States as clerical employees, and there are distinctions in the matter of retiring allowances and holidays and that kind of thing, but I am referring more particularly to their, pension rights. I think we should make it clear in this B ill that we are going to place them all on the same footing with regard to these retiring allowances. It is a matter that requires to be gone into very carefully, and it is necessary . that some provision should be made on an actuarial basis, either by Act of Parliament or by these servants can be placed on the same footing as regards retiring and other allowances when they are brought over from the States. will look into this matter, so that all these servants may start fair under tlie new conditions, and so that no matter in what'State they may have been they may be on an equal footing. As to the line repairers, they are just as useful a class of servants to the Commonwealth as a whole as are those servants who are employed in the clerical division; and, as their work is, in the very essence of it of a permanent character, they should be put on the same footing as are other permanent employees. Now, these line repairers are, in some of the States, employed for six or nine months, and at the expiration of that term of permanent employment they are re-appointed, so as to make them what I may call "" permanent temporary hands."" past, but it is not to be so in the future. the future, unless it is specially provided for. that injustice has not been done to any of Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is specially provided for. not think that it is a matter that ought to be left to the commissioner to tackle when he comes into office, but it seems to me that it is one that should be dealt with by the Government before they hand over the service to the commissioner.

So many amendments were made when the Bill was in committee that I think honourable members will consider that many of the provisions, however much they may have been regulation, so that modified, have not yet been made perfect. The House, however, will not probably desire that there should be a long discussion on the motion for the third reading of the I -hope the Minister Bill, and I am therefore hoping that when the measure comes back from another place, we shall have an opportunity of reconsidering two or three matters which I trust will attract the attention of tlie other House. There is one matter to which I should like distinctly to refer. As one who has consistently regretted that it is necessary to have females in any of our departments occupying positions which men ought to fill, I would, at the same time, be the last to wish to see any inj ustice done to our female employees, and I am rather disposed to believe that the view which has been expressed here is likely to operate disadvantageously to these female employee's under, the conditions which have been conceded by the Minister in charge of the Bill.

I have consistently held-and I said so during the debate upon the second reading of the Bill-that any female who is employed in the Government service, who can give us service equal to that which could be rendered by a male employee in the same division is entitled to receive equal remuneration. That cannot be gainsaid. But, at the same time, I hold that it is altogether unreasonable to suppose that females will be .physically capable of giving service equal to that of men in all departments of the State. I recognise that there are very many classes of work in the federal service which females can do equally well with men, and in such cases the females ought to be equally well paid. I have only risen for the one purpose of urging upon tlie Minister that if he possibly can he will give an assurance to the House that female employees will not be placed in a disadvantageous position in any of the departments of the Commonwealth in consequence of the resolutions passed by this House. I also wish to express the hope that we shall have an opportunity of reconsidering certain portions of the Bill that seem to me at the present stage to be incomplete. I therefore reiterate strongly what has been said so well by some honourable members who preceded me, and particular]}' by the honourable and learned member for Indi, that some declaration by the Minister is necessary in the interests of the female servants of tbe Commonwealth. desire to impress upon the Minister the necessity of seeing that the temporary hands in the Commonwealth service are not overlooked in this measure. We had a considerable discussion on this point, and we were assured by the Minister that the matter would be looked into, and that if the provisions of the Bill did not cover such cases as have been referred to by the honourable member for Darling, and on previous occasions by honourable members for South Australia, Mr Batchelor and Mr Solomon, in connection with temporary employment in that State, the matter would be rectified. We know there are some officers in South Australia who have been on what is called the temporary staff for fifteen or twenty years, and it will be a calamity if, when this Bill is put into operation, it is found that it does those who are called upon to administer it. not cover such cases as these. We were told some time ago that where it might be necessary to makn reductions in the service the temporary hands would be the first to go, and the tendency will be to fall upon the people I have referred to when retrenchment takes place. We were told yesterday that the policy of the Government, in regard to dismissals of female employees, had not been indicated to the officers of the Commonwealth, and yet we have it to-day on the authority of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that certain young ladies in the Victorian department of the federal service have already received notice. I think it is time that we laid it down that whatever* the policy of the Commonwealth is, it must be carried out by the officers of the various, departments. I assume that the honourable member who has brought this matter under the notice of the House is quite sure of his facts. 1 written notices here. clear as possible that the department is acting coutrary to the instructions of Parliament, and that should not be allowed. ance with secret instructions. change seem to have been going on for aconsiderable time. Paragraphs about what was going to be done have appeared in the press, and it has been practically intimated that the heads of the department have agreed upon a certain line of policy. Yesterday, however, we had an assurance from the Government that no such policy had been agreed upon, and until it has been agreed upon by the Government tbe heads of the department should not be allowed to flaunt this House by putting a penalty on some of the weaker members of the service. Where women are doing the same work as men they should receive the same pay ; there cannot be two arguments about that. I do not contend that there are the not some things which women are physically incapable of doing as well as men, but in a great many branches of our public service women are quite as competent and as reliable workers as men.

I hope we shall always consider that however imperfect a measure may ultimately prove to be, we should not allow it to leave this House knowing it to be imperfect. doing so. quired, we should be willing to give the time necessary to make it here, instead of sending the measure to the other branch of the legislature to be perfected. I wish to allude to n matter upon which we had an assurance yesterday from .the Minister who represents the Postmaster-Generali n this House. He declared that no alteration of policy in the administration of the Postal department was intended by the Postmaster General. I am sure that we were all glad to have that assurance, and I , in common with other honourable members, am sorry to hear that something has taken place which may be considered as a departure from the policy which we were assured would continue. I hope, however, that there has been some misunderstanding, and that the Minister will see that the department is carried out in accordance with tlie promise which has been given to this House. We must bear in mind that we have not laid down any hard arid fast rule as to the salaries which women in the public service are to receive.. After they have reached the salary of £110 per annum their increases will depend, as increases to the salaries of male officials will depend, upon the recommendation of the commissioner, who in the case of females must certify that they are equally capable as men of performing the work required of their offices. I think that we have not gone beyond what is just to those who have to pay the pubbc servants and to those who are employed in the public service. An honourable member has referred to the term ""federal pension,"" but I do not .know that there is such a thing as a federal pension. Public servants who have been transferred from the service of a State where pensions are provided will not lose any of their rights or privileges by reason of their transfer. Their pension rights are to be continued to them, but the pensions that are paid to them will be federal pensions only in the sense that the Federal Government will contribute its share in proportion to the length of time they remain in the federal service. But any public servant of a State who is entitled to a pension will bring over with him into the service of the Commonwealth, not only his rights to a pension, but also the liabilities, if any, attached to those rights. If in the service of the State he was compelled to contribute to a fund out of which his pension was payable, he must coutinue that contribution or j>ercentage deduction. I do not see that the officers who have been transferred under these conditions have any reason for complaint. the rights are now unequal. The officials would like to have them equalized. officials in the Commonwealth service depend upon the rights which they enjoyed while members of a State service. I think that we cannot give officers of the Commonwealth service higher privileges than those to which they were entitled when in a State, service. If in New South Wales an officer was entitled to a pension of £ 3 0 0 a year, while in Queensland an officer in the same grade was entitled to a pension of only £ 2 5 0 a year, we cannot equalize their positions when they are both transferred to the Commonwealth service, but we preserve to them the rights which they enjoyed in their respective States. alter those rights 1 them? alter them, if they wish us to do so, and are prepared to bear the brunt of the alteration 1 Mr V.

If there is to be a levelling up in this respect, we must place all officers who have been transferred upon the same basis with regard to pensions, which would be impossible unless we adopted a federal pension systems The policy which the House has adopted is not a pension system, but a policy of life insurance. I have had placed in my hands a copy of the notice which has been sent to some of the girls employed in the General Post office in Melbourne. It is in these termsAs there is no immediate prospect of the staff of female telephone switch operators being increased, the necessity for your attending at the Central Telephone Exchange to learn the duties no longer exists ; and it is requested that you will any official to mete out reprisals to employees be good enough to at once cease attending.

The notice is signed by the Deputy Postmaster-General. certainly acquired rights which should be respected, and, as we have been given to understand that tlie poHcy of the department is not to be altered, there should not be an alteration in regard to them. I should like the Minister, when speakingin reply, to satisfy the fears of honourable members in regard to the position of temporary, or provisionally temporary, employees transferred from State services. I ask him to be very explicit in stating that officers whose employment in a State service, though technically called temporary has been virtually permanent, shall be taken into the Commonwealth service as permanent employees. I know that it is difficult to frame a clause which will cover all tlie cases with which it is necessary to deal in the protection of the interests of the employees; but if the Minister will say straight out that all these officials will be taken over as permanent employees, and that the wording of the clause will not be a barrier to that being done, he will satisfy honourable members' fears. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Ho w many of the employee's in tlie Postal department of South Australia were on the pro. and tern, list when the honourable member was ' recently administering it t A very large number. per cent. Mr V. L. SOLOMON -And many of them had been years in the service 1 have been 26 years in the service, and who are still on the pro. and tern. list. It seems to me that under the clause as it stands they might be held to be temporary employesof the Commonwealth service, and might be liable to dismissal at any time. That is why I ask the Minister to make an explicit declaration of the policy of the Government on the subject. W it h regard to the employment of women in the service, I cannot conceive that the circular which has been referred to this afternoon has been issued as the result of a decision come to by a committee of this House upon one of the clauses of the Bill, because it would be a preposterous and outrageous proceeding for under his control because of something which had been done by the Legislature. This measure has not yet become law, and the right to decide whether women empk^es These young ladies have shall in all cases receive equal payment with men is left, not to the Deputy Postmaster-General, or to any official in his department, but to the commissioner who is yet to be appointed. To anticipate the decision of Parliament, and therefore to do an injustice to certain employees, is an act of which I do not think the Deputy Postmaster-General of Victoria capable. If that is why he issued the circular, the sooner he is removed from his position the better, because it is of no use for us to pass laws regulating the conduct of the public service if the officials who have to administer the service refuse to carry them out in the spirit as well as in the letter. I would give my assistance to any extent that might be necessary to bring about the proper observance of any A ct We might pass. member does not suppose that the Deputy Postmaster-General issued the circular without consulting the Postmaster-General. whether he did so or not, but I cannot conceive that the circular-was issued because of a vote which was come to in this Chamber. I should not support a Ministry which I believed capable of advising one of its servants to act in such a manner as to bring about the reconsideration of a vote of the Legislature-and that is the object of the issue of I think quite 75 the circular which is conveyed in the honourable member's suggestion.

120,Mr Batchelor,"I do not knowgiven my opinion upon the subject of tbe employment of women, and I came in for a good deal of adverse criticism for suggesting that what has occurred might be the result of what we were proposing to do. I may say that what I dreaded was not that any attempt would be made to dismiss any of the present staff, but that in the future when new employees were to be put on, there would be very few women employed if we enforced the originalproposal, and I urged that in all cases the same amount should be paid to women as to men. What was done, namely, to leave tlie matter in the hands of the commissioner, seemed to ine and the committee the only safe way. else could decide as to the amount of work, the kind of work, and the ability with which the work was being done. The commissioner is responsible, and it is with the commissioner we have to leave the matter. I hope the Minister will make inquiries, and see that the public have not the slightest ground for the suspicion which has been entertained that the action of the Postal department is .the result of the decision of the committee of this House. matter I desire to bring uuder the notice of the Minister for Home Affairs. While the Bil l was under discussion an effort was made to introduce a provision which would allow of tbe transfer of public servants from the service of the Commonwealth to that of the States. There has been, in my opinion, an interference with the spirit of the Constitution in the Postal department; or, rather, the interference has occurred in a State department. It has been the rule in Victoria for many years to allow officers who have specially qualified themselves to be transferred from department to department, where their services can be better availed of. The Agricultural department in Victoria has found it necessary to appoint a number of inspectors, whose business it is to traverse the country with the view of putting down what are known as insect pests in the orchards and in the vine-growing districts of the State. In the Postal department, .an officer devoted some four or five years to the careful study of entomology and micrology, in order to fit himself for one of these positions. It was found necessary by the Victorian Government recently to appoint a new inspector, and a competitive examination was held. The officer to whom I have referred applied for permission to present himself for examination, but the permission was refused, oh the ground, that he had passed over to the Commonwealth. After consultation with the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, a note was sent to the State department, and the officer was allowed to compete. He came out at the top of the list, but while it was called a competitive examination, and while the fact that he was allowed to compete might be considered an acceptance by the State of his right to the position, should he prove himself qualified, this officer has been passed over in favour of the one next to him on the list. ' the State. State. Surely there is going to be somereciprocity in these matters, and if the Commonwealth is going to take over a number of officers from tbe States, the least the States can do is to act fairly and honestly by the Commonwealth. Those officers who came over to the Commonwealth feeling satisfied that under the provisions of the Constitution Act every right which they enjoyed would be secured to them, must feel that they are not being fairly treated. I would ask the Minister, therefore, if he. will make some inquiry into this matter, and whether these facts cannot be brought prominently under the notice of the Government of Victoria with a view to having what I believe to be a wrong righted. If what I ask is done we shall at the very beginning assert the principle that faith should be kept with these men, and a great deal of unrest which exists at the present time will be removed and probably similar dissatisfaction avoided in the future. the desire of the Minister to turn out legislation as nearly perfect as possible, and with his experience of the public service as Minister of an adjoining State, he no doubt will escape many dangers and difficulties. But I notice a very serious omission from the Bill, namely, the omission of any provision for tlie establishment of an Appeal Court. An Appeal Court is so important to the service itself, tending as it does to the better feeling of the officers, and also to greater security for the public, that provision should be made in this direction. And in orderto fulfil his desire for a good measure the Minister would do well to recommit the Bil l with a view to considering tbe suggestion I now",29,Public Service Bill

If that be pre-supposed, it is necessary, in order to prevent discontent, that an Appeal Court should be supplied for any officers' who may consider themselves injured or improperly treated. fact that there was an Appeal Court would tend to more careful recommendations and administration on tbe part of beads of tbe departments ; and, indeed, I think that in order to carry out the principle of promotion -.by merit, there must be a tribunal of the kind established. strong punishment for officers if they do not carry out their work properly. we putthe power of punishment into the hands of the commissioner, no power is given to injured officers to make any appeal against recommendations by which they may feel they aire injured. have considerable power in recommending to the commissioner and the inspectors . certain officers for advance in the service.

WILLIS (Robertson) I was certainly under the impression that it was the intention of the Minister to move the recommittal of the Bill. measure which I consider is a great improvement upon any similar Act in operation in the States, and I think it reflects very much credit upon the Minister. But I regret to find that he has not adhered to a promiseI think he must have given a promise to some one, because it-appears to be the general impression that the Bill, would be recommitted-and it was my intention to bring under notice several amendments that .1. think would really improve the measure. I merely rise to make myself understood by those who have communicated with me on the .subject, and who have brought under my [17 JULY, 1901.] BUI. 2649 notice material amendments which might be made.. I regret very much that the Minister has not moved the recommittal of the Bill. the recommittal unless the honourable member told me for what purpose he wanted it reproperly remunerated. committed 1 MrH . WILLIS I think that during this afternoon there was a Bill recommitted as a whole, and we commenced its discussion from the first clause. If the Minister has already given a promise to an honourable member that he would recommit the Bill, there was no necessity for me to mention to him any particular clause. I regret very much that he has not recomlistened with some attention to the debate which has taken place upon this Bill, and I find now that two or three honourable members seem to be afraid of the work of this Chamber, and of their own work in conjunction therewith. They are now hoping that another House will rectify something which the}' have overlooked here. All I have to say is that it will be far wiser for honourable members of this House to thoroughly finish their work before allowing it to go up to the Senate. It is preferable to fully consider any measure which is submitted for our consideration before transmitting it to another branch of tbe Legislature, than to stand up apologetically on its behalf and trust to another place to remedy its defects. I trust that Our future deliberations will be conducted with that end in view. Owing to ill-health I have not had the pleasure of being present during the passing of this Bill through committee, but in regard to the point which has been raised as to the employment of female labour, I unhesitatingly assert that the minimum wage must apply This is a alike to both male and female. I see no reason for a distinction being made, and I hope that the Minister will see that tlie case brought under his notice is thoroughly ventilated. If it is found that in the administration of a prospective law, the Postmaster-General or any of his officials has attempted to discharge any officer, I trust that those responsible will be dealt with i u the proper way. It will be a bad state of affairs if we discuss legislation here, and find our proposals anticipated by departmental officials before they become the law of the country.

I have listened to the various suggestions made by honourable members, and it seems to me that very important amendments have been proposed which some honourable members think should be considered in the other Chamber. I quite agree with tlie honourable member who has just spoken, that if we are properly to carry out legislation we should do our work thoroughly, and not be dependent upon the other Chamber at all. Let us finish our work here definitely, and then the other Chamber can make such amendments as it thinks are desirable. competent for an honourable member now to propose the recommittal of the Bill, but that course can easily be arranged with the concurrence of the Minister. All that the Minister has to do in order to enable an honourable member to move in that direction, is to withdraw his motion for the third reading of the Bill. Sir WILLIAM LYNE bate all over again. sirous of having the debate all over again, but three or four very important suggestions have been made affecting a large number of our public servants. Even if the discussion on those proposals does occupy two or three hours, it is only fair to give honourable members the opportunity of making desirable amendments for the protection of our public servants. Sir WILLIAM LYNE Minister is serious about is in trying to get the Bill through in an imperfect way. When the measure was first submitted to the notice of the Housei t was in a most imperfect state. The Opposition, recognising that it was not a party question, assisted to amend the Bill, so as to improve it as much as possible. All sections of tbe House endeavoured to perfect the Bill. AVe made many important amendments, and I think have improved the Bill to a very large extent. I believe that it is capable of still further improvement in the direction indicated by honourable members. If that is so, even if the remained for ten years longer and did not matter occupied more than ayeryfewminutes, pay is it not better to make the amendments before sending the Bill to the other Chamber1 Do not let us start the practice, which is too frequent in some of the State Parliaments, of sending away imperfect measures, and saying"" Oh, the other House will do the rest."" In view of the suggestions which have been made, I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole question, and to see whether it would not be better for him to withdraw his motion for the third reading, and thus allow honourable members an opportunity of recommitting any clauses h i which they think an alteration should be made to make the Bill more perfect than it is at the present time. possibly the Minister may be induced to agree to the suggestion which has just been made when I direct attention to a clause Possiblyi t is not which slipped through a few nights ago in committee. I do not know the reason which led to its insertion in the Bill. It was certainly not inserted after any argument, or after any explanation by the Minister. The clause I refer to is clause 58, which providesAll officers of a department transferred to the Commonwealth and all officers in the public, And have this derailway, or other service of a State so transferred, who by any law of a State had to contribute to a superannuation fund or to insure their lives, shall continue to be liable to pay the sum imposed by such law into the Treasury, and continue to keep up such insurance according to the provisions of such law. I would like the Minister to explain how he came to put a provision of that sort in the Bill, because if he is quite certain that section 84 of the Constitution Act -whic h is the provision relating to transferred officers preserving their existing and B e serious. .accruing rights implies that the public All that the servants have also the liability cast upon them of paying a portion of their salaries into a superannuation fund, then this clause is absolutely unnecessary. If .the Constitution imposes upon the public servants the obligation of keeping up their payments to a superanuation fund, then this clause is unnecessary. Under section 84 of the Constitution, a transferred officer is entitled to receive from the Commonwealth on his retirement the payment of a pension which he would have received bad he remained in the State service.

Whether the point of order is sustained or not, I think that, in view of the fact that honourable members are anxious to move very important amendments, the Minister should, in justice to those honourable members, do as other Ministers have done in the' State Parliaments in similar circumstances. would ask whether it is quite in order for honourable members who addressed themselves to the third reading of the Bill, after so addressing themselves, either to debar other honourable members from speaking or to give themselves an opportunity of making a second speech on the third reading. I must confess that the proceeding in this particular' case has not been strictly in accordance with tlie standing orders, and that the third reading of the B ill should not be taken immediately after the adoption of the report, unless standing orders were suspended to permit of that course. Still, I think it does not lie in the mouths of those honourable members who have taken advantage of the opening of the third reading debate to now object to its proceeding, and therefore, unless the House desires otherwise, I propose to permit the course that has been commenced to be carried out to its completion.

172,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"-It struck mehonorable members to harass the Minister, or to do anything else but assist him in perfecting the measure. ber helped me a lot. MrV . L . SOLOMON I am sure the Minister cannot complain of the assistance he has received from the members on both sides of the House. contentious Bill. It is not a party Bil l in any sense, and has not been treated as such, and the Minister has had the cordial assistance of members in all parts of the House. Considering that many members of tliis House were not aware of the particular standing order under which the third reading of the Bill was allowed to be moved, and having in view also the fact that the standing order itself, which provides when the recommittal may be moved, has been ignored, and it being admitted that a grave mistake has been madea mistake which materially reduces the privileges of members of this HouseI think that the Minister might concede the point that I have put before him. Sir many clauses, you will not have any more of the Bil l so far as I sm concerned. MrV . L . SOLOMON I am sure the Minister does not mean anything of that sort. Sir WILLIAM have been occupied three or four weeks over this B ill already, I do mean it. MrV . L . SOLOMON -This is a Bill which will have far-reaching consequences, because it will affect thousands of our civii servants, and if we spent another week or two over the Billi t would not matter. It would be very much better that we should do that than adopt tlie suggestion of some honourable members, who appear rather tired of the Bill, find anxious to get rid of it by sending it up to the Senate, leaving the members of that House to gather from our debates an idea as to the defects of the measure. I see no other course open to me than to move That the standing orders be suspended hi order to enable a motion for the recommittal of the Bill to be moved. take has been made. The ordinaiy understanding as to the application of a standing order of this description is, that where no amendments have been made in committee, a third reading may be taken at once, because there is no likelihood of objection being raised to that course, owing to the fact that no amendments have been made; but that where amendments have been made, time shall be allowed for the reconsideration of the measure before the third reading is taken. The construction which This is a nonhas been put upon the standing order by you, sir, is opposed to the practice of some of the State Legislatures at least. There -the motion that a Bil l be read a third time is just as susceptible of amendment as any other motion. I have no doubt that your interpretation of the standing order, Mr Speaker, is the correct one; but if the standing order is adopted permanently, honourable members will be in this difficulty, that they will not know when the proper time has arrived for moving an amendment, inasmuch as no motion will have been stated from the Choir. It is not in order for an honourable member to move an amendment, unless the motion which he proposes to amend has been stated from the Chair. But from the construction you put upon the standing should move an amendment upon a motion which has not been stated from the Chair. I understand you to rule that the words "" before motion made "" mean before jtjhe order of the day has been LYNE -Considerin g that I stated from the Chair. If that is so, a member must get up and move an amendment upon a motion which is not before the House. If , on the other hand, the words mean before the motion is finally put to the House, and after it has been stated from the Chair, the motion is susceptible of amendment-and that would appear a sensible view to take-and honourable members have a perfect right to move now the omission of all the words after the word "" be,"" with a view to providing for a recommittal. If the words "" before motion made "" are to be construed to mean before a motion is stated to the House, it seems to me that it will be necessary to alter the standing order so as to give honourable members a better opportunity for moving an amendment. member submit those remarks as a point of I am sorry that a misorder ?

Mr V. L. SOLOMON -That is exactly the position I want to point out to tbe Minister. I admit the question was debated and that we were informed something would be done to conserve the rights of these men; but I have searched through the Bill and I cannot find any provision in that direction. On this point I appeal to honourable members not to send this measure, which affects the best interests of civil servants who have been many years in the service of a State, to the Senate in an incomplete condition, without any provision whatever MrV . L . SOLOMON I cannot see any provision in the Bill conserving the rights of men who are provisional and temporary officers. I will stand corrected if the Minister can show me such a clause. So far as I can see, these men who have served fifteen or twenty years, and are virtually permanent officers, come over to the Commonwealth as provisional and temporary officers, liable to be dismissed at a week's or a month's notice. That is not fair to a large body of men, numbering several hundreds in the State of South Australia, whose position should be just as much recognised as that of the young ladies employed in the Telephone department, and as that of a great many other civil servants has been recognised and made secure by honourable members on the Government side of the House, and on the Opposition side, also. I do not blame honourable members for one instant for looking after the interest of every branch of the service. The promises which were given by the Minister in charge of the Bill, I understood to mean that before the measure was completed in committee, or before we came to the third reading, there would be some reasonable provision inserted to conserve the rights [169] of this large number of officers. The Minister's attention was called to their position frequently, not only by In members of the Opposition but by honourable members on the Government side of the House, among whom was the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor. He is a gentleman who has -occupied the position -of Ministerial head of a Post and Telegraph department transferred to the Commonwealth, and he admits that there are about 70 per cent, of the officers in the department over which he had control who have come over to the Commonwealth without one single line in this Bill to protect them in the future. To trust the Commonwealth is a very good thing to do; but I venture to think that the position of these officers was better as servants of the State of South Australia, where they were likely to obtain reasonable consideration of their just claims and rights, than it can possibly be under the Commonwealth, unless something is included in the Bill to meet their case. officers if temporary at the time of their being taken over? MrV . L . SOLOMON -That is precisely Attention was called to the fact that these officers had for many years served in South Australia under promises from various Governments that, seeing their terms of service were so long, they would, although classed as provisional and temporary, be recognised as permanent officers. The sole reason these men were kept as provisional and temporary officers was in order to prevent the demand year by year for certain increments, which were provided foipermanent officers from the lowest to the highest. But they were promised a Civil Service Bill, which is now being considered by a Royal commission in South Australia, and they were promised that their rights should be decided by that commission. We now find, however, that these men are passed over to the Commonwealth before the decision of the commission can be made known, or their proper classification can be arranged by tbe Government. I admit that seeing that federation had been looming for two or three years, undoubtedlygreat neglect was shown on the part of those who were at the head of the Government in South Australia, in not taking care that officers likely to be transferred were protected and their position",39,William Lyne I Understood

195,Sir William Lyne,That is not correct. the point I want to put to the Minister:,40,William Lyne I Understood
196,Mr Beid,"What rights have temporaryproperly defined. But would it be fair, simply because of that neglect, for representatives of that State, who take an interest in these hundreds of officers, not to ask the Minister to insert some clause in the Bill to put them in the same position as officers who have been transferred from other States', and who do the same character of work, but who happen to be classified as permanent officers? Surely there is nothing inequitable in such a request, which forms one of my reasons for moving that the Bill be recommitted. I am quite sure the Minister will admit that, during tlie general discussion, this point was placed before him on more than one occasion. if the honourable member-had been listening. MrV . L . SOLOMON -It was answered in such a way as to hold forth a promise that the matter would be dealt with before the Bill was completed. I ' said the point was covered by the Bill. MrV . L .

I feel sure, from the remarks of several honourable members, that this is not the only point, by a great many, in which this Bill requires alteration and amendment. Several honourable members have suggested that they would like to see amendments in clauses, and I ask them to vote with me to recommit this Bill, not with a view to going right through the measure or to harass the Minister at all, but simply with .a view to correcting any of those clauses which they think are faulty. I do this because I think that if we start on an important Bill like this by saying, that because its proper discussion will occupy a few more days, we should hurry it on to the Senate .and trust to that Chamber to make important alterations, we and one which has been prolific of much trouble i u the State Parliaments.

I hope, however, that the committee will allow me to draw attention to this clause, and to the different way in which justice is meted out, according to whether the person who complains is a member of the public or a Government officer.

So that, we see that as far as the person who brings an action against the Customs authorities is concerned, he must give notice before he proceeds, and a certain interval of time must elapse, because it is provided that no proceedings shall be instituted against any officer until one month after the notice in writing has been given. A man, therefore, cannot bring an action against a Customs officer for anything done, however bad it may prove to be, without giving notice in writing, and without an interval of a month elapsing after such notice, andthere are certain other requirements to be met. Then he is bound down within the four corners of the words written in the notice, and if by some slip in the wording of his notice-perhap s owing to his not having had the advantage of legal advicea man with the best action in the world would go down upon a technicality without the merits of his action being considered at all. When we come to the 236th clause, dealing with Customs proceedings against private citizens, we find an extraordinary state of things, as contrasted -with what is provided for in clause 211. If Customs officers and members of tlie general public I rise to a point of order. were treated alike I would not make these I admit that my honourable observations at a l l ; but we actually find I that it is proposed that the Customs department may go absolutely away from the substance or form of the original charge an:l that the person affected by the alteration is absolutely powerless to make any valid objection. The Customs department can go quite away from the substance and nature of the charge. If at the last moment they find that they cannot prove it, they can shift their ground, and make a substantial difference in tlie charge. It would be a most praiseworthy thing if the clause simply provided for the curing of technical defects, but it goes further, and allows a substantial change of front upon the part of the prosecuting authority. I have already called attention to the extraordinary line drawn against private citizens and in favour of public officials, but no one seems to mind what becomes of citizens so long as the officials are protected. Perhaps this is due to the climate, or it may be one of the incidents of the fiscal poUcy of the country; at any rate it runs rather strongly against the somewhat antiquated prejudices which people from other parts of the world hold with regard to what is fair in the administration of justice and the settlement of disputes between two parties engaged in business who may happen to differ. As a rule, if there is a policy tending in a certain direction both parties to proceedings get the advantage of it. But here, although a private citizen is tied down to his notice in writing, the prosecuting official can depart in substance from his information, and yet the court will be bound, however unjust they may consider the departure, to compel the person charged to meet the altered case, although they may allow him a certain interval in which to make his preparations for doing so. But let a private citizen break down on his written notice by a hair's' breadth, and the Judge will have no power to cure the defect. We tie the hands of justice in favour of one class of persons and against another class of persons. I admit that certain provisions are necessary in Customs Acts for the protection of the public interest, but in this B ill we are asked to go a little bit too far. A private citizen must give a month's notice in writing before he can proceed to action, and if he alters his notice he must allow another month to elapse, while if",43,Customs Bill

One can find provisions for the protection of officers in all Acts relating to departments which are given considerable powers.

Clause 23SNo witness on behalf of the Minister or collector in any Customs prosecutions shall be compelled to disclose the fact that he received or gave any information or the nature thereof or the name of the person who gave such information, and no officer appearing as a witness shall be compelled to produce any reports made or received by him confidentially in his official capacity, or containing the Minister mean to say that on the wordconfidential information. tantamount to absolutely prohibiting any cross-examination of witnessess? I think that the Minister might consider the matter. I suggest that after the word ""information,"" line 4, we should insert the words ""to an officer in his official capacity."" The clause recognises that information has to be given by a good many side channels, and sometimes it is very necessary that it-should reach the Crown. sometimes to force a witness to disclose tlie source of bis information, as otherwise that channel would be closed in the future. As the clause now stands the main branch of cross-examination will be stopped. to point out, very much as the honourable and learned member for Corio did, that surely in any investigation beforethe court the person who is giving evidence as an informer should be open to cross-examination. All our rules seem to be going by the board now. The right to cross-examine a man who appears as a witness against an accused has been conceded until now. But what is the most vital point upon which a man can be cross-examined ? Isi t not his personal interest in the matter in dispute ? Surely the man who is an informer, and who expects to get a third of the penalty if the accused is convicted, ought to be open to cross-examination ? According to this provision, however, he could not be cross examined either by the accused or by his counsel. He could not be asked as to whether he is notpractically the principal in the prosecution, the person who set the law in motion, and who is to receive a substantial pecuniary reward if the accused is convicted. I put it to my right honourable friend The right honorable and learned member misunderstood it . clause statesNo witness on behalf of the Minister or Collector in any Customs prosecution shall be compelled to disclose the fact that he received or gave any information or the nature thereof, or the name of the person who gave such information, &c. The words I am speaking of are, "" No witness shall be compelled to disclose the fact that he gave any information."" Does ing of that clause, the informer being in the witness-box, he could be asked "" D i d you give any information in reference to this proceeding."" ? W ill my right honourable friend seriously contend that he could be asked that question under these words ? and learned member is laying stress on the word ""gave."" wrong, I am willing to surrender my view, It is' not desirable but it seems to me that an informer would exactly come under these words as the person who gave the information. Surely the personwho gave the information would be the informer. He would be the person who led to the proceedings by giving the information, and would be entitled, if the prosecution -were successful, to one-third of the penalty imposed. We know that in all courts of justice these are matters which the ""courts ought to have before them. Surely the court ought to be in a .position to know these facts. An HONOKABEE MEMBEB -Would this clause stop the ordinary admission of a witness ? an admission, why should the informer be put in such a position that he can go behind this clause and refuse to give any information? If he refuses to give information and the question whether he is really not the principal in the prosecution cannot be asked for the purpose of the in quiry, he will be regarded by the Judge not as an informer at all, because there is no evidence that he is an informer, and the adjudicating authority must be guided only by the evidence.

I do not bhink so. The bulk of these cases I know will come before courts of pebby sessions, where there is no j u r y ; and we know that a prejudice is often found to exist in regard to informers. When the decision comes from the Bench there may not be the same delicacy indealing with such mattersthat exists in other circumstances. I must say that I feel some responsibility in endeavouring bo alber bhe clause ME. McCAY (Corinella) I wish bo ask if bhe clause as ib sbands would nob cover a case Of this kind : Supposing bhab a Customs witness in the box had given evidence that A had committed a certain offence, and he were asked in cross-examination, "" D i d you tell X thab A did nob commit bhe offence""? He musb decline to say whether he gave the information , or what was the nature of the 1 information. What would be done in a case of that kind? In-addition to that I would ask the Minister whether it is not a proper thing in Customs prosecutions, that all parties, should know that a man is an informer, if he is one Those who have heard evidence given by informers in Courts of summary-jurisdiction, have sometimes known such evidence to be discredited, and the fact that the man is an informer mav, in -some cases, very properly cause doubt as to the value of his evidence. Morever, this is a doubt that bhe Court should have cognizance of. I take it that tlie Minister wishes to protect bhe Customs officers against the necessity of disclosing the names of the public-spiribed citizens who may have given information about cerbain offences against tlie law. was referring bo another question. If they kept informers out of the box there would be no harm in refusing to give information about them. harm; but I think the words ""or gave"" cover a good deal more ground than the Minister intends to cover, and it is a question whether, in view of the clause being capable of such a wide interpretation, tlie advantages that the ""Minister expects the department to derive would not be outI s it fair that the adjudiweighed by the possible disadvantages that might be experienced. in the administration of justice. an employee who may have given informaShould an adjudicating tion as to what his employer is doing ? things it is intended to operate in that way. No doubt the criticisms that have been directed to a part of the clause are fair enough, but the position is this : In customs prosecutions and in other classes of cases, however reluctant we may be, we have bo avail ourselves of the assistance of informers, and their names should not be unnecessarily disclosed. I think that is a principle thab is recognised everywhere. On bhe other hand, a man should not be permitted bo sbep inbo bhe box and pose as an independent witness when be is to all intents and purposes an informer, and very possibly interested in theresult of thecase. Mi-. KINGSTON -The question is whether the clause goes too far. As to the principle, it has been laid down by various high' authorities that a witness cannot be asked, and will not be allowed to produce documents when such production may be prejudicial to blie public inberesbs, and it is desirable.to put this provision within the four corners of an Act.

The amendment 1 suggested is, I think, preferable. MrO ' MALL EY (Tasmania) I am very glad that the Minister has agreed to the amendment, because as the clause stood it seemed to me that it was only legalizing blackmail. It is the duty of the Government to make it as easy as possible to do right and as hard as possible to do wrong, but this clause as it stood first would have made it easy to do wrong. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Progress reported. Sir WILLIAM LYNE That the Bill be now read a seeond time. T feel that the task before me is rather a section of the public take fright at someheavy one, especially in the presence of so thing to which they are unaccustomed. many of iny legal friends, who know more about the laws on which the Inter-State Commission Bill is based than I do. I intend, however, to speak, not from a lawyer's stand-point, but from the stand-point of common sense. I do not mean by that to Say that most lawyers' have not common sense. In view of the reports and articles, especially the leading articles, which have appeared in tbe daily press during the last week or two, since this Inter-State Commission Bill was placed before the public, one might feel disposed to reply .in a great measure' to the criticisms which have been passed, and, to some extent, to omit reference to other parts of the Bill, which, to my non-legal mind, are just as important as are those which have been referred to in the press. In connection with this matter I am struck When, however, it is not a by the unanimity of the press throughout the States. I would not for a moment suppose or wish to insinuate that there has been any common communication from any one centre to bring about this extraordinary consensus of opinion. I think tlie Minister should able gentleman sees that they have common sense. the honourable member means ? would not be PVGS3. Sir WILLTAMLYNE I think the shipowners have a lot of common sense especially when they fancy they are menaced in any way. That, however, is by the way. I am afraid I shall have to ask the House tonight to bear with me at any rate during a part of my speech, which I am afraid will be a little wearisome because I intend first of all to refer to several clauses in the B ill and also to the Acts from which they are taken. I do not mean honourable members to infer from that that all the clauses in the Bil l are taken from these various Acts because there are one or two very important ones that do not appear at all, either in the English or in the American Acts. I wish to point out, in connection with this measure, that we are instituting in Australia something that we are quite unaccustomed to, something that we have never had an opportunity-althoug h the necessity has existed-of creating before, I m o v e in the shape of an Inter-State Commission; and I am not at all surprised to find that a",50,Customs Bill

314,Sir Malcolm Mceaciiarn,"No, theT.fc is well known, I suppose, by a large number of honourable members that this is, no new thing, and those who took part in the Convention know that the provision for this Inter-State Commission was practically forced upon the Convention. The Convention was compelled to take the action it did in passing tbe provisional clauses in connection with this commission. tbe railways were concerned. as shipping is concerned. I shall show, I think, before I resume my seat that it was clearly contemplated by the Convention that the control of the commission should extend to ocean carriage as well as to the railways. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -To the back door, as well as the front. I am very glad to bear the honourable member for South Sydney refer to that, because it was not the State of New South Wales that was anxious for the establishment of the Inter-State Commission, but rather the other States; and New South Wales had to bow, and did bow, to the wishes of the other States represented in the Convention. As I said, I shall commence by referring to a few of the clauses which are most important. Having been present at a gathering-a t a very influential gathering-of ship-owners and others in SydneyI had an opportunity of hearing many of the objections -raised against the various clauses in this Bill. These objections extended to the Inter-State Commission having any power to investigate or to control any rates connected with shipping either coastal or external. sions refer to private enterprise the representations were limited to that. Majesty's ships of war there are no publiclyowned ships here at the present time. New South Wales does not own any nor does Victoria, and, therefore, this must apply absolutely to privately-owned ships. The first portion of the B ill deals with the interpretation of various terms used in it . Great exception was taken to the interpretation of the words "" common carrier."" The definition given in the Bill is that""Common carrier"" includes the Railway Commission or Commissioners, and the persons or authorities controlling the railways, ferries, or other carrying agencies of the Commonwealth or of any State. To my non-legal mind it appeared at first that this did not possibly apply to shipping, but I have since obtained a definition of the words "" common carrier,"" which shows that this provision in the Bill is only an addition to the common law interpretation of tbe term, and that ""common carrier"" meansEvery person who plies with a carriage by land, or a boat or vessel by water, between different places, and professes openly to carry passengers and goods for hire. . MrV . L . SOLOMON -I s there any interpretation of the term in tlie Interpretation Bill which we passed recently ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not follow that measure closely. I left it to my legal friends. This, however, is an interpretation that I have obtained in -addition to the interpretation of the term which is contained in the Bill. Great exception was also taken to the next expression "" external and Inter-State commerce."" I desire to point out to honourable members that that expression is taken from a United States Act The provisions of this ActI am quoting from the United StatesA c t to Regulate Commerceshall apply to any common carrier or carriers engaged in the transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad or partly by railroad and partly by waterto the through rate. they carry portly by rail and partly by water.

321,Mr Bruce Smith,"In the United StatesThat is the clause as it appears in the United States Act. As-.my honourable friend says, I know that it applies to carriage by rail and carriage by vessels over lakes' and rivers. I think it also extends to coastal carriage in connection witb the railways, but it does not extend generally to the coastal shipping. I wish to direct attention to the fact that in two reports issued by tbe Inter-State Commission of the United States they have pointed out that the very absence of the particular provision in regard to shipping that we have included in this Bill has caused great trouble there, and they are fighting hard to get it adopted. I have no doubt that the shippers are trying just as haud to prevent it . The Inter-State Commission state, at page 70 of their report for 1889, as published in Vol. I . of ""Miscellaneous Documents of the House of Representatives"" for 1889-90, thatWhen the Congress was given power to regulate commerce among the States, railroads had no existence. To whatever extent the regulation so provided for was intended to include transportation or transportation charges, it must have had special reference to the then existing transport methods, which were mainly by lake, .river, or coastwise carriers. The regulation for which provision is made in the Act to regulate commerce does not apply to commerce as it was conducted when the power to regulate was conferred. The Act applies to water transportation only when '' used under a common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment,"" in connection with a railroad, and as part of a line or route of which another part is a railroad, and leaves carriers engaged in transportation wholly by water independent of regulation. The exemption of so considerable a part of transportation from the operations of the law is a serious hindrance to the-regulation of that which the Act includes. . . . These are some of the effects of unregulated water transportation. Its usefulness must not be in the least impaired, but it is both expedient and just that it should be so far regulated as to pi-event its demoralization of other transportation. This requires carriers by lake, river, and coastwise to publish and maintain tariffs as do carriers by rail, and be alike subject to the general provisions of the Act. Only one of the five great lakes on our northern border is wholly ""within our territorial limits, but could quote, but I will not refer to them upon all the fluctuations of unregulated rates and charges are so frequent as to create confusion aud uncertainty in charges on railroad traffic. Then the report goes on to point out that on these lakes there are 200,000,000 of shipping. season, so that honourable members will see that these lakes are really inland oceans, and the carriage over them is immense. Sir William Lyne, passage which .the honourable gentleman has quoted appear in the report for 1889 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE In the report for 1889. I only give these-short extracts in order to show that although not included in the United States law as it stands now, there is a very great effort being made to get this provision imported into it , and strong reasons are given for its adoption. I intend to quotenow from the report for 1893, where a similar reference is ;made. see the distinction 1 They point out that the absence-of control over outside shipping prevents them from carrying out the objects of the Act which are included in the Act. Sir WILLIAM LYNE And that it demoralizes their action in connection with the railways. traordinary that this has been jgoing on since 1889 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE If the.honourable member will allow me to proceed we shalLget on much better. The report sets .forthCongress did not see fit to include carriers operating upon the lakes within the provisions of the Act to regulate commerce, except so far as the}' may engage in connection with railways in the transportation of Inter-State traffic ""under a common control, management, orarrangement for a continuous carriageor shipment"" over a route "" partly by railroad aud partly by water."" The partial, regulation thus imposed has not failed to result in considerable uncertainty and confusion, and obviously offers opportunities for evasions and subterfuges, contrary to the spirit and intent of the statute. The attention of Congress was called to this fact by tbe commission in its Third Annual Report, page 7, as follows :"" The exemption of so considerable a part of transportation from the operations of the law is a serious-hindrance to the regulation of that which the Act includes."" These statements appear at page 59 of the commission's report, as published in Volume II . of "" Miscellaneous Documents of the Senate"" for the year 1893-4. There are many other passages which I further. I have simply read these extracts in order to show that there has been a strong desire expressed that this provision should be included in the United States tons Act, and reasons are given why shipping That was the capacity for the should be included within the definition of a common carrier.

327,Mr Bruce Smith,"The Minister losesto give us the greatest information. That is the reason we have gone so often to tlie United States in connection with this matter. In the United States they have, I think, five commissioners, and so far as I can gather these commissioners are paid £1,500 a year. We propose three commissioners, one of 'whom, as our Constitution Act provides, must belong to the legal fraternity. That is quite right so long as the legal member does not overshadow the other two. My impression of a good InterState Commission, especially if shipping comes in, is that it should be composed of the best men that can be obtained, and that we require a legal man, a business man, and a railway man. lawyers than the Constitution Act, because there is nothing in the Constitution Act providing that a lawyer must be a member of the Inter-State Commission. Sir WILLIAM LYNE that is the provision in the B ill ; but we think a great deal of the lawyers-ther e are so manj of them in the Cabinet. When we T come to clause 7, which provides for the salary of the commissioners, I shall propose to give a higher salary, at any rate to the chairman, than £1,500 a year. Mr O'MALLEY -That is high enough. Sir WILLIAM LYNE 30. years; but at the expiration of that time an alteration can be made, and other officials appointed, or if the railways are given over to the Commonwealth; and it is thought desirable, we can get rid of the Inter-State Commission ; but in the meanime we want t e very best men that can be obtained. Tbe most important clauses, and those to which I shall mainly refer, are in Part3 and Part5 of the Bill. 3 deals with the regulation of commerce, and to clause 15, which deals with rates and preferences, great objection was taken by the deputation to which I have referred. The clause readsAll rates fixed or made by any common carrier(a) For any service rendered in respect of external or Inter-State commerce; or (/)) For the receiving, delivering, storage, or handling of goods in connection with external or Inter-State commerce; or (c) which affect external or Inter-State commerce, shall be reasonable and just, and every such rate which is unreasonable or unjust is hereby prohibited. That clause is taken from the United States Act. railways and shipping connected with railways. The United States law, as I say, was the inspiration for that clause, and though it does not apply to coastal shipping, I will show, I think, before I resume my seat, that the provision is seriously necessary, seeing that, as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said, each of our States has a coastal line, and the coastal shipping is very much in the same position as railways, though not under Government control. Clauses 16 and 17 deals with undue preferences upon State railways and rates necessary for development, and the words are merely in accordance with the Constitution Act. I shall not attempt to interpret what these clauses mean. I think there was some A t any rate, doubt in the Convention as to what they meant, and they will have to be interpreted, I have not the slightest doubt, by the High Court before very long. Another clause objected to was clause 18, which deals with equality of charges under similar circumstances. That clause is taken from the S and 9 Vict., chapter 20, section 90, and also from the United States Act. I do not think I shall not read the provisions of those This is an appointment for seven Acts; but the wording of tlie clause is almost the same. Then we come to clause 19, which provides that undue preference is not to 13e given. Great exception was taken to this clause. I do not say it is true, but I have often been told, and I believe it is true, that extreme preferential rates are given in connection with shipping companies, and that the discount in some cases amounts to a very' large percentage of Part the whole freight. untrue. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I told some of the shippers whom I met that if they would confidentially give me any information on that ScoreI should be much obliged. I know what is stated; but, of course, I cannot know whether it is true. know that in England 95 per cent, discount is given on files 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE If that were given to every one alike, there would be no complaint; but when it is given to one and not to another, then it should be stopped.",54,Inter State Commission Bill Second Reading

A -woakneis was found' iri theea'rly days, both in the United States and Gireat Britain, in cases* where the.goods -were carried by two persons, in. compelling the order of the commission to have effect on both when it' had. reference to the same goods. This clause is'intended to confer a power similar to that given iri the English Act. Clause 41 relates ' tb'appeal's. An appeal can bo-made to the .High, Court only upon a point of law, not upon a question of fact. The next clause provides that the commissioner may state a caseunder certain cririditions, if t h a t eourse.beiiecessary. These two clauses are taken' from 36 and 37 and 52 and 53 'Victoria. The clause of all' that has created .such a.buzz is, clause 44. There is no doubt it in a very drastic provision, but I think it is one which will have to be passed if the Act is going to be of any effect. It is taken from the United States Act. It refers to ifche annual reports by carriers. No-doubt it is an in -' quisito'rial clause, but if tihe. commiesioneiis had not the power to' compel .information; on some oondition. su*sh as that, the measurecould be evaded, and their work would be almost absolutely nullified.

The clause providesTlie commission shall once in every year make a report to the Minister; which shall be laid before both Housesiof the Parliament within 30 days after, the mailing thereof, if the Parliament be then, sitting, and if not, then, within 30 days.after the next meeting of tbePanliainent.

I take it that these reports from tlie commission will be very mucli. on the lines of the United.

349,Sir William Lyne,"The honourable and he is -referring to what the commission .remarks. Then the honourable member for Bendigo saysI understood that the qualifying and limiting words with regard to railways and rivers were to be eliminated. I do not know what could be stronger or more emphatic. to rivers and railways. those quotations which refers to ocean-going steamers. Sir WILLIAM LYNE able and learned member's pardon. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo referred to ocean navigation, and there is no doubt that right through the piece thewholefoundation of the discussion was that the Inter-State Commission should have ful l control over everything relating to trade and commerce. as to that having been the intention of the Convention ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE that I have had communications from a number of people. I have been told by those interested in shipping, and it has been stated in the pressI did not trouble to bring the quotations from articles which have been published in the papers not only in Victoria and New South Wales, but in South Australia -that it was never intended that the powers of the commission should apply to ocean navigation and shipping. That is why I am taking the trouble to show a justification for framing the Bill in tlie way that it has been framed. If my honorablecolleaguethe Attorney-General, who I am sorry to say is absent through sickness this evening, and myself had left this provision out of the Bill,'we should have been at once liable to be charged with not carrying out or perhaps with directly opposing-the intention which is so strongly marked in the Con vention debates in connection with the Inter-State Commision. tlie railways, simply because they were the most difficult to deal with. and learned member for Bendigo movedThat the words ""upon railways"" be struck out. That was agreed to. He then movedThat the words ""and upon rivers flowing through, in, or between two or more States,"" be struck out. This was also agreed to. Then the -right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, who was fighting against this at the time, and was objecting to what had been done, said in a most concerned manner Now we discover that this tribunal has to deal with every possible matter relating to trade and . commerce. The honourable member was objecting to the proposed powers that were to be given to the Commission, and fighting against them, but I quote what he said to show what his impression was. After the debate was over, the clause was brought up in the form in which it now appears in tlie Constitution, I beg the honorand it is entirely different from the clause I read, upon which that debate was based. It seems to me, therefore, that there can be no two opinions as to the intention of the Convention. After the foundation of the Commission had been laid in South Australia, mainly upon the reports of. the Commissioners of Railways, and the statements made in the connection with the rivers, the matter was allowed to remain in abeyance until after the meeting of the All I can say is Convention in Sydney. Subsequently, at the Melbourne Convention, as I have shownby the speeches I have quoted from, it was clearly intended that the control of the Inter-State Commission should apply to trade and commerce generally, and I think I can claim for the Government that in proposing that shipping be included within the provisions of this Act we have onlydone what the Commonwealth Act has directed us to do ; nothing more. Probably there are those who object to it, but we were* compelled to make the submission to Parliament upon this matter as complete as it could be, and whatever alteration may takeplace, I do not think the House, or the country, or even the shipping community canblame tlie Government for the course they have taken. If the shipping community were asleep at the time, and they are not often to be caught napping, that is their misfortune, and they must not blame the Government for submitting the question in its most complete form, when we have received an absolute direction to submit it for the consideration of Parliament. 1 would like now to say a few words in reference to the necessity for an Inter-State Commission at asearly a date as possible, if we are to prevent the state of things which has existed on our railways for so many years, and is existing at the present time. I hold here a statement which I believe is absolutely true, that preferential rates exist on the railways of Victoria and New South Wales at the",59,Inter State Commission Bill Second Reading

I have said so many times. the committee will the.Minister say whether, if goods can be carried profitably and cheaper by water down the .Murray, for instance, than by rail, .he is going to force goods to come by rail at the.higher rate 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE There are many things which will.have to be decided by the High Court. I have not the slightest doubt that if we adopt the true principle of preventing Inter-State advantage, we must apply it to river steamers in the same way as to railways. What is the use of preventing railways from drawing trade from one State to another unduly, if we allow river and coastal shipping to do it . calamity to'have a railway to a place. Sir WILLIAM LYNE think -that will be so; but I . am showing, I think conclusively, that this must have been in the minds of the Convention during the debates from which I have quoted to-night: The Convention saw that we must deal with shipping as well as with rivers, if we were to make the whole thing complete. If we are not going to make the whole thing complete, it is quite a different matter. I might go f urther, and say that it would be possible for a State to subsidize a steam-ship company. Take, for instance, a large ocean steam-ship company, and a desire on the part of a State to make a special effort in favour of a particular port. What is to prevent the State from subsidizing that company, thougbitisanocean-going company? time enough to deal with that by-and-by 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE to say that it is time enough to deal with will come under the Bill when there is this matter when occasion arises, there may through carriage by both rail and shipping ? be something in that contention. 50 years without it being done. strike at .the natural advantages a State may now possess. Sir WILLIAM LYNE If we do as is done in the United States of America, we shall have to do that, and so we shall, if we are going to do as they do . in Great Britain so far as harbors are concerned. As I have already shown, no railway in Great Britain has a right to give a preference to I do .not say one harbour over another, .and no shipping connected with railways has a right to give preference in freights to one person over another. Although honourable members may the information of not agree with rae, they must allow me to show the weak points which will remain if shipping be left out of the Bill. That is all I want to do, and that being so I have done my duty up to the present stage. I do not think I shall detain the committee I can say. longer. I have, .as shortly as I could, explained the Bill, and shown what may be, or will be effected under its provisions. The Bill is as complete as the Government can make it at present. If it is not thought wise to go to the extent proposed by the measure, that will not injure the Bill, nor will there be any reflection on the Government. I will say that the Government are fully determined, to go .so far, at any rate, Theni t may prove a that they will deal with shipping in connection with railway freights and in conI scarcely nexion with rivers, if they do not deal with ocean shipping. change bis mind before the B ill is through.

I object altogether to the principle of Customs officers' being allowed to participate in tlie proceeds of fines and seizures. When the -Minister wasaddvessing the House on the second reading, I called bis attention by interjection to this-very clause; and my reason for doing so was that during a lengthy business experience in Port Darwin, in the course of which I had a very close connection with Custom house work, I found' that tbe system of permitting Custom house officers to participate infines and penalties, led to a very great'evil. My experience was that it induced the' Custom-bouse officers to be overcritical in many instances, and to convert offences' of the most trivial importance into oases which would permitthem to make seizures,' and participatp in the penalties. I remember one instance which will show how very badly this system works. A large number of' Chinese passengers, some 200, I think, landed at Port Darwin by steamer from Hong Kong. Amongst those Chinese were several who had small quantities of opium and tobacco about them-ver y small"" quantities indeed, something under' a pound of opium, or perhaps a half-pound tin, each. A t any rate the Customs officials, who were very keen in. scenting out offences, and in making seizures, arrested some ten or twelve of these Chinese passengers, and although there was little or no evidence of The informer is to scent amy combination or collusion amongst them, the prosecution was so framed as to charge these men with being , concerned in a'n attempt to smuggle the total quantity of opitim and tobacco represented by the twelve separate quantities which they had in their possession. ber interested in'the case'? .

A t one camp that I was in seven or eight persons were fined from £ 2 0 to £ 5 0 each on the information of two informers, who were never out of a public-house.
