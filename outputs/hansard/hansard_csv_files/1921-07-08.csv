This is not playing the game.

House if I get an opportunity. hear the reasons that actuated the honourable .member in moving to have these particular items included in the motion for recommittal. I find that item II 6 refers to parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas, while item 300 refers to woodware for vehicles. But how can we give an intelligent vote on this or any other amendment unless we are permited to debate it? If we are to be called upon to vote without any debate whatever, we shall be voting in the dark. weeks in discussing the Tariff. large number of items included in the schedule, the discussion has been very short, and the Minister( Mr Greene) should not be impatient of a little further discussion in order to clear up in this Chamber what he may not be able to clear up in the Senate. We have no guarantee that the items covered by the amendment, if not recommitted here, will receive any consideration in another place. We have no undertaking from the Minister that he will ask his representative there to take up any particular attitude in regard to them. If , in respect of each amendment, he would state what attitude his representative in the Senate is likely to take up, it might'lead to a speedier decision of the question here. I do not desire to delay the House, but I hope we shall deal with each amendment on its merits.

I have taken a very keen interest in the debates on the Tariff, and, save in respect of anomalies that have occurred, and which, as the Minister has said, should be rectified here, I am quite content. I took strong exception to the proposed re-opening of the-piano duties when they had been settled after a long discussion in Committee, feeling that if they Were to be reconsidered I would be justified in asking for the reconsideration of other duties of importance to those whom I represent. If members are going to propose item after item for reconsideration, merely because they were dissatisfied with the decisions of the Committee on those items, we* shall find ourselves committed to the reconsideration of the entire schedule. I ask the Minister not to permit that. What is in the mind .of the honourable member for Henty in asking for these recommittals ? that, if I could show that my figures were correct, he. would give me a higher duty. member should be permitted to give reasons for asking for the recommittal of the items. The recommittal of about twenty items has been proposed, and they should be disposed of in Committee of Ways and Means in a couple of hours. The Minister and his officials cannot know the effect of every duty, and members who have other information should be permitted to bring it before the Committee, so that anomalies may be rectified. So far as parasols are concerned, I object to an increase of the duty; but the schedule should not be sent to another place until we have made it as perfect as possible. If a member is not allowed to give reasons for moving for the recommittal of an item, the parliamentary institution becomes a farce. No member can vote honestly on a proposal for recommittal without knowing why it was moved. a statement? not know what reasons actuated the honourable member for Henty in moving for the recommittal of certain items, though they may be supposed to be obvious. It seems to be thought unnecessary for a member to be informed on these questions.

"" As you know, their new season's prunes come in August-September. Well, in 1920, their opening prices, which are maintained for the full season in America, were, for prunes going 80-90 to the 1 lb., 8d. c.i.f. Sydney, and to-day their price for same grade prune is 4d. c.i.f. "" Although they will maintain their opening price throughout the year for their, home market, they reduce their price by 50 per cent, for the Australian market. "" To verify my figures, apply to Brown and Dureau for c.i.f. price prunes 80-90 for August last and c.i.f. prices for same prunes to-day. ""The fact of the price dropping to such an extent, and it being well known amongst merchants that California is likely to have a big carry-over, makes it hard to sell Australian prunes at anything like a fair price, because merchants expect America to force sales by further reduction as their new season approaches, so as not to have any carry-over'. ""New South Wales growers are very much concerned, and feel that' if they are not properly protected they will not be able to stand the competition. "" They are not financially .strong, and are not able to hold their fruit until after tbe American price cutting is over, therefore have to realize just when the competition is keenest with Americans forcing sales. "" The Coastal Farmers Co-operative Company, who sell most of the New South Wales produced prunes, we believe, are very much concerned about this matter, and are, I believe, approaching the Minister for Trade and Customs. If the duty is raised to 6d. per lb., growers would guarantee not to' take full advantage of duty and, would 'sell below the American landed prices. "" The Australian production 'has,we believe, just about overtaken the demand.' "" We carried over from last season 20 tons prunes, and all merchants carried over stocks from last year, the shortage of sugar having restricted the sale of dried fruits last winter.

For this reason I move That the item be further amended by adding the following words to sub-item (E) (general Tariff) :"" And on and after Oth July, 1921, 20 per cent."" Amendment agreed to.

As this does occur, I move That the item be further amended by adding to sub-item (E) 1, the following words:""And on and after Oth July, 1921, Wire of No. 16 or finer gauge, ad val., Britisli, 25 per cent.; intermediate, 30 'per cent.; general, 35 per cent."" thank the Ministerf o r having proposed this alteration. When the item was originally amended, honourable members could not know what the effect of the amendment would be, but the new rates had hardly been put into force before it was found that a good deal of 14-gauge wire is used for fencing, and that the duty levied on it amounted to no less than £18 per ton. I ask the Ministeri f he w ill agree to lower rates than 25 per cent, and 35 per cent; on wire of finer gauge, which is used by the farmer for the trussing of straw and for many other purposes, and by makers of cages and other manufacturers. Wir e imported for the manufacture of barbed wire and netting is exempt, but many other manufacturers import wire as their raw material, and, probably, as the rates stand, the duty on the finer gauges runs to £20 or £25 per ton. I have, here an article written by Mr. I propose Brownlie, one of the big Labour leaders of Great Britain, who made an inquiry into the economic and labour conditions of America. It is dated 21st May last, and contains the statement that the average wage of the steel worker in the. United States of America is 3s. l d . per hour, while that of the British worker is about Is. 8d. per hour. I do not think that our workers are better paid, on the average, than those of England. Surely! therefore, our manufacturers do not need a protective duty of 35 per cent, in addition to the natural protection which they enjoy by reason of the heavy freight charges on transport of wire from abroad. I do not like the ad valorem rates, but the Minister has pointed out that the length of wire contained in a ton increases with the fineness of the gauge, and that, therefore, specific rates would be unfair. While file American firms have wonderf u l plants, I think that with the up-to-date plants such as the BrokenH ill Company and subsidiary companies use duties as high as those proposed are unnecessary.

Clause9 provides for the application of the British preferential Tariff, wholly or in part, to any part of the British Dominions, and for the application of the intermediate Tariff, wholly or in part, to any part of the British Dominions or to any foreign country. Negotiations may be undertaken and arrangements entered into tentatively for the' application of the British .preferential' or the intermediate Tariff rates either legislation which honourable members have in* whole or in part to any part of the British Empire, and in regard to foreign countries power is given to negotiate on the basis of the intermediate and general rates. In regard to foreign countries, British preferential rates cannot be conceded; the negotiations must be on the basis of the intermediate Tariff or the general Tariff. The Bill further provides that after the Minister has negotiated with a British Dominion or a foreign country, as the case may be, and before he brings the proposal to Parliament for ratification he must obtain a report from the Tariff Board. ""We are endeavouring to insure that. Parliament shall have at its disposal a complete re1 port by an independent body on the proposals which the Minister is submitting. Presumably the Minister will bring up with his proposal to Parliament the report of the Tariff Board. We do not lay a definite obligation upon him to do so, but Parliament can ask for the report, and no doubt will obtain it . it mandatory for the Minister to produce the report to Parliament? necessity to go as far as that. We make it mandatory upon the Minister to get the report, and no doubt Parliament will take all sorts of care that it has an opportunity of studying it. The only other provision of any moment is that which provides for the application of deferred duties. It will be noticed that if the Minister gets from the Tariff Board a certificate that goods are not being manufactured in this country in sufficient from time to time the operation of the deferred duties. I have repeatedly traversed this ground in the course of. the debate on the Tariff, and I think members are generally familiar with the provisions of the Bill. Does the Minister propose to pass this Bill this afternoon? If so; why? Unless there is a special reason for theimmediate passage of the measure I think it might well be arranged to consider it simultaneously with the Bills relating to the Tariff Board and dumping. Moreover, I have a great objection to passing not had an opportunity of perusing, let alone understanding. This Bill refers extensively to the Tariff Board, but the House may not agree to the appointment of that body. want to get the Bill passed this afternoon is that until it is passed the schedule cannot be sent to another place. batable matter in this Bill which cannot be debated on the measures which are to be considered later. decides not to create, a Tariff Board?
