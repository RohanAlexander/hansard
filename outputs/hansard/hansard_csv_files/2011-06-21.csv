But providers are implement options stemming from the supposed to then be left to manage how they review. I fear the same for universities when deliver these themselves.

But, system is also designed to monitor progress despite the coalition's concerns about the towards the 20 per cent low socioeconomic transition to a demand driven funding status participation rate and the 40 per cent system, we broadly support the measures attainment target and to reward providers as contained within this bill. progress is made. There are, however, a number of measures But the coalition finds it hard to trust that contained within the bill that we do have these deals will actually be realised. Labor is concerns about. The first of these is in addicted to red tape and there is a real risk relation to the mission based compacts that these compacts will unnecessarily burden higher education providers. We do for providers to deal with the regulations not have to look far to realise that, under the they have created. Gillard government, this risk is very real. Our commitment to reducing the cost Just look at small business. After more than regulation by a quantifiable $1 billion per three years of Labor, small business is annum follows a successful adoption of drowning even further in red tape. Labor annual dollar based red tape reduction targets promised to make life easier for business by set by the Victorian government. Victoria's pursuing a one in, one out rule for new approach to regulatory reform is highly regulation. No new law was supposed to be regarded by business. The coalition introduced unless an existing one was taken recognises the proven success of Victoria's off the books but, instead, Labor has deregulation policy and will adapt and refine imposed 220 new regulations for each one it. Commonwealth departments will be they have removed. So the one in, one out required to tell us how many hours small rule became the 220-for-one rule under the business will spend on filling in government current government. If Labor imposes paperwork and how much it will cost. This excessive reporting and regulatory will include things like new software, advice arrangements on our higher education from accountants, and training and time providers, it means more time, money and spent away from work to learn any new effort that they have to divert from real work requirements. Departments and bureaucrats to filling in forms for bureaucrats in will also have to explain how many Canberra and less to spend on students. businesses will be impacted by regulatory Excess red tape and regulation benefits nochanges and how much they will have to do one. It means more cost for business; it to comply.

We will also Australians. make sure that departments and bureaucrats A coalition government would have a explore other alternatives before imposing whole-of-government approach to reducing regulations, and we will require ministers to the cost and burden of regulation by cutting pursue the least-worse regulatory option for the overall cost of existing regulations by at all policies and programs.

The coalition does not oppose the with industry and asking them about the real introduction of compacts or agreements in need for regulations and stopping theory, but we find it hard to believe that unnecessary red tape from being introduced Labor will deliver them reasonably. It is in the first place. We will also make interesting to note that any closure of courses bureaucrats calculate how much it will cost or shifts in load between campuses will need departmental approval. Higher education providers are also going to be required to have compacts that are both achievable and meet a range of other specifications that worthwhile in meeting the Bradley include social equity and research to support objectives.

It is in the base funding rate, and I think that having a review of the recommendation, and needs to be seriously looked at. we will certainly be keeping a close eye on Let me just touch on the other measures that. Again, we know that universities are the bill introduces-firstly, the mission already struggling with lack of resources to based compacts on universities. Again, we provide for the students they have and broadly support this measure, but we have provide the high quality of education that some serious concerns with it.

Universities are faced with the implies that there will be just one piece of prospect of working out how they get the paper that both the Commonwealth additional resources. As the shadow minister government and each university signs. I for education outlined earlier today, there are believe that in actual fact it will be really three options to address that. Firstly, significantly worse than that. It will not be the universities could accommodate the one piece of paper; it will be a volume that additional students within the existing has to be agreed upon between the resources-simply put more students in and universities and the Commonwealth.

Thirdly, the governthe universities need to be freed from the red ment could actually find the additional tape and given the opportunity to provide resources to meet the additional costs that education as they best see fit.

The The first option of accommodating the government have form in adding red tape to additional costs within their existing institutions, be they businesses, nonprofits or resources is obviously exceptionally difficult other institutions. They came into power for the universities. They are already pressed promising that there would be less red tape to the limit. The second option of finding and fewer regulations. They promised that additional resources themselves is already for every new regulation they put in place very difficult for the universities. The they would take one out. But we know the universities are already heavily reliant upon record of this government in this area since international students, for example, who 2007. That record in fact shows that for cross-subsidise Australian students.

The student learning entitlement that, while this bill concerns higher was introduced by the Howard government. I education and is in large part about thought it was a sensible measure in essence addressing the 40 per cent target objective, to address the issue of professional students. which we broadly support, this bill should It does not try to prevent legitimate students not be interpreted as meaning that tertiary from doing their undergraduate and further education is somehow necessarily better than degrees. But it does try to address the fact alternative pathways which are available to that some students do one degree after students. We should always be encouraging another and insist on getting taxpayer students to pursue their own pathway, support to continue to do further degrees whether that be going into an apprenticeship, which may not be necessarily advancing the going into a job straight after high school or economy or our society. We do not believe it going to university. It is important to support is sensible to abolish the student learning the broad objective of students going to entitlement.

147,In The Context Of This Debate On This Bill That Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (16:57,"Iburst of enthusiasm, well before the critical I seek to make three points in the time detail of how the arrangements will work has available to me this evening. Firstly, to too in fact been sorted out. Is that not all too great an extent, this bill gives effect to a familiar a pattern from this government? In package of measures driven largely by the bill that is before the House this evening, politics, not by policy, and by a political I regret to note that we are once again seeing desire to have a package on credit cards. this pattern at play. Secondly, much of this bill involves detailed, Let us be clear: the question is not onerous and poorly thought through whether some Australians are offered credit regulation, the costs of which look very like card increases which they are ill equipped to to considerably exceed the benefits. The deal with-of course that happens all too third point I wish to make is that the often-and the question is not whether there implementation of this package regrettably are issues in relation to people dealing with has been done in this government's usual credit who may not be well equipped to do shoddy, hasty and imprecise way and, so. The question before this House is indeed, much of the critical detail is still not whether this particular bill is an effective yet available, because it is contained in way of dealing with the problem, because regulations. this government assumes consistently that all Let me turn to the first point-a package you need is good intentions. If you genuinely driven largely by politics, not by policy. Let think there is a problem, then bring forward me quote some of the more fragrant any measure, any package, and that ought to observations from the press release headed be judged as a success. The real question for 'A competitive and sustainable banking the House is whether, as a matter of fact, this system', issued by the Treasurer on 12 is an effective and sensible package of December 2010. According to the Treasurer measures. I regret to say that there are this package of measures, of which the serious reasons to doubt that it is an effective measures in this bill form part, will 'give and sensible package of measures. every Australian a fairer go'-I note he I note that the genesis for this legislation seems to be troubled by self-doubt because was a deeply political exercise, a package of he is not committing to a fair go, merely a so-called reforms announced on 15 August fairer go. He goes on to say in another 2010, a date you will have no hesitation in typical flourish of rhetoric that they 'won't let recalling, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, which the big banks off the hook'. If there was ever fell during the middle of the last election a clear indicator of the deliberate political campaign. intent of this legislation, I think that quote gives the game away. Substantively, there are some six measures contained in this package, which Again, with a little bit of self-doubt from this bill now seeks to pass into law and the Treasurer, he goes on to note, 'There's no some, as we have been pleased to silver bullet here,' which might as well acknowledge, have some merit. Others, I amount to an admission that quite a number regret to say, have very little merit and could of the measures in this bill are frankly more fairly be described as merely being trouble than they are worth, that the costs meretricious window dressing designed to they will introduce exceed the benefits. He pad out a press release. nevertheless commits to 'keep working hard to give all Australians a fighting chance'. Again, I wonder how giving Australians a fighting chance measures up to the standard party to, by putting some worthy sentences he set himself at the start of the press release in a press release. to give every Australian a fairer go. I would suggest to you that what this The thing that really stands out is a classic government is trying to do with this non-sequitur. We have come to appreciate particular package, these detailed controls on the non-sequitur as the favourite rhetorical credit cards, is to seek to make up for the fact device of the Treasurer of Australia and there that in reality competition in the banking is a fine example of a non-sequitur in this sector is considerably weaker than it used to press release. Immediately after the be.

The question which is raised about the measures reality is that this Treasurer, this Ruddcontained in this legislation is: why are they Gillard Labor government, has presided over necessary, in light of the fact that there is one of the most dramatic contractions of already a very tight regulatory regime competition in the banking sector that we dealing with credit limit approvals under have seen for a very long time, and you do chapter 3 of the National Consumer Credit not make up for a significant attack on Protection Act? competition, as this government has been A further question which might be asked done in a shoddy, hasty and imprecise way. is: isn't there a risk that, by imposing detailed The exposure draft was released on 3 March, restrictions on the capacity of banks to offer and only two working days were allowed for increased credit limits to their customers, the written submissions to be received by banks will in fact be encouraged to start by Treasury, even though this bill deals with offering higher credit limits than they might extremely complex business processes otherwise have proposed? Isn't there a real involving the provision of services to possibility that this legislation will end up millions of Australians and the practical dayhaving the very opposite effect to the one to-day management consequences of this which is proposed? sweeping set of changes are very, very Another serious concern with this package substantial. of measures is that some of the critical detail I note further that, when the bill was first is not obvious on the face of the legislation, introduced, there was a set of provisions because the legislation simply provides that which mandated that every customer of a there will be regulations made regarding bank would be automatically provided with a these matters-for example, the key 10 per cent buffer facility.

It was interest charges. pointed out to the government that that was A further question which might very not a particularly good idea in a piece of reasonably be asked is: why is it the case that legislation which is supposed to prevent this legislation is rife with strict liability automatic or unsolicited increase in credit provisions-that is, provisions under which card limit limits, because it has the guilt is simply assumed and the mental state substantive effect that you effectively give of the person charged with the offence is every customer a one-time 10 per cent considered to be irrelevant? One reason why increase in their credit limit. It is hard to it might be rife is that such provisions appear think of a clearer example of the very shoddy to be rife in every piece of legislation this way in which this set of rapidly rammed government brings forward, because they sit together measures, dreamt up for political very well with this government's preference purposes, has been put into legislation. for detailed, prescriptive and intrusive I note that, as a consequence of this rather legislation.

I note that some of those provisions the government has at a very late stage have been removed from the set of chosen to completely remove the provisions amendments which have been put forward that were in the original bill dealing with this by the government at the eleventh hour, but buffer mechanism and has introduced a we still face a very serious and obvious whole new set of provisions in this area by question: why is it that there are simply so means of amendment. I suppose we ought to many measures contained in this bill which at least acknowledge the fact that the seek to impose strict liability? government has conceded the self-evident The third point I wish to make is to note, logical problem in the original set of with considerable regret, that the measures dealing with the so-called buffer implementation of this package has been facility.

In particular, Labor Party have now been incorporated into one is straightforward and is supported by the legislation which we are currently this side-that is, the specification of an debating.

My constituents on the Gold has now been amended at the eleventh hour, Coast in my seat of Moncrieff and all of us was about rules surrounding the use of credit cards above their credit limit.

It is part of legislation would have meant. In the first daily life. When you drive in your car, you instance-this was an obvious concern and see billboards. When you turn on the one that I raised with witnesses as well-was television, you see advertisements. We are the issue about whether, as a consequence of not compelled to race out and purchase all Labor's legislation, we would see a situation those items as a consequence of seeing where credit providers provided a higher advertising. Indeed, for the manufacturers than usual credit limit to a customer, and service providers that are advertising in a expecting that subsequently they would be market economy, I think it is part of their unable to raise the credit limit unless they routine business. In fact, I think most people had jumped over all the hurdles that this have become desensitised to a large extent to legislation effectively put before them. The advertising.

That was the about whether or not this is a little heavycase with the original iteration of this handed. My personal view is that it is heavylegislation. Now that has been amended so handed. My personal view is that it is crazy that consumers can give their consent to to be saying to financial lenders, 'Don't you there being, for example, additional fees and dare provide an unsolicited credit offer, charges associated with going over their because if you do that then you're in breach credit limit as well as with respect to the way of the legislation, and if it is a personal a credit limit is assigned in the first place.

Why is it that consumers forward by the coalition and incorporated apparently have the ability to discern what those changes into the legislation. they should consume when it comes to other A second aspect of this that causes me products and services but they cannot do it some concern is with respect to so-called with respect to credit cards? I think it is one unsolicited invitations. As a matter of bridge too far. I think it is unnecessary. In principle, I do not really understand why we that sense, I certainly have some concerns.

Firstly, the bill changes the way banks of course. They were able to immediately apply credit limits. Currently banks allow double what they were able to rack up. Now credit accounts to exceed credit limits and lenders will not be able to send offers to then charge an over-limit free.

It more exclusive the club the better people feel prevents banks from slugging consumers about themselves-so the bronze club, the with excessive over-limit fees and empowers silver club, the gold club, the platinum consumers to choose whether they can go club-and sometimes it is a case of offering over their limit. As I said, at the moment to change you from a gold to a platinum, yet there is about $10 in fees for every man, it does not really change anything except the woman and child in Australia. Hopefully not colour of the card, but people mistakenly feel everyone in Australia has a credit card, but they are in a more exclusive club. I am not still it is a significant amount. This bill also sure what sorts of colours and metals they requires credit card lenders to allocate progress on to, but everyone likes an repayments to a consumer's higher interest exclusive club and the people who offer bearing debts first.

This was certainly the case when Mr Praveen Ranjan came to see me with his brother last Friday. He informed me that in mid-May he found his son dead in his bedroom. His son had committed suicide. His son apparently gave no indication to his parents that he was upset, sad or in any way depressed. From all accounts, he was a successful, bright and popular young 16-year-old boy. He was captain of the hockey team. He was one of the brightest in his school and potentially was going to be the school captain in the following year. Mr Ranjan and his family are naturally devastated. They are dealing with something now that no parent should ever have to deal with. They have given me permission to raise their tragic story in the parliament in order to raise awareness about youth mental illness and its impacts. They are particularly keen to raise awareness amongst parents of youth with depression and the possible signs and how to interact and engage better with their children, particularly teenage ones. They also want to raise awareness amongst young people about the implications of their actions if they do take their own life, of the devastation of parents and loved ones left behind. Given his devastation and his wife's devastation, I think they are being incredibly courageous in raising these issues publicly and I admire them greatly for it. As you would be aware, youth depression and youth suicide are too common in our community. About one in three young people is estimated to suffer a mental illness at some stage before early adulthood. As a community we must do more to address youth mental illness. We need to raise awareness of its prevalence in our community and be more open in talking about it. In doing so, we must reduce the stigma associated with it so that all young people feel comfortable in talking about it and all older people can also feel comfortable in talking about it and not attach a stigma to it. We need to invest more in support services for our young people. I am particularly impressed by the headspace foundation and, as you might be aware, I am seeking a headspace centre in my electorate. Locally, I am also working with some of the other community leaders to promote the issue of youth mental health. My heart goes out to Mr Ranjan and his family. As a parent, I can only imagine what they are going through. But hopefully through their loss they will make a difference to the lives of others. (Time expired) Republic of Slovenia Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister for Human Services) (16:03): I am rising today to speak on the 20th anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Slovenia. When France Preseren wrote his poem Zdravljica in 1844, it was considered subversive. The third and fourth verses of his poem, which spoke of Slovenian nationalism and national identity, were considered so dangerous by the Austrians that the poem was banned from publication. The censors said that Preseren could publish his poem MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Bills
233,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke) Took The Chair At 16:00.,,162,Constituency Statements
234,Mr Tudge (Aston) (16:00,"As a member of parliament you sometimes have stories toldwithout the offending verses; Preseren said that the poem was mutilated without them. Now Zdravljica is the Slovenian national anthem. While mostly only the seventh verse is sung, the whole poem and its history are representative of Slovenia's journey to freedom and independence. This Saturday, 25 June 2011, the Republic of Slovenia will celebrate the 20th anniversary of its independence. Slovenians at home and abroad are preparing to commemorate this important event. Slovenia is a small country of two million people yet it has a rich history and a mighty heart. It is a land both fiercely independent and peaceful. Its people are spread across the globe, fully integrated into their new homes yet passionately attached to their motherland and mother tongue. Australia has a small but active Slovene community, many of whom migrated here in the 1950s and 1960s. The 2006 census recorded 16,085 people of Slovenian origin living in Australia, mostly in Melbourne and Sydney. Of course, Canberra and Wollongong also have large Slovenian communities. On 16 January 1992, Australia became one of the first nations in the world to acknowledge Slovene independence. Slovene Australians should be proud of the role they played in this official acknowledgment. We have strong representation now of Slovenians from Slovenia-for instance, the charge d'affaires, Dr Zvone Zigon, and the incoming ambassador designate, Dr Milan Balazic. But for a very long time we have had Slovenian Australians like Mr Alfred Breznik AM, the honorary consul-general, former Liberal senator Misha Lajovic and religious leaders such as Father Valerijan and a series of very involved priests and nuns who led the Slovenian-Australian community in supporting independence for Slovenia. I think their work should be acknowledged as critical to Australia being one of the early recognisers of Slovenian independence. The contributions made by the Slovenian-Australian community to their adopted homeland allowed the Australian government the confidence to support Slovenian independence. I was in Slovenia on that first evening of independence, 25 June 1991, sitting near Tromostovje, listening to speeches over a public-address system and watching the fireworks in the warm evening sky. I remember the following day the way in which the borders were closed and Slovenians drove their cars and trucks onto the roads to block the onslaught of the Yugoslav army. It was a very anxious time for Slovenians around the world. It is wonderful to see that we can now live peacefully as neighbours. (Time expired) Boothby Electorate: Oaklands Railway Crossing Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (16:06): I would like to raise an important issue which residents and commuters in my electorate have complained about for more than two decades-that is, the Oaklands railway crossing. They raise the issue of traffic delays at this major intersection. It is the intersection of two major arterial roads, Diagonal Road and Oaklands Road, combined with the Oaklands Park railway station and crossing. It is an issue that the Rann state Labor government continues to ignore. The Diagonal Road-Morphett Road intersection is regularly raised by constituents when consulting with my electorate, whether that be through my regular surveys, my listening posts or my street corner meetings. This intersection is already the cause of unbearable delays, but these will only increase with the recent opening of the new South Australian State Aquatic Centre and the proposed expansion of the Westfield shopping centre at Marion. The only real solution to the massive delays and gridlocks during peak hour traffic is a grade separation, either a road underpass or MAIN COMMITTEE a train overpass. This grade separation would need to take into account a complete redesign to ensure there is a continuous, uninterrupted traffic flow to this area. This issue has recently come to the fore again because, in only the last two weeks, the state government in their state budget have shelved a $12.6 million upgrade of this intersection. Whilst many measures in the South Australian state budget were re-profiled-which is the word now used by the state Public Service for deferrals of expenditure-this one has been deferred, with no date given as to when it will be reintroduced. All they have done is announce a $2 million traffic study on the intersection. It is just another example of the state Labor government announcing things and then putting the spending on the infrastructure on the never-never. It is a stunt they have a proven track record of using. In 2006, the South Australian state government were going to fix another area of traffic congestion in my electorate-the intersection of South Road and Sturt Road. Five years later nothing has been done on this intersection, and there is no money set aside to fix it. It means that the residents in my electorate will again miss out because of the Rann state Labor government. I urge the Premier, Mike Rann, Minister Patrick Conlon and the state government to listen to residents of Warradale and Oaklands Park and show this by making the Diagonal Road-Morphett Road intersection a priority on their infrastructure agenda. Calwell Electorate: Victorian Arabic Social Services Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (16:09): TodayI rise to express my very deep concern regarding the Victorian state government's failure to renew $150,000 of funding for an intake and referral service run by Victorian Arabic Social Services, VASS, in my electorate. VASS is an organisation that services a considerable proportion of our local and diverse Arabicspeaking community. Not only is Arabic the fastest growing language spoken at home, but if we take into account the Chaldean and Assyrian community, which makes up 60 per cent of VASS's client base, Arabic is the most widely spoken language in my community after English. The funding relates to VASS's Arabic families intake and referral service program, a program that serves to bridge the gap between mainstream services and the Arabic-speaking community without duplication. Family services are a core service to the community and VASS has received a wide range of referrals to this program from organisations across the public, private and community sectors as well as across agencies. The Baillieu state government, which likes to proclaim its support for multiculturalism, appears to have a selective understanding of what multiculturalism means for communities across Victoria, in particular for the Arabic-speaking community in my electorate. I am the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and we are currently conducting an inquiry into multiculturalism in Australia. One of the things that has arisen very early in the hearings is that multiculturalism is very much about inclusion, about including migrants and enabling them, especially new migrants, to integrate and belong to Australian society. This means that government cannot promote the benefits of migration and multiculturalism without also recognising the challenges and the grassroots mechanisms by which to tackle them. Issues of language and culture cannot be ignored. English language skills and cultural sensitivity have a direct impact on access to education, employment and the community services that all other Australians enjoy. Unless policies on multiculturalism and MAIN COMMITTEE social inclusion are brought together, we will miss a vital part of the jigsaw puzzle when it comes to allowing communities to integrate and participate fully in Australian society. It is extraordinary that we have a state government in Victoria that stands on a platform claiming to be a champion of multiculturalism, yet behind the glory and the lights that they are very keen to take centre stage in they aim to cut funding to a vital service to a very important and sizable community in an area where the language used by this community features very strongly. This is a state government that is meant to meet the needs of all Victorians. SoI want to join with my community and with the local member for Broadmeadows, Frank McGuire, in calling on the Victorian state government to reinstate the funding before the end of this month. (Time expired) Bradfield Electorate: Order of Australia Recipients birthday honours list to observe that there were eight constituents from Bradfield named in that list. I want to use this occasion to briefly pay tribute to them. First of all I would like to acknowledge Mr Douglas Spencer OAM for service to the community through a range of social welfare and service organisations and to the law. I would like to acknowledge Ms Helen Preston OAM of Wahroonga for service to conservation and the environment. I would like to acknowledge Mr Andrew Locke OAM of Gordon for his services to mountaineering. I would like to acknowledge Mr Ian De Mellow OAM of Wahroonga for service to aged welfare. I would like to acknowledge Mrs Margaret Catterall OAM of North Turramurra for services to the community through a range of Jewish organisations and to the Gemmological Association of Australia. I note in passing, with some pride, that my wife is a member of the Gemmological Association of Australia. I would like to pay tribute to Mr David Barnsdall OAM of Killara for services to the community through the Hamlin Fistula Australia organisation. I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Geoffrey Ainsworth AM of St Ives. He was made a member of the Order of Australia for service to the visual and performing arts through the promotion and support of contemporary art and to the community. I would also like to acknowledge Mr Mark Scott AO, the Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and a constituent of mine in the suburb of Roseville. His citation reads: For distinguished service to media and communications, and to the community through advisory and governance roles with a range of social justice and educational bodies. I do note with pride the fact that all of these constituents were honoured in the Queen's Birthday Honours List. I particularly note the rich diversity of the nature of the service that they have provided to our community. One of the great features of the honours system in Australia is that it offers a chance for the community to note the contribution of people in so many diverse areas. As I move around the electorate of Bradfield, I am constantly struck at the range and diversity of people and of their voluntary or other contributions to the community. I think that the presence of eight constituents in the Queen's Birthday Honours List is testament to the degree of community services going on.

And there is a lot of country football at this time of year and a lot of young people are involved in junior football. In my electorate the showing of poultry is coming back-not just chooks but ducks, geese, bantams, full breeds and a whole range of birds; full feather, soft feather and a lot other terms that I am not that familiar with. It is certainly receiving great support. I am patron of the local club which has just spent a considerable amount of money and done a lot of work locally to upgrade their shed, their showing area and their meeting rooms, which they share with the local fishing club. They have obtained good sponsors and they get large numbers to their shows, which is terrific. I have been encouraging them to engage young people, which they are doing and a lot of young people are now involved in showing birds. The local fishing club is also very active in involving young people and families. It is a family oriented club. They have many members and are probably the largest of any fishing club in Australia. They teach kids the skills of fishing as well as how to look after the banks of rivers and how to look after their local area. One of the big events in the local area is the Tasmanian Trout Expo, which is held at the Cressy District High School, just up the road from Longford, and also at Brumbys Creek. Once a year they have a lot of activities for young people. There is a fashion parade where young people can show off outdoor clothing and get confidence from modelling. They can catch 'Trevor' or 'Tracey' in Brumbys Creek, the tagged fish worth $10,000 which have never been caught. These programs involve young people and it is great to see them being involved in a lot of different pursuits. Solomon Electorate: Kakadu National Park this House an issue which goes beyond the boundaries of my electorate in Solomon. Before this sitting of parliament, I was fortunate enough to visit Kakadu National Park with Gagudju Association executive officer, Rob Trenerry. I wish to inform this House that what I saw was a blatant example of federal Labor's mismanagement and buck-passing. During my time at Kakadu, I visited some of the local Indigenous communities, including Mudjinberry, which is near Jabiru. At this community, I was informed by the traditional land owner and member of the Murumburr clan, Jessie Alderson, that many of the local dirt roads leading to the Indigenous communities have deteriorated to such an extent that the school bus would no longer drive down the roads to pick up the children for school. This has meant that many children in these Indigenous communities located within Kakadu cannot attend school. As a result, attendance at the local school has dropped, a situation which is expected to become worse in the coming wet season. I spoke with Judy, a local Indigenous mother, whose daughter Babylon has suffered as a result of these roads. She told me how her daughter loved to attend school and how upset she was when she had to stay home. Judy is on dialysis and depends on these buses to pick up her daughter and to drop her home. What is incredible about this situation are the flow-on effects that it has had. Due to the roads not being drivable, the buses will not pick up the children, the children do not go to school, the parents are punished for not taking their children to school and the children lose interest in their education-and, finally, the Labor government has failed. What saddens me about this situation is that, because no-one is willing to help these people, Jessie, the traditional land owner, a woman in her 60s, has been dragging a tractor tyre attached with a steel chain behind her car in an attempt to try to smooth the roads. She has been driving up MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Constituency Statements

She tells me she has written to the member for Lingiari and her local council but no-one will listen to her or give her help. We have a Labor government which claims they care about Indigenous communities, yet her local federal member, the member for Lingiari, who also happens to be a minister in this government, does not have the courtesy to respond to her request. Unlike this government, the coalition does care about Indigenous communities and their children's education. That is why I have brought this very important matter to the attention of this House. Hopefully now this Labor minister will respond to the people-his people-that he has been ignoring previously. With the last of my remaining time. I would like to congratulate the Greek Orthodox Community of Northern Australia for this year's Glenti. The annual cultural festival was a brilliant success and I enjoyed being part of this event. (Time expired) Fairhaven Surf Life Saving Club Isaac down to the beach at Fairhaven along the Great Ocean Road. We went down there because from two days before my office had been receiving reports from the Fairhaven community that their very fine surf life saving club was in some trouble. SoI went down there and inspected for myself the state of the Fairhaven Surf Life Saving Club. WhatI witnessed was truly remarkable. Through the course of this winter there has been a number of very severe storm events and storm surges. As you would expect, surf life saving clubs are built on top of dunes very close to the beach that they serve. Of course, with these very substantial storm surges at Fairhaven there has been an enormous amount of erosion taking place which has eroded away access for the surf life saving club to the beach. More importantly, the surf life saving club is now placed literally right on the edge of a cliff and if we continue to see storm surges then we can expect the club to be washed away. This surf life saving club has been there for many years. In fact, they have been working really hard to secure fundraising dollars and money from the state government to rebuild their facility to support the Fairhaven community. The state government department responsible, the Department of Sustainability and Environment, had given them coastal consent to rebuild their facility. I am now told that the Department of Sustainability and Environment are considering withdrawing that coastal consent because of the state of erosion that is taking place along the Fairhaven foreshore. It reminds me of the importance of tackling climate change. Whilst this particular event is clearly not climate change related, it is true to say that with sea level rise we are going to see an enormous number of public assets along Australia's coastline eroded away, placing many billions of dollars under threat. Live Animal Exports Australian beef industry. The first is on live exports to Indonesia, and I would like to take this opportunity to call on the government to resume the trade. The industry has been to government and presented a case for getting the trade up and running again, and the minister has now been over to Indonesia and has held discussions with the Indonesian government, so the time is right for us to commence the trade. We should do so, initially, by starting with those exporters who were exporting to abattoirs already meeting OIE guidelines. As a matter MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Constituency Statements
238,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (16:21,On Saturday morning I went with my son,167,Constituency Statements
239,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (16:25,"I rise today to speak on two issues of relevance to theof fact, Elders have a first-class abattoir in Indonesia and a supply chain from the paddock to the plate which is the equivalent of what we have here in Australia. The trade for that company alone should never have been banned. As a matter of fact, the government made a knee-jerk reaction in stopping all the trade rather than just doing so for those abattoirs that were not practising standards. Those abattoirs' practices, I think we would all agree, were abhorrent and we do need to change them. But for those practising in the correct way, on behalf of the beef farmers of Australia, of the Indigenous communities who not only own beef properties but work in that industry and of everyone employed in this $400 million trade, we need to get on with that trade. It is a point worth making for those people who think we can just send manufactured meat over to Indonesia that our live cattle exports are the way we have led manufacturing meat into that market and in other markets as well. So, if we are moving to get more boxed meat into Indonesia, the best way to do it is to open the trade, and then the boxed meat will follow as a result of that. At the same time that we have banned live exports to Indonesia, the government is proceeding with its $6 per head tax on those Australian producers sending their livestock to our own domestic abattoirs. They have done that without honouring the agreement that was made when these changes were brought into place. AMIC has put out a fact sheet about the Gillard government's imposition of a new $6 per head tax on the Australian producer. I would ask all members of this House to read it. I would ask the minister to read it, because not only are we harming our live exporters at the moment but we are about to put a new tax on our abattoirs which is going to make them less competitive. So, on those two issues, I would ask the government to seriously look at whether its actions are in the long-term interests of our beef producers, who have produced beef successfully in Australia since Federation. Australian Institute for Innovative Materials Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (16:28): I visited the Australian Institute for Innovative Materials facility on 9 June with Parliamentary Secretary Justine Elliot and member for Throsby Stephen Jones. The University of Wollongong, which is the facility that runs AIIM, is a recognised world leader in multifunctional materials research, and I had the opportunity to find out more about the groundbreaking research being led by Professor Gordon Wallace and Professor Dou. The research groups housed at the AIIM-the ARC Centre for Excellence for Electromaterials Science and the Institute for Superconducting and Electronic Materialstogether have more than 200 researchers and postgraduate students working to tackle some of the biggest global challenges. This includes energy technology that is developing new methods of energy generation, transportation and storage, including battery technologies that will be of considerable importance to the future of electric vehicles, and building on the breakthrough research they have done. Secondly, there is health and medical bionics to advance muscle and nerve regeneration and cochlear implants and to develop wearable bionics to assist with injury prevention and rehabilitation, as well as advances in medical devices such as improved MRI systems. Thirdly, there are innovative materials and manufacturing. There is some amazing 3-D printing technology and rapid prototyping systems and there is the development of materials to help lower costs and prove the efficiency of mechanical and electrical equipment. This facility continues to grow with the support from the Gillard government. We have invested $43 million in the future of the facility to create the first materials research facility to bridge the gap between lab based research and commercial MAIN COMMITTEE applications. The expanded facility will now be able to undertake groundbreaking research and help turn those research breakthroughs into reality. It is a state-of-the-art facility, housing internationally recognised researchers who, from their Wollongong base, have established strong collaborative research and industry partnerships that give them a global reach. It is once again an example of the Wollongong area leading the nation and the world in important research and in new technology development for the future of the nation. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 Consideration in Detail Finance and Deregulation Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $601,056,000. last week. I had the responsibility of exploring with the Assistant Treasurer the various matters to do with the appropriation bills. Unfortunately, last week it was a total waste of time-an absolute and categorical waste of time. I just wanted to put it on the record because I am still very cross about what happened. The Assistant Treasurer turned up with half a dozen goons, most of whom did not speak except to intervene and interject in an attempt to disrupt proceedings for the whole hour with inane and mainly quite offensive comments. They were not even comical. Every attempt was made to not cover the substance of any of the questions. The questions were asked in good faith. As always, there is politics on either side of this chamber. Points are made, and I am not oblivious to that. I am pleased to see the Special Minister of State because we have had some healthy debates. We will make our political points. If he does not know the answer, because the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is in another chamber, it would be appreciated if we get the answer in due course. I just felt that last week's session was the worse experience I have had. The previous Minister for Finance and Deregulation made a serious attempt to canvass answers in this chamber, to make political points where appropriate and not waste the time of everyone involved. Firstly, I would like to explore some of the issues to do with the government's proposal to increase the debt ceiling from $200 billion to $250 billion, which was included in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012. This is a cognate budget debate and this session is our only opportunity to explore any of these issues. While this is incorporated, we do feel that this is an opportunity to get some understanding of a very important matter which has never been put in an appropriation bill in the past. It has always been properly debated separately, but it was snuck into this bill with no explanation on the evening of the budget. The opposition are very interested to know which minister made the decision to incorporate the debt raising proposal in the second appropriation bill. Firstly, is the minister aware that this is without precedent, and could he explain why the government has gone down this path and not put the proposal in a stand-alone piece of legislation? Secondly, I would be grateful to know why the government is so averse to having this item debated in detail before the House?

I wrote separately to the Leader of the House and asked, again, if he would give consideration to this being debated in some detail and separated out from the other appropriation bills, and I got back what was a fairly nondescript response. Basically, it was trying to take the mickey out of me at every opportunity on this issue, but there were no substantive reasons at all as to why it could not be done. Certainly, it was a very perfunctory 'no' to the question of whether it could be considered in some detail. Thirdly, is the minister aware of the stark contrast in how the debt issue is being handled compared to the United States, where there is a very public and robust debate in Congress with the Congress being given the opportunity to vote on the fund-raising proposal? (Time expired) Special Minister of State) (16:36): The member for Goldstein says that being here last week with the Assistant Treasurer was the worse experience he has had, but I think that you and I have both shared much worse experiences than that in our lives. He asks three questions, most of which do not fall into my direct portfolio responsibility-but, yes, I will get back to him with an answer to those questions in the way in which he has put them. I cannot promise that the answers I give will be more than the broad outline of why the government is doing what it is doing and how the parliamentary arrangements came about, but I will do that. In 2011-2012 the Finance and Deregulation portfolio will be appropriated $601.1 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for the ordinary annual services of the government. This will include departmental capital budget funding of $23.8 million, about $400,000 million in departmental supplementation, and administered capital funding of $3.3 million. The Finance and Deregulation portfolio will also be appropriated $210.2 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 2) for non-operating purposes. A number of new measures were announced in the 2011-12 budget for the Finance portfolio. I will enumerate some of those. The government will provide $7.2 million over five years to increase the number of parliamentarians' personal employees by a total of 10 positions. The additional staff will allow members and senators to better manage their workload and provide them with greater capacity for consultation, understanding and decision making. The unique circumstances of the 43rd parliament have required this, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Members who hold critical positions have required additional resourcing and additional support, and as part of the normal process of ensuring that members of parliament can function properly we have provided additional staff in order to allow just for that. Other measures include appropriations of $2.3 million in 201112 to investigate and test ways to improve individuals' ease and use of access to Australian government services. This funding will be used for a scoping study, a technical pilot and business case, improvements to be explored including allowing individuals to communicate updated details to multiple agencies simultaneously, and improve filling in forms using information previously submitted to a government agency. There will also be the ability for individuals to view all of the government communications in one place. I will say more about the idea of what the government wants later in this session, but the initiative is designed to create both a better digital environment for our citizens and better information management for government, and it is consistent with a drive over time from governments of Australia to ensure that the benefits of the digital revolution are felt by our MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Bills
242,Mr Gray (Brand,"Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity andcitizens and can also be used to the advantage of government, reducing both the cost of service delivery from government and increasing the efficiency. The capacity to do this is important to our citizens and I will speak about it in detail as we progress through the session. $7.2 million over five years to increase the number of government and non-government personnel employees to a total of 10. Would the minister, firstly, tell me what the meaning of 'non-government' is-whom does it include-and what is the breakup of those 10 positions? In addressing those answers, could he tell me whether or not those positions were designed or went-even if they were not designed to-to Independents? I am particularly interested in the question of the national broadband network committee established to which Mr Oakeshott was appointed chairman. Presumably, he got more staff. Does that come in that entitlement or does that come in the entitlement of more money being given to the parliament? In looking at that instance, I note that that was created on 3 April by resolution of the Senate, which of course was after the New South Wales election when Mr Besseling, who was the Independent member for Port Macquarie, was voted out dramatically, that being a seat within Mr Oakeshott's own seat and the one he used to hold in the state parliament. Could you tell me whether or not part of that extra funding for additional employees was given to Mr Oakeshott so that he could employ Mr Besseling when he lost his seat of Port Macquarie? And while I have still got three minutes to go, I will then move on to questions about the appointment of Mr Ken Henry to a position which is described as being 'supported' by the Prime Minister and Cabinet's Office, but would be financed, I guess, out of the Finance budget, because he said he is neither a consultant nor an employee but he is appointed under section 67 of the Constitution. SoI would ask the minister if you could tell me: who prepared the brief for the Governor General to make that appointment? What was the nature of the appointment? When will the appointment be gazetted? Did Mr Henry actually retire from the Public Service prior to his being appointed to this nebulous position? Was he a member of the Public Service Superannuation Fund that required him to retire at the age of no greater than 54 and 11 months to maximise his superannuation payout? Was he in fact in receipt of any superannuation payout? What is the basis upon which he is being paid his old salary of $535,000 a year, which is pro-rated according to the number of days he does, the details of which we do not need? When will the appointment be gazetted? Special Minister of State) (16:44): I thank the shadow minister for the questions. I will get back to you on those as is appropriate. Ken Henry is a distinguished Australian public servant. He is a public servant who has served the interests of our country well under all governments in the course of the last 20 years. He is a public servant whose high regard is such that the accolades that he has received have been extended by all sides of politics. I think all of us took great pride in the work that Ken has done throughout his years as a senior public servant. It is pleasing to see that he will continue to serve the interests of our nation in providing advice to the Prime Minister, and it is extremely important in the context of ensuring that our public servants are able to carry out their work both at the time and into the future rather than, as many do, see their knowledge and their considerable skill in serving both sides of parliament lost to this place, to the Public Service and to public administration.

We are still governed by the standing orders, and the standing orders do require direct answers. That appliescan resume her seat. This is not question time. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: I am sorry; the standing orders apply to more than just question time. time. Independent members of parliament. It is the case that members of parliament whose status in the parliament is as Independents have been provided with additional resources from the government. That has certainly been the case in my own state for the member for O'Connor, who found himself in a position where he sought to independently represent the people of that electorate in this place but also found himself in the position of needing support to understand the complex issues of public policy and also, being a new member of parliament, of servicing a massive constituency and dealing with the complex issues. Yes, we did think it was important to provide additional support for people in that environment. We have also provided additional staff support for other Independent members of parliament. We do this in order to create the best possible environment for such members to properly, conscientiously and purposefully serve the interests of the 43rd Parliament. We have been explicit and transparent as a government both in making those appointments and in reporting publicly that we have done that. We think it is proper, we think it is appropriate and we think it is in the interests of the best parliamentary practice, of good governance and of good government. We do not resile from that. At the same time, when such decisions are made it is critically important to ensure that they are reported publicly and transparently and can be questioned. I return to the point of Dr Henry, the former Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, with a couple of concluding comments. A lifetime of dedication to good public policy and good public administration should be celebrated in this country and should be applauded, especially in the context of a willingness to continue to serve the nation and to serve the good governance of the country. Dr Henry's willingness to do that has again been completely transparently and publicly reported, acknowledged and understood, so there is no great matter of discovery in the questions that refer to Dr Henry. There is, however, the important principle that I think we all would live with in this place, and that is the principle that our Public Service is a great institution that serves our country well.

He has been on some sort of 'swinger' list. Would that be correct? resume her seat, I will give him the call and she will not get the time. This is not question time. It is consideration in detail. The member for Mackellar has the call. 2 is: was Mr Oakeshott given an extra staff position after 24 March, which was the date of the state election? Let's take it from the end of that month. Was Mr Oakeshott given an extra position after the state election in New South Wales? I also note that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is going to increase by another 200 people. Is Ms Lampe, who was the previous chief of staff to the Prime Minister and who was farewelled with great parties in February of this year, yet allegedly remained on the payroll until 3 June this year, counted as one of those 200 people? Indeed, why was she kept on? The reason given was that the Prime Minister's new chief of staff, who had worked for her when she was deputy leader, needed a four-month handover period. Was it, in fact, because she was supposed to end up with the national secretary's job-your old job, I thinkbut was vetoed and therefore without an income and the poor old taxpayer had to pick up the leeway? Perhaps we could understand whether she is one of those desperately needed 200 people, particularly when I notice that the Department of Human Services is going to lose 1,200 people while we will have 1,100 people on the Prime Minister's staff. It does not seem to be helping her out much, but it is a valiant effort, I suppose. In that 200 people that she has now got on her staff, could you tell me whether or not the executive service appointment of Mr Henry has any precedent and whether precedent was relied upon? Perhaps in your answer this time you might be able to tell me who prepared the brief for the Governor General and when we might expect it to be gazetted. Special Minister of State) (16:53): There are a couple of points there. The first is whether Mr Henry on a 'swinger' list-I do not know. You would need to ask other people if he is on such a list. I doubt it. The Oakeshott staffing matter I have addressed. As for DPMC and Amanda Lampe, we made clear that Ms Lampe's continued presence on the staffing arrangements of the government was because it was part of her handover in that critical role as chief of staff for the Prime Minister.

254,Mr Gray (Brand,"Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity anddelivery reforms is aimed at providing more personalised, convenient and quicker services to people. Advances in IT mean that we are able to provide innovative ways to improve service delivery to citizens and better meet the public's expectations of personalised services that are convenient and quick. It is the case that today our citizens are used to rapid services delivered from banking systems, airline booking systems and they expect the same sort of speed and quality of service from government departments. Worldwide, governments are looking at ways of delivering services that better meet the needs of individuals and that make it easier for individuals to interact with government. Today, Australians expect government services to be as intuitively easy to use, to understand and to access as they can be. As a government we are constantly looking to see what we can do better and how we can effectively harness technological advances to improve what we are doing. Important reforms currently underway include the merging of Medicare, Centrelink and the Department of Human Services to provide a more connected and seamless service to people in the community. We are at the first step of a process of investigating the capacity for people to provide their personal information such as name and contact details, but potentially more complex information such as income and employment, to one government agency and to consent to it being used by other nominated agencies-a kind of 'tell us once' capability. The early work is focused on testing concepts and scoping the environment for possible options. We have asked the Department of Finance and Deregulation to explore options that would allow people to communicate updated details to multiple agencies simultaneously, to prefill in forms using information previously submitted to other government agencies and to view all government communications in one place. The aim is to do away with some cumbersome processes such as those which require individuals to resubmit the same details multiple times to gain access to services. This could provide great benefits, for example, for people in crisis and emergency situations such as those affected by the recent floods and cyclones and for all Australians who may need to change their address details when moving house. In exploring these capabilities, individual privacy is at the forefront of our minds. This exploratory work will focus on only frameworks that operate on the basis of individual consent so that any flow of the information will be controlled by the individual and not by the agencies involved. Individuals will be able to opt in and out of the facility at any time. People could choose not to opt in and could be selective about how much they make use of such a facility. There will be no central database of people's personal information. Agencies would not be able to swap or match client information; rather, such an account would enable people to share their own information with each individual agency, should they choose to do so. We will not be merging agency databases. We are not looking to create a centralised national identity database and there is no hidden agenda. We are exploring frameworks that will put greater control in the hands of individuals. The reason for this is to create greater efficiency and intuition in government information management systems to make more efficient for our citizens the information distribution that they provide, to create a more current and up-to-date information set about key metrics available for good public policy making and to ensure that our citizens obtain those benefits and rights that they are due to receive under our various rules for such entitlements. It is also MAIN COMMITTEE the case that we will be doing this over time and in a way that is as effective as possible. (Time expired) consideration in detail stage and we are supposed to be talking about the appropriations. The minister's speech was very nicely read, but I hardly think it was relevant to anything we have been addressing. The minister said at the beginning that he had answered my questions about Mr Oakeshott's personal staffing arrangements, and I disagree. We do not know whether or not Mr Oakeshott was given extra staff as a result of these budget allocations, which enabled him to put on extra staff after the last election in New South Wales. I specifically request an answer to that and, if he does not have it-or if any of those people sitting at the back cannot give it to him-then I would like to place that question formally on notice. I think we deserve an answer to that. With regard to the question about Ms Lampe, clearly the answer must be that the poor old Prime Minister is so incompetent that she needs two chiefs of staff, whereas when poor old Mr Rudd was bundled out the door, his chief of staff was sacked that same night. Maybe Mr Rudd was more competent than Ms Gillard and you knew it right from the beginning. Mr Robb: No handover. bloke who had worked for her before-that is extraordinarily incompetent. I want to ask a question about solar panels and this building. I note that $187,870 is to be paid to Silex Solar Pty Ltd for solar panels for a rooftop trial for work between April and June. Solar panels will be installed on the roof of the Senate wing and the gardeners' compound. Was a thorough cost-benefit analysis done on the project to install these solar panels? On average, how much electricity will they generate? Will the electricity generated be fed back into the grid or will it be solely used for Parliament House? Will an outrageous payment be made for it if it is fed into the grid? If this trial proves unviable and there are negligible savings or no savings in electricity costs, will there be a further installation of solar panels at Parliament House-in other words, will the plan be abandoned? In the meantime, I note that the electricity costs for this building have gone up from $290,000 a month in September last year to $320,000 a month. Have any low-carbon solutions been put in place in the interim that may have caused this increase or is there some other reason? Special Minister of State) (17:01): I thank the shadow minister for her questions. I will get back to her on the staffing arrangements for Mr Oakeshott. She asked questions about solar panels. I will have to get back to her on the details of the solar panel questions because it is important and do accept the good intentions behind the questioning. She has asked about a range of detailed matters around the operation of such panels and whether there are interconnections with the ACT grid and whether there is reselling into that grid. I am not able to provide answers to those questions at the moment but, yes, Shadow Minister, and I will come back to you as soon as I possibly can with the detail of answers to that.

257,Mr Gray (Brand,"Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity andCybersecurity is one of Australia's national security priorities and our approach to this issue is clearly outlined in the government's Cyber security strategy. The same principles, key actions and measures will apply in our work on service delivery reform and underpin our evaluations of options in this area. It is extremely important to ensure that those who do not have a computer will not be disadvantaged in this new digital age. Such a capability would not exclude people who do not have access to a computer. People who choose not to opt into the system which I have described would access services as they do currently-that is, by approaching the relevant agency and providing sufficient information to establish eligibility. Members will be aware that in the context of the need to provide the Australian government with that information, there may well be people who are not digitally enabled or not able to get access to a computer in order to take advantage of such a streamlined and capable system. We still need to ensure that such people do not have the disadvantage of needing to inform the government several times before that information is held in a common way by the government. We will be taking steps to ensure that those who are not digitally enabled are able to take advantage of the technology changes. The reforms in this area are likely to be very complex and they will evolve over time. They will need to be considered as long-term projects, subject to the government deciding to invest in competing frameworks. We will work closely consult widely with all relevant stakeholders, users of Australian Government services, privacy interest groups, Australian Government departments et cetera in developing the future reform options in this area. However, at this stage what is happening is that the government is trying to scope the nature of a possible framework that it might want to go into. The government is not, at this point, considering whether to introduce the new service delivery arrangements. What the government is doing is considering the possibility of the service of informing the government once of a range of personal details that our citizens hold and that they may require to provide to multiple government agencies. These reforms are an extremely important part of what we call, in general, the digital democracy and enabling our community to better contact, access and obtain information from governments. As the NBN rollout across the nation continues, the capacity to do this becomes more and more important.

The way in which this is occurring right now does seem to be contrary to the intent and to the way in which the standing orders are framed, in that questions have been asked, the minister is unable to answer the questions and then he merely reads out material about issues that have not been dealt with at all in the questions. that he is within the parameters of the portfolio. I did not hear the question that was framed earlier because I was not here, so I am not going to make a ruling on this particular issue, but he is within his portfolio area, from what I understand. There is no point of order. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: The point of order is this: this is a part under the standing orders designed for members to ask questions about the appropriations.

258,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Georganas,"I am listening to the minister and I feelasked relating to the material that the minister is merely reading out and taking up time with, thereby denying people their proper function. initiatives in the budget is extremely important and, Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to conclude some areas of discussion around the initiatives in the digital economy. When I speak next I will come back to broader issues in the budget to do with the NBN. (Time expired) would be beneficial, Mr Deputy Speaker, if we were to receive some detailed responses. We have lots of issues that we would like to go through. Whilst the minister has been giving us lots of wonderful detail about the budget papers, most of it I have read already. Perhaps we can take some of that material as read. Much was made ahead of the budget-especially by the minister the minister is representing, by the Treasurer and by the Prime Minister-about the toughness of this budget. In that regard I would like to refer the minister to the table on page 10-6 of Budget Paper No. 1. I would be grateful if the minister could explain why government spending, as a percentage of GDP, has been higher in every year of office of this government. The forward estimates in the budget papers show spending in the last year of the Howard government at 22.9 per cent of GDP and since that time, and all the way through to 2014-15, the best that happens is 23.5 per cent. There is a consistent pattern of a government that is claiming to bring down an extraordinarily tough budget, that is going to take pressure off small and medium business who are seeking finance, continuing to borrow $135 million every day and putting enormous pressure on others looking for finance. They are adding to interest rates, which is adding to exchange rate pressures and adding to the cost of taking out mortgages and getting finance. On all fronts the spending of this government is critical to economic outcomes and the cost of living pressures faced by households and the pressures faced by businesses, and yet the government, whilst talking about a tough budget, has laid out a four-year program which is still a country mile from spending levels, as a percentage of GDP, under the previous government. I would like to know why there has not been any effort to keep spending as a percentage of GDP below 2007-08 levels, as is the case with taxation receipts. The government has made a particular point about not going higher with taxation receipts than the previous government but, when it comes to spending, it sees no reason to make the same provision. This seems to be a significant inconsistency and I would appreciate an explanation for that. From the point of view of a tough budget and the difficulty being faced by many in the economy and the uncertainty that currently exists, the reason for that uncertainty is that people have gone from minus one per cent savings to 11Â½ per cent, so something close to $70 billion has not been spent this year that would have been spent in a typical year. It is no wonder the retail sector is on its knees. That is a function of uncertainty. People are anxious about what might lie ahead. Do we have some sort of satisfactory protection or resilience against future economic shocks? The structural deficit within the budget is a critical factor. Why has the government not featured the structural deficit estimates over future years?

Why, as distinct from 2009-10 when they were featured strongly, has the government not this year featured the structural deficit figures? (Time expired) Special Minister of State) (17:13): I thank the shadow minister for his question but it is almost as though he missed the fact that there was a global financial crisis. It is almost as though, in his commentary, he ignores the reality of government measures to support employment across the economy. Employment was under threat in every single sector, from retailing through to construction, through to the agricultural sector and in vehicle building-in every way our economy was threatened and so the government put in place measures in the third quarter of 2008 and throughout 2009. All were opposed by those opposite, and opposed for reasons entirely of basic politics. That means that the successful defence of jobs and the support of economic activity is due entirely to the quick action of the Australian government. It has been action roundly applauded both internationally and, most importantly, in local communities where jobs have been preserved, businesses have been kept intact and families have not been ripped apart by the devastating impact of high unemployment. I think it is also important that the shadow minister concedes that the current federal government has a lower, smaller taxation footprint than did its predecessor. Indeed, it is a proud tradition of the Australian Labor Party that we are not a high-taxing government, in comparison to the government that we replaced in 2007. The taxation of our community of course is the removal of funds from our community for use by government, and it is important that that footprint be proportionate and appropriate. It is revealed in the budget figures, as I am sure the shadow minister has fully understood and his reflections here demonstrate, that the low-taxing Australian government is able to do that because of both the efficiency of the way in which the Australian government spends money and the effectiveness of the way in which the Australian government raises its revenue. It is inevitably the case that because of that the massive measures that had to be undertaken to protect employment, to ensure that industries and commerce continued to operate throughout the tough and dark years and the very tough and dark weeks and months of the global financial crisis, could be supported by the rapid action of the Australian government. We also made clear that, as a consequence of the measures that we undertook, the government does see the budget moving into surplus. The government does see the importance of those measures. And the government, through its fiscal discipline, is moving to ensure that the budget returns to surplus as quickly as it possibly can. Why do we do that? We spend money when we have to and we do not spend money when we do not have to. We spend money in order to protect employment and to protect our community. As the honourable member well knows, we spent large amounts of that money building enduring community infrastructure: enduring infrastructure that will be used to educate future generations of Australians; enduring infrastructure that will provide hospitals and roads; enduring infrastructure-ports, rail infrastructure-to support economic activity. It was about providing infrastructure that will survive generations, but a decision which was taken in order to support employment, to support our economy and to support our community. You asked the question, quite reasonably: how is the government able to maintain its extremely low taxation footprint? The answer to that, very clearly, is through tough fiscal MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Bills

It is an astonishing performance, a remarkable performance, but one that we will continue. (Time expired) Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (17:18): I am aware that one of the big government initiatives is the National Broadband Network. It touches many portfolios. It touches the health portfolio, with the introduction of e-health. It touches the education portfolio, with some of the opportunities that will be happening there. It touches the small business portfolio, and in my own electorate I have seen various initiatives which will be enhanced greatly, including cyber wine-tasting across continents, across seas-tasting wine from McLaren Vale over in New York. My question to the minister is: could the minister outline some of the NBN related initiatives in his portfolio and some of the developments that are happening there? Special Minister of State) (17:19): I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I am not really sure how you do cyber wine-tasting. Ms RISHWORTH: It is pretty exciting. contemplating McLaren Vale shiraz, we would all prefer not to be doing it in a cyber way; we would prefer to be doing it in a real and genuine way. It is an important question to go to current initiatives in the budget that deal with the National Broadband Network. In particular there is funding provided for in the current budget through the Department of Finance and Deregulation to assist in the oversight of the new entity to manage the universal service obligation that comes with the National Broadband Network. On 20 June 2010 NBN Co. Ltd and Telstra announced an agreement and the rollout of the National Broadband Network. In support of that agreement the government announced policy reforms to support the transition to the National Broadband Network environment including the implementation of an institutional regulatory and funding regime for the delivery of the universal service obligation and other public interest services and that is what we dealt with in this budget. Earlier, on 10 February 2011, the government announced that it had reached an in-principle agreement with Telstra for the package of measures announced by the government in June 2010 to facilitate the transition to the National Broadband Network. These reforms included establishing the new entity which will function from July 2012 and to provide funding that will ensure that all Australians have reasonable access to a standard telephone service-the universal service obligation for voice telephony services-and ensure that pay phones are reasonably accessible to all Australians-the universal service obligation for pay phones. It will also include emergency call handling, the triple 0 and 112 numbers, and the national relay service. There will be migration of voice only customers to a fibre based service as Telstra's copper exchanges are decommissioned and the development of technological solutions for continuity of public interest services such as public alarm systems and traffic lights. There will be $1.2 million over five years provided to the Department of Finance and Deregulation to assist in managing the government oversight of the new entity that will be established to manage this universal service obligation.

264,Mr Gray,"AndI have to say that, I think like all of us present, especially whenGiven the government's significant financial investment in maintaining the continuity of voice services to Australians, appropriate oversight of this entity is required. Currently, no resources are provided for that function. The Department of Finance and Deregulation will provide advice to government on the governance structure of the new entity and monitoring of the ongoing strategy and performance of the entity including in relation to complex financial matters including the government's financial investment, the USO regulatory environment and related legislation, appointments and performance, stakeholder management between NBN Co. Ltd during the rollout of the National Broadband Network and with the broader telecommunications industry and other related matters. Those initiatives are part of the all-of-government response that embraces both the reality and the possibilities that are presented by NBN. We know the language and we are commonly understanding the language of government 2.0-it has been around for five or six years-and it denotes a kind of government that has as its hallmark the ability to reach out, the ability to listen to, the ability to insightfully interpret the communities that engage with it and importantly the ability to provide information to our citizens in a timely and efficient manner. That was never more poignantly demonstrated than during the emergencies that our country faced in January and February of this year. The developments in government 2.0 and in cloud computing simply allow the government to be more embracing of the communities that we represent and allow us to deliver in an effective and efficient way. With the development of the capacity represented by the NBN Co. and the requirement to attend to the universal service obligation facilities that we are commonly understanding are part of large and complex utilities then we can see that the all-of-government approach to supporting the activities of NBN Co. is underpinned by the work that is done in the department of the digital economy and also in the department of finance. (Time expired) spending performance. The minister spent most of his time debating previous budgets. I would be very happy to do that but the session is designed to debate, discuss and seek detail about the current budget. The current budget is struck in a climate where the terms of trade are at 140-year highs-not a bad climate in which to manage an economy. The current budget is struck at a time when we have a labour shortage with the changing demographics in the economy and the skills required for the mining sector, and an unemployment level just under five per cent. The point was made by the minister that they have had a very rigorous fiscal program, notwithstanding the global financial crisis. Given the fact that we are seeing terms of trade at 140-year highs and that those levels are expected to continue during the course of the next four years, how is it that the government appear incapable at the end of that four years to be within a bull's roar of the level of expenditure as a proportion of GDP that was brought down by the last government? That is question No. 1. Secondly, the minister said that the government is able to maintain its low-taxation footprint because of the extraordinary capabilities of the Treasurer and his colleagues. The fact is that the reason the government has been able to maintain taxation levels lower than the previous government is that it did not include major items in its budget. For instance, it did not include the carbon tax. Minister, why did the government not include the carbon tax as it did two years ago in its expenditure items? If it had done that, it would have grossly exceeded the taxation formula and percentage of GDP of the last government. MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Bills
265,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (17:24,"The last opportunity I had I asked about the government'sThe other point I would like to make is that the minister made absolutely no reference to the $107 billion debt. The fact of the matter is if you borrow like a wounded bull, you do not have to tax as much. Notwithstanding that, this government have brought in a carbon tax, a mining tax, a flood tax, a luxury car tax, a cigarette tax-taxes ad nauseam. They are a hightaxing government, but they have deferred taxation. When there is $107 billion debt that is deferred taxation-it will have to be paid off by taxation in the future. They are shifting the burden onto us, so that whenever we get the opportunity and privilege of government we will have to clean-up the mess they leave. Minister, why is this government not exercising the sort of restraint that would be considered in the middle of a 140-year high in terms of trade and in the middle of a world which is potentially likely to move into a double-dip recession? Why is the government not trying to protect and restore the resilience that this government inherited in terms of the economic conditions? Special Minister of State) (17:28): Today, Australia enjoys a taxation arrangement whereby the proportion of taxation paid by Australians is less than it was in the last year of the Howard government. It is a simple undeniable fact. It is something that the current government takes great pride in and something that the Australian community takes great relief from. AllI hear from members opposite is the preference to tax and to spend, which is something that Australians have never supported. Australians support governments that are capable of keeping their house in financial order and we have said and stated clearly that the budget will be in surplus in the time frame that we have described. We have stated clearly that our taxation footprint is smaller than at any year under the previous government and continues to be the case. Furthermore, we are able to do that because of the extraordinary measures which the government have been prepared to take to better frame our budget and our spending priorities. Mr Robb interjectingyet in place. I hear the member opposite lamenting that the tighter fiscal discipline executed by the current government ensured a capacity for our nation to better weather the global financial crisis, to be better positioned and better prepared for the recovery in Australia and to be better prepared and better able to deal with the terms of trade that we currently see. I thank the members for their questions and I take on notice those questions which I have indicated I will. I will come back to them in a timely fashion with answers to those matters.

In this context, the government's focus with this budget has been clear: to bring the budget back to surplus, to invest in skills and training and to get more Australians into work.

The budget expands our healthcare system, invests in infrastructure, makes regional Australia a better place to live and continues to assist families. In line with these strategies, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has 11 new measures in this budget, including the impact of the temporary increase in the efficiency dividend. Furthering our commitment to mental health, the government will provide $24.4 million over four years to establish Australia's first National Mental Health Commission. This is part of very large new funding for mental health services. The Gillard government is strongly committed to planning more effectively for the future mental health needs of our country, creating greater accountability and transparency in the mental health system and giving mental health prominence at a national level. The National Mental Health Commission will be established within the Prime Minister's portfolio and, through the Prime Minister, will report back to parliament, bringing a truly whole-of-government focus to the task of mental health reform. In addition to this significant new investment in mental health, this budget provides $6.5 million over four years to maintain support for the delivery of the Council of Australian Government's reform agenda-an important agenda which is aimed at improving the well-being of Australians now and into the future. This budget provides for a $5 million donation in 2010-11 to the New Zealand Red Cross earthquake appeal to help with the earthquake recovery effort. These funds are helping in the immediate recovery and in getting Christchurch back on its feet after one of New Zealand's darkest days. Indeed, we have had the opportunity this week, with the visit of New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his address to a joint sitting of both houses, to convey our direct sympathies to the people of New Zealand for the events of this year, which regrettably are continuing. This budget provides $2 million over three years to the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney to further inform policy discussions on Australia's alliance with the United States. The budget also provides for a departmental contribution of $168,000 over two years to fund the Commonwealth's involvement in the commission of inquiry into the Queensland floods. In the arts, this budget provides $1.6 million across the forward estimates for the Contemporary Music Touring Program to provide grants for professional artists to perform original contemporary Australian music in regional and remote Australia where this otherwise would be commercially unviable. In order to support this new investment, this budget will deliver savings of $1.6 million over four years from the GetReading! program by promoting books and reading in a more cost-effective way, including utilising digital technology and epublishing. This budget delivers on our election commitment to provide $10 million over five years in additional support for Australian artwork. In a significant contribution to Australian sport the government will provide up to $38 million to the organisation and staging of the 2015 Asian Football Confederation Asian Cup and to ensure the sustainability of football in the lead-up to the event. In addition, this budget provides some $4.6 million over five years to establish a task force to coordinate the Commonwealth's role in supporting the cup. The government will achieve further savings of $5.6 million over four years from 2010-11 from the testing and research components of the Illicit Drugs in Sport Program and the MAIN COMMITTEE research component of the Sport Anti-Doping Program. These savings will be redirected to support other government priorities such as the extension to the Active After-school Communities program. I commend the appropriation to the House. like to have some indication as to whether the parliamentary secretary is going to adopt the practice of the minister previously, which is: if he cannot give an answer to a question he continues to read out blurb from the budget papers, which in no way responds to the question asked and just takes up five minutes of time, or whether we can go to the practice that used to pertain in this consideration in detail-which, if you like, is more of an estimates hearing for the lower house-whereby we can ask a question, have it responded to and have a to-and-fro of information without someone from the government getting up and speaking for five minutes and then the minister taking another five minutes and wasting the entire period. resume her seat. I ask the member for Mackellar whether her question is to the chair or whether it is part of her five-minute consideration in detail to the parliamentary secretary? I think you are asking the question of me. Is that correct? think you would know what is in the mind of the parliamentary secretary. I am making the point that this whole process has really become something of a farce, which it never used to be before. It used to be used to elicit useful information and specific answers to questions. I might be kind to the parliamentary secretary and say that this was the practice that existed before he came to this place. It is a new and novel development that we are seeing here. With that prefix to my questions I will be interested to hear his response. The questions that I specifically would like answers to relate to the funding of a review of illegal boat arrivals and the Ombudsman. I notice in budget paper No. 2 in the Prime Minister and Cabinet section that $900,000 has been earmarked over two years to continue the Ombudsman's scrutiny of processing refugee claims for irregular maritime arrivals by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The budget paper claims that the funding will be used out of the Ombudsman's current resources. My first question that I would like a response to is: what duties will that mean that the Ombudsman cannot do that he would otherwise would have done with those resources, because $900,000 of his money has been earmarked for this specific purpose? My second question is: in 2007-08 there were 25 unauthorised arrivals. That was the result of our effective Pacific Solution policy, which of course was ended by the government in 2008 and the boat arrivals started to arrive. In 2009-10 there were 5,614 arrivals. If we start to see an increase, or the increase as we have seen continues, will the Ombudsman need more than $900,000 to fund these claims, and if he does will he be able to get that from an advance from the minister for finance or some other mechanism? My third question is: by giving this responsibility, to the Ombudsman, does this effectively amount to a vote of no confidence in the department of immigration which I note has had its numbers increased to carry out its tasks? My fourth question is: does the scrutiny process entail reviewing every single refugee application, or doing a random sample of applications? Is there an anticipated individual assessment cost for each inquiry it makes? A further question is, has the scrutiny which the Ombudsman has already carried out revealed an MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Bills

Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:40): IfI could first start with the procedural inquiry that was raised by the member for Mackellar. It was apparently some kind of expression of concern about the way in which the government here in the consideration in detail of appropriations is answering the questions. I listened intently to the previous consideration in detail over the hour that the Special Minister of State was answering questions posed by members of the opposition. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjectingvery clearly to opposition members in response to their questions that he would take on notice a range of the questions in respect of whichMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjectingdo me the same favour. I listened to the Special Minister of State taking on notice in saying he would get back honourable members in a timely fashion. That is how he ended his session here in consideration in detail. SoI can assure the member for Mackellar that certainly we will be answering questions, and indeed if the member for Mackellar had looked at Hansard, because she was not here yesterday, she would have seen that I was here in the consideration in detail of the appropriations for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency attending with the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Both of us answered questions and I think that were she to consult Hansard she would see that I indeed answered the opposition's questions from yesterday. Going to the question about the Ombudsman's $900,000 indicated for scrutiny of processing refugee claims, and the indication that he isMrs Bronwyn Bishop: No, asylum seeker claims. asylum seeker claims, which he is going to fund from current resources. With respect to the other questions that were directed to apparently additional unauthorised arrivals. CanI say that it is an excellent measure that the Ombudsman is now undertaking additional scrutiny for processing asylum seeker claims. Implied in the member for Mackellar's question is the suggestion that perhaps this scrutiny is not warranted. I can assure the House that this scrutiny is absolutely warranted, and it is reflective of much greater care in the way in which these asylum seeker claims are being handled, and indeed much greater care in the way in which the entire system is being run. I need only refer in that regard to the appalling compensation bill that the Commonwealth is still facing, arising from people, some of them Australian citizens, detained in the immigration detention system by the Howard government before August 2007. There is a budget item that relates to the compensation bill. It is now over $16 million and these cases, and the compensation provision that is having to be made, almost all relate to the 247 cases that were referred by the department to the Ombudsman following the Palmer inquiry and the Comrie report with such notorious cases as the case of Vivian Solon, falsely deported from Australia by the former government, or Cornelia Rau, improperly and illegally detained over MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Bills

The member for Mackellar was referring to the claim that in 2007 there were some 25 unauthorised arrivals, which of course is held out by the opposition as some claim to the success of their policies. It was no such thing. As I have just indicated, arising from the mismanagement of the immigration detention system, under the Howard government there were much larger numbers of people in immigration detention, an indication why we need to have scrutiny. We need the Ombudsman looking at these things. (Time expired) Parliamentary Secretary Dreyfus. I see that we are going to continue in this vein. I would ask you then the specific questions that I asked to be taken on notice and that you let me have them as soon as possible. I will try one more specific question. Considering the deal that your government is proposing with Malaysia, with the disgraceful trade in human flesh, whereby Australia sends one person to Malaysia to be either tagged or subject to Malaysian law and birchings, and we in return will receive five refugees who have been approved by the Malaysian government, does the $900 cover the costs of the Ombudsman scrutinising each one of those exchanges, those vile exchanges? If so, when will he be reporting upon them? Is that part of the government's overall plan? That is question No.1. Question No. 2 for this section. I want to now turn to the Australian National Audit Office where there is outlined an expenditure of nearly $2 million to be spent on conducting a financial statement audit of the National Broadband Network and the NBN Tasmania between 1 April 2011 and 30 October 2013. I note that there is no confidentiality clause in the contract despite the government repeatedly making the excuse that much of the NBN's activities are commercial-in-confidence and that any scrutiny of this $50 billion project is impossible. In light of those things, is the audit which is to be conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers a comprehensive audit and will its cover all income and expenditure aspects of the NBN and NBN Tasmania? That is question 2(a). Question 2(b) is: will the audited financial statement be published? 2(c), if so, how often will the audited financial statements be published and, if they are not to be published, why not? 2(d), how regularly will financial statements be audited and how often will the government receive audited financial statements from the auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers? Are you aware of any other companies who have been asked to conduct an audit of the NBN? And what audits of financial statements of the NBN had been conducted to date? At what cost would these audits have been done? Will the cost of the audit be included in the overall cost of the NBN, which, the best we can guess is likely to be $50 billion? They are very specific questions and if the parliamentary secretary is unable to answer those specific questions, I would simply ask him to take them on notice and reply in that way or, if he has specific information, I would very pleased to receive it. Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:49): They are very specific questions that have just been asked by the member for Mackellar.

Insofar as those questions relate to that statutory office holder, I will take them on notice as well. But the detailed questions that were asked about the NBN are misdirected and really need to be directed to the communications portfolio. I am sure that the member for Mackellar has means available in which she can so direct. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet does provide the Prime Minister with policy advice on matters that relate to the National Broadband Network, but the implementation of the National Broadband Network is the responsibility of NBN Co., its shareholder ministers and their respective departments, which are Senator Conroy and his Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and Senator Wong and her Department of Finance and Deregulation. It is the case that senior officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet attend the National Broadband Network implementation steering committee, which covers a range of departments. But the kind of detailed financial questions relating to the NBN really should be directed to the department of communications. To conclude-insofar as there is some information being sought in relation to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet appropriation-the government, through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, engaged the investment bank Greenhill Caliburn in November 2010 to review the NBN Co. corporate plan. The cost of that engagement was $1.1 million including GST, plus about $8,000 in expenses. The other question the member for Mackellar asked, as best as I understood it, was about the current status of the negotiations with Malaysia-with some quite pejorative and needlessly, but typically, inflammatory statements made about this area of policy which I do not accept for a moment. I need to make it clear that, in answering this question, I reject entirely the way in which it was framed and put and the language used by the member for Mackellar, including her use of the word 'disgraceful'. The only thing which is disgraceful about the discussion of the negotiations with Malaysia is the way in which the opposition is approaching this question. There are advanced negotiations with Malaysia and with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Those discussions are progressing well. The talks are being conducted in a spirit of great goodwill. It is a very detailed arrangement. It is very important that we get it right. As the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has said, further details will be announced in the coming weeks. Our government is committed to breaking the people smugglers business model and to deterring people from making dangerous sea journeys so that we will not have a repetition of the tragic event that occurred on Christmas Island late last year. While we are talking about 'disgraceful', what is actually disgraceful is that the member for Cook is now saying that he is going to visit Malaysia. It is apparent that the Leader of the Opposition is so worried that the arrangement with Malaysia is going to work and work well that he is sending the member for Cook for another stunt-another dumb stunt, I might sayMAIN COMMITTEE to Kuala Lumpur in a deliberate attempt to wreck the current negotiations, and, indeed, while they are about it, to wreck our relations with Malaysia. It is a disgraceful act. It is an incredibly destructive stunt by the opposition and it amazes me that anyone who is contending for national leadership in this country, as is the Leader of the Opposition, would authorise one of his spokespeople to go to one of our regional neighbours for this purpose. (Time expired) specific question relating to the disgraceful and despicable deal that his government is doing with Malaysia to trade in human flesh. I find the so-called solution absolutely reprehensible. I am astounded the parliamentary secretary can stand there and attempt to defend it. The very specific question I asked him was: can you tell me whether the Ombudsman, out of his $900,000, will be reviewing each of those transfers should the deal be completed so that we will know whether people have been tagged like cattle to be immune from birching or whether they will be subject to Malaysian law and subject to the birching that is part of that law? That was my specific question, and I note he failed to answer it. I now want to go to appointments to the Prime Minister's staff. I did ask some of these questions of the Special Minister of State, but he was unable to provide any information. We might get some from you. First of all, Amanda Lampe, who was the chief of staff to the Prime Minister, was farewelled with great parties in February but remained on the public payroll until, I understand, 3 June. Could the parliamentary secretary tell me, the rest of the parliament and the public generally why it was deemed necessary for there to be a four-month handover from Ms Lampe to Mr Hubbard, who had previously worked for the Prime Minister. Was it due to the incompetence of the Prime Minister that she needed two private secretaries? Was it the fact that Ms Lampe needed an income because she did not get the national secretary's job? You might then be able to confirm for me that she left the Public Service on 3 June and confirm for me that she has not been offered another position. My second set of questions relates to Mr Ken Henry. I did ask the minister whether Mr Henry had left the Public Service. I ask that as a very specific question. If he has left the Public Service, is there any policy in place that says someone who has left the Public Service may not be re-engaged on what used to be referred to as a Friday-to-Monday appointment, which was used by people who were under the old Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme? To maximise their return they must leave no later than being 54 years and 11 months of age. I notice that Mr Henry is about to turn 54. If Mr Henry is still a public servant, what is the nature of the leave that has been referred to in the newspaper? Is it leave without pay? Is he still being paid at the rate of $535,000 a year? If not, could you give me the details? What is the specific nature of the appointment by the Governor General under section 67 of the Constitution that requires this appointment to be made in this way? If you examine precedent, the sorts of people who are appointed by the Governor General usually have not included former heads of departments onto the staff of the Prime Minister. I note in the press that it has been said that he is neither a consultant nor an employee-it is a mystical appointment-but he will be supported by Prime Minister and Cabinet. I would be grateful for details of what that support entails and precisely what the nature of his duties will be. I also asked the minister when the appointment will be gazetted and why it has not already been gazetted. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Bills

IfI cannot have specific answers today, would the parliamentary secretary please take those questions on notice and give me specific answers as soon as possible. Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:59): I will start with Dr Ken Henry's appointment. The questions that I have just been asked seem to have been drawn from various instances of misreporting in the media. It has been made very clear that Dr Ken Henry AC has been appointed by the Governor General as a special adviser and his senior appointment was announced on 1 June 2011. The result of this appointment is that Dr Henry's extensive knowledge and experience are going to continue to be a valuable resource, and I am pleased that those skills are going to continue to be available to the Australian government. Dr Henry has had a very distinguished Public Service career which spanned more than 25 years, 10 of which were spent as the secretary to the Treasury. In that time Dr Henry has made major contributions to the well-being of Australians and to the prosperity of the nation, not least of which was the extraordinary, timely and invaluable advice he provided to the government with the onset of the global financial crisis. His appointment does not require a gazettal-there seems to be a misapprehension on the part of the member for Mackellar in that part of her question. He is appointed by the Governor General. He is presently being remunerated at secretary level, but he is expected to work part time and will be paid on a pro rata basis. I can point out that the most recent appointment under section 67 was that of Mr Fergus Ryan as strategic investment coordinator, and this expired in 2002. Other examples include Dr Paul Twomey as chief executive officer of the National Office for the Information Economy, Ms Gwenyth Andrews as chief executive of the Australian Greenhouse Office and Mr Michael Hutchinson as chief executive of the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology, all in 1998-these appointments were made by the Howard government. It is a process recognised under the Constitution and it should be a surprise to anyone here that the opposition were expressing concern about it. We have a distinguished Australian who has provided distinguished service to the nation. It is an excellent thing that Dr Henry is going to continue to be able to provide service to the people of Australia. Another question asked by the member for Mackellar related to the Prime Minister's former chief of staff Amanda Lampe. Again, as I indicated to the member for Mackellar in relation to some of her earlier questions, that question needs to be addressed to the finance portfolio, since prime ministerial staff are not paid out of the appropriation under consideration here for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It is the responsibility of the department of finance to operate the MOPS ministerial and parliamentary staff system. The other matter is one that the member for Mackellar pursued, using inappropriate language and the word 'disgraceful' in relation to present negotiations with Malaysia, and asserting that I had not answered her earlier question about whether the Ombudsman would be reviewing each possible transfer under the yet-to-be-concluded arrangements with Malaysia. The question that she actually asked when she first stood up to ask about the Malaysia arrangement was in relation to whether or not the government would be making public details of the arrangement, not the question that the member for Mackellar now asserts that I have not answered. Again, it is a question that is better directed to(Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Bills
279,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climatecontext of my question. My intent was clear to me; I am sorry it was not clear to you. But thank you for those answers. I will go again to the question of Dr Henry. You did not tell me whether or not he has left the Public Service or, if he has left, when he left. You said that he has been appointed as a special adviser, without saying to whom he is special adviser. You have said that he has been appointed to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and that is useful, but I would like to know the terms and conditions of his appointment. The parliamentary secretary has been at great pains to say that Dr Henry was a great public servant. In the eyes of many that may well have been true during much of his career, but at the end he certainly became very partisan. I am not at all surprised that he has been given this rather political appointment to take up advising the Prime MinisterMr Dreyfus: He was appointed by the Howard government. appointment, particularly since you have a Treasurer who is seen by the electorate as ineffectual and not across his portfolio at all. I can understand why you would want someone with more expertise around to give better advice. Nonetheless, I would like to know the terms and conditions of the appointment and why it was done under section 67 of the Constitution. There is no adequate reason. You made some comparisons and I can find you many other appointments made under section 67 of the Constitution, but I find it very difficult to find any precedent where a political appointment has been made, to assist the Prime Minister via the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, under section 67. All the other appointments are ones where there is a provision in legislation that the appointment be made under section 67. I saw an official shake his head, but if he can find an example and convey it to the parliamentary secretary of anyone who has been appointed under that section by the Governor General, as a political appointee, to assist the Prime Minister and advise the Prime Minister via the department, I would be very pleased to hear about it. Perhaps, when he is advising the parliamentary secretary on that issue, he could help him give the answer to what the terms and conditions are and what the job specification is for the position to which Mr Henry has been appointed. But I would particularly like to know whether he left the Public Service and is coming back as a contractor. Change and Energy Efficiency) (18:08): Dr Henry ended his appointment as Secretary to the Treasury on 26 April 2011 and he commenced in his new role as special adviser upon being appointed by the Governor General. His duties are to be determined in discussions with the Prime Minister. I need to make it as clear as I possibly can to the member for Mackellar that this is not a political appointment, that the government does not accept her characterisation of the appointment of Dr Henry under section 67 as a political appointment and, further, that the comments that the member for Mackellar has just made to this House-that Dr Henry, when he ended his distinguished career or apparently at some unspecified point towards the end of his distinguished career, became partisan-are a disgrace. That is a disgraceful comment to make. We have here, in Dr Henry, someone who has served our nation for 25 years, 10 of them spent as Secretary to the Treasury. He was of course appointed as Secretary to the Treasury by the Howard government. After taking a well-earned period of leave, he will MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Bills

I want to take further issue with the whole way in which the member for Mackellar has sought to characterise this appointment. A legion of appointments have been made by successive Australian governments, not only under section 67 but in a range of other ways, sometimes not even under statutory authority or specifically under a particular provision of the Constitution but under the executive power of the Commonwealth. It is open to a Commonwealth government to appoint anyone in any capacity to serve the government, and it would be a sorry day if it were otherwise. The government is entitled to engage the services of anyone to serve this nation if it is for the better government of the Commonwealth. It is not necessary to point to precedent. It is not necessary to point to anything other than the constitutional authority conferred on the government. Nor do we need to look for particular statutory authority because there is a whole range of conventions and institutions that serve the Commonwealth that nobody queries, other than those opposite, who wish to query governmental arrangements that they themselves have used on numerous occasions in government. They wish to challenge them because they are now in opposition and they wish to simply nit-pick or raise problems where none exist. It is entirely appropriate that Dr Ken Henry, a distinguished Australian appointed to his former post by the former government and having served Australia well over many years, should continue to provide service to the people of Australia. Insofar as there is anything left of the question by the member for Mackellar I will take it on notice and provide anything more that might be needed to answer her questions in a timely fashion. I would take issue also with her proposition that the examples that I gave of other appointments during the term of the former government, being Mr Fergus Ryan, Dr Paul Twomey, Ms Gwenyth Andrews, Mr Michael Hutchison, were not legislatively required to be made under section 67 of the Constitution. It is a facility put there when the Constitution was drafted in order to make it very clear that the Commonwealth will have at its disposal appropriate services of people with expertise, who could be employed in the manner envisaged by section 67 of the Constitution, as appointments of the Governor General. I reject on behalf of the government in the strongest possible terms the connotations which the member for Mackellar has sought to put on the engagement of Dr Henry or indeed the characterisation of his appointment by the member for Mackellar as a partisan or political appointment, which it is certainly not. the comments I made earlier and I would simply ask you again: is Mr Henry still a member of the public service? If not, when did he retire, what is his position and what are the terms and conditions of his appointment? How is it possible that the government can legitimately ask the Governor General to appoint Mr Henry at a salary of $535,000 a year without knowing what the job is? He is no longer a person employed as the head of a department where the salary of $535,000 is established by the Remuneration Tribunal. He is now someone who is merely being appointed to assist the Prime Minister with advice of a political nature and he is being paid at the same level as the head of Treasury. I think the Australian people are entitled to know why the appointment is being made with no terms and conditions, no understanding of what the contract is or what his responsibilities are. And how you can possibly justify him MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Bills
283,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (18:12,"Thank you for the rhetoric. I stand bybeing paid at the rate of the head of Treasury? I think it is an absolute disgrace but typical of the attitude of this government that thinks it can do anything in a panic to try and get some advice, which it thinks might help it out of a hole. If Mr Henry is still a member of the Public Service then I would like to know why he was not appointed in the ordinary way as a member of the executive service. Why was the decision taken to use section 67? Was it because this was the only way in which he could be paid this extraordinary amount of money, and otherwise he would be captured by a determination of the tribunal? The parliamentary secretary can sit there and smirk all he likes. The bottom line is that this is taxpayers' money. We heard from the shadow minister for finance today that we are in debt wholly and solely due to the incompetence of this government-and, I might add, under the watch of the same Mr Henry as the head of Treasury, who backed up the extraordinary expenditure. We have only to look at your track record. We have only to look at pink batts, the waste of money in the BER or the $900 that went out to dead people or to people who lived overseas, only for us to be told, 'Oh, this is all perfectly ordinary.' I asked you to give me one-just one-example of where anybody else had appointed a political appointee-that is, someone who was not part of a determination and was not someone like the sorts of people that you identified as being appointed quite properly under section 67. I asked you to give me one name of somebody who was appointed to a golden job with no job specification at $535,000 a year while still on leave, and you do not expect me to be outraged by that. Of course I am outraged by it. SoI ask you again: is he still a member of the Public Service? If not, when did he leave? What are the terms and conditions? When will we know the terms and conditions of this supposed job? How can you possibly justify that salary when there is no job for him to go to? And what are the terms and conditions of his leave? I simply sum up by saying that this epitomises the attitude that this government has to the people of Australia: you are totally unaccountable and totally without consideration of the way things should be done properly, whether it is sending people in a trade of human flesh to Malaysia to be subject to birching or to have a label attached to them like an animal, or the incompetence in putting any program in place.

285,To Go Back To The Questions About Dr Henry,"and I am glad the member for Mackellar isinvite the member for Mackellar to examine the history of section 67, what was said about it in the convention debates and why it appears in the Constitution. Section 67 has traditionally been used because there is no coverage in existing legislation for the manner of appointment of a whole range of people who provide service to the Commonwealth. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Just give me one political example. under section 67 of the constitution as in any way political. He is a distinguished Australian with immense expertise in Treasury matters, in fiscal matters and in economic matters who I am very pleased is going to continue to provide his services to our country. The member for Mackellar said that the Australian people are entitled to know. I think that the Australian people are entitled to know why it is that members of the opposition are in any way challenging the appointment of Dr Henry to the service of the Commonwealth, because the appointment of Dr Henry to the continuing service of the Commonwealth ensures that his abilities and his vast experience, recognised by the former government, are going to continue to be of service to our people. Section 67 is being used for Dr Henry because of the whole-ofgovernment nature of the policy advice that he is going to be able to give the Commonwealth. It goes well beyond anything that a conventional appointment under the Australian Public Service Act might encompass. Dr Henry will be advising the government on issues that are of a whole-of-government nature, and details of that, as I have indicated in my previous answer to the member for Mackellar, will be determined with the Prime Minister. It is bizarre that the member for Mackellar should suggest that there has been even the slightest lack of accountability in relation to the appointment of Dr Henry. If it was so unaccountable, why was it that there was an announcement of Dr Henry's appointment, along with a number of senior appointments that the Prime Minister announced on 1 June 2011? It is hardly an act of unaccountability to make an announcement of the appointment of someone under section 67 of the Constitution. I would ask again, and I think the Australian people are entitled to know, why it is that the opposition are so set on criticising absolutely every feature of the administration of the Commonwealth in talking down this country and the government that they cannot conceive that someone with as distinguished a career as Dr Henry could and indeed will provide continuing service to our country. Finally we had a reference from the member for Mackellar, who just cannot seem to leave it alone, to the negotiations that are ongoing with our neighbour Malaysia. For weeks now we have seen an attempt to destroy our relations with Malaysia and our government's work with our regional neighbours, something which the former government never did, in order to reach appropriate arrangements in relation to asylum seekers. Coming up now-and no doubt we will hear more about it-we have further destruction being planned by the member for Cook, who has been sent by the Leader of the Opposition to Kuala Lumpur. (Time expired) Malaysia was to specifically ask you whether or not the Ombudsman would be using part of his $900,000 earmarked money-which is not extra money but money taken away from other duties he might be doing-to make reports on each and every one of the disgraceful trades in human flesh of one asylum seeker going from Australia and our receiving five here in Australia.

I ask the parliamentary secretary to give me one name-just one-of any other political appointment or any appointment of a person to assist the Prime Minister out of a hole, which is exactly what this is. I can understand why the Prime Minister thinks she needs some additional advice, because she certainly cannot rely on the person who parades around as the Treasurer. She needs something to dig her out of the hole, so I can understand why they might seize on Mr Henry as being the answer.

Who wrote the brief for the Governor General? Who put together the information for her to make that appointment? I think that is a very important point to have on the public record. I repeat: how is it possible that you can ask the Governor General to appoint someone to a position of $535,000 a year with no job specification, no description of the duties they will have to carry out and no notification to the general public as to why it was necessary to have this very special method of appointment? I make the point that it is special. I asked you for one name of anybody who had been appointed to a political position like this and you cannot supply me with one. All the other people that you have given me the names of are perfectly ordinary appointments under section 67 and I am perfectly familiar with the operation of that. This is an exceptional appointment. You, Parliamentary Secretary, have admitted here today that there are no terms and conditions that have been established.

I would say to the member for Mackellar that I will take on notice her questions, although I do feel I have answered quite a number of them now more than once. I will take on notice those of her questions that have not yet been answered and respond in a timely fashion. I just want to make a point about the Ombudsman because, while attending the quorum call in the chamber, I have had occasion to reflect on the Ombudsman's position. It is a very curious thing that the member for Mackellar should be addressing questions to me about an independent statutory office holder. I know that those opposite do not have the same proper view of the independence of statutory office holders. It appears that the member for Mackellar has not read the Ombudsman's legislation, does not understand that the way in which the Ombudsman functions is to act on complaints and further that, insofar as there is any other jurisdiction available to him, it is a jurisdiction that he determines solely in his own absolute discretion as to how that discretion is to be exercised. The suggestion that I, appearing here in consideration in detail of the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, should be able to say or indeed that it would even be proper for me to say how the Ombudsman is going to carry out his statutory functions is frankly ridiculous. As to the continued appalling calling into question the excellent appointment of Dr Ken Henry, it is a sorry day that the opposition is seeking to deny to the Australian people the services of someone of the immense eminence and expertise of Dr Ken Henry, who I have no doubt could be commanding remuneration many times that which he is being provided from the public purse if he were to go into the private sector. We are all very well aware of the immense salaries that are being paid in the finance sector in Australia at the moment and indeed overseas, and the Australian people are being well served by obtaining the services of Dr Henry. Lastly-and I say again, I will take on notice the questions that have been addressed to me, insofar as they are proper questions, by the member for Mackellar.

Never forgetting his desire to fly, he commenced flying lessons and then transferred the Regular Army to undertake pilot training. In December 2009 he was posted to the 6th Aviation Regiment based out of Holsworthy. Lieutenant Case served his country with honour. His schoolmate at Xavier College said of his friend, 'There was no better person you could have wanting to represent this country.' Lieutenant Case served in a number of overseas deployments, including in Malaysia and East Timor, before his final deployment in Afghanistan.

He served our nation with great distinction, also, with Lieutenant Case, having served in East Timor and Afghanistan. The noble efforts of these two young men and their lives will not be forgotten. BeforeI close my contribution in this solemn debate, I want to reflect for a moment on one of the reasons we are in Afghanistan. I spoke earlier of Lieutenant Case's close family and the important role they played in his positive and happy upbringing, and note that he leaves behind two sisters, Jackie and Liz. Before the intervention in Afghanistan, it should be remembered that, under the Taliban regime, girls were not allowed to go to school. Women spent most of their time indoors and all women were forced to wear burkas, covering their heads, faces and bodies. But today, over 2.5 million Afghan women are receiving an education. Afghan women now serve in the country's parliament, they own their own small businesses and they work as teachers, lawyers, community health workers and even prosecutors. These advances in the lives of millions of Afghan women are thanks to the efforts of brave men like Lieutenant Marcus Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. Our nation will never forget their sacrifices. condolences to the family and friends of Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. I also wish to offer my condolences to the family and friends of Sergeant Brett Wood and Sapper Rohan Robinson. The Australian War Memorial is less than 4,000 metres from here. Etched on its walls are the names of 102,734 men and women who have laid down their lives in the service of our nation. Four more men now join this list and, like the names they join, each of these men has their own story, their own family and their own legacy that they leave behind. Sergeant Brett Wood lived an extraordinary life. He served across the world, in Bougainville, East Timor, Iraq and on three tours to Afghanistan. His many decorations speak of his courage, among them the Medal for Gallantry and a posthumously awarded United States Meritorious Service Medal. Brett was a commando, one of the Australian Army's most highly trained and important roles. He did that job since 1998. His 13 years in the special MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Condolences
299,Mr Clare (Blaxland,"Minister for Defence Materiel) (18:46): I rise to express myforces involved some of the most difficult and dangerous work that Australian forces have been asked to do. According to those who knew him well, he was not one to boast about it. At his funeral his wife, Elvie, said: To say Brett was humble is an understatement. He did not want to be defined by his achievements and introduced himself as just an ordinary guy. His most frequent expression was 'no big deal'. He was not an ordinary guy. He will be remembered as a decorated soldier, dedicated to the service of his country, and his death is a big deal for all Australians, as is the death of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. The photograph on our television sets and in our newspapers of Lance Corporal Jones, butcher's knife in hand and sharpening steel across his chest, tells us something very important. The work of our troops is not done just in the fields and in the mountains of Afghanistan; it is also done in the kitchens, the garages, the hospitals and the hangars, as well as at remote forward operating bases like FOB Mashal in the Chorah Valley where Lance Corporal Jones was killed. That he was taken from us by the actions of a rogue Afghan soldier makes his loss all the more painful and all the more difficult to accept. It is made no easier by the news yesterday of the death of that Afghan soldier who did this terrible act. The commander of Australian forces in the Middle East, Major General Angus Campbell, said: 'Lance Corporal Jones chose...to take the challenge of working in a patrol base and underwent additional weapons and other training to be part of the small, tight-knit teams that support our troops'. He said: 'the efforts of people like Lance Corporal Jones often go unrecognised, but they are much loved and respected for their contribution'. His efforts certainly do not go unrecognised in this place. They are appreciated. His sacrifice is remembered and his service is honoured by us all. In the words of Brigadier Mulhall, 'He was a bloody good soldier and bloody great cook,' and he will be remembered as such. Our thoughts are also with the family, the five brothers and sisters and the parents of Lieutenant Marcus Case, who was killed when the Chinook he was in crashed in Afghanistan last month. He was a young man who packed a lot of living into a very short life. Many soldiers aspire to be a special forces commando, some to be an army aviator. Lieutenant Case was both. He served as a commando on his first deployment to East Timor in 2007 and as an aviator on his deployment to Afghanistan. Between those two deployments he was involved in another very important mission; he was part of Operation Queensland Flood Assist in January this year, flying reconnaissance missions across affected areas in a Kiowa helicopter. No wonder his family was so proud of him. At his funeral his brother Chris said, 'We are thankful he was born into our family.' They said he had a heart of gold. He will be remembered as a soldier, a pilot, a mate and a son. We are all grateful for his service and our thoughts remain with his family. Finally, I take this opportunity to remember Sapper Rowan Robinson. As a sapper, he did one of the toughest jobs in Afghanistan, not only in combat construction, demolition and explosive work, but in all the other work of a soldier. Two weeks ago his unit uncovered one of the largest weapons caches found by the Australian Special Forces in Afghanistan this year. As they moved to the second part of the mission, Sapper Robinson was shot. He was providing covering fire for his mates. At his funeral, his father said, 'He was someone that others looked to when things got tough,' and you can understand why. His unit commander said this about Sapper Robinson: MAIN COMMITTEE He epitomised everything it means to be a special operations engineer â€¦ everything that one could be, he personified: bravery, mateship and a willingness to risk one's life so that others may live on. ... These were his qualities. He was a brave Australian soldier. He was also a son. I am told that, even while deployed in Afghanistan, Sapper Robinson organised to send his mum flowers on Mother's Day. We remember his commitment to his family alongside his commitment to his country. His father made this promise at his funeral: We will be there every Remembrance Day and ANZAC Day to honour you and your fallen mates, 'til the day we die. Sapper Robinson's family will not be alone. As a nation we will pause to remember Sapper Rowan Robinson every Remembrance Day and every ANZAC Day, just as we will remember Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case, Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, Sergeant Brett Wood and the other 23 who have fallen in Afghanistan whose names are inscribed on our hallowed Wall of Remembrance. In the space of four weeks, the loss of four young Australians forever lost has had an impact. Understandably it has caused some to question why we are in Afghanistan and how long we will remain. In these dark moments it is important to remember why we are in Afghanistan. We are there because it is in our national interest to be there. It is in our national interest to be there because the threat posed by an unstable Afghanistan reaches far beyond its own borders. It affects its neighbours; it affect us. We all remember where we were on September 11. We remember where we were when we heard about the Bali bombings. We also have to remember where these terrible acts were planned and who the men were that planned them. We are one of 48 countries contributing to the same effort under a mandate of the United Nations, and we are all there for the same reason-the threat posed to all countries by an Afghanistan where malign forces can take root again. As I said in the debate about our involvement in Afghanistan last year, we cannot pretend that what happens in Afghanistan does not affect us here in Australia; it does, and because it does it is right that we are there. That is why our troops are there today. That is why their work requires our support in good times and in bad. That is what these men whom we honour today would expect of us. Our responsibility is to be worthy of them and of their sacrifice and to honour their memories with deeds, not just words. Lest we forget. Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case. In paying my respects following their deaths, I acknowledge that their loss is supreme. The loss of any soldier is a tragedy, and to have lost two on a single day makes it all the more difficult. I offer my condolences to the families and friends of Lance Corporal Jones and Lieutenant Case. Lance Corporal Jones shares my son's name. His middle name, Gordon, was probably the name I wanted for my son's first name anyway. We are of course not related, but the name Jones is popular; Smith is common. Lance Corporal Jones was described by his family and those in the Defence Force as 'dependable, loyal, with a sense of humour that all who knew him enjoyed'. He took his role as a cook very seriously. He even used family recipes in his quest to provide only the best for his mates. He spent time in Townsville at the mighty 1RAR, and his time there makes his passing all the more personal for me and those in my electorate. MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Condolences
300,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (18:56,"I rise to speak to the condolence motion for LanceLieutenant Marcus Case was a motivated and talented 27-year-old pilot, known for his ability on the rugby field and especially for his love of flying. Those who worked with him spoke admirably of his ambition as an Army pilot, having embraced his new challenge of operating a remotely piloted aircraft with the RAAF. The men and women of the 5th Aviation Regiment, C Squadron, in Townsville have spoken to me about the dangers our Army pilots face and the skills they display in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Case's training was not in vain. Both soldiers were widely respected by their superiors and their peers, and they will be missed by their close family and friends. To lose a member of our Defence Force in the circumstances in which we lost Lance Corporal Jones is a travesty and an act of cowardice in the extreme. But we must not forget the important work that was being done by Lance Corporal Jones and others in the Mentoring Task Force in training Afghan soldiers. This role is crucial in creating an Afghanistan that is free of terrorism and for ensuring that Afghanistan does not again become the threat that it is today. Further, I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my support for our role in Afghanistan. Fighting terrorism at its source remains a vital mission in being a responsible player in the international community and, as we continue to make progress, the bravery of our fallen soldiers will not have been in vain. In offering my support to the troops in Afghanistan, I would like to make a special mention of the soldiers deployed there from Lavarack Barracks in Townsville. I recently had the honour of attending the farewell parade for 2RAR as they prepared for their deployment throughout Afghanistan to undertake their role in training Afghan soldiers and nationals in order to make that country a better place. I know that they have the support of the Townsville community and all Australians. When I say that we are behind our troops, the role that they are playing in helping Afghanistan towards being a better democratic country that values all its citizens equally, regardless of sex, religion or ethnicity, cannot be underestimated. To the family and friends of these brave soldiers: this tragic loss will not be forgotten and it will not be in vain as we continue in our fight against the threat of terrorism. It is cold comfort to any parent that they died bravely. No parent should ever have to bury a child. My heart and the hearts of all the ADF men and women, veterans and the people of Townsville extend to the families of Lance Corporal Jones and Lieutenant Case our deepest and most sincere sympathies. May they rest in peace. Lest we forget. and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (19:00): TodayI rise in this place to express my sympathy at the deaths of two fine Australian soldiers. Firstly, I would like to extend my sympathy at the death of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and express my condolences to his family. I was privileged to attend the funeral service for Corporal Jones as the acting Minister for Defence in Melbourne just recently. He was described as a dependable yet cheeky character by his family. He was a much loved son, brother and boyfriend who enjoyed his role in the Army and was an excellent soldier. Lance Corporal Andrew Jones was serving with the Force Support Unit when he was tragically killed on Monday, 30 May 2011 Afghanistan time.

301,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence ScienceCorporal Jones has been shot and killed in a coalition special forces operation in Khowst province. Lance Corporal Jones was born in Melbourne, Victoria in 1986. He was a young man. He joined the Army in 2004. He completed his initial employment training as a cook and was posted to the catering platoon of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. His was the first operational death in the Australian Army catering corps since Vietnam. In 2008 Lance Corporal Jones was posted to the 9th Force Support Battalion and deployed on his first operational deployment, Operation Astute, to East Timor in July 2008. He deployed on Operation Slipper in Afghanistan in November 2010. Lance Corporal Jones was admired by his mates within his unit not just for his great cooking but for the great soldier and man he was. His dedication to his role as a cook was second to none. I am told that he would always call on all his resources to provide the very best meals for his mates, including using his favourite family recipes. He was 25 at the time of his death-too early for such a vibrant, fun-loving man with so much to live for. Lance Corporal Jones was awarded the Australian Service Medal with clasp Timor-Leste and the Australian Defence Medal. At his ramp ceremony on Monday, 6 June in Melbourne, Lance Corporal Jones was posthumously presented with the Australian Active Service Medal with ICAT clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the NATO ISAF medal. As I said, as acting defence minister I was privileged to pay my respects to Lance Corporal Jones at his funeral service. At that service Brigadier David Mulhall, commander of the 17th Combat Services Support Brigade, described Lance Corporal Jones as a true gentleman, kind hearted and decent. Brigadier Mulhall also described the courage of Lance Corporal Jones. He said: Real courage is when you look at your family that you love, which is central to your being, and the girl you have fallen in love with and know that what you do is dangerous and there's a chance you won't come home. That is real courage. On behalf of the Australian government, I offer my support to Lance Corporal Jones's family and friends through this difficult time. I hope they are able to draw some comfort from the knowledge that they are in the thoughts and prayers of so many Australians who are grateful for their loved one's service to our nation. We humbly thank Lance Corporal Jones for his courage, his selflessness and the ultimate sacrifice he has made on our behalf. At this difficult time. I also remember the family and friends of Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case, who was killed on the same day as Lance Corporal Jones when an Australian Chinook helicopter crashed in Zabul Province, around 90 kilometres east of the Australian base at Tarin Kowt. I would like to offer my sympathy at the death of Lieutenant Marcus Case and express my deepest condolences to his parents and brothers and sisters, Robert, Michael, Jackie, Liz and Chris. His loss will be felt by his loved ones the most, but he will also be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues. Lieutenant Marcus Case was born in Melbourne, Victoria, in 1984. He enlisted in the Active Army Reserves in June 2002 and was posted to 5th/6th Royal Victorian Regiment. In 2003 Lieutenant Case commenced the commando selection and training process with 1st Commando Regiment, before being posted to 1st Commando Regiment and an operational tour to East Timor. In March 2008, Lieutenant Case transferred to the Australian Regular Army, undertaking pilot training at the Army Aviation Training Centre at Oakey. In MAIN COMMITTEE December 2009 he was posted to the 6th Aviation Regiment in Sydney. Lieutenant Case first deployed as an infantryman to Malaysia with Rifle Company Butterworth in 2005 and in January 2011 played a pivotal part as the Aviation Battle Group deployed to Queensland to provide assistance as part of the Australian Defence Force flood relief operation. Lieutenant Case's deployment to Afghanistan commenced in May of this year. He was taking part in a routine Task Force Thunder mission with the Rotary Wing Group when the aircrew of the Australian CH-47D Chinook were forced to make an uncontrolled landing. Lieutenant Case was killed in the incident and five other ADF personnel were wounded. My thoughts, as I am sure yours, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, also remain with the wounded and I wish them a speedy recovery. Over a period of eight years service in the Army, Lieutenant Case has been awarded the Australian Service Medal with Clasp Timor-Leste and the Australian Defence Medal. At his ramp ceremony in Melbourne on 6 June Lieutenant Case was posthumously presented with the Australian Active Service Medal with ICAT Clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the NATO ISAF Medal. Lieutenant Case was an accomplished Kiowa pilot and was taking on a new challenge of a different kind of flying, operating a remotely piloted aircraft with the Royal Australian Air Force. He was a loyal, reliable and very trusted member of his unit. Though he was quiet and reserved, he enjoyed a joke with his mates and was always the first among them to volunteer when work was required to be done. I also had the opportunity to pay my respects to Lieutenant Case at his funeral service, at which his brother Chris described him as 'a person of many colours and many layers', and one with a heart of gold. His brothers and sisters said that after the first five children their mother and father would keep trying for more until they got it right. They stopped with Marcus. He was described as a larrikin and as a ranga, as a kid who had thought he was born on a pirate ship, and as someone who was destined to become a pilot. As a close-knit family they were comforted to know that in death he was never alone, being accompanied all the way home to his family by a mate in Lieutenant Adrian Wilson. Brigadier Gregory Lawler, Commander of 16th Aviation Brigade, said Lieutenant Case was 'a man with a strong desire to fly, who would get himself into the cockpit no matter what'. The desire and his generosity of spirit was no more evident during Operation Queensland Flood Assist this year. Lieutenant Case was described as 'coming in to work off leave asking what he could do to assist and, as he had no flying clothing, squeezing into a mate's borrowed flying suit'. Lieutenant Case has brought honour to our nation, the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Army and, most especially, his family. He will be honoured by his colleagues. On behalf of the Australian government, I offer my prayers and support for Lieutenant Case's family and friends. I offer them my assurance that the sacrifice of this astounding young man, this outstanding young soldier, and all others serving their nation will be forever remembered. We will not forget him or Lance Corporal Jones. Lest we forget. condolence motion for Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case.

302,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong) (19:10,"It is with great sadness that I rise to speak on the Army soldier and Lieutenant Case in a Chinook helicopter crash, brought to 26 the number of Australian soldiers to tragically lose their lives on the battlefields of Afghanistan. These brave and committed men died defending Australia's security in this distant but critically important conflict. Afghanistan is at the front line in the war on terrorism, and the active service of our men and women in uniform has made and continues to make the lives of millions of Australians that much more safe. It is a sacrifice that a grateful nation will never forget. Lieutenant Case was only 27 years of age. He was based in Sydney with the 6th Aviation Regiment. He was born in Melbourne and went to school at Xavier in my electorate of Kooyong. Lieutenant Case enlisted in the active Army Reserve in 2002 and was posted to the 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. In 2003, he commenced commando selection and training, which included an operational tour to East Timor in 2007. He had also been deployed to Malaysia with Rifle Company Butterworth in 2005. Most recently, in January 2011, he was part of the ADF's flood relief operation in Queensland. Lieutenant Case, who was tragically killed on his first tour of Afghanistan, had been deployed there as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator. I attended the funeral of Lieutenant Case, with both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, at St Bede's Church only a few weeks ago. It was a very moving ceremony, with hundreds of Lieutenant Case's friends and colleagues coming to pay their respects to this very special young man and brilliant aviator. He was clearly much loved by his parents and five siblings. The speeches of his brothers and sisters gave us all an insight into this young man, who drew pictures of helicopters as a young schoolboy and wanted to do his bit to make the world a better place. In the words of his brother Chris: 'He knew his greatest weapon and shield was his mind. We are thankful he was born into our family.' He was also a brilliant sportsman, playing rugby abroad, and was a cherished and close friend to many. He will be sorely missed but will never be forgotten. Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, who was 25 years of age, was also from Melbourne and also on his first deployment to Afghanistan. He leaves behind his partner and his loving parents and two younger siblings. After joining the Army in 2004 and training as a cook, he was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, later moving to the 9th Force Support Battalion and then deploying to East Timor in 2008. He was deployed to Afghanistan in November 2010. Lance Corporal Jones was a skilled cook and a respected soldier. In the words of Brigadier David Mulhall, 'He was a bloody good soldier and a bloody great cook.' He was known for his selflessness and his commitment to others. Australia's military involvement in Afghanistan makes for a difficult time for our country, but having recently visited our soldiers in Oruzgan and Kandahar as part of a bipartisan parliamentary delegation I saw first-hand the important work they are doing in bringing security and stability to this war-torn country. It is a difficult mission, but they are making a real difference. More significantly yesterday, today and tomorrow are difficult times for the Jones and Case families. Their pain is felt by all Australians. We stand ready to support them in every way we can. They need to know that their sacrifice and that of their families is not in vain and will never be forgotten by a grateful nation. Lest we forget.

303,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"Chief Government Whip) (19:15): I join with the PrimeGordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case. Both died in separate incidents on 30 May this year while on operations in Afghanistan. Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones was from the 9th Force Support Battalion and was serving with the Force Support Unit in the Chora Valley, an area I know well. It is a shockingly rugged part of the world. He was an Army cook by trade and an Australian soldier by profession, on duty in uniform the day he died. Sadly, he was only 25 years old. Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case was a member of the Sydney based 6th Aviation Regiment. He began his training as a reservist and deferred his university studies to serve in the Army full-time. He trained as a commando, which is a great achievement, and was deployed to East Timor. Marcus then trained as a pilot and had deployed to Afghanistan as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator. He was taking part in a resupply sortie in southern Afghanistan when the helicopter in which he was being carried crashed. Again, very sadly, he was only 27 years of age. I did not know either of these very fine Australians but, like all those who have gone before them, it is easy for us to almost feel that we have known them. We know what they were and what they were doing, and we certainly know that they believed in what they were doing. It is a great constant in this conflict, and I am sure in conflicts before it, that while we mourn their lives very deeply we take some comfort, as do their families and their friends, because I have spoken with many of them on previous occasions. We know that they believed in what they were doing, they were committed to what they were doing and they knew all of the risks. Just as importantly, having very sadly attended a number of ramp ceremonies and military funerals, I know their families and loved ones supported them in what they were doing. Generally speaking, although I do not know the families on this occasion, soldiers have the support of their loved ones and their loved ones support what they are doing because they know that that is what they want to be doing. Soldiers who spend so much time training want to put that training into effect, and there is no better way to do so than in defence of their nation's interest. We are in Afghanistan for important reasons even though there seems to be some doubt in the public mind from time to time. The reality is that failed states pose a risk to countries like Australia and of course we know that many Australians who were killed in places like Bali and Jakarta were killed at the hands of people who had their training in Afghanistan. We have been there too long and we have lost too many young lives, but our mission remains an important one. Like the Prime Minister, I am very, very strongly of the view-as is the Chief of the Defence Force, who spoke quite strongly very recently at a press conference on the occasion of a death-that we need to stay and finish the task we have at hand. That immediate task of course, in addition to the disruption operations of our special forces is to train the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police to the point at which they are able to take care of their own security. When we have done so we should be in a position to bring our people home with our heads held high. There has been some speculation in recent days, and I suppose effectively confirmed by Secretary Gates of the United States that we are now going through a round of negotiations with the insurgents. I used to say when I was minister that there is a very big difference between negotiating with extremists and talking with moderates. The reality is that success in Afghanistan will not come by military means alone. It will only come when we have a MAIN COMMITTEE political settlement, and of course when we have sufficiently built the systems of governance and effectively built the economic infrastructure that will be required to make Afghanistan what I might describe as a normal country. But finish the job we must. We cannot allow 27 Australians who have given their lives in Afghanistan to have given their lives in vain. Again, when I have spoken with families in the past they have asked that of me and us collectivelythat is, do not let them down by not finishing the good work they began. I take this opportunity to thank families, friends and loved ones of these two very, very brave Australians for giving us their sons and for the sacrifices their sons made. And, of course, I take this opportunity to extend my own very, very deep sympathy to all those who have been affected by these two very great tragedies. defence minister, and other speakers that have made a contribution on the condolence motions for Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Case. When you look at photographs of these two soldiers, there is a temptation that you could view them with the detachment of not having personally known those two men. But as a former member of the Australian Regular Army, I can quite easily imagine the moment when these photographs were taken, and how proud they were of the recent medal presentation I suspect in the case of Lance Corporal Jones, and of recently having received his wings in the case of Lieutenant Case. You can also imagine how proud their families were for the achievements that these two fine young soldiers and for what they had done. When you look at the circumstances again, we think of Afghanistan and we think of the circumstances where most of our soldiers have died, under tragic circumstance of course, of improvised explosive devices, or the fire fights that are all part and parcel of armed conflict. When you think of that it is then hard to reconcile the fates of these two soldiers. I know that it was not that long ago, certainly in terms of the SAS's collective memory, that we have lost so many in the tragic Black Hawk crash. When we look at the case of Lieutenant Case losing his life in the crash of a Chinook helicopter, and the Afghan National Army soldier that killed Lance Corporal Jones, these are different circumstances then when you are not actually faced with that two-way fire fight, the improvised explosive device threat. To have lost two soldiers in these circumstances seems even more tragic than in the normal cases. But what I would say is that what we learn from this is that the profession of arms, the wearing of the uniform of the Australian Army, and in the case of the Air Force and Navy as well, it is a life of risk. It is a life where you open yourself to the possibilities of death and serious injury, and not just through the fire fights. The training, the activities that are undertaken and the way in which combat and military service is prosecuted open people to the risk of the worse case, the supreme sacrifice. So it is the case here. The death of Lance Corporal Jones, brutally and clearly without remorse, being shot down by a person that he thought he could trust, makes that betrayal even worse. And, whilst there might be some comfort for family that it would appear his killer has been brought to ultimate justice with his recent shooting, it is nevertheless a reminder to us of the threats that will always face our people. The Taliban are a brutal opposition. They are a people that have never added any value to the world. They have only ever been a negative influence for the people of Afghanistan-for the children, for the women and for the girls of Afghanistan. They have only ever been negative. As I have said, they have never added value. I suspect that, in the case of the MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Condolences

As for Lieutenant Case, Australia is no stranger to our soldiers losing their lives in aviation accidents. We have had the Black Hawk crash in the past that killed so many of our finest SAS soldiers, and we have had other military aviation accidents as well. It is an unfortunate part of operations, and in operating these sorts of aircraft there is a greater level of risk. I guess in many ways it is cold comfort to the families that their loved ones were taken in these circumstances. But we must never forget that they were there in Afghanistan doing what had to be done, and that is what we should be concentrating on. That is what the families should be concentrating on. Regardless of the circumstances, these guys, these soldiers believed in the mission they were a part of and they believed that there will be a better world and a better Afghanistan for the fact that they were there. Despite what happened and despite the way in which they lost their lives, they have done great service for the people of Afghanistan and of course for the national interest of our great country. SoI pay tribute to Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and I have paid tribute to Lieutenant Marcus Case. Their lives were not in vain.

We on this side of the House understand that high-quality intelligence is arguably more important to government now than at any time since World War II. Global terrorism has transformed Australia's perceptions of its security, and intelligence is a key facet in Australia's response to this changed environment. Since September 2001 the coalition government provided over $10.4 billion of funding to 2010-11 to enhance Australia's national security and counterterrorism by increasing the capacity of our intelligence agencies and also by boosting Australia's aviation, maritime and border security. I want to say at the outset that I am a supporter of our Australian intelligence services. They need tools in place so they can conduct their business efficiently and properly, and we need to provide them with these tools. Unfortunately, the Gillard Labor government's most recent budget was a blow for our intelligence and national security community. Labor's latest budget revealed that Labor is going to waste $1.75 billion in taxpayers' money on the blowout in the immigration detention program, but in the meantime the Gillard Labor government has slashed Australia's national security and border protection budgets to pay for its costly immigration and border protection disaster. Labor cut $6.9 million in funding to ASIO for its security checks for protection visa applicants. They have made this funding cut at a time when ASIO is under increasing pressure to pump through vast numbers of those security checks for those who have come to Australia illegally via boat. ASIO has also had funding cut for training overseas liaisons, to the tune of $8.8 million in slashed funds. ASIO was not the only national security agency that was targeted by this Labor government for cuts to help their budget bottom line. The Australian Federal Police were also badly affected by Labor's mismanagement of our national security. Labor cut funds to the AFP and also cut 72 of their staff. Considering the work the AFP do with counterterrorism and cybersecurity, in conjunction with our intelligence agencies, it raises grave concerns about how Labor is managing Australia's national security. I now turn to the specifics of the bill. As outlined in the bill's explanatory memorandum, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 to provide the inspector-general with capacity to undertake own-motion preliminary MAIN COMMITTEE",205,Bills

312,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (19:35,"by leave-I rise to speak on the Inspector-General ofinquiries and extend the capacity for own-motion full inquiries; to permit the delegation of the powers of the office of the inspector-general subject to ministerial approval; and to permit the inspector-general to release material to royal commissions at the discretion of the government of the day. The bill will also make a small number of technical amendments. As a background to the amendments in this bill, it is important to note that the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security was created in response to the 1983 Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, known as the Hope royal commission, to provide for oversight and review of the intelligence and security agencies, of which there are now six. The six are the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate and the Office of National Assessments. As the act now stands, it allows the inspector-general to undertake preliminary inquiries, but only when a complaint is made to the office. Where an allegation is made but there has been no complaint to the office, the only formal option for examination of the matter is to commence a full inquiry. There is also an apparent anomaly in the act. The inspector-general can conduct an inquiry on his or her own motion into the activities of the Office of National Assessments, ASIO and DIO but has no such capacity in regard to the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, DSD or ASIS. Presently, the act also permits the inspector-general to provide to the Prime Minister a copy of any report covering the ONA but not the other five agencies within the inspector-general's jurisdiction. As the act presently stands, it does not provide for any power of delegation. All the powers of the office must be exercised personally. This limits the number of inquiries that can be conducted at any one time on top of the inspection and complaint handling functions. The provisions of the act relating to secrecy are intended to prevent court proceedings becoming an indirect channel for the disclosure of information and documents gathered as a result of the complete access to which the inspector-general is entitled. However, there are likely to be instances where the inspector-general could assist the work of a royal commission. The bill will make provision for regulations for a commission to seek such evidence. The inspector-general will not, however, be obligated to give evidence at the request of any royal commission. In concluding, I would like to draw attention to the matter that the honourable member for Berowra brought up in the House yesterday when reporting on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Following on from the comments I made earlier, I would also like to endorse the comments made by the member for Berowra about the serious impact of Labor's efficiency dividends and budget cuts to our national security and intelligence agencies. The need for intelligence agencies has in no way been diminished and we live in an increasingly uncertain world. Their workload is growing, especially in relation to counter-espionage and cyberterrorism with increasing worldwide threats to our national interest. The impact of efficiency dividends is likely to weaken the ongoing effectiveness and the capacity of these intelligence organisations which we on this side of the House have been trying to develop. The coalition believe the intelligence community should be adequately resourced at a time when it is facing increasing challenges. The coalition support the passage of this legislation through the House. However, it reserves the right to move amendments in MAIN COMMITTEE the Senate, pending the report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is due to report on 7 July. I will end as I began: we live in an increasingly uncertain world and the roles of our intelligence agencies remain very important in keeping Australia safe from myriad threats that we face in the national security environment. It is very important that the legislative basis for the actions of that intelligence community keeps pace with these changes and the opposition therefore support the passage of this bill, although with the caveat that we will be interested in the report from the relevant Senate committee and we reserve our right to make amendments on that basis. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (19:43): by leave-Much has happened in the world in the more than 20 years since the creation of the inspector-general, which I understand was originally set up in response to the 1983 royal commission on intelligence and security. The world of 1983 is very different from the world that we see ourselves in today. In 1983, the Soviet Union was still in existence and our security and intelligence services continued to view the world through the prism of the Cold War. However, much has changed since that time. The Berlin Wall has fallen and the Soviet Union has broken apart. The security concerns of a generation ago seem now a distant memory and the security and intelligence concerns of today are more dynamic and complicated than the world of the Cold War. We have seen the rise of asymmetrical warfare. We have seen the rise of non-state players. We have seen the rise of Asia and in particular China. We have seen instability in our region. But perhaps, most importantly, we have been witness to the tragic events of September 11 2001 and the rise of Islamist terrorist organisations. The events of that day brought into stark reality the presence of not only a new threat to Australia's interests overseas but also a very real threat to the physical safety of Australians domestically and abroad. We have seen this with the Bali bombings and the attacks on hotels and our embassy in Jakarta. At home we have seen our security and intelligence services foil plans to attack military and civilian facilities. These events, both tragic and alarming, underscore the very real impacts of these new world threats on our way of life. Apart from the change in the types of threats facing Australia, the world has also seen great technological change. In 1983 when the royal commission took place, who could have imagined the changes that we have now seen in technology, especially with the internet and social media. I was in India in 1996, and the internet had just actually hit the streets. I think that I was one of about 120 people in New Delhi, which is a city of some 20 million, using the internet. So we look at the changes that have taken place in just that time. The use of the internet has been of particular use to al-Qaeda in its recruitment and propaganda. As the Director-General of Security noted in his statement to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee: The internet helps al-Qaeda in its task. It is both a propaganda and a recruitment tool. It provides terrorists with both a platform to support operational activity and the means through which to project their ideology onto the international stage. The dissemination of violent extremist ideology through the internet poses the very real danger of drawing individuals down the path of radicalisation. The new threats and the new technologies serve to highlight the importance of having a wellresourced and supported intelligence apparatus. The potential danger and tragedy that could result from not having one is too great. I believe very firmly that the only reason we have MAIN COMMITTEE been spared the experience of a London bombing or a September 11 is because of the great work of ASIO and its sister agencies. However, it is a constant battle and one with the consequence of failure being very high. That is why this government has invested in increasing the capabilities and capacity of our security service. In addition, I think these organisations do great work. I have had some dealings-both as a member of parliament and in my former life as someone who was with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and who consulted with the Department of Defence for 10 yearswith those people who work in the intelligence community. The work of the staff in our intelligence agencies, by its nature, goes largely unsung. Unlike other public servants who can at least see or speak about the fruits of their work in the world, the members of these agencies must be silent and largely unseen. It has often been said that the success of the intelligence agencies is usually measured by the things that do not happen-the terrorist attacks prevented and the assassinations that never took place. Thus, it is very easy for us to take their work for granted and possibly, in extreme cases, even claim that they serve no purpose. But we should avoid such simplistic analysis. However, that is not to say that the intelligence services should be given an entirely free hand in what they do. There are obvious and at times well-founded concerns about the accountability and probity of intelligence services. The concerns are perhaps more relevant given that this parliament has in the past consented to the passage of new laws and regulations which, in the case of security related offences, provide the justice authorities and intelligence services with greater powers and flexibility than would apply in the usual criminal cases. Our intelligence services are today armed and empowered to a much greater degree than ever before. Their capacity to gather information, and therefore their implied capacity to infringe on civil liberties, has never been greater. While this expansion in capacity is to the credit of the government-for it would be shirking its duty to defend the country if it did not do what it thought was necessary-we must consider the protection of the individual's liberty as well as their safety. I believe it is critical that whenever the state takes on new powers over the individual there must be built-in processes and protocols that ensure these new powers cannot be abused. It is in this light that we should consider this bill, for this bill is about oversight and scrutiny of the intelligence services. It is a true mark of a mature, liberal democracy that it can maintain and support effective covert intelligence services while at the same time ensure that the powers held by these services cannot be abused or used to infringe upon the liberties of its citizens. In this light, I would also like to recognise the work done by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and her staff in ensuring that our intelligence community are true servants of the Australian community and not their own. The inspector-general of intelligence has oversight of ASIO and ASIS as well as the Defence Imagery and Geo-spatial Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate, the Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation. The inspector-general of intelligence has the responsibility to review and, where necessary, investigate the intelligence services to ensure their activities comply with ministerial direction and legislative requirements and with respect for human rights. The IGIS does so independently, with a capacity to generate their own investigations as well as in response to ministers and the public. MAIN COMMITTEE The amendments before this House today are designed to update and modernise this legislation to address issues that have become evident over time. This bill will ensure that the essential work of the inspector-general is carried out efficiently and effectively and will strengthen the accountability and oversight of the Australian intelligence community. The amendments in this bill expressly recognise the role of the inspector-general in assisting the government in providing the parliament and the public with assurances that the intelligence community is subject to scrutiny and is using its powers in accordance with law. It also strengthens the capacity of the IGIS to undertake its own-motion preliminary and full inquiries, provides for the ability to delegate the power of the office with ministerial approval and, as well, provides the IGIS with the capacity to release material to assist royal commissions. It is a cliche, but true, that the price of democracy is eternal vigilance. I firmly believe that this includes appropriate and robust oversight of our intelligence community. This robust oversight is the reason the Australian public has such support for our intelligence services. This very oversight is the difference between a police state and a modern, liberal democracy. I commend the government for its commitment to national security as well as for its commitment to ensuring that our intelligence services are acting with integrity and propriety. I commend the bill to the House. on the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2011. I rise simply to record a series of what I regard as concerns merely with what could be seen as some of the acts that this bill is seeking to change. The member for Canberra referred to modernising, and I do not think anybody has a problem with modernising, but my concerns are with some of the powers within this bill that we are discussing today. It is important to note at this juncture that we have referred the matter to a Senate committee, and I think that is probably a wise decision in relation to the power to delegate. The office of the IGIS was created in 1983 and there are now six intelligence agencies in Australia. The IGIS was set up to provide an oversight and review, and I think the member for Canberra makes an important point about having sufficient oversight and review functions of such important agencies in a liberal democracy. I want to record my support of those six agencies and the work that they do on behalf of our nation. Intelligence and the gathering of it is, by necessity, a secret business; nonetheless, I regard it as fundamental for our nation's security and its future. The act currently allows IGIS to undertake preliminary inquiries, but only when a complaint is made to its office. Where an allegation is made but there has been no complaint to the office, the only formal option for examination of the matter is to commence a full inquiry. There is also an apparent anomaly in this act in that IGIS can only conduct an inquiry on its own into the activities of agencies such as the ONA, ASIO and DIO but has no capacity in regard to DIGO, the Defence Signals Directorate or ASIS. That is an anomaly that does need to be corrected. I think that is a valid and important modernisation of this act. The act also permits IGIS to provide the Prime Minister a copy of any report covering ONA but not the other five agencies. There are plenty of discrepancies within this current act that certainly do need modernising and these amendments from the government are to be welcomed and bring us into line with what you would regard as a common-sense approach for this particularly important agency. MAIN COMMITTEE",206,Bills
313,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (19:53,"by leave-I thank the House for the opportunity to speakAt present the act does not provide for any power of delegation. I think this is where as an opposition we have a concern. If you are proposing a power of delegation, that should be the subject of sufficient scrutiny and review to ensure that we are not giving extra power or additional ability that we may not ordinarily grant as a parliament to such agencies. There is very sensitive information that IGIS is able to gather and that needs to be closely held. The ability to delegate is probably something that should have a very rigorous examination by Senate committee. The act also confers strong coercive powers on IGIS, which should not be allowed to proliferate. Those coercive powers in relation to calling witnesses and bringing people to provide evidence or information are very serious. It is the role of government to hold an exclusive monopoly on the right to use force and we allow agencies, particularly police and intelligence services, to use it on our behalf. They have to be subject to the appropriate protection and scrutiny for all citizens. This is a valid consideration that the opposition has in terms of ensuring that this is given broad scrutiny. That is why we have foreshadowed that we do not oppose this bill as it is currently drafted, but there could be potential amendments following an examination by the Senate committee. I think it is important that that consideration is given, particularly in regard to these powers of delegation. I do not really have a lot of other objections or things I would like to comment on in relation to this bill. I note the submissions and concerns that will be provided to the Senate committee will deal with many of these provisions. There are some concerns from the Law Council of Australia. While I may not always agree with the Law Council of Australia, I think it is proper that they have the opportunity, as do other concerned stakeholders, to put their concerns to a properly comprised Senate committee where we can consider the scope for any further amendments to this act and to the provisions of the amendment bill before us today. While not opposing anything in particular, in fact there are some worthwhile provisions in this bill, it is important that it have rigorous scrutiny and that people be given the opportunity to make submissions on potential further amendments to this legislation. Special Minister of State) (19:58): I rise to close the debate on this important bill. These are the first amendments to this act since 1983. I commend the bill to the House and thank the honourable members for their contribution in this debate. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

314,Mr Gray (Brand,"Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity andForeign Affairs and Trade: Officials for Emergencies (Question No. 337) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 24 March 2011: How many departmental officials were reassigned to other duties to assist with managing the emergency in (a) Egypt, (b) Libya, (c) Christchurch, and (d) Japan, and what is the usual position of each of these officials. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable memberâ€™s question is as follows: (a) A total of 298 officers were reassigned duties at various times during the period of the crisis to assist with the departmentâ€™s response to the events in Egypt. Officers in Canberra who assisted with managing the emergency response to the events in Egypt were re-assigned from geographic, multilateral, trade and corporate divisions in the department. Officers who undertook short-term missions to Egypt deployed from Canberra or from posts in the Middle East, Africa or Europe. (b) and (c) The emergencies in New Zealand and Libya occurred at approximately the same time. A total of 323 officers were reassigned duties at various times during the period of the crises to assist with managing these emergencies. Officers in Canberra who assisted with managing the emergency responses to the events in Libya and New Zealand were re-assigned from geographic, multilateral, trade and corporate divisions in the department. Officers who undertook short-term missions to New Zealand deployed from Canberra, and the officers who deployed to Libya deployed from regional posts in the Middle East. (d) A total of 410 departmental officers were reassigned duties at various times during the period of the crisis to assist with the departmentâ€™s response to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Officers in Canberra who assisted with managing the emergency response to the events in Japan were re-assigned from geographic, multilateral, trade and corporate divisions in the department. Officers who undertook short-term missions to Japan deployed from Canberra or from posts in the Asia-Pacific region. Agricultural and Horticultural Apprenticeships (Question No. 375) Mr John Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 23 May 2011: Why are agricultural and horticultural apprenticeships excluded from the governmentâ€™s commitment to increase support for trade apprentices in critical trades, despite the severe skills shortage in agriculture caused by the drain of skills workers to the mining sector. Mr Crean: The Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable memberâ€™s question: The Gillard Government is committed to building Australiaâ€™s future workforce. As part of this commitment, the tax exempt Tools for Your Trade payments available to eligible apprentices were increased from 1 January 2011 to provide up to $5,500 per apprentice over the duration of their apprenticeship. The Tools for Your Trade payments are available to eligible Australian Apprentices in critical or skills shortage occupations, including shearing, tree surgery and landscape gardening. These payments have also been extended to other Certificate II, III and IV Australian Apprenticeships in an agricultural occupation, and if in rural and regional Australia, a horticultural occupation. In addition to commencement and completion incentives totalling up to $4,000, employers of agricultural and horticultural Australian Apprentices in skills shortage occupations may be eligible to receive a special rural and regional commencement incentive of $1,000. Employers of eligible Certificate II Australian Apprentices in declared drought areas may also receive special drought area incentives totalling up to $3,000.",211,Bills
