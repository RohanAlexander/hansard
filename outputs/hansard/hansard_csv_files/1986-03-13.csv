The Minister does not want to have to stand up to a handful of people in the sun and we should be encouraging them. But has the Government endorsed what has happened at outside an abattoir or to provide a service for which the industry is paying 50 per cent of the Mudginberri?

However, there are countervailing tendencies, even within prive people from other countries of their Europe, which exacerbate the whole problem of dual nationality, the act of renunciation can be an nationality. An example is the French Nationality Law empty gesture, albeit an important symbolic act. of January 1973. Under prior French domestic law, a Those countries which acknowledge, along with person forfeited his French citizenship' if he became Australia, single nationality, could accept the naturalised in another country. France therefore appeared to uphold the principle of single nationality. The adoption of Australian citizenship as an autonew Law provides that on naturalisation elsewhere a matic declaration of renunciation of their former person does not lose his French nationality unless he citizenship. Moreover, for some countries this makes 'express declaration to that effect: but a man renunciation does not remove such a person's under 35 may not thus renounce his French nationality citizenship. until he has satisfied, or been exempted from, his obligations of military service. This Law is expressed to be I was going to talk about the importance of subject to France's obligations under the European Conthe citizenship ceremonies in my electorate and vention, and the combined effect of the two is: if a how I enjoy attending them, but I have been French citizen becomes naturalised in one of the other countries which has ratified the European Convention, asked to speak for only 10 minutes and I will he loses his French nationality automatically: if, howdo that, except to make one comment about a ever, the same Citizen is naturalised in any other country matter raised by the honourable member for in the world (including Australia)Chifley( Mr Price). He said that those who this would include our former Frenchmanswear an oath of allegiance are given a Bible and he recommended that they read it. I endorse he may continue 'to retain his French nationality, or may indeed be prevented from losing it. Thus, in relathat for all those Christians who take out Austion to all countries outside Europe, France has taken tralian citizenship. However, I am disappointed the step of increasing the incidence of dual nationality. that we do not do at citizenship ceremonies what we do when we enter this Parliament as new We can see that, should an Australian citizen members and have those who take the affirmareturn to the country of second nationality, the Australian Government has no legal authority to tion and the oath stand side by side.

I finally say thank you to the people behind It is that removal that causes me a great deal of the scenes, particularly Mr George Mohren from concern. I feel strongly that the removal of the the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Afrequirement upon candidates to state their name fairs, who has been at nearly all the citizenship in full at the commencement of the oath or ceremonies in my electorate to make sure that affirmation is totally unnecessary and has been things go smoothly.
