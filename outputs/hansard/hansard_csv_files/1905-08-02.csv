The report says, "" Mr Deakin,"" declared Mr Skene, ""tried follows:the Government before a packed jury of his own political supporters, and he decided not only to move that amendment, but to go to the Labour Party and break up the coalition."" "" When do you say he did that ? "" asked Mr Page, to which Mr Skene answered, "" Before the delivery of the Governor General's speech, and at 7 o'clock on the same evening."" I had no intention to question, in any way whatever, the Prime Minister's conduct prior to the reading of the Governor General's speech, and I should like now to put myiself right by reading the Hansard report of what I said But what did the Prime Minister do? He called together his own immediate supporters, and tried the Government before a packed jury consisting of ten honourable members, including himself. He then decided to move his amendment, and not only so, but to go to the leader of the Labour Party and enter into an arrangement with him which would have the effect of smashing the coalition.

I think it is highly desirable .that a f u l l majority of the House should assent to the Chairman of Committees selected, because after all that officer has a great deal of work to do, and it is highly -desirable that no small clique or combination of cliques should be enabled to elect .anybody they may choose.

""in movingThat Mr Charles Carty Salmon be appointed Chairman of Committees. As I understand that there is to be some -slight opposition to his re-election upon the present occasion, I propose to give a reason -or two which I think should influence the House in favour of his selection. It may -seem rather strange that I-who , during the greater portion of the present Parliament have occupied a seat upon the opposite side of the Chamber to the honourable member for Laanecoorie-shoul d be found proposing his re-election to the office of Chairman of Committees. In this matter, however, I am following constitutional principle rather than party allegiance or personal friendship. acting is that which should be f o l lowed in electing not only the Chairprinciple of selecting always the retiring officer, if he has given to the House or Committee discreet, able, and impartial service. Under these circumstances I ask that reasons should be given to me why the retiring Chairman of Committees, who is the candidate that I ""am now nominating, should not be re-elected. I need only poirif to the splendid precedent which has been set in this connection by the House of Commons, where although Conservative Governments have held office for a number of years, the last six Speakers have been Liberals. I have, therefore, to look further to ascertain to' what cause opposition to the honourable member's re-election can be attributed. The first reason for that opposition is to be found in the fact that upon a certain occasion the honourable member for Laanecoorie exercised his vote against a Government. I submit that that is no reason why the election of any Chairman of Committees should be opposed. It is a very unfortunate circumstance, no doubt, but there are occasions when the ChairmarioOf Committees is called upon to exercise his vote. Very often he may not desire to take any side, but it becomes absolutely necessary for him to do so. Of course in this House it is unnecessary for Mr Speaker to vote, but the Chairman When notice has been of Committees is sometimes bound to vote, and the honourable member for Laanecoorie did so. I would further point out that he is responsible purely to his constituents and to his own convictions for whatever vote he gave. For anybody to attempt to punish the retiring Chairman of Committees simply because he cast a certain vote upon a certain occasion is scarcely a proper proceeding. sinuation to make. that any body of men should entertain that view. view ? tained it, I shall be all the better pleased. sinuation when there is no proof of it ? that view, I shall be all the better pleased, and therefore I urge that more substantial reasons should be advanced why the retiring Chairman should not be re-elected. I The principle upon which I am am aware of one reason which has been urged in favour of another oandidate being brought forward. Under ordinary circumstances, I should have voted for that candidate, because I have been sitting with him for a long, time past, and he has my personal respect.

Unfortunately, however, he was not present-no t through any fault of the honourable member for Laanecoorie, or of this House, or of his own. Consequently, it becomes my duty to propose the re-election of his successor, who is the retiring candidate, and I hope that he will be re-elected. I trust that this House will act upon the principles which have guided it in the past, and not allow any honourable member to be punished by refusing to re-elect Him when he has shown himself in this House to be fair, impartial, and able in every direction.

I regret that charges have been made against those who favour the selection of the honourable member for Riverina. It is not because of any decision on the part of the late Chairman of Committees that I submit the name of the honourable member, but I do so merely because he was the previous occupant of that office. He was defeated at the last election, not through any fault of his own, but through the error of an officer who was responsible to this Parliament. To a certain extent, therefore, it was the fault of Parliament itself that he was not here when the Chairman of Committees was elected. Consequently, I maintain that he has a prior claim to the position, and, seeing that whilst he occupied the office he gave every satisfaction, I have very much pleasure in submitting this motion. motion. are no other nominations, I should like to sav a word or two. member kindly resume his seat? I am not quite sure at the moment whether I ought I would point out fo to permit any debate in this case. The direction of the House upon the resolution recently adopted is that the election shall be conducted in a certain method, and that the Standing Orders should be suspended If, so far as to enable the House to take that course.

The question about which I am not quite certain is, whether any honourable member ought to be permitted to speak, not with a view to proposing or seconding any candidate, but simplv with n view to debating the merits of the candidates proposed. I ask the honourable member for Gwydir not to press his claim to speak for ' a few moments, and in the meantime I will look into the point and see if further debate ought to be permitted. The interval will provide an opportunity for other nominations to be made if any are which you have referred, Mr Speaker, as to the right of honourable members to speak on this question, I should like to point out for your consideration that the right to discuss propositions submitted to the Houseis inherent in every honourable member, unless expressly taken away. A question which has occurred to my mind, and which I shall submit for your consideration, is whether the terms of the resolution that we havejust carried interfere in any way with the right of honourable members to debate the propositions before the House. I should' like you to consider whether the words in paragraph r"" That the House do now proceed to the election of a Chairman of Committees,"" necessarily mean that no honorable member shall have the right to express his-opinion on a proposition for the appointment of a Chairman of Committees when it is=",15,Election Of Chairman Of Committees

47,Mr Reid,"In reference to the point tosubmitted for our consideration. I have no wish that there should be a discussion on the question of the appointment, and do not intend to take part in one; but the suggestion that any honourable member can be debarred from expressing his opinions on a motion, in the absence of something done by the House, declaring that there shall be no discussion, strikes one as being very extreme. I do not think that the words to which I have referred necessarily mean that a debate on any proposition regarding the appointment of a Chairman of Committees shall be debarred. the inherent rights of the House, which, in my opinion, can be removed only by the use of very strong words. is a matter for your consideration, sir, and I have only to say, in conclusion, that I . feel that the rights of honourable members are safe in your hands. what the right honourable member has said; but the question is not quite so simple as he has just suggested to the House. Procedure by open exhaustive ballot requires not the proposing and seconding of a motion -whic h would of course be a proper basis of debate-bu t merely the nomination of a candidate. I was in some little doubt a few minutes ago whether I ought or ought not to require a seconder to a motion nominating a candidate. If there had been nothing before us but an open exhaustive ballot, all that I should perhaps have asked for would have been a nomination, which would not have been in the form of a motion requiring to be seconded, and could not have been followed by debate. But I had to bear in mind the fact that the resolution to which the House had agreed provided that an open exhaustive ballot should take place only in one contingency, that is to say, in the event of there being more than two candidates nominated. I could not tell, when I spoke a-few moments ago, whether there would be more than two nominated, but I had to provide ag.r'nst both contingencies. I had to guard against"" the contingency of there being only two nominations, in which case there would not be an exhaustive ballot, and also to guard myself so as to be ready to put the motion from the Chair in the ordinary way, in which case debate would follow as usual. If there be only two nominations the motion must be subject to debate, and must be put from the Chair in the ordinary way. Buti f three nominations [18] be made we must proceed with the open exhaustive ballot, and at this stage debate must be precluded. I had both these contingencies in view when I spoke, and they seemed to me to involve some little difficulty, which has not been taken, into account by the right honourable member for East Sydney. If there be no further nomination, the two proposals, the one in the shape' of a motion, and the other in the form of an amendment thereto, are now before the House, and are open for discussion. The right of discussion is one of I should like to point out that if the mode of election to be adopted were that of an open, exhaustive ballot, it should not be in However, it order for an honourable member to speak on the merits of a candidate whom he had nominated. Obviously, if an honourable member were allowed to speak in support of a nomination made by him, an opporI entirely agree with tunity should be given to honourable members to put before the House anything they might wish on the other side of the question. If we are, in future, to follow the procedure now laid clown, it seems'to me that it would be well to have a rule that, if the election is to be by open exhaustive ballot, no honourable member shall be allowed to do more than nominate a candidate. Unless such a restriction be imposed, we shall witness the spectacle of one honourable member putting forward all that can be said in favour of a proposition submitted by himself, whilst there will be no opportunity to put to the House what, perhaps, are salient points against the election of the candidate proposed. contingency, but, in view of the possibility that the open exhaustive ballot would not be resorted to, I had to guard myself by requiring each proposal to be moved by one honourable member-of course, with the possibil ity of debate-and seconded by another, with the possibility of debate. After that had been done, the whole matter might have been debated at such length as the House desired. As there have been onlyi two candidates nominated, we have not to consider the provision for an open exhaustive ballot, and the whole question is now open to debate, the amendment beingThat the words "" Mr Charles Carty Salmon"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" Mr John Moore Chanter."" about to enter upon a duty which, to my mind, is one of the highest that falls to",16,Honourable Members Hear Bear

51,Mr Webster (Gwydir),"We areour lot, and it is important that we should review any point that may tend to strengthen or to weaken the claims of a candidate for the position that we are called upon to fill. Speech-making is not popular on occasions of this kind, but one has to consider not the mere question of personal popularity, but his duty to those whom he represents. In these .circumstances I feel constrained to offer a few observations. The Chairman of Committees should be one who is able at all 'times to exercise the great powers conferred upon .him with discretion; it is in the highest degree essential that he should possess a judicial mind. I propose now to refer to an incident that occurred during last session, not because of any personal feeling, but because I feel that it is a matter that affects the whole House. Any honourable member may f a l l under the lash of a Chairman of Committees, and the episode with which. I am about to deal, to my mind, shows that the honourable member for Laanecoorie, who has been nominated for the position, does not possess that judicial mind which is essential to enable a Chairman of Committees to satisfactorily, discharge the duties of his office. While the Estimates were under discussion last session, I had occasion to refer to a matter of which I had some knowledge, and was endeavouring to faithfull y do my duty to the country. Judge of my surprise when the honourable member for Laanecoorie, who was then Chairman of Committees, availed himself of a standing order which should be exercised only with the greatest caution, to oall upon me to discontinue my remarks on the ground that I had been guiltv of tedious repetition and irrelevancy. I claim that I can speak for more than eighteen minutes without indulging in tedious repetition. Whatever my faults, I do not think I can be charged with tedious repetition. public time. Let us get on with public business. characteristic of the leader of the Opposition. While he is prepared to waste hours in discussing something which amounts really to nothing, he does not hesitate to complain that public time is being wasted when an honourable member is seeking to point out something which closely affects the interests of the House. The position taken up by the Chairman on the occasion to which I refer did not affect me to any material extent, because under the Standing OrdersI might have resumed my seat, and have risen almost immediately to address the Committee once more. As a matter of fact, however, it had a serious bearing on the expenditure of time involved in the transaction of the business of the Parliament. As the result of his intervention, we had an all-night sitting, which would not otherwise have occurred. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -A t what hour did the incident occur? to those honourable members who so highly appreciate.our liberties that they are prepared to treat an important question of this kind with such levity as the honourable member for South Sydney is exhibiting. On the night in question the Government were practically wasting the time of the Committee by baiting honourable members. I have no desire, however, to deal with that aspect of the matter. Concerning the personal attributes of the honourable member for Laanecoorie, or his parliamentary experience, I have nothing to say; but I contend that on the occasion in question he failed to exercise the powers of his position with due caution. On the other hand, the honourable member for Riverina, who was Chairman of Committees in the first Parliament, has been eulogized again and again for the firm and impartial manner in which he discharged his duties. I have never heard any complaint against him, and a point that we should bear in mind is that he was unable either to be nominated, or to seek nomination, when this Parliament met. That, was no fault of his; it was due to the bungling of an officer of the Electoral Department, and any one of us may have the same thing happen to him at any time. honourable member for Riverina had been declared duly elected when this Parliament I s not this a great waste of first met, he would, without opposition, have been chosen Chairman of Committees. Therefore I appeal to the honourable member for Laanecoorie to consider the claim of the honourable member for Riverina to the position, and suggest that, as an act of magnanimity he might retire in his favour. I do not oppose the re-election of the honourable member for Laanecoorie on personal grounds, but I think that in order that the rights and liberties of the members of this House may be protected, and to insure the proper and constitutional conduct of business, we should elect the honourable member for Riverina.

The Chairman of Committees put the Standing Orders into operation against him only when no other alternative remained. If there were qualities more than any others which distinguished the honourable member for Laanecoorie, during the period of his occupancy of the Chair in Committee, they were the qualities of patience and forbearance, and the desire to do justice to every member in the House. I say this, although I have myself fallen under his official displeasure, and have had to bow to his ruling, when perhaps I felt that I was being treated a little harshly. I believe, however, that we should, on all occasions, do our best to support the authority of the Chair. The honourable member for Gwydir may be, perhaps unconsciously, largely swayed by personal considerations in opposing the re-election of the honourable member for Laanecoorie, although he thinks that he is opposing the re-election on public grounds. that it was right for the honourable member for Lang to say that the honourable member for Gwydir was groggy on the The occasion to which he referred. insinuation. ber for Lang withdrew the remark, and when a remark has been withdrawn, no comments should be made on it. attention.

I consider that the Chairman, in the proper performance of his duties, could not, on that occasion, have done anything else. have said anything about the qualificationsof the honourable member for Laanecoorie, because I do not think it a good thing for the House to discuss the merits or demerits of candidates for offices of this sort, had it not been for the gratuitous reflection of the honourable and learned member for Corio upon a certain section of the House, in proposing the honourable member for re-election to the Chairmanship of Committees. AlthoughI consider that the honourable member for Laanecoorie on the occasion which has been referred to absolutely lost the discretion which usually characterizes him. and warned the honourable member for Gwvdir practically before he had had time to get going, so anxious was he to ensure that the Standing Orders should not be infringed take the honourable 'member for Gwydir to get going? and those who know the honourable member's capacity, know that he can talk for anv length of time without getting out of order. the honourable member for Laanecoorie for that action, nor do I cherish resentment against him-and I think I can speak in this matter for every member of our party -for the vote which he gave in this House on one occasion. man could feel resentment against an honourable member for a vote given in this House in the discharge of his duty to his constituents, and the sooner that any one who could cherish such feeling goes out of Parliament the better. the honourable member for Riverina, I shall not be influenced by any such considerations. gave general satisfaction as Chairman of Committees in the first Parliament, and that but for a mistake of the Electoral Department, he would have been re-elected on the assembling of the second Parliament, and would therefore have been chosen Chairman of Committees again this session.

The Senate will know nothing of the message. the Constitution. MrM c DONALD the B ill is originated requires to have the message. message from the Governor General has been brought down to this House. what reason? It cannot be to enable the B ill to be introduced here, because, as far as we are aware, that Bill is at an end. We can only attempt to revive the Bill here upon a motion But in the other House we cannot attempt to revive it at all. If the measure be sent down to us with amendments by the other Chamber, to all intents and purposes it is a new Bill, of which we know nothing. I admit that this is a question which requires grave thought, and I do hope that the Government will defer its further consideration until the Joint Standing Orders Committee have submitted its report upon the whole matter of lapsed Bills. agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy. According to section 56 of the Constitution, it would lae not only derogatory to the dignity of the House, but highly unconstitutional to adopt the suggestion of the Prime Minister in the present instance. That section providesA vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed, unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of . the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originated. Those words are very clear, Then, apart from the difficulties of procedure which may arise in the discussion of this B ill , we have only to look at clauses 48 and 49' of the Papua Bill to have any doubts which may exist confinmed. Clause 48 statesThere shall be payable in every year out of the revenues of the Territory, which, to that extent, are hereby appropriated accordingly, the sum of One thousand two hundred and fifty pounds for the salary of the Lieut -Governor, and the sum of One thousand pounds for the salary of the Chief Judicial Officer of the Terri7 tory. The following clause provides: There shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth towardsthe revenue of the Territory the sum of Twenty thousand pounds in each financial year up to and including the financial year ending the 30th day of June, 1906, and thereafter such sums, if any, as the Parliament appropriates for that purpose. Honourable members will see that those clauses provide for a distinct appropriation I think that it is. of moneya very distinct one indeed. I confess that I should be glad to know how the Prime Minister proposes to overcome that difficulty. It appears to me that it should only be necessary to point out the A great danger of allowing this proposal to pass. Let us suppose that some action isPor taken in British New Guinea, as the result of which a lawyer is brought face to face with this B ill. The very first thing that he would do would be to show that it was not in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution. ""No doubt the proceedings would be expensive, but I feel sure that if the matter were submitted to the H i g h 1 Court that body would determine that the Papua Bil l had not been properly passed, that we had exceeded our powers, and that no Standing Orders of ours could override section 56 of the Constitution. My attention has now beer* 'drawn by the Clerk of the House to message No. s, by which it appears that a message from the Governor General, relating to the Papua Bill, has been received during the present session. That fact disposes of one portion of the argument which I have addressed to the House. The other question at issue is whether it is wise to allow a Bil l to be brought forward under these Standing Orders, whether it would not limit debate to such^an extent that we should find ourselves unable to deal with this measure afresh. We know that there is a good deal to be said in favour of the saving of time which might result, but I think that experience has generally shown that where a measure had been .revived by resolution more time has been occupied in debating the resolution than would have been absorbed if the Bill were introduced afresh.

92,Mr Mccay (Corinella),"I should likerevenue yesterday afternoon. The honourable and learned gentleman was then precluded from replying, though I think I may say, without revealing any confidences, that he -does not think it necessary to delay .the consideration of this proposal. .sonally, I express no opinion upon these Standing Orders or their merits, because --this House has thought the subject of suffi-cient importance to refer it to the Standing Orders Committee in connection with Bills which require a message from the Governor General. I have the honour to be a member of that Committee, and therefore I -do not express an opinion upon the subject -either way, beyond pointing out that it was considered of sufficient importance to warrant its reference without a dissentient voice to the Standing Orders Committee of both Houses, if the Senate will agree to the adoption of that course. It seems to me, therefore, that the Bill is one which the Government should postpone for the few days that will be required to enable this matter to be considered. I am not at all sure that bhe contention of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, that matters of this kind -come within the purview of the High Court, could be sustained before that tribunal. But, apart from the merits of the .Standing Orders, and their applicability to Bills of this character, I suggest to the -Government the desirability-in view of the -question having been raised, and of their concurrence in the decision of this House yesterday of deferring the consideration of the Bill for the present. It is not as if they had not plenty of Bills with which to proceed. which the late Government left behind-even if the present Ministry had no measures of their own in hand-and I understand that they have-ar e numerous enough to provide this House with ample work. We know that there are Bills ready for discussion, so that the public business need not !be delayed in any way. I therefore urge that they should allow the Joint Standing Orders Committee to report upon the applicability or otherwise of these Standing Orders to Bills which require to be originated by a message from the Governor General, before proceeding to act upon the assumption that not only do the Standing Orders apply to such Bills, but that they Apply to all Bills. I cannot understand this impetuous haste on the part of the Government-thi s extraordinary new-born zeal -for pushing on these particular measures. I quite admit that it is desirable that we should provide Papua with a Constitution as soon as possible. My own attitude upon that matter last session, in connection with certain Senate amendments, clearly demonPerstrates that. But the shelving of the Bill at that time involved a delay of six months; in the* present instance it may not cause a delay of more than six. Consequently, I say that it is desirable, in the interests of the proceedings of this House, to delay dealing with this matter until the Standing Orders Committee have reported upon the applicability or otherwise of these orders to Bills which require to be originated upon message from the Governor General. have referred a similar matter to the Standing Orders Committee, it seems rather at variance with the course which we tookin view of that reference, which was agreed to by the Government-to proceed now as if the matter were of no consequence. If the Bill were only in its earlier stages, the point which I aim making would not, perhaps, be quite so strong. But I understand that the consideration of the Bill was almost concluded last session. I think that we were considering the final amendment of the Senate when Parliament was prorogued. law now but for the action of the honourable member for Kennedy. consideration now, our attitude will seem rather inconsistent with our action of yesterday. It was then thought a matter of sufficient importance to warrant a meeting of the Those Joint Standing Orders Committee to decide what is the proper course to take; but in the meantime we are asked to adopt what may prove to be an improper course, and to pass the Bill under circumstances which the Joint Standing Orders Committee may report are unwarrantable and irregular. The Bill, I think, might well wait for the few days necessary to enable that body to submit its report. I quite agree with the honourable and learned member for Corinella, that the matter is of importance. I do not wish to express any strong opinion upon the point which has been raised, beyond saying that the question is of importance, and that we should only be showing proper respect to the tribunal to which a similar matter has been referred, if we postponed its consideration for a few days.

On that ground, I made the suggestion to the honourable and learned member who called attention to the question, and who was proposing some special tribunal for its consideration, that the Committee which had framed these Standing Orders was the proper body to reconsider them if they needed further attention. raised was that a message from the Governor General might be necessary. is the point now involved. opinion, section 56 of the Constitution offers no obstacle, and the procedure we are now taking is perfectly legitimate from a constitutional point of view.

In my debated at great length in both Houses, a number of divisions have taken place upon it, and we are still open to consider all the amendments made last session by the Senate. Our failure to pass the Bill twelve months ago has resulted in great loss to Papua. I am very reluctant that there should It may probably be within be a single month's delay if it can be avoided, because, even if the Bill be passed at once, some time must elapse before its The honourable and f u l l benefits can be obtained.

The passing of the Bill, therefore,is a first and the necessary preliminary, in order that the development of The course proposed by Papua may reach' a stage that will call for the action to which the honourable member has referred. I would, therefore, ask honourable members to allow this stage to pass, in order that we may deal with the amendments as rapidly as possible.

JURY EXEMPTION of Home Affairs) -In rising to move That the B ill be now read a second time, I may explain that it is simply a small machinery measure intended to complete the judicial machinery already created by this Parliament. It was laid upon the table by my predecessor in office, and was the first to be introduced during the present session. Bv section 15 of the High Court Procedure Act, it is provided that the laws of a Slate relating to the qualifications of jurors, & c , shall be binding upon the High Court when it sits in that State. The principle is this : that when the High Court is sitting in a certain State, and it is necessary for the purposes of a trial to have a jury, the law prevailing in that State in relation to the qualification or disqualification of jurors, shall be binding on that tribunal. Under the laws of the States, certain classes of persons, consisting of army officers, members of the Legislature, executive councillors, civil servants, municipal councillors, and various other public officials and classes of persons are exempted from service'at jury trials. Byreason of their position in the community, and the importance of the particular callings or offices they hold, they are exempt from the duty which falls to the lot of an ordinary citizen to serve upon a jury. servants to be exempt? MJr. GROOM -Becaus e they are already performing public services which require their attention. If a public servant were liable to serve on a jury he might practically be taken away from the performance of one class of public work to discharge another which is carried out by certain classes of citizens who, by reason of their -connection with the commercial life of the community, are selected to act in that capa-citv). It would be highly undesirable, for example, to ask public servants of the Commonwealth to serve on a jurv to be called upon to decide whether the Commonwealth is liable upon a certain set of facts. TheB ill provides thatThe following persons shall be exempt from -serving as jurors whether summoned so to serve under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State :The Governor General. The members of the Federal Executive Council, The Justices of the High Court and of other Courts created by the Parliament. BILL. The senators and the members of the House of Representatives. The members of the Inter-State Commission. The officers of -the Public Service of the Commonwealth. The members of the Permanent Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth. It is quite possible that some of the persons enumerated may be already exempt under State laws; but inasmuch as it is highly desirable to have a distinct and clear statement of their position in this respect, this Bill has been introduced. It is practically an addition tp the provisions of the High Court Procedure Act. in State Courts, or only State Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction ? persons named, so far as the Commonwealth is able to do so, from all services, either Federal or State.

121,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"I think thatwhich I have just referred occurred to me 1 while the honourable and learned gentleman was moving that it be read a second time. The Bill was introduced by the late Government, so that I admit that we were responsible for it before. But the point that has occurred to me, after further consideration of the question, is whether, by the language of the B ill , we are proposing to interfere witb State powers, over which we have no jurisdiction. Would such a thing be convenient? It might give rise to strong objections in the States. It might be said that we were assuming to exercise legislative powers that we did not possess. There is another reading of the Bill-that the rule is to apply in Federal Courts or in State Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. To that extent, I think it is perfectly valid. In providing that the members of the Executive Council shall be exempt, I presume our intention is that Federal Executive Councillors on active service-unde r summons to the Executive Council-shoul d be ( exempt. Under our Constitution Executive Councillors do not resign their positions after they leave office; they continue to remain members of the Executive, but are not summoned. The number of such persons, however, would be so small that I do not think it is necessary to suggest any alteration in that respect. This Bill must be a good one, because it had not only the imprimatur of the late Government, but of the ante-penultimate Government. It was in preparation while the Watson Government were in office, and is absolutely necessary in order to prevent interference with the public duty of Federal officers. Thfe list of exemptions contained in the Bill is* much smaller than that with which we are familiar in the Victorian law. Shire councillors and various other functionaries are exempt from serving on juries under the law of this State, and a policeman or other officer engaged in the work of getting a jury together often finds the task a very confusing one. As to what has been said With regard to the Bil l interfering with State Courts, I do not see why we should not interfere with them to the extent of providing that the work to be done by Federal officers shall not be hindered in order that State Courts may be served. I think that we have power to isolate our officers; that we have power to say that States duties shall not touch them It is; certainly not unreasonable to lay it down that our public servants shall not be dragged away from their duties to serve for seven,, fourteen, or twenty-one days on a juryI shall support the second reading of theB ill , and hope that it will be passed through, all its stages as soon as possible. I should like to say a word or two with, regard to what the leader of the Oppositionhas said as to interference with State jurisdiction and State law. It might well becontended, and no doubt will be contended,, on behalf of the Commonwealth, that it is beyond the jurisdiction of State legislation to impose duties as jurors, upon any of these Commonwealth officials. At the same time it is as well to have it upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth that it is the will of Parliament that they shall not be so required to serve, because there are cases well known in American law in which the fact that Congress had intimated its will in regard to certain matters determined whether thosematters were beyond the competency of the Legislatures of the States. The measurecannot do harm, and it may do good. somewhat nervous in addressing myself to this question after several ex-Ministers and all the lawyers in the House have expressed* themselves in favour of the measure, I wish to say on behalf of the citizens of the Commonwealth that I know no reason why senators and members of the House of Representatives should be exempted from serving on juries. The general body of electorsare not glad to serve on juries, and would individually evade the duty where they could, although they are told that it is their highest privilege. Speaker were summoned to serve on a jury f* summoned. Either the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives are not competent to serve on juries, or they should not be exempted from giving their services in the law courts of the country when required so to do. It seems to methat the passing of this measure will give the public occasion to say that we avail ourselves of every opportunity to create a closepreserve for our own advantage. the opportunity to earn juror's fees. not think much of the fees which he gets.

If it were claimed, the presiding Judge would have to decide, as a matter of law, whether the measure applied to a State proceeding. learned friends opposite think that his decision would be that it did apply? To my mind, there is room for considerable doubt. The strict reading of the Constitution seems to be-that, whilst our legislation sets aside inconsistent State legislation, it does so only in regard to certain specified subjects. specified subjects, but in regard to any subject on which we have power to legislate. to legislate as to the qualifications of a juror in a State Court? As the B ill was drafted by the late Government, I do not wish to raise difficulties in connection with it, but to me it is doutbful whether our powers extend so far as some honourable members appear to think, they do. I quite see the importance of the point raised by the right honourable gentleman, but, as I said before, I think it would be held, even without this provision, that Commonwealth functionaries are not to be dragged from the performance of their duty by any provision under a State law. For instance, could it be thought for a moment that the Justices of the High Court were to be dragged into a State court as jurors in a criminal case. Surely, without any provision in a Commonwealth Act, it would be held that they were exempt from such service. A t the same time, there is no harm in including in a Bill dealing with exemptions from service as jurors the reference to States Courts, because it could never then be argued that the mention in the exemption of the Courts of the Commonwealth, and the failure to mention the Courts of the State, was an indication of the intention of ' Parliament that the Act should not extend to the Courts of the States. The provision is an indication of the will of Parliament that our functionaries shall not be called upon to serve asjurors. and proper. The objection, to my mind, carried out as far as we can by legislation The point I raise carry it out. We cannot do more. there can be any question as to our power to deal with this matter. Eveni f we did not make provision such as that now included in the Bill, there would be no power on the part of a State, under its laws, to compel a member of this Parliament to serve on a jury or to attend at a court of Do my justice. May saysThe privilege of freedom from arrest has alsobeen construed to discharge members and their servants from all liability to answer subpoenasin other Courts and to serve on juries. That has been fhe privilege of members of Parliament for many years, and I think that, apart from legislation, the same rule will hold good so far as the Federal Parliament is concerned. We are carrying out an immemorial practice, whiich has been tosome extent cut down recently by some of tlie States.

ThisB ill , like the preceding one, is vouched for by three Governments. spoil it . orable member for DaJley will heartily support this Bill, in the interests of the bleeding citizens of the Commonwealth, because it proposes to save their time and money. The measure is a very useful one, and quite in line with many others of the same class on the statute-books of the States. It aims at shortening the procedure and lessening the expenditure involved in mere formal proofs in the Law Courts. Courts, including the Inter-State Commission, and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and the State Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction, as well as all persons authorized by the law of the Commonwealth, or of a State, or by rhe consent of the parties to take evidence, shall take judicial notice of and recognise without any proof the seal of the Commonwealth, the fact that certain functionaries hold their positions when documents purporting to bear their official seals are presented, and take cognisance of the proclamations and other formal documents issued by"" the Governor General, or under the authority of a Minister of the Commonwealth. It also provides, as in the States laws for the admissibility of copies of public books and documents, under certain circumstances, and for facilitating proof of the votes and proceedings in Parliament, of the Government Gazette, and of the judicial proceedings of the High Court, or other Federal Courts, or any Justice or Judge, by means of the production of a copy of such proceedings. WhatI have described represents practically the whole of the Bill. The measure presents no contentious features whatever, but is intended to simplify and facilitate legal proceedings, and as such 1 hope that it will reBill read a second time.

It appears to me that an attempt is being made in this clause to regulate the law of evidence in the States Courts, apart from the occasions upon which such Courts are exercising Federal jurisdiction. I It requires that the Federal should like the Attorney-General to' say whether the Federal Parliament has jurisdiction to lay down additional rules of evidence for the States Courts when they are dealing with purely State affairs.

I wish to know whether it is intended to make provision additional to that which already exists in the States in regard to Courts dealing with State matters only; because if so I can see some danger. If it were held that we had exceeded, our powers in attempting to provide additional laws of evidence in the States Courts, dealing with State matters only, some very lengthy proceedings might at some future time be set aside on the ground that evidence had been admitted under this Act which was ultra vires. grave doubt is raised by the honourable and",28,Second Reading

TheB ill has, of course, been copied from State Acts, in regard to which no such question could be raised. The rules made under a State Act of Parliament would have to be taken cognisance of by the various courts of that State, but here we are seeking to prescribe that the seal of the Commonwealth and certain other things shall be taken cognisance of by the courts of the States. How can we direct the courts of the States as to the evidence they are to accept with regard to certain matters. It would not be competent for the Imperial Parliament to prescribe that the seal of the Imperial Government should, without any proof, be recognised throughout the British Possessions. power to do that. to Federation, one State Government could not prescribe that the seal of its Executive Council should be taken cognisance of by other States. We are now practically prescribing that the signature of a Federal Minister must be accepted as proved in a certain manner in a State court, and I do not think we have any jurisdiction in the matter. which various State Courts are to take cognisance of Federal documents in purely State matters? I quite agree Avith my honourable and Jearned friends that there is a doubt in this matter. This Bill has been inherited, and the question raised is one that is not quite clear under our Constitution.

Since Ave have poAver to legislate upon certain subiect matters, and since our poAver of legislation extends to binding the Courts, as well as the people of the States, I can quite understand that we ought not, as a CommonAvealth Parliament, to assume that Ave cannot compel everybody to recognise our Acts. That is the idea I think Avhich led to the insertion of these A\'ords. I quite agree that it is a subject which is not free from doubt; but I think that Ave ought to assert our poAver in this Avay; that is, for instance, as Ave haA'e poAver to make a CommonAvealth seal Ave have poAver to say that eA'ery person shall take notice of that seal, and that every Court in Australia shall recognise it . means that they shall recognise it as the seal of the CommonAvealth. gentleman is selecting the one feature of the Bill under Avhich difficulty is least likely to arise. stance because it is a clear instance.

In the case of evidence, we also have power to say to every individual in the Commonwealth, "" Y o u shall not drag our public documents, our Cabinet minutes, or our public officers 'into Court when we have, provided you with a summary means of proving the facts which you desire to establish."" beyond protection of the Commonwealth procedure, and protection of our Federal servants and Federal documents. Let us take the matters mentioned in it in their order. Clause3 relates to the official seal of the Commonwealth. We provide that that seal shall speak for itself. We say that it shall not be necessary to drag an officer from the Commonwealth service to prove that that seal was affixed to any particular document. The next clause relates to the signature of the Governor General and other officials. Surely we do not want to drag the Governor General into any court to attest his signature! In this Bill Ave simply giA'e litigants a means of proving their case at less pains. Then Ave relieve our officers of the need of proving certain signatures. Then we come to certain documents, proclamations, commissions, orders, or regulations Avhich are issued or made by the Governor General, or by the authority of a Minister. Under the provisions of this measure these can be proved simply by producing a copy of the Commonwealth Gazette, certified to by the Government Printer. (These clauses do not impose disabilities upon the poAA'ers and privileges of litigants. On the contrary, they confer a privilege upon them, and enable them to avoid expense by proving certain things Avithout the necessity of calling upon original persons or original documents. We have f u l l control over our OAvn officers and documents for our own purposes. We could, if Ave liked, put the whole of them upon an island and declare that nobody shall touch them.

I do not entertain the doubt which has been expressed, but I defer to those There is nothing in this B ill Avho do. I repeat that the passing of the Bill can do no harm, and will probably effect some good. there is a very great deal of force in the point which has been raised by the honourable and learned member for Parkes.

The main point at issue is that if we possess jurisdiction to prescribe the methods by which the State Courts shall be conducted, we have the power under the Constitution to regulate the laws of evidence in those Courts and in State proceedings. That is the serious question, andi I see nothing in the Constitution which enables us to go into a State Court and make a law in regard to the conduct of its business in State matters which is not covered by any defined power in our Constitution. There aTe some very large rules in this Bill, no dbubt all well intended. These may relate to an order of a Minister on any conceivable subject, or a notice in the Commonwealth Gazette, which may be a private notice, having nothing whatever to do with the Commonwealth Government or with the Commonwealth Courts. Some person may have inserted in tlie Commonwealth Gazette, or some document which he alleges is the Gazette, a notice upon a private matter, and under this B ill we should make that notice evidence in a matter which may be .a private one, with which the Commonwealth has nothing to do, and which forms the subject of litigation in a State Court.

I entirely agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne as to the utility of this measure. I should be very glad if I could think that we have power to pass it, in order that we might bring about some unison in regard to certain branches of the law of evidence. But the honourable and learned member stated that we ought to "" assert our power."" I think that is rather a dangerous doctrine. We cannot make power by asserting it. said that I echoed what had been stated by the Attorney-General to tlie effect that we ought to assert our powers as far as we could constitutionally. agreed upon that. I intend to show presently that this measure differs very materially' from the last Bill with regard to the idea of "" chancing it."" The last Bill dealt with jurors, and its only effect would be to lead to the withdrawal of certain persons from doing duty as jurymen, and their withdrawal could never have invalidated anv proceedings. But I think it is clear that if this Bill be passed in its present form it may operate with very great hardship upon suitors in State Courts. If it might, then we should pause. I can easily imagine a case, extending over a week or two in a State Court, to which the law of evidence laid down here for Commonwealth Courts was applied. In such a case the point might be taken, on appeal to the High Court, that the State Judge had no right to admit evidence in accordance with the principles contained in this measure. the point might arise. Court ultimately determined that we had no power to pass additional rules for the States Courts, the whole of the proceedings T h a t matter is included in might be upset, to the great cost of some individual citizen.

Let us suppose, further, that, in order to prove tlie case on behalf of the plaintiff or defendant, it is necessary to show some entry in a Commonwealth book. According to this B ill , it would be possible to put in as evidence what purported to be a copy of an extract from a Commonwealth book purporting to be signed merely by the officer who had charge of that book. would have to be a copy; it would be an extract consisting of a copy of part of the book.

It purports to be signed by the officer in charge of the original. Under our law, it is not evidence without further proof, but under this Act it is, and I shall admit it."" The proceedings might involve an expenditure of some thousands of pounds, and if ultimately the High Court held that that portion of the measure applying this law of evidence to State Courts was ultra vires, the whole proceedings would be upset. I have taken a probable case. General will admit that my argument is not The Attorney-General has drawn affected by any suggestion as to the case of the Governor General's signature. Cases of that sort, I am sure, would be provided for by the laws of the State: We are concerned in seeing that evidence which touches the Commonwealth machinery shall be provable as easily as possible; but I do not think that we are sufficiently interested to pass this measure on chance. There should not be any difficulty, if the B ill were passed without the provisions as to State Courts, in inducing the Governments of the different States to introduce separate Bills. carrying out those provisions of this measure to which exception may be taken.

If the honourable and learned member will turn to section 51 of the Constitution, which enumerates the powers of.the Commonwealth, he will find that by sub-section xxv., we are empowered to legislate for the recognition throughout the Commonwealth of the laws, the public acts, and records, and the judicial proceedings of the States. is laws, records, public acts, and judicial proceedings of one State shall have judicial recognition in every other State. If we can do that, it is difficult to imagine that we cannot make the same provision in respect of Commonwealth Acts, records, and judicial proceedings. as the one power was specifically given, why was not provision made for the other ? the right honourable member's argument; but when we have in addition to that power the right to legislate on "" matters incidental to the execution of any power,"" and so on, as provided by sub-section x x x i x . , I think it must be admitted Attornev-General sav that this is incidental ? power to say that there shall be Commonwealth public books and .records, and that they shall have the effect, if honourable members like, of appointments. we said that when a person's name was recorded in a certain book, he should be deemed to be appointed to a certain office, the production of such a record would be evidence that he was properly appointed. I am taking the case to which the honourable and learned member for Parkes has referred. If a copy of some public book were produced, in accordance with this Bill, in an action tried between A and B, citizens of the same State, in Western Australia, I take it , that it would be going a long way to say that we had not the power to provide that public recognition should be taken all over the Commonwealth of a certain fact, if it were evidenced in a certain way. cutive.

We surely havepower to say that a copy of, or extract' from, a public book shall have the same effect as the production of the book itself.. If we can do that, it is going very littlefurther to provide to say we can say that the goes further than that, because it providesthat, if a copy purports to be a copy by thesignature of a person purporting to be the officer in charge of the book, it shall beevidence. involved in the other; if we can do the one thing, we can do the other. I am taking: It may be very difficult, but the simplest case, because while not freefrom doubt, I think the probability is that this provision will be effectual. 'That isonly my personal opinion, and I give f u l l ' weight to that which has been expressed by the honourable and learned member for Parkes. If we can say that a public book is to have a certain efficacy, we can surelv say that an extract from that bookshall also have a certain efficacy, and we can make of that extract a ComT o what power does the monwealth document. If we make it a Commonwealth document, our law should* under the fifth covering section of the Commonwealth Constitution, be recognised by every Court and every individual throughout Australia. Suppose ral is taking the most obvious part of my illustration; but there is the other part, where an officer purports to be the officer in charge. However, I do not wish topersist in my objection, if he is willing .to take the responsibility. which we have all to take. The provisionis framed to save expense, and to obtain simplicity. If we cannot do what is proposed, we make the admission that the States could say that no recognition shall be given to a Commonwealth document, except in a most cumbersome way, and' would put' it into the power of a StateParliament to enact that no Commonwealth Act or appointment shall be recognised unless the Governor General himself apI t would relate to the Exepears to swear to it . case.",33,Ioavs Upon Lines Of Avell Considered Legisla

In Queensland, where the practice of swearing affidavits before Justices of the Peace is followed, some justices very strongly object to the work thrown upon them without any fee or charge, which in some cases occupies two or three hours a day. also consider whether, in all matters, justices of the, peace should be authorized to take affidavits. From what I know of the circumstances under which affidavits are sworn, the signature is often regarded as a mere formality, and the justice does not always recognise the importance of the act that is being performed. I think that it is highly desirable that the whole matter should be carefully considered, and made the subject of a provision in a special Bill at a later stage. -the honourable member for Maranoa to agree to the arrangement which I have made with the Attorney-General, who has promised that he will inquire into"" the matter, and, if possible, introduce an amendment in the Bill when it is before the Senate. matter, and see how f a r the honourable and learned member's desire can be achieved.

Immediately afterwards the honourable and learned member pointed out that affidavits in Victorian County Court matters could be sworn before Justices of the Peace, and I submit that, if any confusion were likely to arise from diversity of practice, it would hare occurred before to-day between the Supreme and County Courts. This is not only a layman's question, but one which vitally affects the fair and economical administration of the law, and also the inWe should terests of lawyers. The greater the facilities offered for prompt decisions in our courts, and for reducing the expenses in connection with such matters as those which have been under our consideration, the larger will be the number of litigants and the greater the fees earned by the lawyers.

263,Mr Isaacs (Indi,"Attorney-General) .aroused in our midst a feeling of indignation that such practices as have been disclosed by the evidence, and which are summarized in the report of the gentlemen who composed that Commission, should have been possible. Its members, I may say,"" were men of experience-representativ e men. They consisted of a gentleman who, for a considerable time, occupied the position of Police Magistrate, and who now fills a high office in the State service of Victoria; of another gentleman who is a member of the State Legislature, and a representative farmera man who has served in various Ministries in Victoria, and who undoubtedly has the welfare of the primary industries, as well as of other industries, at heart. The third member was a man of great banking and commercial experience, and, therefore, we cannot imagine that any of the Commissioners wished to promote what some of my honourable friends opposite are pleased to term '.' socialistic"" measures. The zeal, ability, and industry which the Commissioners displayed demand the recognition of their country. They have done very great service in exposing practices which certainly militate against the well being of any community. But although those practices were carried on upon a large scale, and were extremely detrimental to the great industries of Australia, they were, I believe, confined to comparatively a few. It is the moral sense of the community rebelling against such practices which demands such a Bill as that we are now submitting. It will be well, I think, if I read from the final report of the Commission on the butter industry^ which was constituted a Federal body by the Government 'of which the honourable member for Bland was the leader. Whilst he filled the office of Prime Minister, the Commission was constituted a Federal Commission, in order that its inquiry might be given greater scope, and that it might be invested with a larger measure of jurisdiction than it originally enjoyed. Amongst other matters, the final report of that,body points out thatFor a considerable period prior to 1904 it was observed that there was a marked unrest in the trade and amongst the dairymen.. This gave rise to murmurings of disapproval of the methods adopted by certain agents in the disposal of the butter sent through them, and also of the manner in which certain companies which, at their inception, augured well for the promotion of the best interests of dairymen, collapsed to the disappointment of the shareholders and suppliers, and eventually passed into the hands of persons who worked them in their own special interests, and not in the interests of the producers engaged in this national industry. Such an industry., which has progressed so rapidly, and which wasassisting materially to enhance the wealth of thisState, was threatened with an upheaval, owing, to the reprehensible practices which it was openly stated had developed. They proceed to show that their sittings, occupied a considerable time, and that they examined witnesses both in Victoria and New South Wales, besides examining intothe butter industry in the latter State. Upon page 32 of their report, they deal' with the question of secret payments to directors and officials. They sayThe voluminous and confirmatory evidencetaken on the subject of secret payments to directors and of officials demonstrates conclusively that this reprehensible practice is prevalent toan alarming extent, in the dairying industry, and we find upon this evidence that(a) commissions have been secretly paid by butter agents to secretaries, managers, and directors of factories; [i ) commissions have been solicited by officials from agents and others in return, for influence to be used on their behalf; (c) contractors and suppliers of factory requisites have paid and been induced' to pay a percentage on the amount of the supplies to directors and officials; (d) the business of traders and agents who have withstood these solicitations for commissions has consequently suffered' from such refusal to make secret payments. of the report of the Commission have not been circulated amongst honourable members. It is possible to have copies circulated? that done. The last statement which I read constitutes a highly important feature, because it shows that although there wereagents who were indulging in nefariouspractices to their own pecuniary advantage, there were others-and I am proud to say that I believe they formed the vast majority of. the agents throughout Australia-who adhered rigidly to the honest course. But these, it must be recollected, had to submit to the result which followed their adherenceto that course, because there were othersless scrupulous, who did not hesitate to dowhat the Courts, as well as commonsenseand moral sense, designate as unfair, unjust, and improper. It is for the protection of the honest agents of the producers, and"" of the public generally, that this Bill is introduced. The Commissioners sayIn eliciting evidence on this subject, it was only to be expected that the utmost efforts would be made by the donors and recipients to withhold"" information that would assist us in coming to a",38,Secret Commissions Bill Second Reading

265,Mr Isaacs,"I will endeavour to havedecision on the facts. Whilst some principals adopted the view that these payments were matter of concern only to the giver and receiver, and others maintained that any payments made were for bona fide services rendered, they all adthe Commission's report. mitted that the payments were secret, and took the precaution, when made in coin, to demand no receipt or acknowledgment. It will be seen by the evidence that fhe practice had become, so universally regarded as a recognised custom that factory officials made application in writing to agents and contractors for commission on the trade extended to them, only considering it necessary to mark their, communications "" private."" Honourable members will be good enough to bear that fact in mind, because we have included in this Bill provisions which make it penal to make these offers, irrespective of whether they are acceded to or not. is not the fault of the man who attempts to bribe an agent if his attempt is not successf u l , any more than it is the fault of the individual who endeavours to commit murder if he does not succeed. The Commissioners then proceed 1 Besides the immoral effect of the practice, it has certainly limited the competition for the factories' business. Scrupulous agents, who refused to prejudice employees and directors on their behalf by making substantial concessions or payments, failed to obtain or retain the business which was given or transferred to some less scrupulous competitor. officials' good-will had also the effect of depriving the factories' interests of that protection which an honest servant would observe towards his real principal. To these secret payments, therefore, may be traced the licence and liberty given to agents and speculators, 'and, cpnsequently, the abuses to which the trade in factory butter has been subjected. The Commission reports that the necessary result of agents receiving bonuses principals have to pay more for the services rendered. out of the price charged for the services rendered, there is a sufficient margin to remunerate the agent, on the other side there must be a sufficient margin to enable a reduction in the price to be made, if no such illicit commission were given. and in fact it is the principal who always pays in such cases, although he does not know it. possible from referring to particular individuals, because it is well known that this matter is still under the attention of the State Attorney-General, and that recommendations were made by the Commission that the position of the persons who engaged in these practices should be taken into consideration by the .Crown Law authorities.

Of course. I do not adopt all the statements which have been made in regard to these wrongful practices.

We should be careful that we say nothing impeaching the honestv or honour of our people. TheB ill is necessary, not because our people are dishonest or immoral, but because they are honest and moral, and reprehend certain practices which are indulged in by comparatively few among us. I think that I have now put before the House the gist of the measure. It is a measure which undoubtedly concerns the welfare of the Commonwealth in more ways than one. It will link itself to other measures of which we have given notice, or have in preparation, and we hope that, with the assistance which we shall give to the producing community by it and other measures which I have indicated, we shall do a great deal for fhe welfare of the Commonwealth. It is. no doubt, to a large extent, a Bill for consideration in Committee. It is short, and I trust that it is clear. Its object is palpable, and I think will be acceptable to honourable members. We shall be very glad indeed if , in the course of the progress of the measure through the Chamber, honourable members will afford us the best assistance they can in improving its provisions, to better achieve the end we seek. presented only yesterday, and therefore, although its object commands my heartiest sympathy, its importance and the novelty of legislation, of this kind demand a reasonable adjournment, so that honourable members may carefully studv the provisions of the measure, together with the report which The honourable member has been referred to.

As the leader of the Opposition has stated, the general principles of the Bill must commend themselves to the community and to the House generally, and it will facilitate the ultimate consideration of the measure if the educative forces of the second-reading debate are permitted to operate at an early date. Debate (on journed. t I move That the Bil l be now read a second time. This measure, which has reached us from the Senate, is intended to place on a uniform basis, as far as possible, and in a manner analogous to that winch has been adopted in regard to patents, all the trade marks in the Commonwealth. As honourable members know, this is one of the subjects committed to our jurisdiction by the Constitution, and I think we shall all agree that it is eminently desirable that the commercial community should have as much uniformity as possible in the legislation relating to trades marks throughout Australia. At the present time, there are, in the various States, Trade Marks Acts more or less based-excep t in the case of New South Wales-upo n recent English legislation. The New South Wales Act, which is of long standing' although re-enacted by way of consolidation, I think, in 1900, follows the older form of legislation in England. I may mention-the fact is not material at present, but it may become so when .we reach the Committee stage-that in the other States there is practical uniformity in the method of dealing with trades marks, and that that method follows to a large extent the legislation now standing on the statute-book of the mother country. We propose, in this measure, to follow English legislation with certain important modifications. In England, an'attempt has been nmade by certain veryeminent members of the House of Commonseminent in the legal profession, and with a considerable experience of patent law-a t the head of whom is Mr Moulton, to alter IDV legislation some of the provisions and some of the principles which are at present embodied in the English patent law. We have had the benefit of inspecting Mr other words, after fourteen years there will Moulton's B ill , which is backed up by a great number of legal authorities, and the Senate have incorporated in this measure many of Mr Moulton's suggestions. When honourable members see in the margin references to "" Moulton's B ill 1904,"" they will understand that theyi relate to the measure introduced into the House of Commons by the honourable and learned gentleman named, in order to place the trade mark law upon a more advanced the later developments of commercial requirements. This measure consists of eight parts, seven of which honourable members. I think will regard as uncontentious. That is to sav, they are simply; proposals for legislation which do not raise any such question as that involved by part VII . relating to union marks. I propose to deal shortly and in general terms with the uncontentious parts, and to afterwards deal specially with part VII . Honourable members will see that the B ill proposes to put an end, as soon as possible, compatible with the protection of existing rights, to the State Acts dealing with trade marks and to bring the whole subject under the control of the Federation. Clause6 provides that the States Trade Marks Acts shall, with certain exceptions, on the commencement of the Federal Act, cease to apply to trade marks. If a trade mark is registered under a State Act, that Act shall continue to apply to the trade mark as long as registration continues in force. Again, if any proceedings under a State Act are pending when the Federal Act comes into operation, such -proceedings may be continued and completed under the State Act. In other words, they are not to be thrown away. The third exception applies to applications for the registration of trade marks under a State Act made by virtue of some right acquired before the commencement of the Federal Act, in pursuance of an International Convention for the protection of industrial property. Under some International Conventions, protection is given to certain trade marks registered within a certain time, and if they are not registered within that time the protection ceases. Therefore, we protect the right to make an application under the State law. We say that a person may proceed under the State law, and register, in order to preserve a right which might otherwise expire by effluxion of time. Trade marks, which are already registered under States Acts, are to expire after fourteen years from the commencement of the Federal Act. In",44,Secret Commissions Bill Second Reading

Some of the registrations may terminate before that period has expired. right acquired under the States Acts shall cease altogether? a trade mark will not lose his right to it at the expiration of the period mentioned, but he will have to bring it under the Federal Act. under States Acts may require renewal in order to retain the rights conferred by registration. As soon as that occasion arises the proprietor will have to renew under the Federal ""Act, and no fee is to be charged for such renewal. The owner of a trade mark will be permitted to retain his State registration if he chooses, but he may prefer to abandon his State registration and bring his trade mark under the Federal law at once, which will give him a wider field for operations. Provision is made that the proprietor of a trade mark properly registered under any State Act may make application for , registration under the Federal Act. Then provision is made for cases in which conflicting rights may exist, owing to the fact that one man may have the right to a certain mark in one State, and another man may have the right, through user or otherwise, to the same mark in another State. The fact of one proprietor of the mark registering under the Federal Act is not to exclude another person from the right to use the mark in another State in which he owns it. The ninth clause deals with the registration of unregistered marks, and provides, just as it would in the State, that the proprietor of a trade mark in use in any State at the commencement of the Federal Act, may make application for the registration of his mark under such Act. Certain provisions are inserted which refer to the registrability of marks under the Trades Marks Acts in force. we with 'administration. It is provided that the Minister of. Trade, and Customs, or any other Minister, may administer the Act. It is also proposed that the Commissioner of Patents shall, in the first instance, be the Registrar of Trades Marks, and it is further provided that deputy registrars may be appointed. tended to utilize the services of the officials in the Patent Office. vided that the Commissioner of Patents Trade [REPRESENTATIVES.] Marks Bill. shall be the Registrar of Trade Marks until the Governor General otherwise determines. That sufficiently indicates the intention of the Government to avoid incurring any unnecessary expense. There is no reason why the"" administration of the Trades Marks Act should not be in the same hands as the Patents Act. Clause 14 provides that when the Bill comes into operation the whole administration of the States Acts is to pass Certain trades marks registered to the Federation. The nature of the marks which may be registered are set out in Part III . , and honourable members, by reference to that portion of the B ill , will see what are the essential particulars of a registrable trade mark. They practically follow the English law, and are set out in clause 16. I do not intend to ask honourable members to traverse the highly technical language of the provisions of Part III . I would only say that, when the expression "" registrable trade marks"" is used, it has this signification: Any man may use any mark to indicate his trade, but it is not every trade mark which he may choose to employ that he can register, because a man, without any permission of law, may use any word in the English language. For example, he might choose any word from the dictionary-the word "" delicious "" if he liked-and put it upon any article of an edible or potable character on the market. But he could not register that word, because it is an ordinary part of the English language; and nobody is entitled to go into the great domain of the English language and enclose a portion of it for his own exclusive benefitWhen .a trade mark is registered, it means that it is the exclusive property of the man who registers it. When honourable memberscome to read that portion of the B ill , they will understand why such care is taken to set out what shall not be included in a registrable trade mark. For instance, the Then words ""copyright"" and ""registered,"" come to the provisions dealing and the Royal arms, cannot be used, because they are common property. Part IV . of the Bill deals with the registration of trade marks. In it-and especially in clause 24-ther e will be found some deviations from the existing law, which can be more properly dealt with in Committee. The remainder of that part deals with thelegal position of making applications, opI presume that it is inposition, and decisions. Division 4, I may specially mention, provides that the registration shall be for fourteen years, but may be renewed.

I have not gone very minutely into these various clauses, because they are already fully acquainted with the general nature of of this B ill , which is intended as f a r as possible to consolidate and unify the law relating to trade marks, because it is of his goods may go throughout the Commonwealth'. He is not required to make six varying success. In one State, perhaps, a As a result, I think that we made in the scheme now submitted as compared with that which reached us from the I stamped with their own mark is no innovation in English law. turies each little guild and corporation had its goods so marked. that was the case, and it is the case af the present time.

Mr .CONROY -In the case of the guilds, the goods were their own production. of the unions. union labour and partlv by non-union. doubt, will fully express their views upon this subject in Committee; but I wish now to succinctly put before the House the ideas embodied in this Bill. English statutes for a long time backwhich will be found enumerated in the well known text book, Sebastian on Trade Marks, it will be seen that in statute after statute the workers' mark has been applied with authority. It may be applied in various ways, and in some companies each member of the company or guild or trade has had his own special mark to identify his workmanship. In various Acts of Parliament I do not wish to occupy time by enumerating the details of them-the principle has been recognised in England for centuries back of having goods stamped with the workers' mark. In the existing Act of New South Wales, No. 19, of 1900-whic h is, I think, a repetition in a somewhat more modern form of the Trade Marks Act of 1865 of that State, which itself was an application as closely as possible of the English Act of 1.862-ther e will be found words to which I invite the attention of honourable members. In that Act, "" trade-mark "" is defined as follows:"" Trade mark"" includes any mark lawfully used by any person to denote any goods to be goods of tlie manufacture or merchandise of such person, or to be goods of any particular descripthat is the uniontion made or sold by such person. In the same section "" manufacture"" is de'fined to include "" workmanship and production."" the mark which may be placed upon various goods by any worker. It will thus be seen that there is no novelty in the proposal that goods may be so stamped as to identify the workmanship, or the guild by which they are produced. I can see very little indeed in the nature of an innovation in the provision that a trade union may have a mark to indicate its work; but independently of any precedent, I have asked myself whether there is any fair reason for the course proposed. Eveni f there were no precedent, is there any fair reason for saying that a trade union should not have a mark to indicate the goods made, sold, or selected by its members? I can find no reason for saying, for example, that any company or firm, or federation of employers or of employees, should not have some mark to designate their goods. I fail to see why they should not have a mark of their own if they choose, provided that it is not to be used for the oppression of another person. learned gentleman read of the American experience ? it very careful consideration. The question raised by tlie honourable member is a very pertinent one, and I shall deal with it at once. The experience of the United States, put shortly, is that a union mark is only to be employed when its use is permitted by the union concerned. pose to go further; they propose to compel' a union to allow a mark to be used. States no one is allowed to use a union label without the permission of the unionaffected, and the Bill as sent down from the Senate is framed on similar lines. It provides, as passed by another place, that a union mark must not be used by any person unless he is authorized. Clause 76 provides that upon registration of a trade union mark, the union by which it is registered shall be deemed: to be the proprietor, and shall be entitled to the exclusive use 1 of the mark. Then in sub-clause (2) it is provided thatThe rights of the proprietor of the trade unionmarksha'I be deemed to be infringed by the unauthorized use, in respect of the goods in respect of which it is registered, of a mark identical, or substantially identical, with the trade union markThat closely approximates to er so nearly resembling it as to be likely todeceive. propose to accept that provision. already been circulated by us.

327,Mr Isaacs,"Can the honourable memlong as this be provided for, I see no danger of oppression. ( But there is another class ot casejfor which provision wil] have to be made. It is not always possible to make goods wholly by union labour. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the details of trade to be able to go full y into all particulars; but let us take the case of caps, which, with the exception of the peaks, are manufactured wholly by union labour. In such circumstances, it would not do for any manufacturer to be able to say that the complete article was made by union labour, because that statement would not be true. A man has no right to make a statement that is untrue, and the manufacturer of a class of caps coming within the category to which 1 have just referred would not be, able to say that they were made wholly by union labour. In such circumstances, however, a. union might give him permission to so use its label as to show the extent to which the goods were made by union labour, but not to deceive the public by causing them to believe that the goods were made wholly by union labour. This is not as cogent an instance as can be found in many trades. Many goods are made partly iby union and partly by non-union labour, and I think that a manufacturer might wel-l be required to obtain the permission of a union to the placing of its, label on such articles. Bill provides for such cases? them in the list of amendments that has been circulated. The proposed new clause 77 in the list of amendments provides thatThe application of the union trade mark to goods shall be deemed to be unauthorizedWhere the use of the mark was authorized, no man could be said to be committing a breach of the Actunless(a) It is applied to goods which are the manufacture or workmanship or the product of the labour of members of the union exclusively, and is so applied by the employer of those members of the union; or by a member of the union by direction of the employer. In other words, if the goods are exclusively the product of union labour, the employer himself will have a tight to place the union label upon them without asking leave to do so, or a member of the union may place it on the goods by direction of the employer. In the next case, it is provided by the amendment in question that the application of the union trade mark to goods shall be deemed to be unauthorized unless(i) It is, by or under the authority of the union, applied to goods by the employer for whom they are made or manufactured, or by a member of the union by direction of the employer. This is put elastically, because it is felt that no union would give a manufacturer permission to put a union label oh non-union goods, and the public will therefore be protected. In the case of goods that are substantially, but not exclusively, the product of non-union labour, it might be unfair to the union concerned to allow its trade mark to be applied without permission. In that case, I have made a strong attempt, and, I think, a fair one, to safeguard the interests of every one, although I shall be glad to have the assistance of any honourable member who can show that the provision fails to carry out the object at which I have aimed. I think that I have answered the question of the honourable member for Corangamite about the American boycott. I believe that if this clause* had been in force in America there would not have been the difficulties that have been made manifest there, and which I gather, have arisen through the action of unions, in saying to manufacturers, "" No matter how you conform to union conditions, you shall not have the right, under any circumstances, to put the union mark upon your goods unless you submit to some further terms."" Act has now been declared ultra vires. any case, that is beside the question, which is whether any wrong could be perpetrated under this B ill . ral know of any case such as he has referred to, in which a manufacturer who has conformed to union conditions has been prevented from using the union mark? read certain complaints of a general nature which have been made, together with the objections of some honourable senators, who thought that the B i ll might be used in an oppressive way. I have endeavoured to meet those objections, and I do not think it likely that the B i ll will be used in an oppressive way; but that the clause which I shall propose will do substantial justice to all.

We have heard He will not be of so-called ipnions of employees which were not bond fide unions of employees, and without some such provision as this, it would be quite easy for a make-believe union of employees to adopt Thus, while it is a union trade mark, and for employers to use it. So long as a union of employees is bond-fide, it has power to register a union trade mark, but if it is not bond-fide, it will have no right to parade as such. Proposed new clause 78c is a very important W ill he haw to subsection, and I invite the particular attention of honourable members to it, because it aims at an indication of the intention of this Parliament that no use shall be made of this power with regard to union trade marks, which shall at all countenance the idea that there may be in future a breach of the ordinary criminal laws of the State. It may convey that impression ? It will be deemed to be larly how it might be so used, but arguments are often used which are surprising. jection to the clause to which the honourable and learned gentleman is about to refer, but I do not see a reason for it . per clause to have in the B ill , because, without it, it might be said -that the new For power given to unions to register union trade marks would inferentially give them the power to do more in the direction of exerting pressure than they were entitled to do before. will not be able to set up common law rights against the rights given in the Bill, as was done in the Tajf Vale caseThe propreventing any unfair use of the powers of the Bill in the way of oppression or coercton, wi 11 be preserved.

Debate (on journed. RULE : . DISABILITY External Affairs) -The request preferred by the leader of the Opposition was so reasonable, in view of the amendments of a serious character which are proposed to be made in the Trade Marks Bill, that it was impossible to deny his wish. As we have passed two Bills this evening, and have made some progress with another, I move:That the House do now adjourn. on this occasion to refer to a question which I addressed to the Minister of Home Affairs last Wednesday, with reference to competitive railway rates. Minister whether he had any information as to the stage that had been reached in the negotiations between the States, with a view to coming to an agreement to abolish preferential railway rates. He made answer that New South Wales had been try|ing for years to arrive at a settlement, but without success -He mentioned that, in 1895, the Commissioners of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia arrived at an agreement, but it was rejected by the Victorian Government. So far as Victoria was concerned, it was stated that si number of conferences had been held, but all had failed to arrive 'at a satisfactory settlement. In regard to Queensland, it was stated that no action had been taken, as that State had never been approached by any of the other States. In the case of South Australia, the reply was that no finality had been reached'. It was further stated that so far as Western Australia was concerned, the matter Was now under consideration. Judging from these answers, the Minister has not been supplied by the officers of his Department with the facts which really ought to have been brought under the notice of the GoI do not wish to interfere vernment. As far back as November, 1901, I drew the attention of the then Minister of Home Affairs to the violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution, by the fierce competition for the trade of certain districts. I particularly introduced by the Victorian Commissioners, which was alleged to be intended to counteract a similar rate charged by South Australia-the existence of which I denied. or FEDERAL This Victorian rate was applicable to the section of railway between Dimboola and Servicetown, and its object was to prevent the .trade of that district from going to South Australia, or to hamper fhe trade of the settlers in that part of Victoria with the adjoining State, and induce them to go to Melbourne. I asked the Minister to direct the attention of the Premiers of the States to the existence of these rates, and suggest a renewal of the attempt made in 1895 to come to an agreement to abolish the nates, and thus render it unnecessarv to institute an Inter-State Commission. The Minister promised that something should be done, and, in answer to a question asked byi me on the 28th May, 1902, he stated that it was his intention to oall the attention of the Premiers of the States to the matter, with I asked the a view to an agreement being entered into by the Railways Commissioners. Nothing seems to have been done-a t least no substantial effect followed. Communications of a somewhat ambiguous character passed between the Ministers of some of the States, but nothing was done. On several occasions I called the attention of Ministers to the existence of competitive rates, but no attempt was made to bring about their abolition by agreement. The upshot was that In March, 1904, a meeting took place in Melbourne, at which the Commissioners and general managers of the railways of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland decided to appoint a board to formulate some scheme for readjusting the rates. That board met several times in Melbourne, and its report was presented and adopted at a meeting which was held in Melbourne",52,Trade Marks Bill Second Reading

359,Motion By Mr Reid) Addirected Attention To A Rate That Had Been,"on the 12th September, 1904. A further meeting of the Railway Commissioners was held in January, 1905, and it was then arranged to adopt practically all the resolutions as regards the competitive rates in certain districts, called competitive districts, that were embodied in the report of the board. An agreement was entered into which was dated May, 1905, but which came into operation as from some date in March. It would appear from the answer given by the Minister that the officers of his Department are to some extent ignorant of what is passing on this very important matter between the Railways Commissioners of the States, because he made absolutely no reference to the fact that in January last an agreement based upon the report of experts was adopted, and that that agreement, which was dated 28th of May, had operated retrospectively as from ist March, 1905. I may say that Queensland had backed out of the arrangement. from Queensland nof having been approached by the other States, and so far from that State having occupied the position of simple innocence that has been assumed, it was represented at the meeting held in March, 1904, at which the board of experts was appointed. When, however, the report of that board was presented in September, 1904, Queensland backed out of the arrangement; it withdrew as soon as the resolution was submitted that all secret rebates should be disclosed for tlie information of all the States concerned the honourable member are not those which I read in the House. The wrong particulars have, through some inadvertence, been inserted in the first edition of Hansard. The correct answers will, I understand, be found in fhe second edition. rely upon, and certainly the answers astonished me. Queensland refused to become a party to the agreement dated May, 1905. One would imagine from the information given from time to time that preferential rates upon our railways had been virtually abolished. N6 doubt the rates between 'Serviceton ,aind> DimbqdHa, ;to which I previously referred, have been abolished, but the Commissioners have not abolished such rates as do not recognise the geographical position of the competitive districts. Notwithstanding the agreement entered into, in which Queensland refused to join, I find that the railway authorities of that State are advertising the fact that they are carrying wool from Longreach) to Rockhampton,. a distance of 428 miles, and from Charleville to Brisbane, a distance of 483 miles, for Â£ 2 per ton, the same rate that is charged upon the railway from Hergott to Port Augusta, in South Australia, which is over 200 miles shorter. It is all very, well for apparently inspired statements to be made from ""time to time to the effect that preferential railway rates have been; abolished. Queensland advertisement referred to by the honourable and learned member? information is derived from a reliable source. The Queensland^lines referred to compete with the South Australian railway, from Hergott to Port Augusta, and the low rates charged are evidently intended Sof a r to divert traffic from the proper outlet at Hergott. I ask the Minister to look into the whole matter, and ascertain what really has been done. Apparently the agreement which has been entered into merely provides that the rates are to be raised all round, but that the existing volume of traffic is to be in all cases regarded as sacred. In other words, whatever advantage has been gained by any State under the competitive system is to be preserved to it . That is one of the resolutions which were arrived at in September, 1904, and which' I believe were adopted by the agreement of May, 1905. I have a copy of ""that resolution, which reads as follows: That the Commissioners in Conference, having given careful consideration to the question of rates in traffic to and from territory where competition exists, and with the object of obtaining such increase in revenue for the service rendered as the conditions will permit, and, at the same time, maintaining the status quo in respect of I had only Hansard to the tonnage of each class and description of goods, to and from such territory as is carried by each of the States concerned, hereby enter into the following agreement as a modus vivendi. They then proceed to set out certain rates, which are to be applicable for the future. Those rates might be increased up to the limit of the ordinary rates; but the Stateshad the right, if necessary, to keep them down at or near the old limits, if by raising them they were likely to lose any volume of the traffic which had been acquired under the competitive rates. In other words, the old evil was, as far as necessitated by, maintenance of the volume, to be perpetuated. If a State by",53,Members In State Elections And State Members In Commonwealth Elections

367,Mr Webster (Gwydir),"I wish tolikewise. I do not think that two wrongs make a right, or that the Commonwealth Parliament is justified in establishing a precedent of that character, even though the States Legislatures may not remove the disability imposed upon Federal representatives. In New South Wales the clause to which I refer was inserted' in the B ill after a long sitting, which extended over twenty-three hours, and when the House was weary. There was not a word of discussion upon that amendment which deprived Federal representatives of the right to become candidates at the State elections. Some prominent members, who are pretty active in most debates, admitted that they had no knowledge of the presence of that provision in the Electoral B ill . ignorance ? general, and that would not be complimentary to the Plouse as a whole. not so general as the honourable member imagines. orable member is fairly well versed in matters behind the scenes, and no doubt he could shed some enlightenment upon what actually did happen. At any rate, the New South Wales Hansard does not show that there was any general knowledge of the proposal to insert such a provision in the B ill . As a matter of fact, there was not a great deal of discussion in this House when a similar provision was submitted. It was dealt with in a very gingerly fashion, which evidenced that honourable members did not think too seriously about it. The honourable and learned member for Angas did state his opinions, and I believe that the honourable and learned member for Werriwa raised objections, but he did not urge them very persistently. When the Bill reached the Senate that Chamber was of opinion that the provision was not a fair one to place upon the statute book, because of the embargo which it imposed upon members of the States Legislatures. As a result, it was actually defeated in the other House. During the interval I appealed to the Premier of New South Wales to repeal the law which the Parliament of that State had enacted. Sir John See accordingly entered into communication with the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth"", urging him not to force the objectionable provision through both Houses of the Commonwealth Legislature, and promising that if it were not placed upon the statute-book, he would immediately proceed' to repeal the law on the subject in New South Wales. The present Premier of that State has also intimated his anxiety to remove the barrier of which I complain, so as to allow the people the widest choice in the election of their parliamentary representatives. He has intimated that if this Parliament will take similar action, he will introduce a Bill to repeal the arbitrary provision which obtains in the law of that State. South Wales Premier promised to do that? finite promise that if the present embargo be removed from the Commonwealth law If it were, it was he is prepared to take similar action in regard to the State law. Either we are democrats or we are not. If we are what we profess to.be-advocate s of democratic laws-w e should carry our policy to its logical issue, and so amend our laws that memI know that the honbers of the Legislatures of the States will not be ineligible for election to this House. Why should we place an embargo upon a member of the State Parliament who might desire to become a member of this Legislature, and who might be an acquisition to the political life of the Commonwealth ? The States Houses are supposed to be a training ground for those who wish to reach the higher and rarer atmosphere of Federal politics, and I contend that to debar a member of a State Legislature from en1 tering this House is to adopt a most undemocratic course. I tried to secure the removal of this embargo when the question was before the Senate, and also when it r was discussed in this Chamber a second time, but was unsuccessful. In these circumstances, when I decided to enter Federal politics, I had to resign my seat in the State Legislature of New South Wales. fore the House two vears ago. sard report of the debate, but do not know that the honourable member put these considerations before the House. them very much better than the honourable member has done. but I do not seek any credential from ihe honourable member for Parramatta, either as to the matter of any of my speeches, or",55,Members In State Elections And State Members In Commonwealth Elections

379,Mr Webster,"Probably that is so,the manner in which I handle it. I was disappointed with the reply made by the Prime Minister. I recognise that we have in the honourable and learned gentleman die who has been at the back of many democratic reforms in Victoria, arid who was one of the strongest supporters of the democratic provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution Bill. In view of Ihese facts, I think I have a right to expect him to adopt a logical attitude in regard to this matter, and to say that he is prepared to ask Parliament to remove the present embargo. As the honourable and learned gentleman has had time for reflection since answering the question that I put to him, without notice, I hope that he will now give me a reply that will be in conformity with the democratic professions of this Chamber, and the democratic aspirations of the people of the Commonwealth. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has a penchant for playing the rdle of the hero. To-night he seems to have indulged in another exhibition of that kind, and has professed to be very anxious about the members of the States Parliaments. MavI suggest that they are quite able to take care of themselves? ""While the honourable member has gently gibed at all. those who, while in, this Parliament and in the Parliaments of the States, did not, according to him, look after their own business, I would remind him that they were quite as vigilant in the discharge of their duties and obligations as he isa fact that he will be able to prove on further ransacking the pages of Hansard. lodged against the exclusion of members of the States Parliaments from this Legislature, it certainly cannot lie in the mouths of States legislators themselves to make that charge. The way is open to them to take the first step by removing the embargo they have placed on members of this Parliament. If they did so, we should probably follow suit. Parliament has already done so. monwealth Parliament give them a guar intee that that will be done? freely on this question, because I believe, with the honourable member, that this greater liberty should operate both in the State and Federal arenas. But I do say that ri-e States Parliaments have no ground for complaint. Whatever was done in the Federal arena was simply in emulation of the example set by nearly all the States Parliaments. The honourable member for Gwydir is very anxious about the rights of. honourable members, but would it not to much better for him to display/ a Jirtle ot his remarkable energy in advocating the rights of the electors who, after all, ire particularly concerned in this mauer ? the one question. have raised is of infinitely more consequence than the point affecting honoraole members. The honourable member for Gwydir has talked of the rights of members of Parliament, but we have not heard a word from him about the rights of the electors. The embargoes placed on members of the Legislatures of the Commonwealth and the States are not a matter of nearly so much moment, and I have yet to learn that there is any strong demand on the part of electors of the country for the change which the honourable member advocates. We have nothing before us to show that any vigorous demand for this reform is being made by public meetings in the States. at times by this House with which the, people are not concerned. we ought to be more concerned with the rights of the voters outside than with the privileges of honourable members themselves. able member. that the honourable member will assist me in urging on the Government to the work of equalizing the Federal voting power of the Continent. When we have plucked the beam out of our own eye in this respect, we may fairly turn our attention to the infinitely less important question of the rights and privileges of the members of the various States Parliaments. If the honourable member would assist us in the apparently impossible task of looking after the interests of the electors of Australia, I should give him my best support in dealing with the matter to which he has alluded. As the Prime Minister is present^ I should like to ask him a question.

The Government of New South Wales are kindly sending us a supply of copies of their printed paper. any objection to laying that paper on the table of the House? of Home Affairs) -With regard to the remarks that have been made by the honourable and learned member for Angas, I am sorry that, owing to a slip, the. wrong answers appeared in reply to the questions which were put by him. Had he seen the correct answers, I do not think that he would have said what he did with respect to the Department of Home Affairs. The matter of preferential railway rates received the very careful attention of the late Minister of Home Affairs. Just prior to his retirement from office, he sent letters to the various Railways Commissioners, and the replies which I read in the House had in some cases been received only.a short time before. Home Affairs took a strong interest also as a private member in this question, and in the light of that fact the answers seemed inexplicable. of the Department being behindhand in this matter, it has the latest information that it is possible to obtain. The honourable and learned member for Angas, however, has put certain aspects of the question before the House that are worthy of serious consideration, and I shall give them my careful attention. I have only to add that, as a matter of fact, the correct answers to which I have referred have appeared in the press. when it is proposed to ask tlie House to proceed with the consideration of the motion on the notice-paper relating to Home Rule. External Affairs) I have had no requtst from the honourable member in charge cf that motion for any Government time to be placed at his disposal, but have reason to suppose it possible, from the state of the notice-paper, that the honourable member for Dalley may have to-morrow the opportunity for which he yearns.

It was felt, however that a distinction should be drawn between the Federal and the States spheres, in order that there should be no clashing one with the other, and that one of the best methods to avoid any clashing of interests, was to make it clear that, so long as members held a seat in one Parliament or 1 heother, it should not be open to them to become rivals.
