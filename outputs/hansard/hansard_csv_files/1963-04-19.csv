8,Sir Robert Menztes,"Sir, I am uotto the Treasurer by referring to advertisements which appeared in January this year in which the Treasury invited applications from very highly qualified persons for posts in what I understand to be a new section of the Treasury designated as the Economic and Financial Survey Division. Can the right honourable gentleman say whether this is designed to assist in the promotion of coherent economic policies, in providing more up-to-date assessments of economic trends than hitherto have been practicable and in bringing about closer liaison between the Government and private enterprise? If not, in what way is this division intended out of hospital and until he is able to to be of service? new division will serve in all the direcresult will be announced during the tions which the honourable gentleman has Budget session. indicated: It will have the task of extending beyond the current financial year or the one immediately ahead the more important estimates and analyses of economic and financial trends which now are a question about the averaging system of carried out by the General Financial and assessing income tax, which I raised in Economic Policy Branch of the Treasury. the House last year.

As honourable members know, there is a very generous arrangement for tuberculosis sufferers whereby they may receive a 100 per cent, rate pension for the rest of their lives after the disease has been diagnosed. In addition, they have the benefit of hospital facilities. The arrangement goes so far as to provide that a person who is classified as having tuberculosis but later is found not to have it shall receive a 100 per cent, rate pension for the rest of his life. It will be agreed that that is a very generous provision. In addition, benefits are paid for a period after a person comes obtain employment. As I said earlier, these and other repatriation benefits are to revert to it, even under a penalty of, say, four or five years, and secondly, raising the limit of £4,000 to a sum which is more in keeping with to-day's financial imported from Japan for the Moonie to Brisbane pipeline?

I shall make of sterling and, for that matter, of the inquiries and ascertain whether the details dollar, as the two great reserve currencies can be made available to him. addressed to the Treasurer. What amount of Australia's overseas reserves is at present held in the form of sterling? What guarantees, if any, have been received by the Australian Government against loss in the real value of these reserves, which could run into many tens of millions of pounds if sterling were to be devalued? If, in fact, no such guarantees can be obtained, will the Treasurer take steps to hold such part of these sterling reserves as can be readily moved in some other form which will protect their real value? held in sterling reserves is in excess of £400,000,000. I am not able to give the precise figure to the honourable gentleman. Of course, it is not practicable for one country, acting unilaterally, to safeguard itself entirely against the possibility of the devaluation of any currency. Indeed, a transfer from one currency to another for the purpose of protecting the interests of the owner of those reserves might lead to a situation in which devaluation occurred in the country to which thc reserves were transferred. So we cannot eliminate all risks. The only way in which a country could protect itself would be to hold all reserves in gold. That would be impracticable and in any case would deprive Australia of substantial interest earnings overseas on its reserves. The United Kingdom Government has always very firmly maintained the view that it should hold the present exchange value of sterling, one of the great reserve currencies of the world. I am certain that the efforts of the present Administration in the United Kingdom are directed towards maintaining sterling as a strong currency at its present value. The other safeguard, which I think is a very real one these days, is that all the major economies of the world are linked F.2954/63 -R -[29 ] and are subject to the Articles of Agreement of the fund in making honourable any variation of their exchange rate.

This matter has not arisen so far. There is no instruction along the lines mentioned by the honourable member. The qualifications for entry to the Royal Military College are laid down specifically. They are based on the educational standard, the physical condition and the character of the applicants. Those are the only matters that are mentioned in the conditions of entry.

Naturally, however, we are keeping in touch with developments, even though there is no commit al. Shipping and Transport will remember that on Wednesday of last week, in a written reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Stirling, he stated that any decision to proceed with the standardization of the railway between Broken Hill and Port Pirie, in accordance with the 1949 agreement, would depend upon confirmation that the tangible benefits obtainable were commensurate with related expenditure. In view of the reply which the Prime Minister gave to the question asked by the honourable member for Wakefield a few minutes ago, I now ask the Minister whether confirmation of the tangible benefits was received last week or this week. of the Opposition will recollect that the Prime Minister gave a very comprehensive outline of the events leading to the decision. Those events were discussed very thoroughly by the Cabinet and the question of results being commensurate with expenditure was considered very fully. I assure the honourable member that any decision on rail standardization has been based on the very principle that he has mentioned. is directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service. How many seasonal workers in Queensland are employed in the sugar and meat industries? What is the average period of employment each year? What would be the average weekly earnings over that average period? Is there a wage loading for these workers to carry them over the off season when the sugar mills and meat works are closed down? Are these workers eligible to register as unemployed and to receive unemployment benefit without a means test? just how many seasonal workers are employed in both the meat and the sugar industries. BeforeI answer the specific questions asked by the honourable gentleman I should say that we all welcome the fact that there are large numbers of seasonal workers who move into the sugar and meat industries. Those are highly important industries and they could not carry on if tbe flow of seasonal workers were cut off. As to the specific questions I think that there are about 15,000 to 16,000 seasonal workers who move into both the sugar and the meat industries. To estimate the average number of weeks of employment and the average weekly wages we have to divide these workers into various classes, and, of course, the pay and period of work vary. In the meat industry the average period of employment for butchers, for example, is about 25 to 30 weeks a year. The average for cane-cutting is about 25 to 28 weeks a year and the average for unskilled and semi-skilled hands in the sugar mills is about 32 to 37 weeks a year. The honourable gentleman's third question related to average weekly earnings. For semi-skilled and unskilled hands in the sugar mills, the average pay is about £20 to £22 a week. According to Mr Commissioner Austin the average pay of, say, boners and cutters in the northern meat works is between £40 and £50 a week. This might rise to as much as £80 a week for contract labour. A cana-cutter might receive an average o £40 to £50 a week f and some gun cutters earn up to £1,700 a year. These payments to seasonal workers carry a loading because of the seasonal nature of the employment. Lastly, the honourable member for Maranoa asked whether these seasonal workers are entitled to receive unemployment benefit without a means test. An income test is applied but that, of course, applies to income earned after registration for employment. These workers are perfectly entitled to register after they have completed their seasonal employment. H they comply with the conditions of what I may describe as the work test, they can",13,Overseas Telephone Calls

26,Mr Mcmahon,"It is difficult to tellobtain unemployment benefit. If you look at the statistics relating to seasonal employment-thi s is important to the honourable gentleman, who happens to have to live with the problem-yo u will probably find that during February about 6,000 seasonal workers were registered for employment. Those were additional to the normal number of persons registered. I think that I have answered all the questions asked by the honourable gentleman. I shall consider them further in detail and if I can add anything to what I have said I shall do so. for Social Services whether it is correct to say that there has been no increase in the rates of child endowment since June, 1950. Also, is it correct to say that the rates would now need to be increased to at least 9s. for the first child and 18s. for children other than the first, to bring the payments to somewhere near the same relationship to the current basic wage as the payments of 5s. and 10s. had to the basic wage of 1950? If that is the position, does it mean also that mothers to-day are receiving by way of endowment an amount which, in actual purchasing power, has only about half the value of the amount mothers received in 1950? If so, has the Government any good reason for allowing such an unreasonable state of affairs to continue? If the Government has not a good reason, will the Minister treat the matter as urgent and arrange for the payments to be appropriately increased in the next Budget? except for the introduction of endowment for the first child, there has been no variation in the rates of child endowment since 1950, but the question has been examined from time to time and the Government has felt it necessary to make any variation in social service benefits apply to other sections of the community. I direct the attention of honourable members to a statement reported to have been made by the New South Wales Minister of Justice on 17th April last, when addressing the annual conference of the public service association. Referring to increased costs, he saidIt is not the Government which has to find the money, but the people of New South Wales. That, Sir, is common to all forms of government expenditure and it is particularly applicable to social service benefits. ARMY LAND HOLDINGS. the Interior inform me whether the survey of the army land to be released at George's Heights, Mosman, has been completed? If the survey has been completed, can the Minister state the acreage of the land involved and when the release of the land to the New South Wales Government will be effected? Can a covenant be placed on the release to ensure that the land is preserved for posterity as a natural reserve and recreation area for the general public? been undertaken by my department. Speaking from memory, I would say that the area was approximately 40 acres, but I could not be precise on that point. The land has been offered to the New South Wales Government and we are awaiting a reply from it. for Repatriation a question concerning the Repatriation General Hospital at Springbank, South Australia. Is the Minister able to indicate when the recently-constructed psychiatric ward will be opened and patients transferred from the old ward to the new section, which contains the most modern equipment and amenities and reflects great credit on all who have been associated with it? When the changeover takes place, will it be possible to use the old psychiatric ward for general purposes and thus relieve the acute shortage of accommodation in the general section until the planned additional wards for general purposes are constructed? obviously keeps closely in touch with the situation at the Repatriation General Hospital, Springbank, because the work on the new psychiatric ward was completed only in the last few days. Work has now commenced on equipping the new ward, which is of modern brick construction and, I think, one of the most up-to-date of its type",14,Employment An D Unemployment

The new ward is designed to hold 39 patients and also has out-patient facilities. I expect that the openJanuary, 1963, it was 1,568,400, showing ing will take place on 4th June; and when I perform the opening ceremony I hope to see the honourable member there. As to using the present wards to relieve pressure on ihe accommodation, that certainly will be done. As I told the honourable member previously, we hope in the next financial year to construct two additional new wards at the Springbank hospital to relieve pressure on bed accommodation that exists at the moment. In the meantime the accommodation that will become vacant when the patients are transferred to the new ward can be made available for ordinary patients, to relieve the position that exists at the moment. WOOL PROMOTION. to the Treasurer. I refer to the statement of Mr Vines of the International Wool Secretariat that if more wool is to be sold on ber must have an extraordinarily compliworld markets at payable prices, very much more money must be made available for promotion. Will the Treasurer consider establishing a partnership between the Government and the wool industry, which is a most vital Australian industry, by helping wool-growers to meet the cost of additional promotion? able member proposes would represent a significant departure from current policy. It has not been the practice of the Government to make a direct contribution towards promotion, because it believes that this is the responsibility of the particular industries concerned. What we have done in appropriate cases has been to make substantial contributions towards research in various fields. In the case of the wool industry our research contribution is currently about £1,000,000 a year. However, I shall undertake to give some study to what the honourable member has put to us, as a matter of policy. to the Mimster for Labour and National Service. I preface it by referring to the latestfiguresreleased by the Commonwealth Statistician, showing that the number of males employed in private industry in November, 1960, was 1,579,000, whilst in a decline of 10,600. The figures show, further, that the number of males in government employment in November, I960, was 629,700, whilst in January, 1963, it was 661,000, so that the number had increased by 31,300. Does the decline in male employment in private industry reflect a lack of confidence in this Government's economic policy? Do thefiguresshow also that the unemployed are being absorbed on government relief works only? Has the male work force increased in the last two years by approximately 80,000? If so, having in mind the fact that the Commonwealth Statistician's figures disclose an increase of only 20,700 in the male work force, how does the Minister account for the disappearance from the work force of about 60,000 male workers? cated and mathematical mind. ber asks why. I ask him to repeat the figures. As I say, the honourable member for Newcastle must have an extraordinarily complicated and mathematical mind. I found it impossible to follow his figures. But I can answer in a general way the various questions which he has asked. His first statementa rather foolish one, 1 thought, in view of what was said yesterday by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-relate d to confidence in the economy and, naturally enough, Sir, in this Government. If die honourable member wants a statement by a semi-judicial authority to the effect that confidence has been restored and that the economy is sound, then I recommend that he read the decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in full. As to the second part of his question, let me state categorically that the increase in the occupied work force last year was 100,000.

In the last few months-thi s is of great importance-the number of registrants for employment has substantially declined. Large numbers of those previously registered are going into private industry. From my point of view, we must have a balance in the economy between pubhc enterprise and private industry. I think the balance is a fairly good one. I hope for the sake of those now unemployed that there will be a significant increase of employment in the private sector. I would direct the attention of the honorcapital funds made available to it from the able gentleman and of all honourable members on the other side of the House to one other point. If they look at the industrial survey in the last part of the Minister's report, they will see that last month there was a significant increase in employment in private industry. We usually find that if an improvement is shown by our figures, which cover only one sector, there is subsequently a substantial improvement in the number of wage and salary earners shown in the wage and salary statistics published by the Commonwealth Statistician. As the honourable gentleman introduced a political note, I say this to him: Others have said that confidence has bsen fully restored and that prospects are good'. I endorse that statement with all my heart, because I know it to be correct. There is no reason to be despondent. The only people who want to introduce a note of despondency are those sitting on the other side of the House. They want to make mischief out of the misfortunes of some.

I had such a discussion as recently as yesterday, when we spoke about the present capital position of the Commonwealth Development Bank and the resources available to it. It seems clear that, without any further addition, the bank has adequate resources to enable it to continue lending at current rates for at least another twelve months. When the bank was established, we contemplated that it would supplement the Commonwealth Budget with loan raisings principally from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. We envisage that in future the bank will have resources available to it not only from capital funds voted by the Parliament but also from its loan raisings.

Australian tional assistance for 1963-64 will enable the processors not only received no subsidy, processors to be paid a bounty rate more but were forced to compete for their milk closely approaching that payable to butter supplies with the butter and cheese factories and cheese producers thus bringing about a which were enabled to pass on the bounty more equitable distribution of the bounty to producers.

The Government considers that it can assist all sections of the industry by encouraging this diversion through increased exports of processed milk products. This is the main purpose of the bill. The industry organizations have expressed their satisfaction at the success of the scheme in the current season and have sought a continuance of the bounty for a further twelve months. I commend the bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr PoUard) adjourned. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 28th March (vide page 161), on motion by Sir Garfield BarwickThat the bill be now read a second time. Speaker, this bill is not the comprehensive Copyright Bill which honourable members have been awaiting for some years. It will be remembered that in the Governor General's Speech opening the Parliament on 4th August, 1954, after the general election, a promise was made that a committee would be appointed to consider what alterations were desirable to the copyright law of ths Commonwealth. On 15th September, 1958, the Copyright Law Review Committee was appointed. On 22nd December, 1959, the committee made its report. On 18th April, 1961, the report was circulated to honourable members and any members of the public who were interested. At the same time the Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick) made a statement in the House about the report. I note that on 5th April last year, in answer to a question that I directed to him on notice concerning this matter, the Attorney-General expressed the hope that he would introduce legislation regarding copyright during the autumn session of 1963. The legislation on which the committee reported over three years ago and about which the Attorney-General expressed that hope twelve months ago is not the legislation now before us. It is urgent and desirable that the Parliament should pass new copyright laws because there are now three international conventions concerning copyright which Australia has not yet ratified or to which it has not acceded. Australians used the world's most widespread language. It is the language which the greatest number of nations recognize as their official language and which the greatest number of other nations use as their second language. The written and recorded word in English is, above all others, the natural subject of copyright. The first of the conventions to which I refer is the International Convention for the Protection of Literary, Scientific and Artistic Works, signed at Brussels on 26th June, 1948. Australia signed the convention and has not yet ratified it. The second convention is the Universal Copyright Convention and three protocols annexed to it, signed at Geneva on 6th September, 1952. Australia signed the convention and has not International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations, concluded at Rome on 26ih October, 1961. Australia attended the conference at which the convention was drawn up but Australia did not sign the convention and Australia has not acceded to it. The first two conventions mentioned were the subjects of recommendations by the Copyright Law Review Committee. The amendments which would be required in the principal act to permit Australia to ratify the conventions are set out by the committee in paragraphs 38 and 39 of its report. The benefits that will come to Australia if we adopt the 1948 convention are set out by the committee in paragraph 50 of its report, as follows:We also mention that literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works of Australian origin are growing and receiving increasing recognition abroad. The United Kingdom will, we think, remain one of the main users of Australian copyright material and we are of the view that our authors should in that country be entitled to the same copyright protection as British authors. This can only be ensured by granting in Australia reciprocal benefits to British authors.",19,Processed Milk Products Bounty Bill 1963
48,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [11.24],"Mr yet ratified it. The third convention is theIn order that Australian authors may have those reciprocal benefits in Britain the committee recommended that we should ratify the 1948 convention. In paragraph 52 of its report the committee puts the following arguments in favour of adopting the second convention:The benefits to be derived from accession to the Universal Copyright Convention are obvious, particularly in that it enables Australian copyright owners to receive copyright protection in the to lavish undue praise on Australia's first United States for published works with a minimum of formality. At present published Australian works do not receive full protection in the United Slates unless they are manufactured in that country. Adherence to the Universal Copyright Convention would free Australian authors from that requirement as well as otber American provisions regarding registration and notice -programme s under Intertel as meritorious The committee had made its report two years before the third convention was drawn up at a diplomatic conference in Rome in 1961. Parliament is restricted to legislating on copyrights as copyrights were understood at the time the British Parliament enacted the Australian Constitution at the beginning of the century. The committee refers to these doubts in paragraph 234 of its report. It is not inappropriate to assert, however, that copyrights are essentially the subject matter of treaties, and therefore one could prudently assume that this Parliament could pass laws on copyrights under its powers with respect to external affairs under paragraph xxix of section 51 of the Constitution. The benefit in this Parliament amending the Copyright Act to permit Australia to ratify the 1961 convention would be that many Australians then would be able to copyright a greater range of works in 1 tain and America and other English-speaking countries which can be expected to accede to or ratify the convention. Australian writers, dramatists, television producers and designers then would have the benefit of copyright in respect of the additional matters about which this convention makes arrangements and about which previous conventions have not. The additional matters are sufficiently indicated in the title of the convention which is expressed to be for the protection of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations. Australia could be expected to make under the laws of the various States and increasing contributions in these fields. Territories. There are considerable differAlready we have heard with pride that the ences in such methods of appeal. Very Australian Broadcasting Commission programme "" Four Corners"" is being televised in the United States of America. It can be hoped that the commission's participation in Intertel will result in further demand for AustraUan productions in other English-speaking countries including Britain, Canada and America whose television organizations participate in Intertel. When I make these comments I am not to be taken contribution to Intertel, a pretty insipid production about Tahiti. The next scheduled production is about Antarctica. Nevertheless, there is no reason to think that Australia should not produce-it certainly could produce, if it were allowed to do so as "" Four Corners "". The point I want to emphasize now is that when the Copyright Act is amended to permit Australia to There has been doubt whether accede to this third convention there will be still wider copyright advantages to Australian creative artists, not only in literature and drama on the stage but also in taped and recorded dramatic works on radio and television. This bill deals with the much narrower matter of disputes arising about the public performance of literary, dramatic, musical or other works or of recordings of such works. It amends the section of the principal act which states that when a dispute arises between the prospective performers and the copyright owners or their representatives-in Australia it is practically always the Australasian Performing Right Association Limited-ther e can be a voluntary arbitration. It appears that these provisions in fact have never been used. To judge from an amendment which the Minister has circulated, an application now has been received, under the provisions of this section, for the Attorney-General to appoint an arbitrator as the parties themselves have been unable to select one. The bill also provides a code for appeals from an arbitrator. Hitherto in this Parliament we have not provided that code. We have allowed any appeals from the arbitrator whom the parties select or the Attorney-General appoints to be determined properly, therefore, the Attorney-General arbitration laws and procedures. It is has ensured that the Commonwealth shall unfortunate that the vesting of the necessary exercise its rights under the Constitution judicial powers will mean some added work -on e might even say its obligations under for the High Court of Australia, which of the Constitution-to see that appeals from course is already fully occupied in dealing arbitrators are dealt with under a uniform with appeals from the supreme courts of national code. We applaud this initiative the various States and Territories as well and, therefore, support the bill. it is true, as the Deputy Leader of the this matter. If, for example, the CommonOpposition ( Mr Whidam) has pointed out, wealth Industrial Court were to be that we still have to face the question of nominated as the court of appeal, the act Australia's ratification of the three interwould immediately be placed out of line national conventions to which he referred with existing provisions. and which deal with copyright.

49,Mr Drury (Ryan) [11.37],No doubt Court is the appropriate court to deal with,22,Copyright Bill 1963
50,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [11.42],"Sir, Iinclined to think that in regard to matters emanating from the International Labour Organization and international conventions we are a sort of avant garde-that we are out in front-that is not really so. We have lagged behind in regard to many ordinary industrial conventions, but more so in relation to conventions which deal with the protection of books, music and other works of art. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed out, we have not ratified important conventions. The Brussels convention of 1948, which has an important general application, has been ratified by twelve countries and acceded to by twenty-two, but Australia's name does not appear in the list. It would seem that we have been quite careless about the subject of copyright. In the new world in which we live, broadcasting and television rights have assumed some importance. There is a great market for much of the written word and written music, but we are allowing a large proportion of this material to get into the hands of racketeers who are battening on the artistic industries and who, indeed, have done so from time immemorial. At Geneva an attempt was made to formulate a universal copyright law. But an Australian writer has no real security or protection in the United States of America and other English-speaking countries unless his publisher, who is not an Australian, takes out the copyright in his own name and attends to the whole matter. However, in doing that, the publisher has the right to sell the book for a certain royalty and some of the essential protection for the author is taken away. The Rome convention, also, was another step forward in an attempt to consolidate the copyright law. The writing game, as it may roughly be described, as distinct from the production of works of art, constitutes a very big industry. I have in mind people who sell stories, music, pictures or films in various forms, or patterns which are printed and therefore become subject to copyright rather than to patent law. All these works would be protected under the new conventions, which we have not accepted. It is high time that we did something about it. Syndication and first, second and third rights to novels and so forth are completely disregarded in this country. Many people who write for the overseas market, and also for the home market, have been mulcted of large sums of money because the entrepreneur has got in ahead of them. A fellow who lives in a garret, who writes his Australian novel slowly and puts it on an unhealthy and unhappy market, could make a lot more money if he were more business-like. I pay a tribute to not only the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for his fight in regard to the legal aspects of this matter, which for the most part are beyond the comprehension of the writer, but also the Attorney-General for desiring to codify the copyright law in the rather powerful document which I have read and which we shall discuss later. Let us not forget that a tremendous export market is being established-perhap s tortuously and slowly-for the Australian product, whether it is a book, a film, a painting, some other form of the graphic arts, or just some commercial writing. We must protect those people who may be able to hit the jackpot but who are mulcted by the multitude of people who batten on the writing game. In our copyright law, as in our Constitution, there are gaps through which you could drive a coach and four. We are debating a rather tight little bill which covers a lot of academic and legal arguments, but it is important for us as Australians to realize that in our copyright law there are tremendous gaps which would lead not only to Australian producers of works of art becoming frustrated and losing their money but also to the message which they wish to export losing its value. Works which are designed to sell the Australian way of life could be extremely important from the cultural viewpoint and extremely profitable from the viewpoint of any royalties that would accrue. I think it is well worthwhile at this moment to refer again to what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said about these conventions. The Brussels, Geneva and Rome conventions should be ratified forthwith. The bill now before us, in relation to which an amendment will be moved by the Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition and another by the Government, will doubtless be passed by the House. With diffusion by television, broadcast by radio, condensation by magazines, and definite stealings from books and other works having become almost a calling, nobody seems to have known what one's rights really have been. Associations have been formed which have purported to look after the author, the musician or the painter for a certain rakeoff; but it has been found that that associabelieve that the amendment foreshadowed tion has been making tremendous pronts and a very small amount of money has been accruing to the original producer. The provisions governing that situation are now being tightened up, but then we have the marginal problem about where ownership resides. In some cases copyright may be given to a publisher and in others there may be no copyright in existence. In some cases it is an open slather for the entrepreneur who wants to make something out of selling a work of art, a record or a piece of taped literature. The producers of all those works must be protected, but to ensure protection is a very difficult and exhausting task. The new provision governing the submission of these matters to arbitration is a step forward. There ought to be some final appeal so that a distressed writer could have a matter in dispute dealt with at the legal level and adjudicated upon. Therefore, this bill is an important step forward in tightening up our copyright laws. Nobody would ever dream of loshg onesixteenth of a centimetre of the benefit from our production of wool, wheat or any other primary product, but we lose in the aggregate a tremendous amount of revenue because anybody may adopt a slap-happy attitude to Australian copyright and do what he likes witb our books. A long time ago I wrote a bookI hope no one will think that I am being personal in mentioning it-calle d "" The Brierley Rose "", which dealt with the life of my family here in Canberra. It was printed in America as ""The Carolina Belle"". Needless to say, no Carolina belle has ever sent me a quid for what was a shocking piece of plagiarism. I know that the honourable member opposite who is trying to interject is a fan of mine. Copies of both books are in the library and he can get them if he wishes to do so. That was a genuine case of the kind of thing I mean, and it happens in so many instances. Nowadays, with the new production methods, such aa rotogravure, before an Australian writer or painter knows where he is his work is out of his hands and gone. I read the Attorney-General's report on copyright two or three times and it already has my approval. This small measure to provide for arbitration is a step in the right direction. I by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) is appropriate and I hope that it will be supported in a non-contentious way. The job of arbitrating should be given to a body which will arbitrate, so that matters in dispute may be dealt with more expeditiously. It should not be thought, Mr Deputy Speaker, that because disputes have not been taken to a tribunal so far there will not be any in the future. The fact is that there has been no defined place where a person could argue that he had copyright, or that he was being robbed. There are many producers of artistic works who would like to be able to take their case to a tribunal and argue it out. Once we have established a legal right to protect something that is produced by an individual we have moved well along the road to protecting our own copyright. Therefore, although this is a small bill, it is an important one. We give it our support, and I hope that the amendment proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will be agreed to. support the bill. It is very refreshing to be able to stand in the House and say that there is good fellowship and friendship between the people on that side of the House and those on this side. The comments of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and also those of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) were constructive and of value, with the exception of the reference to the proposed amendment by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but no doubt that matter will be dealt with at the committee stage. I wish to refer to the statement in the second-reading speech of the Attorney General( Sir Garfield Barwick) on the question of where appeals should lie. I remind the House that the Attorney General statedThe bill now before the House therefore seeks to set out in the act itself the law governing an",22,Copyright Bill 1963
51,Mr Snedden (Bruce) [11.54],"Iarbitration under the section so that recourse to State arbitration law will no longer be required. Not without some reluctance, because the Government has under consideration proposals for relieving the High Court of minor work, I have included in the bill provisions for vesting in the High Court such of the functions normally vested in a supreme court under the State laws as are necessary to the conduct of such an arbitration. The issue that arises here is the oftexpressed view of the Attorney-Generalthe most recent expression of it that I recall was at the legal convention in Hobart in January of this year-and of a wide range of people in the community, especially lawyers, that because of growing federal responsibilities and increasing federal areas of legislation and litigation, the High Court ought to be relieved of a great deal of the work which it in fact does. We in Australia are most fortunate to have a High Court which is composed of judicial omcers who are held in extremely high regard throughout the world. Many of their judgments on a wide range of law and on appeal matters are referred to elsewhere in the English-speaking world. In the area of appeal consideration, our High Court is the admiration of other countries. There is a necessity to set out the law clearly and precisely by way of appeal judgments, not only in the field of general law but also in the constitutional field. After 62 years of federation, I believe that we are still in the elementary or infant stages in terms of the limitation or delimitation, or of definition, of the areas of the powers inter se of the Commonwealth and the States. There is no doubt that there is really only one power in section 51 of the Constitution which has blossomed out at all, and that is the industrial arbitration power. If we look at the industrial arbitration power alongside the trade and commerce power, we see that a quite incredible difference of construction has been given to the arbitration power compared with the commerce power. I am a federalist and believe that we should maintain the federal system. I believe in federalism very strongly, and my belief in it carries me to the view that the powers which devolve upon the Commonwealth ought to be exercised-no t immediately, of course, but over a period-to the full extent. That is one of the reasons why I am in favour of this Copyright Bill. There is a clear constitutional power, in section 51, in relation to copyright. Because of the situation which has arisen, I feel that we should have a federal supreme court, so that the High Court could be left to its constitutional and appeal duties in terms of the general law. In fact, it seems that the High Court is already very sorely tried in handling the legal matters which come before it. My colleagues at the Bar in Melbourne have told me that there is often a considerable delay before a matter of original jurisdiction can be handled, and that is probably true of the Sydney registry to an equal extent. There is difficulty in finding a single judge in the jurisdiction required. Of course, in cases of appeal matters one expects a long time to pass before the actual decision is given, because so often the decision involves a review of the whole of the relevant law. Such decisions are valuable to the community as a whole and to lawyers especially. It appears to me that the present intentions are that the federal supreme court will grow from the bench which is called the Commonwealth Industrial Court. As we know, that court is composed of Mr Justice Spicer, who is the Chief Judge, Mr Justice Dunphy, Mr Justice Joske and Mr Justice Eggleston. This bench was formulated originally to deal with industrial matters. At the time that it was formulated there was a judge of the Australian Capital Territory who, I think, was Mr Justice Simpson. Now, the Australian Capital Territory supreme court business is handled by one of the judges of the Industrial Court. The volume of business in the Australian Capital Territory has increased so much that virtually it is necessary to have one of the Industrial Court judges constantly engaged on Australian Capital Territory work, which leaves only three of the Industrial Court judges available. Of the three that remain, Mr Justice Spicer has been very busily engaged in a whole host of other judicial duties. For instance, he has acted as chairman of boards of inquiry into two aeroplane crashes. He has also presided over courts of inquiry into a number of marine collisions. I do not know exactly how many. He is the arbitrator under section 13A of the principal act, to which this bill relates, and he is involved in a number of other matters. This leaves virtually only two judges to do the occasional work that crops up-for instance, to relieve in the Northern Territory or perhaps to visit the external Territories of the Commonwealth. This court is being severely tried in terms of work. After those preliminary remarks I come now to the point that the time has arrived when another judge ought to be appointed to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. Just recently, there was a great deal of trouble on the waterfront in Sydney. The court made an order under section 109 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act directing the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to comply with the award. The federation went on strike, and the next step parties to the arbitration. in the procedure was for a person to inform the registrar of the court that there had been an offence, and a summons was then to issue. When this procedure is taken, one has to go to a judge of the court to get him to fix a date for the hearing of the complaint about the alleged offence. The information was made on 29th March and a summons was issued in Melbourne by His Honour Mr Justice Eggleston, but he could not fix a return date for the hearing of the information before 9th April. This meant that a very long period would elapse. This period seemed particularly long as there were current stoppages and also threatening stoppages on the waterfront. But the difficulty was that no judges were available to constitute a court before 9th April. For all these reasons I believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the time has arrived for the appointment of another judge to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The final thing that I wish to say is that in considering the proposals for the creation of a federal supreme court, we ought not to subjugate the role of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. remains for that court a very real function to fulfil. The court ought to be able to fulfil that function, which should not be submerged by the need for judges of that bench to discharge a wide range of other duties. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses1 and 2-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. 1 Clause 3. Section thirteen A of the Principal Act is amended(a) (b) by omitting sub-sections (5.), (6.), (7.) and (8.) and inserting in their stead the following subsections:"" (6.) The arbitrator may, at any stage of the proceedings, and shall if so directed by the Court, state, in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Court, any question of law arising in the course of the arbitration.

The consequence of adopting my proposed amendment would be that the court to which appeals from an arbitrator selected by the parties or appointed by the Attorney General would lie would be the Commonwealth Industrial Court instead of the High Court of Australia. As my learned friend, the honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden), quoted a few moments ago, the There Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick), in his second-reading speech, statedNot without some reluctance, because the Government has under consideration proposals for relieving the High Court of minor work, I have included in the bill provisions for vesting in the High Court such of the functions normally vested in a supreme court under the State laws as are necessary to the conduct of such an arbitration. It might have been happier had the Attorney-General used words such as",24,Copyright Bill 1963
52,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [12.4],"I"" original work"" rather than "" minor work "". Nevertheless, it is plain from what the Attorney-General said that he had some reluctance in burdening the High Court with this further function. I propose this amendment very largely for the reasons already stated by the honourable member for Bruce. Putting it very simply, an appeal from an arbitrator to the Commonwealth Industrial Court would be much quicker and cheaper than an appeal to the High Court. For some years now, I have expressed the view that there should be a new federal appeal court. I did so during the consideration of the Estimates for the Attorney-General's Department in this chamber in August, 1938, and I had done so earlier at the legal convention held in Perth in July, 1957. Later, I expressed the same view during the consideration of the Patents Bills in December, 1960, and November last. At the legal convention held in Hobart last January, a paper entitled "" The Necessity for a New Federal Court (A Survey of the Federal Court System in Australia)"" was delivered by Mr Byers and Mr Toose of Queen's Counsel in New South Wales. In the subsequent discussion, the Solicitor-General, speaking, he said, on behalf of the Attorney-General, statedIt may not be known that the Attorney-General has Cabinet authority to design a new federal Court with a view to consideration by Cabinet for approval for legislative action. Proposed sub-section (17.) of section 13A of the principal act, which I seek to amend, arises from the fact that if a federal judge were appointed by the Attorney-General or selected by the parties to act as arbitrator, an appeal from him would at present lie to State or Territory Supreme Courts. It may be a little invidious that there should be an appeal from a Federal judge to a State judge. I say without disrespect that State courts frequently, and it may be, usually, take the attitude that they are not primarily concerned with Federal matters, and their own lists are so congested with State matters-and familiar mattersthat they are inclined to defer Federal ones. The Attorney-General has, very properly, I think, provided therefore that there shall be an appeal within the federal system. I hoped that he would have provided for appeal to the Commonwealth Industrial Court instead of to the High Court. The Commonwealth Industrial Court is composed of members who are eminendy fitted to deal with appeals in matters of industrial property. The Chief Judge, Mr Justice Spicer, when he was Attorney General, probably did more than any other holder of that office has done to investigate and to set about modernizing the laws on industrial property, trade marks, copyrights, designs and patents. Other members of that court also have considerable experience in these matters. I think it can be said without disrespect that there is in the Commonwealth Industrial Court a greater degree of expertise in this field than would be found in all the State Supreme Courts combined. It is therefore a court which, with its present membership, is eminently well fitted to entertain appeals like this. A somewhat similar situation arose, Sir, under the Navigation Act a couple of years ago. In 1960 and 1961, Mr Justice Spicer was appointed to sit as a Court of Marine Inquiry under the Navigation Act in all the principal ports of Australia. As the Navigation Act stood before 1961, appeals could be taken from him to State or Territory Supreme Courts. To overcome this anomaly, the act was amended in 1961 to provide that there should be an appeal from the Court of Marine Inquiry to the Commonwealth Industrial Court, that is, an appeal from Mr Justice Spicer to two or more of his colleagues on the Industrial Court. The Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman), in his second-reading of the Navigation Bill 1961, gave these reasons. . . For many years, nearly all courts of marine inquiry under the Navigation Act were constituted by a judge of the Supreme Court of the AustraUan Capital Territory. At present, these courts are being constituted by the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The Attorney-General is of the opinion that if such courts are to be presided over by a judge of Supreme Court status, it is inappropriate that an appeal should be to another Supreme Court judge, as at present provided in section 375B. Clause 30 therefore amends section 375B and provides that appeals from a Commonwealth court of marine inquiry wiU lie to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. If my amendment is carried, exactly the same procedure will apply in appeals from an arbitrator-and the only arbitrator so far appointed has been Mr Justice Spicer -to his colleagues on the Commonwealth Industrial Court. That is the same procedure as was brought into the Navigation Act nearly two years ago at the instance of the Attorney-General. There is one other case of an appeal Supreme Court to the High Court. In the to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. circumstances, he elected that it was desirSection 29 of the Broadcasting and Teleable to preserve uniformity in the existing vision Act 1960 inserted section 87A in act, so that throughout the Copyright Act the principal act, to provide for appeals there will be an appeal to the High Court. to the Commonwealth Industrial Court against revocations of licences.

The Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick) made quite clear, I think, in his second reading speech that it was with some reluctance that he provided for an appeal to the High Court of Australia in this case.

However, the second reading is are a very important adjunct to the State supported by the Opposition. piece of legislation comes up in what might they used the very broad sworded method be described as an unusual way.

Under section 16, a judge may order that a person in New South Wales be called to Victoria by subpoena to give evidence in a proceeding. If the person fails to respond to the subpoena, the court may issue a warrant to apprehend him and bring him to Victoria. This is a different procedure from that which applies to persons resident in Victoria.

Another matter that comes to my attention, Mr Speaker, on looking at this bill ought to be considered more closely at the committee stage. I have been informed by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Freeth), who is the Minister assisting the Attorney General, that amendments will be moved to certain clauses. May I ask the Minister whether those amendments have been circulated? I can speak about them. On looking at this bill I was very concerned to see proposed",30,Service And Execution Of

63,Mr Snedden,"The honourable memMinister for the Interior and the Minister assisting the Attorney-General( Mr magistrate is determining then whether or Freeth), the question which a magistrate would have to determine was whether the person appearing before him was the person for whose apprehension the warrant was issued. If a man named Bill Jones was fined, and the warrant was for the apprehension of Bill Jones, one would have found that a magistrate was powerless to receive from the person appearing any testimony that he was not the person concerned. The relevant words are proposed to be changed to read "" on whom the fine was imposed"". This covers the situation, because the fine is imposed upon the actual offender, by whatever name he may be designated or identified. If the actual offender gave a wrong name the person who is wrongly named is not the person on whom the fine is imposed. When I read the bill I had some concern, because it provided for no means of appeal; but even if it had, the magistrate would not consider an appeal. I found then, by looking at the principal act, of which this bill is an amendment, that there is another form of warrant of apprehension. A warrant of apprehension may issue in the case of a person served with a subpoena in a State who does not answer that subpoena. A warrant of apprehension may issue and he may be arrested by a policeman, who takes him before a magistrate. Section 18 (6.) of the act provides that the magistrate has wide powers under which he may refuse on any of three grounds to return the person appearing before him. These are(a) that the charge is of a trivial nature; (b) the application for the return of the a warrant of apprehension in a State or Territory person has not been made in good faith finds in that State or Territory the person for in the interests of justice; or (c) for any reason, it would be unjust or -> « certain period. We come now to the suggestion that there could be no form of appeal before a magistrate when a warrant of apprehension is executed and a person is brought into the custody of a policeman. I suggest that a magistrate, by being entided to consider whether the person in fact appearing is the person on whom a fine was imposed, is not thereby engaging in a re-hearing, a review, an appeal or anything of that kind in relation to the offence in another State. A not he will facilitate the execution of the penalty which was awarded in the other State. No question of appeal or anything of that nature arises. If it were an appeal, I could not support it. I do not think there would be constitutional power to impose any condition for an appeal. Further, it would be highly undesirable to clothe a magistrate in another State with the power to re-hear the decision of the magistrate who conducted the original hearing. This situation does not emerge. I am going into this matter in some detail because, although the situation may not arise on many occasions, it is a matter of great importance to a person who is suddenly apprehended by a policeman, taken before a magistrate and told that he has to go to gaol until a fine is paid, when that person can truthfully say: "" I was not the person who was fined. I was never there."" So the crux of this situation is: How will the magistrate interpret the words, "" on whom the fine was imposed"", which are substituted for the words "" for whose apprehension the warrant was issued ""? I have no doubt in my mind that the magistrate will interpret those words widely enough for him to say, "" WhatI am concerned with is the appearance of the actual offender, because it was the actual offender upon whom the fine was imposed "". The strength of those words is added to by the fact that in the proposed section 26E (2.) remain the words, in relation to the constable who receives the warrantWhere a constable who is authorized to execute whose apprehension the warrant is issued . . . oppressive to return the person either The fact that the words remain in that at all or until tbe expiration of a proposed sub-section but that completely different words are substituted in section 26F strengthens the interpretation I have suggested. It is most important on the odd occasion where it occurs that a man is not to be committed to gaol for a fine which he says was never imposed on him. The alternative is for a magistrate to say, "" I will place you on bail until you go to Victoria and there proceed through the appeal provisions "". If that is not adequate protection for individuals, the purpose of the bill being to facilitate the collection of fines things that have been occurring and which by States, then the individual must be protected. Finally, I find from the bill that a person upon being apprehended must be taken before a magistrate who must then conduct a hearing; but under the terms of the bill no costs can be awarded in any circumstances. If a man was taken before a magistrate, and satisfied the magistrate that he was not the person on whom the fine is imposed-and he would no doubt have legal representation-h e would have to bear the whole of the costs of the proceedings. He would not be able to obtain a refund of costs or an order for costs. The incredible feature is that in the amendment circulated by the Minister assisting the Attorney General in relation to an appeal to a judge provision is made for the awarding of costs on the hearing before the judge, but no provision is made for the awarding of costs on the mandatory exercise of a hearing before the magistrate. In my opinion, this runs contrary to the whole concept of our legal proceedings. In our legal proceedings the basic rule is that the person who succeeds is entitled to costs unless there are very exceptional circumstances. I see no exceptional circumstances in this case that would suggest that the legislation should not provide for an order for costs. However, I do not regard this matter as of such great importance that I should vote against the measure, or do Service and Execution of Process Act, and anything of that kind. I would be very the position certainly requires a remedy. grateful to the Minister if he would give I propose to quote to the Parliament some consideration to putting into the bill a procases which the Government could keep in vision for costs.

When action is taken for any improve the position in regard to many purpose by this company it is taken in the have been unjust to the persons concerned, be they guilty or not. This bill does remove certain injustices. On occasions in this Parliament the question of arresting people in other parts of the Commonwealth and bringing them before the court in Canberra has received considerable prominence. Such action has been taken under certain sections of the act under discussion, and in much more extraordinary and serious cases, the freedom of the individual has been involved. I know that the Minister assisting the Attorney General( Mr Freeth) stated that certain legislation might be introduced to stop this sort of thing, but I propose to show how desirable are the changes that are being made by this legislation. The changes are long overdue, and it is good to know that the Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick) and the Government at long last have seen fit to make these changes. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) and other honourable members have directed attention to what has been occurring. Organizations have been obtaining judgment in the Australian Capital Territory and subsequently extraditing people from other States. In some cases, people have been found guilty of offences without having the opportunity to appear in court to defend themselves. These matters have arisen under the mind in considering further amendments to this aspect of the law. I refer chiefly to a 1",32,Service And Execution Of
64,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [2.27],"Mr firm known as Goodwins (Sydney) Procourt in Canberra. The judgment is obtained in Canberra, and a person, if he desires to defend the action, must come to this Territory in order to put his point of view or defence. Subsequently all the processes of the law are carried out here in Canberra and as has been stated quite rightly by the Attorney-General in this Parliament, people are being prosecuted under the Service and Execution of Process Act in Canberra without an opportunity to defend themselves. There have been so many cases of this kind that they are too numerous for me to mention now, but the fact remains that companies such as Television and General Finance Company Limited, which is the finance house of Goodwins Limited, Sydney, are undoubtedly exploiting sections of the act. It is good to see that the Governmentcertainly in a minor way in this case-is making provision to prevent this sort of thing. Let us have a look at what can occur under this act and why there is need for reforms of this nature. I have before me a contract entered into with Television and General Finance Company Limited for a total amount of £71, £5 deposit and payments to be made at given times. The person concerned is a pensioner aged 78 years. She is in bad health. She purchased a television set and immediately afterwards she took ill and was put into hospital. She asked a very well known citizen of the district in which I reside to write to the company, tell it that she could not pay the instalments and ask it to take back the set. The gentleman wrote to Goodwins shortly afterwards, and informed me about it in these termsOne of our members . . . Mrs. So-and-Sopurchased a TV set from Goodwins of Newtown. After paying the deposit she took ill and was taken at Court would have to be at your own expense. to hospital. She spent six weeks in the hospital. The gentleman wrote to Goodwins promptly and told the company that the woman could not pay. Goodwins (Sydney) Proprietary What a delightful letter for a 78 years old Limited wrote the following letter dated 9th woman to get from a company that had November, 1962Dear Mrs. So-an-so, Re: Hire Purchase A/c We have been advised that you wish to return the goods the subject of the above account. Should you wish us to convey this request to the Finance Company it would be necessary to call and see the writer within the next ten days to avoid the summons being issued against you for arrears as it has been noted that no payments have been made since the goods were delivered to you approximately five months ago. Prior to that the gentleman who had written into the company-on e of the best-known men in the district-receive d from Goodwins in Sydney a letter signed by a man named Goodwin. It reads as followsWe do not accept instructions from unknowns about our clients, and request that you advise Mrs. to call upon the writer personally. This was when the lady concerned was ill in hospital. The letter continuedAt the same time she may pay the arrears on the account, as the television receiver was installed more than four months ago and there has not been one penny paid on the account. The arrears as at to-day's date total £12.0.0 A tremendous amount, of course! If the £12.0.0 was paid the account could be cancelled without further charges. The point I make is that the company was notified immediately the woman could not pay, and was asked to call and collect the set. Subsequently the lady received a letter from the Television and General Finance Company Limited in Canberra. Just listen to this letter which, I submit, shows an exploitation of the Service and Execution of Process Act! It is dated 22nd November, 1962, and readsDear Sir/Madam, Re: Your Account No. Your Account has been referred to the writer for action. To date you are £12.0.0 in arrears. A number of previous notices have been ignored and we now have no alternative than to issue a Summons for all arrears plus court costs and legal expenses. This summons will be taken out at Canberra Court and served on you in due course unless your Account is up to date by then, or a satisfactory offer of payment is received.

Therefore it is imperative that you give this matter your immediate attention. sold her a television set! She had notified the company that she was ill. firm?",34,Service And Execution Of

On 29th January, the company wrote againDear Mrs. Re: Your Account Summons, Canberra Court last week. £5.5.0 additional costs have been added to your Account in accordance with your contract. This Summons will be served upon you within the course of the next twenty-one (21) days by a legal officer or Court bailiff. Your fares to and from Canberra to appear at Court would have to be at your own expense. Our expenses will be added to your Account in accordance with your Hire Purchase Agreement.

Only the writer can be contacted witb reference to your Account. It is signed by some follow who calls himself the legal officer. I cannot read his signature, but that does not matter. But Goodwins were not satisfied with that. I have in my hand a summons issued by the Canberra Courtm 1963 against this 78V year-old lady who resides in New South Wales. It gives the complainant's address for service as c/o Davies, Bailey and Cater, Solicitors, Melbourne Buildings, London Circuit, Canberra City, Australian Capital Territory, to which all notices may be posted. They took out a summons against this woman in Canberra without giving her an opportunity to defend herself, and they did that for a number of reasons. Then a letter, dated 15th February, was sent to this lady from Goodwins (Sydney) Proprietary Limited, 591 King-street, Newtown. It readWe have been advised by the Finance Company that a summons has been lodged for arrears on the above-mentioned hire-purchase account. This summons will be served upon you by a Court Bailiff within the next 28 days, and it will be necessary for you to appear in court in answer to the plaint. This woman who is 78 years old and lives 200 miles away is expected to come to CanIts berra at the behest of these people. The letter goes onAs we sold you the goods and recommended to the Finance Company that they accept your account you will appreciate our concern. If there is anything that we can do to assist you in this matter we would appreciate your advising us. Should you wish to convey an offer of settlement we would be prepared to do so on your was issued against you at behalf, provided that we have your assurance that the Promise to Pay would be maintained. This offer would have to be made to the signatory personally at 591 King-street, Newtown, and an appointment made by phoning 51-9951. In view of the serious state of your account, we urge that you contact us within the next seven days. That is not too bad, but the firm went one better than that-and do not forget that the following letter was sent by Television and General Finance Company Limited asking for payment in connection with certain items:Dear Madam, Now that the goods you hired have been repossessed you will be entitled to get them back(i) if, within twenty-one days, you require the owner, by notice in writing signed by you or your agent, to re-deliver the goods to you. . . .

The point I make is that value of the goods repossessed is sufficient to cover your liability. If the value of the goods is more these things are occurring. than sufficient to cover your liability you will be entitled to a refund. The owner's estimate of the value of the goods repossessed is £20. On the honourable member is referring to other basis of this estimate you are liable to pay the legislation.

I withdraw my kindly reference previously to the Minister. Evidently I am now getting under his skin. However, I know at least that at long last safeguards are being provided as a result of our impressing upon the Attorney-General and the Government the great need for reform. I conclude on that note. I have mentioned these matters to the Parliament because I believe that Television and General Finance Company Limited and Goodwins deserve to be told through this Parliament that their conduct is unethical and warrants action being taken against them. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses1 to 10-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 11. After Part IV. of the Principal Act the following part is inserted:"" PART IVA -ENFORCEMEN T OF FINES IMPOSED BY ""26A -(1. ) In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears""26F -(1. ) Where a person is brought, or appears, before a Court in accordance with the last preceding section(a) if the Court is satisfied that the person before the Court is the person for whose apprehension the warrant was issued and is not satisfied that the liability of the person to pay the fine has been fully discharged, the Court shall, subject to sub-section (4.) of this section, order that, by reason of non-payment of the fine or of the part of the fine that remains unpaid, the person be committed to gaol to serve such period of imprisonment as is specified in the order, being a period ascertained in accordance with sub-section (3.) of this section, unless he is sooner released in accordance witb law; or (6) "" (2.) For the purposes of this section, the Court may presume that the person before the Court is the person for whose apprehension the warrant was issued if the person before the Court does not give evidence that he is not the person on whom the fine referred to in the warrant was imposed. L . Interior and Minister assisting the Attorney General) [2.44] I moveIn proposed section 26F (1.), omit ""for whose apprehension the warrant was issued"", insert "" on whom the fine was imposed "". I do not propose at this stage to embark on a long argument with the honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden) as to the exact effect of those words. He directed attention to a possible interpretation which a magistrate might place upon them. I agree with him that there is room for some argument before a magistrate, but I suggest that it would be better to leave the matter aside until such a case is argued, if ever such a case should arise. I believe with him that this will remove some doubt that might have existed and will identify with certainty the person who is sought to be affected by the order for committal. Chairman, I wish to take this opportunity to convey to the Minister my appreciation of his action in considering the bill again in order to decide whether it should be amended. That action, I think, is a great credit to him. I say that with some embarrassment, but with respect to him. Opposition welcomes the amendment which the Minister assisting the Attorney-General has proposed. One of the Opposition's reasons for proposing an amendment to sub-section (2.) of proposed section 26F is the different wording used in sub-section (1.) and sub-section (2.). Sub-section (1.) refers to a person for whose apprehension the warrant was issued, and sub-section (2.) states that a court may presume that the person before the court is the person for whose apprehension the warrant was issued if the person before the court does not give evidence that he is not the person on whom the fine referred to in the warrant was imposed. We had in mind that there might be a difference between the person named in the warrant and the person on whom the fine was imposed, because of an error in drawing up the warrant or because of wrong information given by the person sought to be apprehended or fined. The amendment that the Minister has proposed now, and the further amendment that he has circulated in respect of sub-section (2.) make it",37,Service And Execution Of

80,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [2.46],"Th eplain that the evidence that one has to give must touch cn the relevant matter before the court. The same words will be used in all places. This amendment, therefore, removes one of our objections to sub-section (2.) words in sub-section (1.) Amendment agreed to. moveIn paragraph (a) of proposed section 26F (1.), omit "" is not satisfied that the liability of the person to pay the fine has"", insert "" that the liability of the person to pay the fine has not"". If the amendment is accepted by the committee, sub-section (1.) will readWhere a person is brought, or appears, before a Court in accordance with the last preceding section(a) if the Court is satisfied that the person before the Court is the person on whom the fine was imposed and that the liability of the person to pay the fine has not been fully discharged, the Court shall . . . order person be committed to gaol to serve such period of imprisonment as is specified in the order. We believe that the amendment would ensure that the onus would be on the Crown, not only to prove that the person before the court was the person on whom the fine was imposed, but also to prove that the fine had not been fully discharged. As the bill stands, tbe onus is on the person before the court to prove that the fine has been fully discharged. The Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick) in his second-reading speech, stated the intention of the act in these wordsIf the court is satisfied that the person before the court is the offender for whose arrest the warrant was issued and that the fine remains unpaid, the court shall commit the offender to gaol. The amendment that I move, therefore, would effectuate the intention of the bill as expressed by the Attorney-General in his second-reading speech. We think that that intention is in accordance with the usual principle and practice in criminal matters -that the Crown should prove all stages. Interior and Minister assisting the Attorney-General) [2.51] This amendment would have the effect of reversing the onus of proof. To prove that a fine had not been paid in another State it would be necessary for the law enforcement authorities in that other State to send some one to the State where it was sought to enforce the warrant. It should be pointed out that We welcome the insertion of these this is not a question of trying an original offence; it is a question of enforcing a fine imposed in respect of an offence that has been proved. If a fine has in fact been paid, the easiest way to establish that is for the person who has been fined to produce a receipt or a cheque butt, or some other evidence that the fine has been paid. It is a well-accepted practice that the onus of proof should fall on the person who has available the easiest or best means of discharging that onus. Furthermore, if a fine is sought to be enforced in the State where it was imposed, there is no onus of proof to be discharged in relation to non-payment. If the person concerned has not moved across the border into another State and it is sought to commit him for non-payment of a fine, he is called upon by the that . . . the police. He must then produce a receipt tc show that he has paid the fine. Otherwise, he is likely to be taken off to gaol. This is exactly the same situation, except that it has moved across the border of a State. The offender is given the additional protection of going before a magistrate before he can be taken off to gaol. In the circumstances, having amended the proposed section to provide that a court shall be satisfied that the person before the court is the person who has been fined, we feel that it would be unreasonable, and would add unduly to the expense of enforcing a decision of a court, to impose on the person seeking to enforce the penalty the onus of proving that it has not in fact been fully discharged. We regret that we cannot accept the proposed amendment. wil' press our amendment, for these reasons. Whilst we appreciate that proof should be facilitated in these matters, we think that proof has been facilitated too much in this case. In sub-section 6 of proposed new section 26F. it will be seen that in proceedings under this section a warrant of apprehension is evidence of facts stated in the warrant. Form1 in the Fourth Schedule to the bill, the form of warrant of apprehension, refers to identity and unpaid",38,Courts Of Summary Jurisdiction

83,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [2.54],"W eamounts and so on. As the section stands, all that the prosecutor would have to do would be to tender a warrant of apprehension and, thereafter, if no evidence were given by or on behalf of the person before the court, then the case would be proved. I appreciate that it is expensive and timeconsuming to bring oral evidence and evidence in the other usual ways. We would not object if, say, there were a procedure for verifying the warrant on affidavit. We feel that it is not a wholesome procedure for the document initiating some process, itself to supply all the evidence to justify that process. I think it happens in many cases in the States that where a warrant is issued or is tendered there is also an affidavit verifying it. There is then the additional safeguard that written evidence is before the court. The originating process is not itself evidence of what it asserts. So, Sir, we think that as this is a departure from principle we ought to press the amendment that I have moved. Question putThat the words proposed to be omitted ( Mr Amendment negatived.

We are grateful to him for directing our attention to what we believe is a sound principle-that there should be a right of appeal in this instance as exists under other parts of the act in respect of similar process. Unfortunately there were some matters of drafting in the deputy leader's amendment that were not quite acceptable to us. We have therefore accepted in printhat this will be acceptable to him. Our amendment prevents an appeal by the police against an order for the discharge of a person from custody, which was implicit in the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It therefore restricts the right of appeal to the person who is to be committed. I should also mention a point raised by the honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden). We do attach power to award costs to an appeal, but not to the original process. In 99 cases out of 100 a right to award costs in proceedings before a magistrate would inflict hardship on the defendant. So we decided that in fairness it would be better for the prosecuting State to bear the costs of pursuing a defendant into another State. However, since the only person who may appeal against a decision of a magistrate is in fact the defendant, it is felt to be right that if he loses his appeal he should bear his own costs. If he succeeds in his appeal the Crown should bear the costs. thank the Minister for the Interior( Mr Freeth) for his remarks and for his amendment. His amendment incorporates the proposed amendment which was circulated in my name a couple of days ago. The alterations which the Minister's amendment makes in the proposed amendment that I had circulated are, I readily concede, improvements on my amendment.

Original question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.13 p.m. until Tuesday, 30th April, at 2.30 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated:National Income. Mr Ward asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. From what sources does he obtain the figures wilh respect to national income which he has referred to from time to time? 2. What procedure is followed in calculating national income? Mr Harold Holt -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Estimates of national income are compiled by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, and the figures referred to are taken from the annual publication on national income and expenditure or from quarterly estimates of national income and expenditure published by the bureau. 2. The principal components of national income are wages, salaries, and supplements, company income and income of unincorporated businesses and public authority business undertakings, payments of net rent and interest by trading enterprises these components are based on a wide variety of data, including returns made in connection with production, and the accounts of public authority business undertakings. The methods of estimation are complicated and it is therefore not possible to set out in brief form the details of the calculation of all items. Mr Ward asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. What was the total national income for the year 1949-50? 2. What was it per head of population? 3. What was the total national income for the year 1961-62 calculated on 1949-50 prices? 4. What was it per head of population? Mr Harold Holt -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:estimated at £2,318,000,000. 2. National income for the year 1949-50 per head of mean population, has been estimated at £288. 3 and 4. Because of the problems of concept and data deficiencies mvolved, the Commonwealth Statistician does not publish estimates cf national income for one year expressed in the prices of another year. However, investigations are continuing into the problems associated with compiling estimates of gross national product at constant prices. Postal Department. Mr Collard asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice1. Is the existing transmitting and receiving equipment at the Onslow Post Office so obsolete and unsatisfactory for that area that it is extremely difficult and often impossible to readily and reliably transmit and receive messages. 2. If so, what action is to be taken, and when will it be taken, to rectify the position? honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. Telegraph service beween Onslow and Perth is provided by means of a conventional overland telegraph line which, under normal conditions, provides satisfactory and reliable communication. In the event of a fault occurring on the landline, standby radio equipment is brought into operation and maintains contact with adjacent centres or with Perth. As an emergency means of communication this equipment performs satisfactorily. On 7th February, however, a severe cyclone with record wind velocity struck Onslow causing serious damage to the landline and destroying the aerial",41,Pairs
