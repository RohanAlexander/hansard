172,When Young People Believe In Their Own Im,"Wales, Nick Greiner, Mr McKay said:gratulations on the announcement made by this government last year to make such a program compulsory for new provisional drivers. The New South Wales government, through its inactivity, seems reluctant to take decisive action, even failing to match the federal government’s Black Spots Roads Program grant of $20 million to my electorate for the Princes Highway. That funding will make a real impact on addressing some of our notorious accident history, yet the state government has said no. Even now the state government is effectively only prepared to spend less than $6 million a year on the Princes Highway from Kiama to the Victorian border. How can anyone believe that the state government is serious in addressing this issue? I support the concept of driver education because it calls on state governments to take responsibility rather than just talk about it. I am not in favour of a curfew, because it penalises too many responsible young drivers who have job obligations. In country areas such as Gilmore, where the state roads leave a lot to be desired and trains rarely, if ever, run on time these measures are draconian and short-sighted. I can only reiterate the importance of teaching driver ethics to school-age children long before they get behind a steering wheel. I would also like to congratulate those involved in the Ulladulla Driver Education program which is run by the Milton-Ulladulla Rotary Club. There stands the framework upon which we can build an initiative that will make an impact on reining back the sad incidence of road trauma we have been experiencing.
