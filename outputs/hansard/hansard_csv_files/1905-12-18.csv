It seems to me that the ammunition is not entirely at fault in these cases, and I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Councili f he will' request the Minister of Defence to see that in any further inquiry that is made, the condition of the rifles, as well as the composition of the ammunition, is looked into. In my opinion, the bursting may be due partly to want of care of the rifles. If rifles are neglected after cordite has been fired in them, and nickel-plated bullets are used, they are far more apt to choke, and thus cause an explosion, than was the case with the old rifles, in which the twist of the bore was not so great, and which were not correimbursed. roded by the black powder used in them, while the missile was a soft leaden bullet. means of conveyance.

The fact that the measure has been discussed at some length in another Chamber is not sufficient in itself to enable me to form any conclusion with regard to it. So far as I have been able to gather from a glance at the Bill, the laws of the States have been partly embodied and partly discarded, whilst new provisions have been adopted, which are at variance with international law. I see great difficulty in dealing with this very complicated question at the close of the. session, and I had hoped that the Minister would consent to allow the Bill to remain over until next session.

The photograph is his own just as much as a painting is the property of the artist who creates it . I know of a case in which a photographer went down a mine and obtained a brilliant picture. The State Government has pirated that particular photograph, and has declined to allow him any compensation whatever. Under such circumstances, I claim that we ought to protect a photographer equally with any other artist. would not prevent another artist from taking a similar picture? persons to take a copy of a brilliant picture without recognising the right of the owner.

In my opinion, an Australian publisher has a hard enough row to hoe without additional disabilities being imposed upon him. In America the same advantages are not accorded to. Australian writers as we extend to American writers. If an Australian publisher has a book which is worth selling in the United States, in order to secure the protection against pirated publications which is bestowed by International copyright, he has to print a copy of it there. Messrs. Angus and Robertson and other Australian publishers deserve every credit for the way in which they are facing this difficult task. They have found that pirated editions of the best of Lawson's works have been published in America.

American authors do not come within the terms of the Convention, and that they will be unable to do so until Congress takes action.

The American law, instead of being advantageous to local literary, scientific, or artistic men, is distinctly disadvantageous to them. They have not been able to secure any protection. is true that Australian authors have been unable to secure copyright there in respect of books published elsewhere; but having regard to the relative population of the two countries, the number of writersdisadvantaged in this way in the United States is likely to be twenty times as great as it is in Australia, since the leisured class from which authors draw their readers is infinitely more numerous in America. I think it would be better to allow 'the position to remain unaltered, because we should not be able, by any action we might take, to make the United States alter their copyright laws. If we made any exception with regard to American publications, it would be necessary for us to pass an amending Bill as soon as the United States came under the international copyright law. Under the Bill as it stands the rights of the authors of that country will not be safeguarded here. The United States have granted no safeguard to our authors, and We might, by means of we propose to grant none to those of that country. between the United Kingdom and the United States in 1894, Great Britain alWe lowed the American right or the American disability to which reference has been made to continue.

No disadvantage can arise from our acceptance of the clause as it stands. If American authors wished to be safeguarded here they would have to publish here.

The honourable and learned member has raised a very big question, and has asked us to take isolated action, such as we are not prepared to take at this stage. Hinkson, at page 105 of his Copyright Law, says of American copy-right that the author must'On or before the day of publication deliver to the Librarian of Congress at Washington a printed copy of the title of the liteAustralian law cannot place on American rary or dramatic work, or a description of the work of art. Not later than the day of publication he must deliver to the Librarian of Congress two copies of "" the copyright book, map, chart, dramatic or musical composition, engraving, chromo, art print, or photograph, or, in case of a painting, drawing, statue, statuary, model, or design for awork of the fine arts, a photograph of the same. vided that in the case of a book, photograph, chromo, or lithograph, the two copies of the same required to be delivered shall be printed from type set within the limits of the United States, or from plates made therefrom or .from negatives or drawings on stone made within the limits of the United States, or from transfers made therefrom. Those are some of the American conditions, and I understand that some British firms have set up establishments, and are publishing in the United States. If an American wishes to obtain copyright in Australia under this Bill, he must comply with Australian conditions. the word "" newspaper "" in the definition of periodical? of clause 13 says that copyright shall subsistin every book, whether the author is a British) subject or not, which has been printed from type set up in Australia. But the Minister tells us that, if copyright had been obtained in the United Kingdom, it would be unnecessary for an American author, who wished to copyright his work here, to have the type set up in Australia. wishes to copyright a work in the United States must, under the Chace Act of 1891, have the type set up there.

If a book were obscene or immoral, no copyright would exist, and if the Registrar were of opinion that a book was not the subject of copyright, he would be entitled to reject it. It would afterwards rest with the Courts to say whether he had rightly or wrongly exercised his functions. Clause 74 provides that if the Registrar wrongly enters a publication on the register, the entry can be expunged.

Moreover, opinions differ very widely as to what is blasphemous or indecent. I consider that it is proposed to give the Registrar too much power, and that the scope of the provision is not defined with sufficient clearness. that the clause should be struck out. The Registrar is really being placed in the position of a public censor. We know that when Herbert Spencer published the chapter ira his work The Study of Sociology, relating to educational bias, he aroused regarded his writing as highly blasphemous. In the same way, many of the English clergy held that Darwin's Origin We are now dealing with Ausof Species was blasphemous. If we had a Registrar imbued with the same HighChurch notions as these clergymen, he would probably refuse to register either of the works mentioned. the final decision.

If he wishes to obtain the full advantages of copyright, he goes before the Registrar, who, under this clause, would be entitled to examine his work, with a view to ascertaining whether it contained anything indecent, blasphemous, seditious, or libellous.

Clause 74 gives ample protection to any person who is aggrieved by an erroneous decision of the Registrar. As the Minister-has pointed! out, an appeal can be made to the Judge in Chambers. There is nothing to prevent a person aggrieved by the refusal of the Registrar to copyright his work /from bringing that officer before a Judge. Should the latter find that the book is not of an indecent, blasphemous, seditious, or libellous character, he can overrule the Registrar, and direct him to grant copyA tribunal of that right. The object of the clause is to enable a test to be applied if such applications are made. It was necessary to impose a prohibition upon works of a certain description, so that the Registrar might be in a legal position to refuse to register them. Under this clause, he will be able to say to the author of any such work, "" I have come to tlie conclusion that this is a blasphemous, indecent, or libellous work, and, inasmuch as the law lays it down that there is no copyright in such works, I refuse to register it .

It is largely in. consequence of the unfair acts of American authors and publishers that the insertion of this provision is rendered necessary. In Copinger's Law of Copyright, page 493, I find the following : There is no treaty between Great Britain and the United States on the subject of copyright, and until recently British authors could not prevent their works being pirated in America. Some measure of protection is, however, now accorded to British authors by virtue of the Act known as the Chace Act 1891. The benefits of this Act_ are extended to a citizen of a foreign State when "" such foreign State permits to Americans the "" benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as its own citizens,"" or when such foreign State is a party to an international agreement which provides for reciprocity in the granting of copyright, by the terms of which agreement the United States may at its pleasure become aparty thereto. The existence of either of these conditions is to be determined by the President by proclamation. I am pressing this point on the consideration of the Committee, because I know that Australian authors have been most disadvantageous! y treated. It is provided by the Chace Act thatIn the case of a book, photograph, chromo, or lithograph, the two copies of the same re|uired to be delivered shall be printed from type set within the limits of the United States, or from plates made therefrom, or from negatives or drawings on stone made within the limits of the United States or from transfers made therefrom. If an Australian author desires to secure a copyright in the United States, he must deposit in its Copyright Office two copies of his work, which must have been printed in that country. 1 do not know whether that requirement has been imposed in order to protect the printers of America; but whatever its object,, it clearly places Australian authors at a disadvantage. A prominent firm of Australian publishers, Messrs*. Angus and Robertson, who are doing a very great service to Australian authors, have shown me that Australian works-and particularly those of Henry Lawson-ar e now being pirated in the United States. The publishers and authors of these works are losing the profits arising from their sale there, because it was not at first considered that the demand for them would justify the expense of having a reprint made there. which no protection is afforded British publishers still in force? them unless they fulfil American conditions. tions ? of which copyright is sought in the United States must have been printed there. to support.the view of the honourable member. On first principles there appears to be a great deal of force in what he has said. clause 13 of this Bill thatCopyright shall subsist in every book, whether the author is a British subject or not, which has been printed from type set up in Australia, or plates made therefrom, or from plates or negatives made in Australia in cases where type is not necessarily used. Ask stands, however, that provision maybe easily evaded by any American author who takes care to register in the United Kingdom. Reciprocity between the United Kingdom and the United States in regard to copyright has not been secured, because the United States refuses to enter into the International Copyright Convention, and if an American author registers first of all in England, he will thus secure his copyright throughout Australia. We have now an opportunity to do something for English writers. At every annual meeting of the Authors' Society of Great Britain vigorous protests are made against the American law of copyright, which is particularly unfair to writers of scientific works, which must necessarily have but a limited number of readers. We all know that for many years the question of whether Darwin's Origin of Species would be a success remained in doubt. Darwin had devoted perhaps the best years of his life to the Study of the theory which he embodied in that work; and naturally his publishers did not feel justified in incurring the risk of reprinting it hu the United States, so as to comply with the copyright law of that",21,Groom

Canada is not a party to the British Copyright Treaty with Austria. I hold that it is the duty of the Parliament to take such action as will insure to Australian authors a proper reward for their labours. If Lawson and other Australian writers find that their works are being pirated in America, but cannot afford to incur the expense of printing and publishing simultaneously in the two countries, we are doing a wrong to them in failing to properly safeguard their interests. 1",22,Groom

The decent publishing firms in America are prepared to give international copyright on fair terms, because they are opposed to piracy, and, even, before the present law was passed, some of them made payments to English authors whose works they were publishing, though those payments were not so large as the English authors would have received had there been a copyright law. I trust that the Committee will agree to my proposal. Under it, the people of other countries will enjoy the same terms as they give to our people, and we have a right to insist on fair ""treatment to our struggling authors and publishers. ter of Home Affairs) I ask the honourable and learned member not to press the amendment. At the present time the United States is outside the Berne Convention, and will not make reciprocal arrangements on the subject of copyright with other countries under that agreement. Consequently, registration there does not give copyright throughout the various countries within the Berne Convention. If an American publisher wishes to obtain copyright in the United Kingdom, he must register under the English Act, which it would not be wise for us at this stage to attempt to override, because, under it, registration in any one part of the Empire gives a copyright throughout the whole Empire. This is a Bill purely to regulate the administration of the copyright law within our own boundaries, and to take advantage of the benefits of the Imperial' Act, and the international agreement, and, while it is desirable that the copyright law. and. giA'es copyright throughout the Avhole should be uniform throughout the civilized world, as the United States people have declined to enter the Berne Convention, we cannot force them in this matter. No American author, however, will be able to obtain copyright in Australia under our Bill unless he complies with our conditions, which are substantially the same as 'those of the United States. ply with our conditions, if he registers under the English Act. to copyright under the English Act has a copyright throughout Australia, and I think it undesirable that Ave should refuse to recognise the legislation of the Imperial Parliament in this matter, because under it any one has copyright throughout the Empire.

GROOM -An American wishing to obtain copyright in Australia must either comply with the provisions of this measure, which are the same as those of the American law, or comply with those of the English Act. It is quite possible that some aspects of the law of copyright may come up for consideration again next session, and, in the meantime, this matter could be looked into. Senator Keating, who deserves the thanks of the community for the tremendous efforts that he has taken to perfect this measure, recommends the Bill, and I ask the honourable and learned member not to press the amendment, but to leave the subject over for future consideration, and possible negotiation. agree with the Minister, that we should pass the clause as it stands.

I think that Ave should take the matter into our OAvn hands, and do what Ave can to secure reciprocity between Australia and America. An Australian author cannot register in America until he has gone to the heavy expense of getting his book printed in type set up in the United States, and I think that the American author should not be protected here until he has acted similarly.

I sympathize with Australian authors as much as h'e does, and' would be willing to give them every reasonable protection, but I do not think we should differentiate against a friendly nation like America, which does not discriminate against us. It would be invidious for us to single out the United States for special treatment. out to the honourable member that my amendment would apply to all nations which differentiate against us. not a word said about the United States. The amendment would restrict the privilege of copyright, so far as foreign publications are concerned, to books which are first published in .countries which' grant copyright on equal terms to books first published in Australia. If America does not differentiate against us, the amendment will not operate to her disadvantage. there is a good' deal in the contention of the honourable and learned member for Corio. I should be very sorry to make any invidious distinction against the United States, but we cannot overlook the fact that although the law is not specially directed against us, American legislation places our publishers at a disadvantage. The United States Act requires that a book for which copyright is required shall be printed and published in America within a certain time after the application has been lodged. I understand that, owing to this condition, a number of large English publishing firms have set up branch offices in America, and have brought out numerous works in Engsmaller firms that are unable to resort to this method of publication are placed at a great disadvantage, and this would apply to all the Australian publishing houses. Therefore, whilst American publishers can come here and obtain copyright for their publications, our publishers are denied a like privilege. We desire to place our publishers on the same footing as those of other countries, and I think that the amendment is deserving of consideration. ItI should not be makes no invidious distinction so far as the United States is concerned, but subjects I think that Australian authors its publishers to the same conditions in Australia as are applied to foreign publishers m the United States. What is good enough for America ought to be good enough for Australia; and there can be no cause of complaint against us if we apply to the United States the methods which that country has adopted in dealing with others. The United States might be induced to recast its copyright legislation if it found that we were determined to assert our right in the direction indicated. posed to support the amendment.

The United States does jnot grant copyright to foreigners, and does not ask from others any privileges which it denies to outsiders. If we do not ask for copyright from other nations we are entitled to refuse it to them. recognise that this Bill can be made a Ir is clear that the smaller nations must gain under any reciprocal arrangement for the registration of copyright, For instance, it would' be of much more advantage to holders of copyright in Australia if they could obtain protection in other countries than to publishers in otheT countries to obtain copyright in Australia. Although the amendment is not specially directed against the United States, it will have the effect that has been indicated by the honourable member for Gippsland. The discussion so far has proceeded on the assumption that only literary works are the subject of copyright. I would point out, however, that musical and dramatic works are also brought within the scope of the copyright law. Music is a universal language, and the arrangement entered into at the Berne Convention, by which musical works copyrighted in,, say, France or Germany can be safeguarded in other parts of the world, is of the utmost advantage. At this late stage of the session I think it is undesirable that we should introduce into this Bill highly debatable provisions. We have been informed that next session a Bill will be submitted for the purpose of dealing with the question of newspaper copyright, and the honourable and' learned member for Corio will then be afforded an opportunity of submitting his proposal. I scarcely think that he will be acting wisely better to defer its' consideration until next in pressing it any further at the present juncture.

Not one argument has been adduced to show that this change is necessary.

We should not pass legislation of this kind without serious debate. Clause agreed to. Clause 24 agreed to. Clause 25 (Copyright and other rights to separate properties). there is some difficulty in this case. For instance, a man publishes a book, with a very good plot, and immediately three or four others set to work Bo dramatize it, and the author ib shut out from the advantage which should accrue to him from the product of his own brain. protection of the author. This clause is intended to give separate rights, so that they can be assigned . It is merely a re1 print from the proposed Imperial law. the Imperial Act. which was passed by the House of Lords clause 13, we have given to every author of a novel the sole right to convert it into a drama. An author may never dramatize his book, and no one else will be entitled to make any use of his plot for the purposes of a drama for forty-two years. Therefore, in view of the multiplicity of novels that are springing up, the dramatic writer will not know where he is. How are we to define what is a dramatic representation? We know that the English Courts have recently been engaged in dealing with the rights of dramatists in regard to the use of novels. We are now proposing to confer upon a novelist the right to-go to a dramatist and tell him that he must not proceed' with his work, because he has adopted a plot similar to that contained in the novel. Under this provision, he may be subjected to heavy penalties, because it mav be urged that he has dramatized some work of which he has never heard. Ought we to impose such disabilities upon dramatic authors? Personally, I consider that the provisions of clause 13 are altogether too wide. In its present form, it is a distinct hindrance to dramatists. Of course, most of the plays produced in Australia, are written by the dramatists of older countries, and consequently, the cases which will arise under this provision, may not be numerous. I object to rendering dramatists liable to penalties, because it may be alleged that they have dramatized stories of the very existence of which they may have had no knowledge. Clause agreed to. Clauses 26 to 32agreed to. Clause 33(1) Unless the reporting of a lecture is prohibited by a notice as in this section mentioned, the lecturing right in a lecture shall not be in fringed by a report of the lecture^in a newspaper.

The lecture may consist of a mere collection of historical facts from various sources, which are open to the whole community, but with which the people generally have not time to acquaint themselves, and the moment such a lecture is delivered from a public platform it should become the property of the public. The people should have the opportunity to learn the views of a lecturer, not merely by paying for admission to the hall in which he speaks, but by means of newspaper reports. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa that we may go too far, and that there is a point at which we must limit the right of a man to secure privileges to which he is really not entitled. I certainly think that we are asked to take a retrograde step. with the view taken of this clause by ""the honourable member for Gwydir. mind, the matter treated by a lecturer stands in much the same relation to him as does a scene to an artist who photographs it. photographed a particular scene would not be sufficient to prohibit others from photographing it . not the scene, but the picture of it, that is copyrighted. A dozen men or more may copyright a picture of the same scene. In like manner, I think that a lecturer should be protected in respect of the address which he has prepared on any given subject. The clause does not contain any element of danger, and I am inclined to think that the argument put forward by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is rather a far-fetched one. am inclined to the view that, instead of providing that newspapers shall not publish lectures for the benefit of the community, unless with the consent of those who deliver them, we should enact that any newspaper which fails to publish a lecture shall be heavily fined. great genius, although practically unknown, might announce his intention of d'elivering a lecture in Melbourne, and might have an audience of only fifteen or twenty.

If a man treats a. subject in an original form, there are two ways in which he may put his work before the people. In the first place, he may publish a book, and in the second he may orally communicate his ideas. If he does so, he can copyright it . To my It is generally admitted that, in such circumstances, a man should have substantial protection for the result of his labour. Let us take the case of a man who desires to earn a livelihood, not by writing books, but by preparing and delivering lectures on certain subjects. The preparation of a lecture may involve a great deal of research, and a man may suffer great hardships in securing the inI t is formation necessary for his work. Imagine, for instance, the case of one who goes on a voyage of discovery to the Antarctic. body in a book the information that he obtained. could be copyrighted. But suppose that he determined to place the information that he had gained before the public, by way of lectures. In that case, surely he should be entitled ,to .securie protection for his work. As a matter of fact, we have already affirmed that he shall. It is pointed out by Hinkson thatAuthors of lectures, or the persons to whom they have assigned them, have the sole right of A man of publishing them; and any person who publishes such lecture without leave is liable to a penalty under the Lecture Act 1835.

The Committee which investigated the whole question in the United Kingdom recommended the very provision that the Government are -to-day -urgingthe Committee to adopt. The honourable; member for Darling has pointed out very truly that the protection which it is proposed to afford a lecturer will be in respect only of the original treatment of the subject with which he deals. The late Reverend Charles Clarke earned his livelihood, and educated the public, by his beautiful lectures on Westminster Abbey, Dickens Thackeray, and other subt jects which any one is free to lecture upon, (but tlie original treatment of which by any lecturer should be protected. there is a great deal in the criticism which has been expended on this clause, and it is open to further objections. Who is to define what is a report ? My experience is that copyright is given to an author, he is bound it. is unprecedented for a newspaper here to 1 report verbatim the lectures of prominent men visiting Australia; but a paragraph of a. few lines, giving the briefest summary of a lecture, might be a technical breach of this provision, which is a very clumsy one to administer. I sympathize with those who think that it is being proposed to carry the protection ofcopyright too far. As a rule, the personality of a lecturer is a more valuable asset to him that the mere words of his lecture. If we read the report of a lecture delivered b\i a great preacher or orator, it stimulates us to hear him, instead of keeping us from doing so. So far as the mere words of a lecture are concerned, they can be copyrighted by making a book of them, and copyrighting it. The greatest -service that can be done to a lecturer is to Teport his lectures in the press. Moreover, any member of his, audience may take down the words of his lecture, and make it his own property. Of course, it will be said that if it is of service to lecturers to have be construed as a breach of the provision. their lectures reported in the press, the clause will be inoperative, because lecturers, -wit h the exception of, perhaps, an occasional crank-wil l not prohibit the reporting of their lectures; but how absurd it would be to pass legislation merely for the benefit of a crank who might think that ' the lecture he had produced was such a monument of wisdom that, unless his rights in if were protected, it would be repeated all over the world, and he would .lose thousands Such persons can protect their Copyright [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. lectures by copyrighting them in book form. turing rights cease. too far, and I shall be quite willing fo vote against it. should like to point out to the Committee that about two years ago Lord Rosebery delivered a speech, which the Times newspaper published in a more or less condensed form, and the question arose as to whether the proprietors of the newspaper had such a copyright in the report as would enable them to prevent other persons from using it. The Court held that they had such a copyright. in, the world gives lecturing rights for so long a period as forty-two years. When a to publish his work in order to take advantage of it, and when he does that, any one who wishes to do so can secure a copy of it. But, if a lecture is copyrighted, nobodycan enjoy it except those who actually go to hear it. which the lecturer never visits are for ever deprived of the opportunity of hearing it. lecturer more than a few pounds to print any lecture in book form, even if it were as long as one of the speeches of the honourable member for Gwydir. That being done, he could copyright the book. would lose his copyright in the lecture. asset is his own personality.

That is an entirely different state of affairs from that which will obtain under this Bill. four States, representing five-sixths of the population of the Commonwealth, the term of artistic copyright is fourteen years. We are asked, without any reason being assigned for the change, to suddenly increase it to forty-two years. Under this Bill one man may have registered a copyright for fourteen 3'ears and one month before the Act will come into operation. He will receive no protection whatever, whereas the individual who registered thirteen years and eleven months before the commencement of the Act, will have his term extended to forty-two years.

I contend that in this Bill we are going too far, because we are lessening the rights of individuals. What would be thought if forty-two years had to elapse before we could take advantaee of any patent? We must fix a reasonable period at which the public shall secure a return for the exclusive rights which they have conferred upon particular individuals. We are asked to regard this Bill as a formal one, and to pass it without discussion. The more I look into it, the more I am satisfied that we ought not to have been invited to agree to it in this hurried fashion. However, I do not intend to labour the question.

It is true that in some, parts of the world, the term of artistic copy-right is only fourteen years; but I see no reason why an artist or a sculptor should not have the same protection conferred in New South Wales, upon his inventive or artistic powers that is accorded the writer of a book. In the In United Kingdom the term of artistic copythe right is during the life of the author and seven years, which is practically an alternative to the period of forty-two years.

I do not argue whether that is desirable or otherwise. But the matter is one which should have received attention at the hands of honourable members. Some of the States may consider that they should still have copies of new works supplied to them. Of course, if that right were preserved, an author would have to supply three copies instead of two, and it is a matter for consideration whether the advantage gained by t'he State would compensate for the disadvantage to the individual. Some books are exceedingly valuable, and the author should not be exploited to any further extent than may be necessary to comply with reasonable requirements. If the existing rights of the States are preserved, they will be entitled to direct an author to send in, not one copy, but ten, or even to send copies to all the principal Mechanics' Institutes.

The more I look at the measure the more I feel that its consideration should have been deferred until next session. In four of the States, representing five-sixths of the population of tlie Commonwealth, we have extended the period of copyright from fourteen to fortytwo years, and we have provided no public safeguards. NeedI remind honourable members that originally these rights were granted only because it was thought that the great mass of the people ought to enjoy all the advantages which were conferred by every new discovery. It was not until after the lapse of many years that it was thought that the growth of mechanical genius would be better stimulated by allowing an inventor to enjoy .for a specified period the fruits of his own industry. Under this Bill, if a man has copyrighted a work fourteen years and one month prior to the commencement of the Act, he will enjoy no protection whatever; but the individual who has copyrighted a work thirteen years and eleven month's"" prior to its commencement will be granted an extension of that period to .forty-two years. I should like to know what is the reason for such an arbitrary proceeding on our part. There is no recognition of the rights of the public in this Bill. Under it we have granted to individuals rights which did not previously exist, and I say that the measure should have received more consideration than has been accorded to it. If it had not beem dealt with at the fag-end of the session, the Committee would have declined to approve of it. Of course, it difficulties that will arise under it.

I have been through the list very carefully, and the honourable member for Bland fully concurs in my opinion. it has been stated that he was endeavouring, for purely electioneering purposes, to arrange a compromise in favour of the selection of Lake George. I decline to believe that. When I asked the honourable member for Bland three years ago to support that site, he was auite ready to do so. One of the reasons why he did not vote with me upon that occasion was that, like the right honourable member for East Sydney, he realized that there was no chance of that site being selected. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra and myself stood almost alone upon this question. What are the circumstances?

Wales went out of its way, so to speak, to allow the Federal Parliament to choose a site, and, in so doing, yielded up what, in my opinion, was a right that it undoubtedly possessed. upon, to hand over a large area, surely it has a right to say to this Parliament: "" We do not think the Commonwealth ought to ask us to grant this site."" When it takes up that position, surely it should not be said that it is. adopting a highly unfederal attitude. We know that if at Dalgety. New South Wales will be called upon at once to construct about thirty-two miles of railwav. which, at the present time, af all events, will be unpayable. be reasonably contended that the wishes of that Sfate should not be considered by us? We should be thankful to the State Parliament for having pointed out to us that the territory is not a very suitable one. Instead of that, many honourable members appear to consider that it has taken up a disagreeable stand,i and the question seems to have resolved itself into one of whether or not we should interfere with ruthers. tion for this Parliament to assume. The agreement arrived at by the Premiers in conference was that the Federal Capital should be a reasonable distance from Sydney. It seems strange that, in previous discussion, that point has been almost waived. The honourable member for North Sydney was the only one who, during the debate on the Seat of Government Bill, impressed upon the House the full significance of that decision, but many honourable members -and I dare say that I was amongst them -were so busily engaged in lobbying and endeavouring to secure votes for certain sites that Ills arguments did not receive the recognition which they deserved. be said that to establish the Capital on the .borders of New South Wales and Victoria, would be to comply with the decision pf ""the Premiers' Conference, that it should be a reasonable distance from Sydney? I am inclined to believe that if honourable members had realized the full effect of that decision, they would not have attempted to [244]2 select a site off the main railway line between Sydney and Melbourne. Apart from the unfavorable climate, the character New South of the country, and its lack of railway communication, there are many other reasons why Dalgety should not be finally selected. We know that it is improbable that many public servants will be stationed at the But since it will be called Capital,, and that it is unlikely that we shall erect a city. I am sure that there is no desire to centralize the Public Service in the Federal Capital at the expense of the Commonwealth. Another point is that if the Capital be established at Dalgety, a delay of half-a-day must occur in the receipt and transmission of our mails. That the Capital becomes established alone should be a sufficient ground for a reconsideration of the question now that party disputes have passed away. As a matter of fact, many honourable members were actually preparing to reconsider it In these circumstances, can it when a certain action was taken last week. In New South Wales it is hard to say what site would have been selected as the result of that reconsideration, but I am satisfied that, but for a little warm feeling that has latelv been engendered, the decision of the Parliament would have been altered. It would be most unwise, however, for the House to stand by its former decision. We have a clear intimation that the Parliament of New South Wales does not intend to agree fo the selection of Dalgety. It is determined by every That is not a reasonable posimeans that lies in its power to resist the establishment of the Capital there. That being so, is the question at issue of such vital importance to the other States of the Union that we should deliberately determine to disregard tlie wishes of a State representing one-third of the people of the Commonwealth rather than forsake the decision arrived at? In what way would the rights of the other States be infringed by a fresh selection being made'? I am satisfied that the bulk of the people of Victoria would have had no objection to the selection of"" Sydney as the Federal Capital, but under the Constitution such a selection is now impossible. That being so, we should Can it seriously consider whether we ought not to select a site which would be more agreeable to the people of New South Wales. If we adopted that course no one could sav, that we had backed down. Surely there could be no objection to our saying to the Parliament of New South Wales, ""Whilst fully recognising the responsibility of the Commonwealth in this matter, we should",42,Chapman I T Is The Old Honourable And Learned Member Got A Dis

If he thinks that Lake George or Yass would make a more acceptable site than Dalgety, why should we condemn him for saying so? If the honourable member for Melbourne wishes the question to be settled, he should ""vote for one of the sites which have been offered to us by the Parliament of New South Wales. He must see that the Federal Capital should be near the trunk line of railway, so as. to be easily accessible from all the States. The expense of giving access to Dalgety by means of a railway would be very great. Even those who voted for Dalgety must feel that it is not a suitable place for the Federal Capital, because of its distance, its inaccessibility, its climate, and for other gety site will be looked upon as a monureasons. I trust thai this Parliament will show that it is a Federal. Parliament, and be willing to compromise with the State, instead of setting itself in opposition to it. If the matter comes to a vote, I shall oppose the retention of Dalgety; but, in view of the lateness of the session, and the fact that many members have left for their homes, I trust that the measure will, after some further discussion, be postponed until next year, when we can take a full vote, and when, I trust, we shall arrive at a satisbeen accustomed to a warm and genial factory settlement. deal of heat has been engendered by the speeches in which the Premier of New South Wales has asserted the just rights of that State; and, unfortunately, the question, to some honourable members, seems to have resolved itself into this-Shal l we support the Premier of New South Wales, or shall we follow the Prime Minister? Eveni f Dalgety were a suitable site, the fact that the people of New South Wales are opposed to its acceptance is a reason why this Parliament should reconsider its decision. will not allow themselves to be influenced by what I may call partizanship, but will recognise that the Premier of New South Wales has merely asserted the rights of that State, and that, if we are to show the true Federal spirit, we musl select a site which will be acceptable to the great bodv of the people of the Commonwealth. honourable members, in approaching the reconsideration of this question, will entirely disregard all the proceedings which have led to so much irritation. WhilstI recognise that the Premier of New South Wales is perfectly entitled to take up the attitude that he has adopted in asserting the rights of the State, it is rather unfortunate that he hasi taken his action at a time when there seemed to be some prospect of arriving by consultation at a satisfactory settlement of the Capital Site question. I trust that any feeling which' may have been aroused by his somewhat precipitate action, taken, I feel sure, without knowledge of the consultative proceedings among Federal members for securing a satisfactory understanding, will be allowed to evaporate, and that honourable members will endeavour to arrive at a settlement fair to all the States and beneficial to the Commonwealth. I fear that in years to come the selection of the Dalment to the stupendous imbecility of this Parliament. If .some honourable members had been a little more familiar with the characteristics of the site as to soil and climate, and other conditions. they would have agreed that it was. per1 haps, one of the most unsuitable that could have been selected. It may be a very good spot at which to raise polar bears, but is not to be recommended as a place of residence for persons who have No doubt a great climate. The country immediately surrounding Dalgety is of an utterly inhospitable character. It is desolate, rockstrewn, and practically bare of timber. Even the reports of the surveyors who originally reported on the site show that the vegetation is very stunted, and one passage in their report reads as follows:Even on the river banks the site is almost entirely destitute of timber, and this does not suggest the idea that parks and gardens will flourish. Surely we should regard the facilities, which the site will offer for making I trust that honourable members parks and gardens. The site is also unsuitable in other respects. Dalgety is distant from Cooma 30 miles. There is a very good road between the two localities At the present time, but the cost of a railway would be considerable. Dalgety is distant from Melbourne about 240 miles, and from Sydney over 330 miles.

The greater part of the Dalgety area consists of undulating treeless country, with frequent outcrops, of granite, and any one who visits the site must be struck with its inhospitable appearance. The occasional tufts of grass are bare on the one side, and are banked up with sand on the other. This, circumstance, taken in conjunction with the fact that buildings are shored up on the lee side with huge pieces of timber, indicates that it is absolutely a very exposed part of the country. average temperature in summer is between 70 and 80 degrees, and I have rarely heard of a temperature exceeding the higher of these registers. I have been at Dalgety in midsummer, when a heat-wave has been passing oyer the State, and the thermometer has registered 106 degrees in the shade at Sydney. And yet I have been absolutely frozen whilst travelling, in a coach at night, and glad to avail myself of the opportunity to sit alongside a big log fire and thaw myself out on New Year's morning. I can quite conceive that the climatic Conditions in midwinter are anything but agreeable. Mr Scrivener says, in the latest report now before usThe area of 100 square miles, as designed, emferable to Twofold Bay in every respect; braces the land most suitable for city and suburban buildings, but within an area so small no serious attempt can be made to protect the water supply, neither can any. source be embraced. any port which may be usedto divert It must be regarded merely as a city site. That, of course, relates only to an area of 100 square miles, and the argument of -course is used to urge the acquisition of a larger area of territory, but it is not reasonable to expect the Government of New South Wales to grant such a large tract of country as has been suggested. Coming back lo the question of cost, I find that, if the Commonwealth were to obtain 900 square miles of country, which is the area they appear determined to secure, the purchase-money would amount to Mr Johnson. £1,216,000, according to Mr Scrivener's estimate of value. Then, again, the approximate cost of building a breakwater at. Twofold Bay, which some honourable members hope to see included in the Federal territory, would amount to £1,500,000, probably more. The figures I have quoted as being required for railwayconstruction, together with the amount neThen, supposing that the terricessary for the construction of the breakwater at Twofold Bay, and the amount that would have to be devoted to the purchase of the territory, represent a total of £11,949,683. Then, again, I am credibly informed that the cost of the railway toconnect Dalgety with Twofold Bay would amount to at least £6,000 per mile, or a? total of £750,000. to which has to beadded the sum of £120.000 new expenditure on the existing Cooma line. ' So that Over £12,000,000 would have to be expended before one shilling could be spent"" upon the work of erecting the Capital. Do honourable members think the State of"" The New South Wales will expend large sum* of money in giving railway access to territory they do not wish to grant? I would"" point out to honourable members who voted"" for the Dalgety site because they considered that it was important to have accessto the sea, that an opportunity presentsitself to secure a port much more suitableand more easy of access. All the country at the back of Jervis Bay, extending to the railway line connecting Sydney and Melbourne, is sparsely populated, and I have no doubt whatever that a large portion of that territory would be readily granted by. New South Wales. In fact, I have little doubt that a much larger arear would be available there, and at .considerably less cost than at Dalgety. And JervisBay, as a port, is certainly infinitely prebut I do not say I am prepared to advocate the surrender by New South Wales of"" trade from the port of Sydney which must, from its facilities and geographical position, ever remain the principal port of Australia. It must be remembered that the people of New South Wales accepted the Constitution Bill because they expected that they would derivesome substantial benefit from having the Federal Capital located within their borders. Sir Edmund Barton, during the Federal campaign, went so far as to say that the Capital would be located in such* a position as to confer on Sydney substantial benefits in the matter of trade. have departed from the spirit of the bond so far as that element is concerned. Dal.gety is not within a reasonable distance of Sydney. It is true that it is beyond the 100-mile limit, but it is also almost as far away from that limit as any site possibly -could be. -Capital at Dalgety would confer no benefit upon New South Wales. In this connection I wish to direct attention to the resolution --that was passed at the Premiers' Conference with reference to the Federal Capital -Site question. It reads as follows: It is considered that the fixing of the site of the of trade. That advantage cannot be conCapital is a question which might well be l e f t to the Parliament to decide; but in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this -matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause, so that while the Capital -cannot be fixed at Sydney or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales, at a reason-able distance from that city. I admit that a great difference of opinion may exist as to what would be a reason.able distance from Sydney; but, at the .same time, the words of the resolution have to be read in conjunction with the provision that the Capital shall be situated not less than 100 miles from Sydney. -might be fairly concluded that the site would be selected as near as possible to Sydney, outside the 100-mile limit. understand that that limit was imposed primarily, for the purpose of excluding the -choice of another site, which was in much favourI refer to Moss Vale. Having -excluded that site, I do not think it ever -occurred to those who were responsible for the insertion in the Constitution of the 100 miles limit that a site should be chosen -which would be practically inaccessible from Sydney. And the right honourable member -for East Sydney, who was; a party to the agreement, has assured us that it was intended that ihe site should be somewheve near the 100-mile limit. I am quite sure that had the people of New South Wales ever step as going to the extreme confines of would not have voted for the acceptance of the Commonwealth Constitution. Sir Edmund Barton took special pains to impress upon the people of Sydney that they ""would derive a substantial benefit from communication with the Federal Capital. He ""led them to believe that the trade from that Capital would go to Sydney. They were enisled by these representations into voting We for a proposal which under other circumstances they would not have supported. That fact is upon record. I certainly heard The erection of the Federal Sir Edmund Barton make a similar statement at a meeting which he addressed in Sydney. He assured his hearers that, although Sydney had been excluded for a variety of reasons, a site would be selected in a locality which would confer upon that city a substantial advantage in the way ferred by the selection of Dalgety. For all practical purposes the Seat of Government might just as well be at Timbuctoo. Dalgety appears less to conform to all those requirements which should be our fks,t consideration than any other site save one that we have been asked to consider. In speaking upon this matter, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie cast some doubt upon the reliability of the printed copy of the memorandum to which the Premiers of the sixStates attached their signatures. He even went so far as to suggest that the copies which had been cirIt culated in this Chamber, printed under authority of the New South Wales Government, contained substantial alterations I from the original document. So far from that having been the case, I find upon comparing them that no alteration whatever has been made in their wording, and consequently his charge falls to the ground. The Minister of Home Affairs, in introducing this Bill, declared that the previous Premier of New South Wales, had refused to take any part in the selection of the site, because he regarded that as a matter within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament. Even admitting that that is so, it will be seen that Sir John See's remarks referred not to the acquisition of Federal territory, but to the selection of the site. I do not dreamed that such a think that it has ever been contended that it is the province of New South the State was contemplated they Wales to determine the site. WhatI complain of is that the Government did not ask that State to grant us the necessary territory before this Parliament selected the site. I have always maintained that the proper method of procedure was firs,f to negotiate with New South Wales for th* grant or acquisition of territory, and then to choose the site. I would also point out that Sir John See did not speak with the authority.",45,Chapman I T Is The Old Honourable And Learned Member Got A Dis

On only one . side of the harbour is there anything like safe anchorage for vessels of fairly large tonnage, and even that is unsuitable for vessels of great draught. It is almost an open roadstead. When there is an easterly or south-easterly swell running into twofold Bay, even vessels lying alongside the extreme end of the wharf which runs out from Eden on the protected side of the port roll to such an extent that many of their passengers often suffer from sea-sickness. sentatives of Western Australia, who urge that if Twofold Bay were a Federal port they would be able to travel by some of the fine inter-State steamers, and land almost directly at the door of the Capital, cannot know what sort of harbour exists there. If they did, they would dismiss such an idea from their minds. There is a limited area of harbour .at Boyd Town, on the southern shore, which is sheltered from the south-easterly and southerly winds, but not from the north-easterly winds. ' On the other hand, the northern shore is more or less exposed to the full force of southeasterly gales blowing in from a stretch of ocean several thousands of miles in extent. To make the port a safe anchorage for vessels of fairly large tonnage, an immense breakwater would have to be run out from Boyd Point, and at the lowest estimate the cost of such a work would lie £1,500,000. members who think that the Federal Capital should have a port of its own, I would point out that Jervis Rav, which lies between Twofold Bay and Sydney, is a port much superior to Twofold Bay, while the country between it and the main line from Adelaide to Brisbane, passing through Melbourne and Svdney, contains several sites suitable for a Federal Capital. The geographical position of Sydney, however, is such that it must always be the great supplying and commercial centre of Australia. I hope that the Parliament will reconsider this matter, apart from all provincial considerations, and. in the interests of Australia as a whole, and that honourable members will put aside their pesrJsonal prejudices, and remember that their determination will affect future generations. I hope that the Postmaster-General, who appears to be soenamoured of the Dalgety site, will forget that he is representing a constituency containing a Federal site honourable member's site? any site, though I am prepared to say which, in my opinion, is the best of certain sites which may be mentioned. I should like a site to be chosen adjacent to the main trunk line of raijway, and, for that reason, voted for Lyndhurst, which, although not on the main line, is close to a line which, had the Federal Capital been located there, would have become the main The repreline, connecting the Capitals of the States. But in voting for Lyndhurst, although 1 indicated my preference for that site before the other sites then offered, I did not indicate my preference for it above any other possible site. able member made up his mind as to which site he will vote for? mind until I know what sites are to be offered to us. The Postmaster-General, in supporting Dalgety, is not supporting the best site in his electorate, because there are others which, from every point of view, are superior to it. The only recommendation of Dalgety seems to be its abundant water supply. that the country surrounding Lake George is to be tacked on to my electorate. Does the honourable member favour the Laike To those honourable George site before the Dalgety site? orable member think that it is as good as the Lyndhurst site? say in the absence of surveyors' reports.

A t this stage of the session I do not wish to criticise the action of the Government very much, but I must express my regret that we got off the track of friendly negotiations,, as we did when we declined to go into Committee to consider the expression of the wishes of the New South Wales Farliament in connection with this question. That is the point at which the Government went off the track. might have determined that any change in our selection was impossible; we might have made up our minds that the sites offered by the New South Wales Parliament were inadmissible, and could not be considered; but, recognising the undoubted standing of New South Wales as the State in which the Capital h> to be, and as the State whose territory is to be taken for the purpose of establishing the Capital, surely we ought to have gone into Committee, and to have paid New South Wales the common courtesy of considering her requests. misconceives, and for such a conciliatory public man, strangely misconceives, the situation, when he regards this as a courteous step. We have not considered the request of the New South Wales Parliament. We are going on as if it had never been made. This matter presents itself in two aspects. One is the choice by the Federal Parliament of a. site, and the other is the disinclination of the New South Wales Parliament to grant that site, followed by an offer of other sites. If the New South Wales Parliament had simply considered our choice, and had said "" No , "" without taking any further step, our position would have been sound, but, instead of that, the State Farliament first said "" No "" to our choice it. cannot consider matters together. Governments can come together, but Parliaments cannot. By-and-by they may be able to ; but at present they cannot, and, perhaps, it is just as well that they cannot. If the New South Wales Parliament had said "" No"" to our choice, and done nothing more, I we should have had no duty such as I refer to, but when they followed up their rejection of our choice with an offer of three^ other sites, the position was different.""

If in the ordinary affairs of life, two individuals had interests in common, and one expressed an intention of which the other disapproved, and made an alternative suggestion, what would be said if the person who made the first suggestion took no notice and pursued his own course? I contend that the people of New South Wales have absolute justification for the irritation they feel owing to the contemptuous way in which their wishes have been treated.

Wales Parliament, by resolution, haw asked us to reconsider the question ? nothing. Nobody can deny that the Parliament of New South. Wales has a right to express a wish upon this subject. That goes without saying. It did express a wish by resolution, not by way of saying, "" Take this site, or we will grant you no other,"" but by offering us three sites. I say that that suggestion ought to have been taken into consideration in Committee, irrespective of whether or not we intended to pay it the slightest consideration. But. instead of doing that, the Parliament of New South Wales was treated as we should treat an officious letter-writer. Its communication has been thrown into the waste-paper basket. Of course, it may be urged that the Government of the Commonwealth have bestowed a good deal of time upon this question. That, however, is no answer to my statement. The matter is one between Parliament and Parliament, and it is not sufficient for an Under Secretary to reply to a State Minister. It must be a matter of equal authority, of Government dealing with Governemnt. and Parliament with Parliament. The Commonwealth Parliament, through no fault of its own, has not taken the wishes of the New South Wales Parliament into consideration. Now, I pass away from that aspect of the nuestion, because we have to deal with the situation which has since arisen. I say that there will be no justice rendered to New South Wales by professing to reconsider this matter at a time like the present, when half of the members have left for their homes. We are here at a time when only honourable members like myself, who have not been doing their duty, can possibly be fit to consider this matter. Honourable members have been working under a very great strain for weeks past, and their own sensations must tell them that they are not fit to grapple with this question as it ought to be grappled with. At the present stage of the session, I do not consider that the House will improve the situation at all by proceeding with this B ill . I think I may speak for my colleagues from New South Wales pretty generally, and I consider we ought to be as much interested in the matter as is any other honourable member. No ; because if it did not because of the action of somebody outside of this House. found, from the few inquiries which I have been able to make since I arrived here, that rightly or wrongly, the action which was recently taken in New South Wales, instead That would have led to of inducing honourable members to approach this question in a more conciliatory frame of mind, has had exactly t'he opposite effect. member himself would not have taken similar action. is a great deal of ground for the dissatisr faction which has been expressed iti New South Wales, and I have endeavoured to give one or two reasons for it. But I wish to make the best of difficulties as they arise. I do feel that the temper of Parliament-in view of what has recently taken place in New South Wales-is not favorable to the calm and successful settlement of this question. ences to "" escaped lunatics "" are not calculated to create a good feeling. of compliment conveyed in that phrase, because, after all, we -were clever enough to escape. Some people cannot do that. Just as I deprecate very strongly the use of objectionable language in this Chamber, I deplore the use of such expressions as that to which the honourable member has referred. They are the last expressions in the world that should be used when there is any prospect of friendly negotiations.

I should like to say a word or two in reference to the caucus, hut this is not the time to do so.

It suited me to support the honourable gentleman in the selection of Dalgety, in order to avoid a worse evil; but when I have a chance of obtaining a better site-on e of which I was originally in favourI am going every time to try to assist in promoting that prospect. I have put my views very plainly. In September last. I stated very clearly why I voted for Dalgety:I admit that we desired another site than that of Dalgety, but we accepted that as the next commendable; and I am prepared, just as staunchly as ever, to support the-choice of the Parliament. My own impression, as against that of others in New South Wales, who so much assail this selection, is that it is absolutely the best that New South Wales is ever likely to get-that any change would absolutely be for the worse. If they do so, not only is it That was the basis on which I founded my support of Dalgety. I have every reason to believe, however, that a very great change has come over the feelings of some honourable members in connection with this subject. I have grounds for the belief that if this question be re-opened, there is a reasonable prospect of the selection, of a site more in the direction of that which I originally favoured, and one which is more likely than is Dalgety to give satisfaction to the people of New South Wales. The Minister of Home Affairs will see that my position is a perfectly fair one. that he likes best; if he cannot get that he supports the site which he next favours. That is the course which I have followed all through. I say that, as against Tumut,. Bombala, or Tooma., I am in favour of Dalgety. That led me to vote the right honourable gentleman informed him that the selection was final and absolute, and could not be re-opened. whether he was wrong or right, because I am sorry to say that I do not retain a very keen recollection of my private conversations. Some people keep diaries, but I do not.

I think that the arguments which have been used are vicious and unsound. question is, what the agreement meant to the Premiers and to the peoples of the States, not what it means to those who have an interest in reading it upside down. I hope that this already painful controversy will not be envenomed by treatment of this kind. right honourable gentleman tried to place a legal construction on part of it, which the right honourable member for Balaclava repudiates ? done so. of Government being in New South Wales, and different from the meeting place of Parliament. several other learned counsel gave the same opinion as to what was meant with reference to New South Wales, and I believe that I expressed my opinion on the subject in an interview; but I have no recollection of any controversy with the right honourable member for Balaclava on the subject. I should be surprised to have a controversy with him on the point upon which I am now speaking. I think it will be found that he is of the opinion that it was not intended that a further disability should be added to the 100 miles limit, because, if that is what is intended, the limit' might have been regarded as 200, or 300, or 400 miles. We were not prepared for a limit of 100 miles, and a legal construction which would compel the Capital to be placed somewhere down on the Murray, near the constituency of Indi.

Seat of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Government Bill. That was the spirit and I will quote his own words. I have here a report of a speech made by him, in which he makes the pledge to stand by Dalgety. honourable member refers, and has handed to me, was delivered in this Chamber in December, 1904, and is reported at page 8561 in vol. xxiv. of Hansard. I am reported to have saidTheI f they are, the Federal Capital will be established in New South Wales at no distant date; but, just as it is possible for the Federal Parliament in its treatment of the subject to so act that there will be no Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, it is possible for the Government and Parliament of New South Wales to so act that there will be no Federal Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, unless we have an inherent right to select the Capital by our own will. That is a question of serious importance, which I hope will never have to be considered. I hope that those who have this matter at heart, will rest satisfied that the Government will loyally regard the decision of this Parliament, unless it is rescinded, and, so far as I am concerned, any attempt to rescind it will meet with my strongest opposition. My reason for those remarks was given in September last, three months ago. There, was a fight between Tooma and Dalgety, and it was such a near thing that but for a marvellous achievement on the part of the Postmaster-General, Tooma would have been selected. The Minister of Trade and Customs was led into a division when he thought that he was quite safe, but everything was wrong. That secured Dalgety for us, and I knew that it stood upon such a frail footing that unless I clung to it with all my power, we should be buried down at Tooma. I told the Postmaster-General that if Tooma were selected I should counsel the people of New South Wales to absolutelv refuse to consider it. I did not tell him that about Dalgety. gentleman is practically doing that now. ing to this House. I suppose the honourable member for Gwydir does not deny that this House has a perfect right to alter its decision as to the site? but I think it was wrong for the right honourable gentleman to hold back such important information as he has communicated tonight. should have mentioned it even at this stage.",59,Chapman Because We Sir John Forrest I T Is Identical With

However, the incident occurred so many years ago that I feel that I may be forgiven for mentioning it now. But be that as it may, I have taken up an absolutely clear position. I would stand by Dalgety to the last when there was any danger of a worse site being chosen. Dalgety was never my choice, and any one looking through the debates will find that I did not use one single expression of satisfaction with regard to it. It was forced upon me as the least of the evils that threatened New South Wales. one, only it is more distant. number of matters in selecting a site for the capital of Australia.

I disliked No. 3 because I thought it utterly bad, and I supported No. 2 site, which was not so bad. I now believe that I can get my original selection, and when I elect to 'take it, I am called a political contortionist. That is a matter of common sense that cannot be appreciated by some members of the Labour Party. I am shifting from Dalgety because I think I can get something better. If , however, to the f by I find that I cannot do that, I shall stick to granted Dalgety. If we were to pass this Bill tomorrow, we should not move one inch further. I think that is one of the strongest reasons for waiting until we get something in a Bill that will enable us to make a forward step. vent the right honourable gentleman from altering the Bill so as to accomplish that. we have a Government, including a number of able men, who have only a little Bill to draft, and yet they ask a stranger like myself, who comes here once in three months, to put it in shape for them.

The Prime Minister made a most unhappy interjection when he practically threw upon me the necessity of knocking the Bill into shape. There is one important announcement in the measure which 1 had overlooked. The first clause readsThis Act may be cited as the Seat of Government Act 1905. What was the title of the other Act that fixed Dalgety as the Capital Site? I think it was something like that. In what way does this Bill advance one pace the matter of fixing the Capital Site? We have passed an Act declaring that the Capital of the Commonwealth shall be at Dalgety. Consequently that is already law. Clause2 of the Bill statesThe territory described in schedule A to this Act. . . is hereby determined to he the territory in which tbe Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be. As I have said, that declaration is flatly against the Constitution. The Capital Site cannot be selected inany territory which has not been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. The next clause, instead of providing that steps shall be taken to acquire the territory-becaus e there are_ alternative words in the Constitution which point to the process of acquiring territory if a grant is not made-empower s the Minister to accept a grant by the State of New South Wales of the territory described in Schedule Au l l extent to wfiich the territory can be the State within the meaning of section 125 of the Constitution.",60,Chapman Because We Sir John Forrest I T Is Identical With

In view of the attitude of the Government of New South Wales, that is silly in the extreme. If this were a conciliatory move, there might be something in it, whether it was sensible or not.

Government, as was their duty, immediately sent to the New South Wales Premier a copy of the Act containing the determination of the Federal Parliament, and asked him to take the steps necessary to carry out grant being made by New South Wales. their choice. This Bill is simply repeating, as a dismal farce; that which was alreadv provided for by this Parliament months and months ago. The Minister is empowered to obtain, and the Governor General is empowered to accept, a grant by the State of New South Wales of the territory described in ScheduleA to the Act. The expression "" grant "" implies the giving of something. It does not imply the forcible taking of anything. It suggests ah approach to the Premier of New South Wales for a grant, but action has been taken already in that direction. The moment this Parliament chose Dalgety, we asked the New South Wales Government to take the steps that were necessary to give effect to the Seat of Government Act. Now we are going to solemnly pass a measure empowering the Minister to ask the Premier of New South Wales to grant us something In a territorial that he has alreadv declared he will not grant.

It all comes back to this: That the Premier of New South Wales can only be asked to grant the territory.

There are two things which might be done-on e is to take up a strong position, and assert whatever rights we may have in the matter ; and the other is to adopt a conciliatory attitude, and endeavour to arrive at an amicable arrangement in that way. This Bill does neither. It asserts that the Seat of Government shall be at Dalgety. That is not conciliation. Then it s.as, in effect, "" Will you kindly grant us this particular site, embracing an. area of 900 square miles?"" The measure will raise another inflammable subject in New South Wales.

The Act which was then passed, partly at the request of the right honourable member for East Sydney himself, did not proceed to determine finally and precisely certain matters which might well have been decided, and which we wish to have determined now. It was urged that the Bill should not be couched in mandatory terms, but that the word "" should "" should be substituted for "" shall"" in section 3. Section2 .says that the Seat of Government "" shall "" be within seventeen miles of Dalgety, and the following section declared that the territory to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth ""should"" contain an area of not less than 900 square miles, and have access to the sea. will, therefore, see that there was nothing precisely determined in that Act, except that Dalgety must be the locality, and that it was the wish of this Parliament that the Federal territory should contain an area of 900 square miles, and have access to the sea. At that time there was no talk whatever of this newly-found argument in reference to the Premiers' Conference. there was.

Until such determination, the Parliament shall be summoned to meet at such place within the Commonwealth as a majority of the Governments of the States, or in the event of an equal division of opinion amongst the Governments, as the Governor General may direct. That left it absolutely open to this Parliament to establish the Seat of Government anywhere in Australia. After the failure in New South Wales to get the Constitution adopted by 80,000 affirmative votes, the Parliament of that State passed certain resolutions. The Legislative Assembly included amongst them a resolution which was taken to the Premiers' Conference by the right honourable member for Honourable members East Sydney, and which is of the highest' importance. The resolutions to which I refer, were submitted to the New South Wales Parliament in August, 1898. The Legislative Assembly of that State adopted the resolution which I am about to read, but the Legislative Council, by a majority of one, affirmed that the Seat of Government should be in Sydney. The decision of that body was, however, ignored by the right honourable member for East Sydney, and he rested his case upon the resolution adopted by the Legislative Assembly, which The Capital of the Commonwealth :That clause 124 should be amended, and promade in the B ill for the establishment of Capital in such place wifhin the miles from Sydney in any way altered the",63,Honourable Members O H

With all respect to the right honourable member for East Sydney, I would say that such an argument is nonsensical. going to show that, when he returned from the Conference of Premiers, the right honourable member took the view that I am adopting. I find that in the New South Wales Hansard, Vol. 97, page 37, the right honourable gentleman is reported, in the ment, course of the debate on the Address-inFederalandParliament Reply, to have made the following statement on 2ist February, 1899The only desire which our ParliamentThat is the New South Wales Parliament. I may say, in passing, that I do not propose to read the whole speech made by the honourable gentlemanat any rate, which this Assembly expressed, was been passed at the Conference of Premiers. that the Capital should be fixed somewhere within It was almost immediately prior to the introthe boundaries of New South Wales, and when an duction of the Federal Enabling Bill in the honourable member of this House definitely tested the question whether I should not go into that Legislature, of New South Wales. Conference with a commission to urge the claims of Sydney to the Capital, the House by a majority of 78 votes to 12 negatived that proposition. So that I was not sent into the conference to advocate the claims of Sydney alone. The right honourable member is now getting very close to such an advocacy. I find nothing throughout the whole of that speech to suggest that there is any alteration, either in the spirit or in the letter, of the power of the Federal Parliament. On the contrary, I find words as to the power of the Federal Parliament-if it wishes to exercise itwhich lead in the opposite direction. There is an expression of opinion that the Federal Parliament will, in fact, establish the Capital somewhere, as near as possible, to the 100-mile limit, but there is no suggestion that good faith would be broken, or that the course would be illegal, if the Federal Parliament should otherwise determine. The right honourable gentleman acquiesced in the observations of the then leader of the Opposition, Mr Barton, sayingAs the leader of the Opposition pointed out, Melbourne is barred to the extent of 186 miles. Showing that Melbourne was barred to a greater extent than was Sydney. was barred. Sir Edmund-the n Mr Barton say on that occasion? I think that his observations are worth reading. At pages 28 and 29 of the volume of Hansard from which I have just quoted, the right honourable gentleman is reported to have given utterance to his own view of the position. I shall be permitted, perhaps, to quote, first of all, a sentence at the end of the passage that I wish to read, because it sums up the position. At page 29, Sir Edmund Barton is reported to have saidThere is only one place for the Seat of Govern, that is the place determined on by the in New South Wales. There was no suggestion of a limit at that time. Going back a few lines, I find that Mr Barton saidNow for the question of the Capital the Premiers' Conference? February, 1899, after the resolution had upon the question? bearing upon it, and I am sorry that the honourable and learned member does not follow me. It shows that at that time the meaning now sought to be placed upon the words in the report of the Premiers' Conference, to which reference has been made, was never dreamt of. ter? Supposing we had only discovered the meaning to-day ? New South Wales, and the distinguished men of that State, never dreamt of suggesting any such breach of faith as that to which they now desire to give prominence.

What does that mean? Clearly that the Capital should be established anywhere in New South Wales, except within 100 miles of Sydney. tinuedLet us consider this matter, and see whether it is quite so serious as they suggest. I would rather that it had been the other way, but let us see whether it is quite so serious as some persons outside, notably, -sundry writers of numerous letters to the newspapers, would seem to make out. If the Capital is a little more, than 100 miles the town, but of the South-Eastern district, from Sydney, it would still be within a three hours' rail journey, and I take it that it will be the endeavour-howeve r Federal, and however patriotic minded they may be-of a large number of the representatives of New South Wales, and most of them, so long as considerations of position and climate are faithfully observed, to see that that Capital is not placed too remotely from either Sydney or Melbourne. If cofTslderation's of climate are observed, it will not be very near Melbourne if it is in New South Wales. Further on he saidI am not going to point out any place as a suitable site for the Federal Capital. Buti f we once recognise this position, that it will be a probable necessity agreed upon throughout Australia that the Federal Capital should be placed in some position which has distinct climatic advantages, it will be easy for honourable members to see that the choice to that extent will be narrowed down, and that this distance of 100 miles from Sydney does not work so much against Sydney as it works against Melbourne,, for the distance from Melbourne to Albury is 186 miles. I should mention that, in a few lines which I did not think it necessary to read, Mr Barton pointed out that the Federal Parliament would probably sit in summer, bewould require to select some place with a Let us recollect that the decision that the Capithe same time a decision that if it is placed on that line of railway at all, it shall not be within 186 miles of Melbourne.

I think these are are worth taking into consideration impartially; and while we may have our regrets on a subject handicap than we are placing the city of Sydney. ference is not borne out by the facts. Let us see what is the next point.

It is entirely contrary to the arrangement arrived at at the Conference of Premiers."" Let us take one step further. I think that I can prove that the Parliament of New South Wales has giveri an answer to this allegation,, because in December, 1904, it passed the following resolution, which Mr Carruthers forwarded to the late Government on the n t h Apri l last:In order to assist in a Constitutional determination of the seat of the Government of the Commonwealth, the Government of this State is authorized to formally offer a grant to the Federal Government of an area of 100 or 200 square miles at or near the following : Tumut, Lyndhurst, and Yass. Tumut is thirty miles further than is Dalgety from Sydney. Sir flies it is twenty-six miles nearer. familiar with the distances, but I am told that Dalgety is 290 miles from Sydney. Sir WILLIAM LYNE ence if one goes round by way of Cootamundra and Gundagai; but the direct line is shorter. the route which people take to get there. Tumut is .310 or 320 miles from Sydney. General think that people would always go round by road to get to the Federal Capital? substantial purposes, there is very little difference in distance from Sydney between Dalgety and Tumut, and, as the New South' Wales Parliament has said to us, "" We are willing to give you Tumut,"" which is practically 300 miles from Sydney, what breach of the compact shall we make if we choose another place which is practically the same distance from the capital. After the resolutions of the New South Wales Parliament were passed, the right It was said honourable member for East Sydney, speaking in this Chamber on the 14th December,. 1904, saidI understand that the Government of New South Wales submitted to the Legislative Assembly of that State a list containing the names of four The modus operandi places which might be offered by the Parliament of New South Wales to the Federal Parliament. The Parliament of New South Wales would be absolutely within its rights in any offer that they might make to us. The proposal submitted to the Legislative Assembly of that State was that one of four sites should be offered, and that body, I understand, decided to omit from the list of sites the name of Dalgety. In other words, it determined not to offer Dalgety as asite for the Federal Capital. If that has happened, it does not in the slightest degree alter the decision arrived at by us, and embodied in an Act of Parliament' It may amount to an expression of a desire to ask this Parliament to reconsider the decision at whicb it has arrived, but the omission of the name from a proposed offer does not alter the decision of this Parliament. If it should turn out thai, a majority of the members of this Parliament aie prepared to repeal the Act which we passed, and choose some site other than Dalgely, the object which I suppose the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales had in view in omitting the name ot that place from its list might be secured. So far as f am concerned-and I think that T may speak for my colleagues-w e are satisfied to act upon the choice which has been arrived at by this Parliament. If it be impossible to arrange any voluntary understanding between the State and the Commonwealth, another situation may arise, but it w ill be time enough to deal with that situation, when it arises. A little later he saidAlthoughI represent a New South Wales constituency, and will always loyally respect the just rights of that State in every way, I am not likely to forget the duties which I owe to this ParT h a t is the differliament in regard to a matter about which 1 think we have the largest share of choice; because it seems to me that the selection of the Federal Site belongs more properly to the Federal Parliament than to a Parliament which is not to occupy the Federal Capital. Yet he talks now about our action in flouting the New South Wales Parliament, and about a breach of contract. What is it we hear to-day ? That this Parliament is to be controlled by the Parliament of New South Wales. we have been told, because it is said that we cannot have any land that has not beer* granted to us by the Parliament of New South Wales. grant. gentleman concluded his speech by sayingI hope that those who have this matter at heart will rest satisfied that the Government will loyally",66,Honourable Members O H

After the resolution had been communicated to the Federal Government, interviews took place between Mr Reid, Mr Dugald Thomson, and myself.

Is not that nonsense? The argument is that New South Wales must come to us and dictate what territory it is to give; and if it is not willing to give us any particular territory, we cannot obtain it. torney-General say the State will dictate to us as to what territory it is willing to give? give you just what we like."" that amounts to dictating where the Federal Capital shall be. We have already determined that the Capital shall be within seventeen miles of Dalgety, and we are going to mark out the territory in New South Wales. And New South Wales cannot stop us from getting that territory. ' It was never intended that any State should prevent the people of the Commonwealth from getting their Capital, and great as New South Wales is, and great as is the respect we pay her, our duty to the Australian people is greater still. We mark out the territory containing 900 square miles in Schedule A, and we say that that territory, subject to any addition that it may be necessary to make for the purpose of water supply, is hereby determined to be the territory within which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be. That is the first practical step. We say : "" That is what we desire for the territory-'no t the Capital, but the territory.""

The words ""can be granted,"" which have troubled the right honourable member for East Sydney, mean this: Under the law, the Crown is the ultimate owner of the land. The Crown may grant a tenancy in fee-simple, or under lease, to any one else. That has been done in regard to some of the land, but the Crown has retained its whole right as to other land. We ask that we may be empowered to obtain from New South Wales the f u l l amount that they have to give-it may be the ownership, undiminished by any tenancy, or it may be ultimate ownership, subject to tenancy in fee-simple, or otherwise, granted to some one else. As a Commonwealth, we ask to be placed in the same position with regard to that territory as the State of New South Wales occupies to-day. the word "" g r a n t "" to refer to property or H o w can the Atjurisdiction ? tion undoubtedly, and so far as Crown land is Concerned, it will refer to property also, If they say: "" We will because we provide, in clause 4From the day when the grant and acceptance take effect, all estates and interests held by. any person from the State of New South Wales within, the territory so granted and accepted shall continue to be held from the Commonwealth, on the same terms and conditions as they are on that day held from the State.

One of the objects of the Bill is to satisfy the desire previously expressed by the Government of New South Wales that we should put the matter in such a form that it could be tested.

If we are wrong in the view we take, we shall be beaten when the matter is referred to the High Court. The contention of New South Wales is that we cannot legally determine the site of the Federal Capital and the Federal territory until we have a grant from the State. If that argument is good, nothing we can do can have any effect. New South Wales will always have it in its power to defy the Commonwealth. We do not think it has that power, but we intend to afford the New South Wales Government an opportunity to submit that question to the High Court.

The Conference of Premiers followed, and, in deference to the feeling of New South Wales, as the oldest and most populous State, an arrangement was made that she should be assured of the possession of the Capital. Out of consideration for Victoria, however, a clause was inserted in the Constitution, providing that it should not be within TOO miles of Sydney.

801,Mr Dugald Thomson,"f shaildefending the Parliament or the"" Ministry of New South Wales; I shall have reason to admit that they have not acted always in the best interests of that State. The Attorney-General actually quoted a speech made by the right honourable member for East Sydney, after the Conference of Premiers, with the object of showing that it ifforded good ground for the argument that :he words "" a reasonable distance from Sydney"" do not convey the meaning which they clearly express. In this speech, the right honourable member for East Sydney said he had no doubt that the Federal Parliament would fix the Capital near the ioomile limit. stood that it could establish it wherever it pleased. question of power is one matter and that of justice is another. The honourable and learned member, in the course of his speech, dealt with the matter entirely from the point of view of power, and absolutely neglected the consideration of justice. orable member endeavoured to show, by quoting; from a speech made by' the right honourable member for East Sydney, that it was the desire df the late Ministry to flout the Parliament of New South Wales. That speech certainly did not bear the construction which' the Attorney-General placed upon it. The honourable and learned gentleman failed entirely to remember what has been stated quite recently in this House, that, as Minister of Home Affairs in the late Government, I had absolutely announced to the press, on behalf of the Ministry, that the resolutions passed by the Parliament of New South' Wales were not to be flouted, but, on the contrary, were to be taken into consideration by this Legislature. This same point was raised in October last. I was absent at the time, but I telegraphed to the deputy leader of the Opposition that an announcement had been made by the late Ministry that the resolutions of the New South Wales Parliament were to be brought before this Parliament for consideration. I referred him to a paper which, among others, gave my statement in that connection as the decision of the Ministry. On the 10th June last, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, as well as other newspapers, published a paragraph based on the information supplied by myseif. that I t is the intention of the Government to submit the Federal question at an early date to Parliament. Not in the last hours of the session, but at* an early dateThe procedure will probably be by way of resolution, although it has not yet been determined. The proposal is to allow the whole subject to be discussed, and the resolutions adopted by the New South Wales Parliament to be considered. The weakness of the Attorney-General's argument is shown by the fact that he endeavoured to twist a chance remark made by the right honourable member for East let it be underSydney was the inference to be drawn from the The whole speech. torney-General sought to draw the inference from a chance remark that the late Government were determined that the resolution passed by the New South Wales Parliament should not be treated with courtesy, and that that Parliament was to be flouted.

The honourable and learned gentleman, with singular audacity, has quoted a speech by the right honourable member for East Sydney, in which he said that the resolution passed by the Parliament of New South Wales had not in the slightest degree altered the decision of this Parliament. That is perfectly correct. But the right honourable member added, as the Attorney-General himself admitted-and",73,William Lyne No As The Crow

If it is not, is it possible to understand the position of some of the Attorney-General's colleagues?

I think that he is acting legitimately. taken to members of the late Ministry adopting a similar attitude? Were we not the Executive of Parliament? Is a Ministry to say that it will enforce those portions of an Act of Parliament with which it agrees, and that it will not enforce those with which' it disagrees? That would be an. absurdity. I think that it redounds to the credit of the late Ministry that, although the right honourable member for East Sydney said that he would have preferred another selection, he would not allow his personal predilections to interfere with the instructions he had received from Parliament. That is the position which I took up. We would not allow our personal predilections to interfere with the carrying out of the decision of Parliament, and we both did our best to have the question settled upon the basis fixed by this Legislature.

But why should exception be ticular site of the Capital. it was to be within seventeen miles of Dalgety. That was mandatory on the Government of the Commonwealth, but not on the Parliament of New South Wales. That was the difference. I do not accuse the honourable and learned gentleman of having intentionally misquoted Mr Carruthers' statement in any way, but the assertion that the right honourable member for East Sydney and I declared that the Act was mandatory on New South Wales is wrong. We made no Such statement. If the Minister of Home Affairs wishes to see what we said he has only to turn to the correspondence.

Whether it was desirable to pass those resolutions is another question.

Our final decision will commit the Commonwealth for all time to a particular site, and if there are doubts amongst honourable membersand I am sure there are amongst half the members of this House-as to the wisdom of our previous decision, why not consider before we go further? The remarks: made by myself and others in regard to the memorandum of the Premiers' Conference received very little attention when they were made. The House was then engaged in a scramble, groups of honourable members endeavouring to get votes for particular sites. Each individual member was endeavouring to get support for the site which he favoured, and efforts were being made, both within the Chamber and out-, side, to push the claims of certain localities. The consideration that should have been given to various arguments was not given, as is shown when it is denied that this more directly than any other is concerned in resolution of the Premiers' Conference was brought forward at an earlier stage. There is no doubt that the resolution was quoted, but, as I have sarild, there was then a battle as of particular sites, and considerations which should have guided us in the choice were neglected. We are in a different position to-day, seeing that we have selected a site to which the State most concerned very strongly objects. The State has not objected altogether, because of the distance from Sydney, although there was reason to .do so, dh view of ,the revival of the memorandum of the Premiers. The objection of the State is, that nothing like the best site has been selected, and, if we find that a number of usually fair-minded people and strong Federalists are roused on this matter, and talk about secession. although I do not agree with that language I think we ought to pause in order to inquire whether there is anv reason. If there is merely a colour of injustice, I think we ought to take time for consideration. Of course, my suggestion may mean a little delay, which will, perhaps, not be altogether in the interests of New South Wales, bearing in view the desirability of having a Capital wSthin the borders of the State at the earliest possible date. However, I urge that we should carefully reconsider the matter before we proceed further. The question may be deferred-until the following session. We are really considering this Bill with an invitation to the prorogation in our pockets. on the invitation. what does that mean? It can only mean that the prorogation is so near, that if theprinting of the invitations were delayed, it would be too late to print them. In national affairs of.this kind, particularly where there Is inflamed feeling on one side or the other, or on both, and more particularly when the feeling is between fellowcitizens of the Commonwealth, it is desirable to allow time for calm consideration. Surely it is better to allow a little time to elapse until the friction and the memory of hard words have passed away. We shall then bein a cooler and calmer atmosphere, with) fuller knowledge of all the facts and circumstances.
