Wednesday, 24 June 2009 ----Herbert Electorate: US Essex the US Essex will not be coming to Townsville next week because the port cannot accommodate this huge American warship. At times of such great economic struggle around the country, particularly in Townsville, the visit of an American warship is no small thing for our community. Generally, it is worth about $93 per head of population in Townsville when a ship of that size comes into port. While often the first thing that comes to mind is our great young American friends having a good time and exploring the world in between long bouts at sea, what we often forget is the positive and sometimes crucial economic impact that this can have on our local community. The planned visit by the US Essex to Townsville next week would have delivered exactly that, and the figures are eye opening. A visit of nearly 4,000 people would have represented a temporary surge of almost three per cent in the local economy through an eight-day injection of between $10 million and $14 million. Almost everyone would have stood to gain: hotels, restaurants, taxis, tour operators. Even the Cowboys, the most popular team in the league now, would have had an enthusiastic, though ill-informed, sporting audience. I might say, for those here from New South Wales, that the captain of the Cowboys, Jonathan Thurston, will lead Queensland to victory in the State of Origin tonight. Townsville next week will not be greeting the ship that has had a long and proud history with Australia, a ship that has always participated in the biennial joint military exercises off the north coast and that in 2001-02 helped us to directly support the East Timor peace process. Indeed, it will steam further north to, dare I say it, dock in Cairns, with the Townsville dock overcrowded with other commercial operators. The state member for Thuringowa was quoted in the paper this morning as saying that this is all my fault because I opposed the development of a cruise ship terminal. That is entirely wrong; I did no such thing. The state government did a dodgy deal with one of the white-shoe brigade on the Gold Coast to build a residential development of 1,000 residences adjacent to the Townsville port as well as to build the cruise ship terminal. It was entirely inappropriate. The whole community, to a person, said, ‘It is inappropriate to have a residential development adjacent to an operating port because of the problems that will occur in the years to come.’ I certainly opposed that but I have never opposed a cruise ship terminal being built in Townsville-in fact, I helped secure defence money to make it a multiuser terminal so that ships like the US Essex could visit Townsville and bring the goodwill that often follows from such important visits by our foreign neighbours. Australian Council of Local Government Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (9.33 am)-I rise today to speak about an important week in the House, and perhaps not for the reason that many members would imagine.

232,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,,177,Constituency Statements
233,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.30 Am),"Residents of Townsville have woken up to find thatond time, and this year’s theme is ‘Building resilience in local communities’. It is a theme that incorporates the challenges faced by local communities today-challenges caused by global economic recession and by natural disasters such as fire and flood, as well as challenges to our capacity to meet the requirements of climate change. These are tough times, we all acknowledge that, but I have high hopes for this meeting because local governments are resilient, as indeed are Australians. Australians are also inventive. It is this combination, I think, that is going to see us through. The Carbon Pollution Production Scheme got thrashed about in the Senate, certainly. Local government members are discussing, though, how these challenges can be met on the micro level, the level where we all live: our local landscape-our homes, our parks, our towns, our shopping centres, our sports and leisure centres. There will be spirited discussion and dialogue this week about resilience at every level-how we cope environmentally and how we build social resilience. We are investing in more than 3,300 projects right across the country. This is part of the government’s Community Infrastructure Program. The CIP will deliver $800 million directly to local governments for local community projects. That is designed with one purpose in mind: for local governments to be able to work on the projects that have been on the books but, importantly, to keep Australians in local government areas in work. There are many local mayors and local government associations I have been meeting with this week. They applaud this measure. Last year we saw the ACLG announce the first round of CIP funding, and that was $250 million. That was distributed to 565 councils across the country. They were for projects that were ready to go. Some of the projects under that funding, for instance, that have been able to progress in my area in Bennelong include projects that the City of Ryde is working on-they are extending the Buffalo Creek walking trail. And Hornsby council is putting that money into eight different projects-upgrades to ovals and work on learning and leisure centres. So this is a funding initiative from the Commonwealth direct to local government that has been widely applauded. There is a $550 million component of this which has been subject to a competitive bid for projects of more than $2 million. I am pleased to say 137 projects right across the country have been funded through this and in the member for Herbert’s electorate. (Time expired) McMillan Electorate: Anniversaries statements in the time allotted. It has been a month of anniversaries in south Gippsland. Fish Creek celebrated the 125th anniversary of the town’s first settlement. There was an amazing parade of wedding gowns down through the ages in Fish Creek. Some 500 to 800 people returned to Fish Creek. This celebration tied in very well with the 90th anniversary of South Gippsland Secondary College, formerly the Foster High School. It was estimated that several thousand people returned on the Saturday to their old school. Special thanks must go to Colleen Smith and her family, who worked so tirelessly to coordinate the reunion.

234,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (9.36 Am),"It is hard to get all we want to put into thesereunion. The celebrations went on all weekend. It was a most memorable weekend for both the Fish Creek and Foster communities. We also celebrated a 70th wedding anniversary, that of Beth and Alex MacKay. Seventy years married for all of us seems a lifetime-nearly a couple of generations. This couple were presented with a certificate from the mayor-we do not call them shire presidents anymoreJohn Duscher. Celebrations, I believe, are still going on today for that 70th wedding anniversary. I also wrote to the Pakenham St James Church, my own church, with congratulations on the 125th anniversary that they celebrated. As a member of St James Pakenham since the early seventies I have had the great honour of receiving the ministry of Stephen Rigby, Adrian Moore, Roger Rich-who carried us through the Ash Wednesday bushfires-Ian Battersby and Hilary Roath. Their faithfulness to their congregation has been a cornerstone of life in the church. I am reminded of the faithful dedication of the eight o’clock service community who worship in the coldest of mornings, from the days of the Purten brothers, Cecil and Ken, to today’s faithful servants. All servants of the church are precious, and to pick out for special recognition only two is fraught with danger. However, such is the contribution from Dot Hardy and Margaret Walden in music and prayer that I am willing to take the risk. Music has been such an important part of the life of St James for such a long time. Their wonderful gift to us through their music has raised the spirits of the congregation and blessed us with each and every note that they have played. At this 125th anniversary we honour all who have worshipped and served at St James. We give thanks to the blessings of those who have passed through the doors of the house and for the solace and comfort found in the bosom of the congregation. Fremantle Electorate: Marine Bioregional Planning Process Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (9.39 am)-I want to speak briefly today about a matter of great interest and importance to my electorate of Fremantle. As members may be aware, the government is currently conducting the new and far-reaching Marine Bioregional Planning Process. This will result in marine bioregional plans being established around Australia under the umbrella of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and is in keeping with the commitment made in 1998 by all Australian governments to create a national system of marine protected areas. I am very pleased to say that the first area under consideration is the south-west region, which runs from Kangaroo Island in South Australia right around to the seas off Kalbarri in Western Australia, and of course it includes the marine environment adjacent to the Fremantle electorate. Fremantle has a long standing and varied engagement with the marine environment that forms its western boundary, and that encompasses Rottnest Island. The sea off Fremantle is enjoyed on a daily basis by thousands of Western Australians and it is plied by recreational vessels, fishing craft and the full range of shipping that makes use of Fremantle Port. It is also the focus of tourism, especially at Rottnest Island, and of a considerable fishing and maritime industry. The south-west region is a marine environment of great significance. To give just some idea of its special qualities: 70 to 90 per cent of the marine species found in this region are unique; the region includes critical habitats for the world’s largest animal, the endangered blue whale-Perth Canyon, for example, which is Australia’s largest marine canyon, is one of only two known feeding grounds for the blue whale in Australian waters; and the region is MAIN COMMITTEE strongly influenced by the warm Leeuwin Current, which is the longest running continuous coastal current in the world, at some 5,500 kilometres in length. The Save Our Marine Life group, which represents a range of organisations-namely, the Conservation Council of Western Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Pew Environment Group, the Nature Conservancy, WWF Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society-is working very hard to advocate on behalf of improved marine environmental management and protection in Western Australia. Save Our Marine Life’s first report, entitled Protecting Western Australia’s big blue backyard, argues persuasively for the creation of substantial no-take marine reserves. It is worth noting that less than one per cent of the region is currently protected by any kind of marine protection designation or area. An appropriate and much-needed increase in protected areas will not only secure the health of Western Australian oceans for the long-term but also improve the non-extractive uses in those areas including diving, ecotourism, scientific study, education and training, and recreational boating. Last week I was very pleased to be present when the Save our Marine Life group presented the minister for the environment with thousands of postcards signed by Western Australians who support a Western Australian protected marine area. Once the national system of marine bioregional plans is in place we will have a secure basis for the sustainable enjoyment and protection of our oceans, and all the creatures in them, and I know this will be very welcome in my electorate of Fremantle. Kenneth John Oram in Australian aviation and one of the foundations on which Army aviation was born. Ken was born on 8 March 1920. He attended Randwick Public School and went on to Sydney Boys High School, where he was school captain in 1937. Ken joined the CMF, a member of 1st Medium Brigade AFA, and then Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1940. Because of his timing in entering Duntroon he was one of the few staff officer cadets to be awarded the Efficiency Medal. Ken graduated senior under officer in 1942 and was awarded the King’s Medal for Outstanding Academic Achievement and the Sword of Honour for leadership abilities. He was only the fourth cadet in RMC’s history to do so. In 1942 Ken entered the war with the 9th Battery of the 2/5th Field Regiment at Milne Bay in Papua New Guinea. After what he described as ‘a short and nasty battle’, the Japanese were defeated for the first time in the war. He took part in the assault on Salamaua, fighting with both Australian and American troops. He gathered further experience with attachment to the US Navy on PT boats in the Solomon Islands and at Headquarters 1 Australian Corps AIF. His final part in the war was at Balikpapan, Borneo, Indonesia, with the 7th division. At the end of the war he went to Cabarlah, near Toowoomba, for officer training school, where he met and fell in love with Joan Smith. They were married on 30 November. In March 1947 Ken and Joan left for England, where he undertook an advanced artillery course at Larkhill and subsequently went to Middle Wallop and flying school to be trained by the Royal Air Force. By the time he retired from active flying in 1975 he had logged more than 7,000 hours on 94 different types of aircraft-all mishap free. He now believed it was vital for an air observation post for the modern Australian Army. In 1949 Ken returned to the School of Artillery on North Head and he set out to convince his senior commanders of this MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Constituency Statements
235,Mr Robert (Fadden) (9.42 Am),"I rise to honour the late Kenneth John Oram, a pioneerneed. The Army was unsure, the RAAF tried to dissuade them and progress was very slow. Ken finally convinced Colonel AL McDonald, who was director of military operations and plans, to support his plan to put pilots and trainees into an aviation unit and charter civil aircraft. Thus1 Army Aviation Company was raised in 1957, with Ken responsible for training standards, policy statements, organisation and equipment tables, and flying procedure practices of the company. Post Army, Ken joined Qantas to help build their flight crew and maintenance training centre, and it was while he was at Qantas that he was approached by his school friend, Rollo Kingsford-Smith, to assist with the delivery of a new de Havilland Dove aircraft from the UK. He teamed up with Harry Purvis to bring the Dove from Hatfield, England, through France and Greece and then they went on a hopping tour across the Middle East, Pakistan and India and down through Malaya and Singapore and finally Indonesia before reaching Australia. It took them six weeks, in which time they encountered snow storms in Europe, hang-ups in bureaucracy and challenges getting rations in the plane-which were resolved by Indian coolies running relays across an airfield with water in giant skin bags to fill the plane’s manygallon tank. Once flying was behind him, Ken moved to PA Management Consultants and finally to Consolidated Goldfields, where he travelled the country identifying ‘new leaders’ for the Australian mining industry. He retired in 1982. Ken and Joan moved to Queensland and settled in Runaway Bay, in the mighty electorate of Fadden. TodayI honour in federal parliament a truly great Australian. Gorton Electorate: Father Norman Gray pay tribute to the exceptional work of Father Norman Gray, who recently celebrated 50 years of Anglican priesthood in my electorate of Gorton. Father Gray of Delahey worked tirelessly over the last five decades helping and providing support for the disadvantaged, the needy and the marginalised. After devoting two decades to remote Aboriginal communities and Scout and Rotary movements in Northern Queensland, Father Gray has spent the last three helping communities in western Melbourne. Father Gray’s altruism and concern for others have brought him into many different settings, including schools, parishes, psychiatric facilities and even prisons. Last month Father Gray celebrated his 50-year milestone at a gathering with friends, family and representatives from state and federal governments. This ceremony included the renewal of Father Gray’s ordination vows and song performances by the Hume Anglican Grammar School choir and the Essendon Baptist musicians and singers. Fifty years of services is no small feat. This achievement is a testament to Father Gray’s dedication and humanity. At the age of 74, Father Gray remains an energetic and dynamic member of and contributor to his community. He is still active in his church and sits on a range of local community committees, including the Delahey Residents Association and the school council for Copperfield College. It is as inspiring as it is uplifting to hear local stories of charity and generosity such as those of Father Gray. The compassionate causes for which he works are extremely admirable, and he should feel extremely proud of his body of work over so many years. I would like to acknowledge the achievements of Father Gray but also recognise the efforts and support provided by his family and many friends. In particular, I would like to acknowlMAIN COMMITTEE",180,Constituency Statements

Father Gray’s efforts deserve acknowledgement, but he is not one to seek praise or recognition. He is driven, it would seem, by the passionate desire to help those around him and the cause of realising social justice. Father Gray is an inspiration and a fine community leader, and the community of western Melbourne is indeed indebted to him. It is a privilege to be associated with Father Gray-a wonderful constituent of my electorate. Civil Liberties Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.48 am)-What has become of the government’s despicable internet filtering plan? The minister for broadband, communications, the digital economy and state censorship has been strangely silent in recent weeks on his plot to demolish the freedom of Australians to access internet material without government controls. I hope that he has realised the error of his ways and will abandon the idea, as the government have done with other plans when it has become clear that they were hopelessly out of touch with those they purport to lead. Was the minister disturbed to learn, as I was, that the brutal, dictatorial Iranian regime is employing similar technology to that he plans to use in Australia? As authorities in Iran this week moved to crush dissent over election results, there were reports it had installed perhaps the world’s most advanced system for controlling internet use by its citizens, greatly exceeding even the notorious level of state intervention in the ‘great firewall’ of China. Perhaps the minister was also disturbed to see the same reports, then raised his plans for Australia as another example of governments seeking to exert control over their citizens through internet filtering and monitoring-Iran, China, Australia. Perhaps he is proud to see our country, which was founded on a bastion of freedom and rights, grouped with two of the world’s worse offenders on curtailing civil liberties. I am not proud of this. I am afraid and disgusted. Trials of the internet filtering system continue, though limited, particularly since major provider and filtering opponent iiNet walked out. The minister has instead been talking of Stay Smart Online, a campaign to maintain security for internet users. He has not explained how blocking access to information will help anyone stay smart. The reality is that the free flow of information stimulates learning and new ideas. It feeds the growth of knowledge. Restricted growth of information has the opposite effect. The government has been told that its plan will not work. It will fail to prevent access to child pornography and other offences linked to internet use. The government is planning a $43 billion high-speed broadband network. One plan increases speeds while another reduces them. Why not save all that money and leave the matter alone? Then we will not be out of pocket and our right to view information of our choosing will not be curtailed. Then we will not be placed in the same basket as China and Iran, which is destined to be the sad outcome if this plan goes ahead.

237,Mr Turnour (Leichhardt) (9.51 Am),"I rise this morning to formally voice concernsout in my mobile office, doorknocking or talking to people in the community, I regularly get correspondence on this issue and people in the community are particularly passionate about it. And there are real concerns about inflated prices when compared with metropolitan centres, major fluctuations in price and so on. How often do I hear that they are quick to put the price up when oil prices increase but when the price drops it takes a lot longer before we see a change at the bowser? The seat of Leichhardt, encompassing Cairns, Port Douglas, Mossman, Cape York and the Torres Straits experiences petrol prices well above those in metropolitan areas. Only yesterday the price of unleaded petrol in the Brisbane suburb of Marsden was 110.9c a litre and in the city suburb of Spring Hill it was 109.9c a litre. Yesterday the price of unleaded in my hometown of Cairns was around 118.9c a litre and the price of unleaded at Weipa was 151.9 c a litre. In parts of the Torres Strait you can pay up to three dollars for a litre of fuel. We know that these costs can be different because of the remoteness and the volume of fuel pumped, but our prices are also linked to the Asia-Pacific region through the Singapore Mogas 95 unleaded and not the US crude price, as many people commonly think, and also to the value of the Australian dollar. These factors all impact on the price of fuel. But there are also valid concerns in the community about the differences in the price of fuel in regional communities as compared to our major capital cities. There are also real concerns about the takeover or the opportunity for Caltex to possibly take over 302 Mobil service stations and the impact that this could possibly have on competition. I am pleased the minister for small business and competition policy has said that if the takeover lessens competition the government will be looking to the ACCC to block that. The ACCC is currently examining that and a decision will be brought down on 5 August. The government is doing what it can to keep control of fuel prices through giving additional power to the ACCC and establishing a petrol commissioner. We wanted to introduce a national Fuelwatch scheme but were prevented from doing this by the opposition. Fuel prices are a real concern to me and a real concern to many members of my local community. I will continue to take these issues up with the appropriate ministers and I would encourage members of my community who do have concerns to continue to contact me about these issues. If they have real issues or concerns about lack of competition or improper activities by station operators they should get in touch with me and I will continue to take those up with the petrol commissioner and follow this issue closely. Swan Electorate: Bullying sent an award to Natascha Sieg for winning the antibullying slogan award by her school. There were some fantastic slogans put forward and the job of picking the winner would not have been easy. The program has been driven by Sonja Linkston who is the school’s academic program coordinator. Sonja has done a fantastic job and I know this program has the full support of the school’s principal, Margaret Jansen. As much as this program can be described in glowing terms, such as forward thinking or innovative, the plain fact is that bullying remains a serious problem in our schools. A study by Edith Cowan University, a university attended by many people in my electorate of Swan, found that over a quarter of Australian students in years 4 to 9 are bullied on a regular basis. MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Constituency Statements
238,Mr Irons (Swan) (9.54 Am),"On 10 JuneI attended the Carlisle Primary School to preThis is a statistic which, I am sure all members would agree, is unacceptable. Parents and children alike have a right to ask: why is this rate so high? It is certainly not because of a lack of public awareness. A recent survey by a local newspaper in my electorate, the Southern Gazette, found that around 47 per cent of respondents from a possible 64 per cent with children were aware of bullying as a big problem in local schools. From my experience, it is also not because a lack of effort from the schools. I know that most schools in my electorate of Swan have anti-bullying policies. The scale of the problem and its unrelenting nature suggests to me that the problem lies not in our awareness and desire to do something about bullying but in our approach. Our traditional methods of tackling bullying are not working. We need to be more innovative; we need to redefine our approach. That is why I was particularly pleased to attend the launch of the Carlisle Primary School’s new antibullying policy. The policy was designed with careful thought after extensive consultation with students, teachers and parents associated with the school and not only educates children about the dangers of bullying but gives children strategies to deal with it. In the new scheme, bullying behaviour will be combated by the shared concern approach, a certain departure from traditional punishment approaches. The shared concern approach includes individual meetings held with each of the students involved in the bullying incident. Each student is asked about the problem and asked to suggest ways in which he or she could personally help to improve the situation. The person being bullied is also given the opportunity to talk. Follow-up meetings give opportunities for the students to change their attitudes. It is certainly a different method, and I will be interested to see how successful the scheme is. If we are to reduce this problem in our schools and our society, we need to make sure that parents also take the role of reinforcing the standards that are acceptable in our society and schools. Parents should not leave the standard-setting to schools. It would be tragic to see programs such as the new Carlisle Primary School program become ineffective due to a lack of positive parental attitude in the home. In conclusion, everyone in our community has the right to a safe and supportive learning environment in our schools. Carlisle Primary School has started this process and should be commended for it. Makin Electorate: Para Hills Community Club dinner celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Para Hills Community Club. In the early 1960s a committed group of residents who had settled in the newly established and growing suburb of Para Hills set about establishing a local community club in response to the social needs that were arising at the time. In 1969 their hard work culminated with the official opening of the Para Hills Community Club by the then Premier of South Australia, Steele Hall, who later went on to represent South Australia in the Australian Senate. Steele Hall and his wife, Joan, a former minister in the South Australian parliament, were present at the celebration dinner, and it was fitting that they could both be there on the night. Over the years, the club has been enlarged and modernised, and today it is a stand-out community club in South Australia. It has also won numerous awards and accolades, including Best Community Club in South Australia for the last two consecutive years. Importantly, the club has not only provided a social, recreational and dining venue for the locals but, since 1969, has been a major financial supporter of the many sporting and community groups in the MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Constituency Statements
239,Mr Zappia (Makin) (9.57 Am),"On Saturday, 20 June, with my wife, Vicki, I attended aarea. Over the years it has also raised tens of thousands of dollars for many worthwhile charities and causes, including the recent Victorian bushfires. At the dinner it was also wonderful to see some of the original Para Hills stalwarts and founders of the club, including Bob and Merian Giles, and Bill and Irene Redhead, who, after more than 40 years, are still keeping a watchful eye over their community’s needs. Adding to the celebration was popular long-time 5AA talkback host Tony Pilkington, who emceed the evening and, with his wit and good humour, ensured that people were kept entertained throughout the evening. I pay particular tribute to the club’s general manager, Cameron Taylor, who also happens to be the chairman of Clubs SA in South Australia; the club chairman, Chris Goldner; the deputy chairman, David Macdonald; and the entire Para Hills Community Club team for the leadership they have shown in recent years. They have not only ensured that the club adapted to the changing needs of the community but also ensured that the values of the original founders of the club of 40 years ago have been preserved. I wish the club well into the future. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Health and Ageing Committee Report Debate resumed from 1 June, on motion by Mr Georganas: That the House take note of the report. Australia, a report I commend to the House, in particular the recommendations the committee has made to the parliament. I commend our committee chair, the member for Hindmarsh, who is in the chamber today, for his leadership in this inquiry. It was an important inquiry for everybody in Australia. I also commend our deputy chair, who is also in the chamber today. We have some alarming statistics in this country on obesity, and I would like to put a few of those on the record today. An ABS survey in 2007-08 found that 68 per cent of adult men and 55 per cent of adult women were overweight or obese. That means that one in two Australian adults are overweight or obese, and up to one in four children are also overweight or obese. We know, and we certainly heard during the committee inquiry, that the prevalence of obesity has doubled over the last 20 years. It is at the stage now where it is a serious health problem in this country, and this report has gone a long way to addressing some of the issues, concerns and things we can do in this country to really tackle the problem of obesity. Access Economics recently reported the economic costs of obesity in Australia for 2008 to be in the region of $58.2 billion. That is a lot of health dollars going to helping people suffering from obesity. We know obesity is associated with, and increases the risk of, many chronic diseases. For example, being overweight is a risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke, Australia’s first and second biggest killers. Three other risk factors that we know of-tobacco use, poor diet and lack of physical activity-contribute to the four major chronic diseases: heart disease, type 2 diabetes, lung disease and many cancers, which are responsible for more than 50 per cent of deaths around the world. MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Constituency Statements
240,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),Order! In accordance with standing order,185,Committees
241,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (9.59 Am),"I am delighted to speak on Weighing it up: obesity inWith our ageing population, which I have a particular interest in, our healthcare system is going to be increasingly unable to cope with the demands placed on it by people suffering from preventable diseases. The World Health Organisation has identified some shared characteristics of chronic diseases. Chronic disease epidemics take decades to become fully established. They have origins at young ages. Given their long duration, there are many opportunities for prevention. They require a long-term and systemic approach to treatment. Health services must integrate the response to these diseases with the response to acute infectious diseases. While many factors may influence an individual’s weight, fat is deposited when the energy we consume from food and drink is greater than the energy we expend through physical activity and rest. I think each and every one of us in this parliament knows that is exactly what we are doing to ourselves. We know that what we intake we have to get rid of some way. I think each of us here in the parliament has a responsibility to set a very good example for Australians in how we maintain our healthy lifestyle and our eating habits. It certainly came out through the inquiry that portion size on the plate really does matter. What goes through the lips ends up on our hips. We have all heard that, we all know it and we all grapple with it day after day. It is a huge temptation, and it takes a lot of willpower to ensure that what we put on that plate is of benefit to us. In this country we also have the opportunity to get out and do some exercise. We know exercise and food intake is part of a healthy lifestyle. Although looking at the weather in Canberra today we probably do not want to be outside, we all know that even 30 minutes of walking makes a big difference to our health lifestyle and how we look after ourselves and our health, particularly as we are getting older. It is a simple matter of exerting more energy than we consume, and that certainly comes through in the report. One of the report’s recommendations which I was particularly interested in is for better urban design in our cities and suburbs to encourage people to be active. I particularly want to commend the Gold Coast City Council for their Active and Healthy Citywide Program. They provide free and low-cost physical activities right across the city. They are also building bike tracks to encourage people to use their bikes. We have an ageing population on the Gold Coast, a lot of seniors, so there are a lot of walkways being built for them, with safety in mind. I think our senior Australians need to know that they can get out and be part of their communities in safety, and we are certainly encouraging that in our city. There is also a study currently being undertaken at Bond University by Professor Greg Gass. He came to the committee hearings that were held on the Gold Coast and shared with us the study he was undertaking. It was to do with walking and the effect walking has on type 2 diabetes. In the last couple of weeks I visited the women who are undertaking that program at Bond University. They are halfway through the program, and I hope that seeing the outcomes of that study, when completed, will be of benefit to the parliament and to the health and ageing committee. We also need to encourage our children to get out and be healthy and active. We know young people go to school and have to spend a lot of time in school, but we also know they spend a lot of time playing computer games. I think we need to have programs to encourage kids to get outside. One of the recommendations we made is about getting community groups and partnerships involved in healthy lifestyle programs. We were all very impressed with a program we saw in MAIN COMMITTEE Melbourne, the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program. For all the members who visited that school in Melbourne, it was wonderful to see the kids growing those vegetables, taking care of them, picking them and then ending up with them in the kitchen, where they actually cooked us lunch. It was a fabulous experience and I think every one of the committee members would say that it was a fabulous lunch. We had no meat with that lunch. It was the fruit and vegetables that these kids had grown, and that program is to be commended. Some schools raised concerns about the difficulty of the criteria and the eligibility for applying for funding for that program throughout Australia. I hope the government will take those concerns on board so that we, as a committee, can see that more and more schools throughout Australia take on that program at school level. We need to teach children the value of eating properly and growing their own vegetables. Even in today’s climate, where families are struggling with the family budget, we saw that you can grow those vegetables on very small plots of land. I think we should continue to encourage kids to do that and set those good examples for their future lifestyles. I was particularly interested in the inquiry we undertook. Twenty recommendations have come out of the inquiry and I commend everybody who was involved in it, including all the people who gave us evidence through the inquiry. There are a lot of things we, as a country, and the government can look at, such as the food-labelling issue. Most of us cannot read the labels on tinned foods in supermarkets, and I think we need to have a look at how we can do something about labelling in particular. As I said, I commend our chairman, the committee for a wonderful report and the committee secretariat for the support they gave us during the inquiry. obesity report that I tabled in the parliament a couple of weeks ago. I will only be speaking for a short period because I have already spoken about it. I thank the House for granting me leave to speak a second time. This very important report looked into obesity in this country. As the member for McPherson said, it showed that 68 per cent of men and 55 per cent of women in Australia are either overweight or obese. That makes us one of the most obese countries in the world, with one in two adults and one in four children being either overweight or obese. We saw many things in the course of the inquiry. For example, we saw the Tai Chi classes that the Gold Coast City Council was conducting for residents at a very minimal cost, giving people the opportunity to go out and exercise in the morning. We saw the kitchen garden program operating in Westgarth Primary School in Northcote, where children were learning the art of cooking-something that we heard has been lost over one generation. Previously we would all come home to a meal that was nutritional and that contained all the vitamins and everything we needed. We are now finding that we are living extremely busy lives. Both parents are working long hours and the children are at school and when we come home we sometimes find it much easier to either get some takeaway or just have a quick fry-up, which makes it very simple. From the evidence that was given to the inquiry it was quite plain that this type of lifestyle was one of the reasons that we are becoming overweight and obese. As the member for McPherson said, it was extremely heartening to see a program in Westgarth Primary School where these children, at a very young age, are taking part in nutritional education and learning skills that they need to live a healthy life. Whilst we were there they MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Committees
242,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (10.09 Am),"by leave-I also want to speak about thecooked us a magnificent lunch. The children grow their own vegetables within the school grounds. They learn the science of growing vegetables, which is like a science lesson for them. They learn how to prepare the vegetables and the art of nutritional cooking. While we were there the children cooked up a mixture of food. I recall having an Indian dhal curry. It was fantastic to see these kids understand what food is meant to be like, and that we can enjoy not only eating it but also the social contact it provides. One of the questions we asked these children is, ‘Do you eat this food at home?’ They said that they encouraged their parents as much as possible to use the ideas that they bring home from school in their cooking. I asked one of the young children, ‘What do you do when your parents suggest that you get some takeaway?’ Her immediate answer was: ‘We tell them off. We tell them it is not good for you.’ Here is an example that is actually working. This was one of our recommendations in the inquiry-that we ensure that we educate the next generation of children to go through life with the right healthy, nutritional habits that we have lost, because of our busy lifestyles, in one generation. One of the other areas that we looked at and that got a lot of coverage after the report was tabled was lap band surgery. We took some evidence from a great witness in Sydney who had had lap band surgery. She was a barrister and she had done all her homework. She came to the inquiry with documents listing all the medical expenses-from medicines to doctor’s visitsshe incurred to treat the ailments which had resulted from her obesity prior to having lap band surgery. She then had documents outlining the costs of the lap band surgery and the costs of the allied services that went along with that surgery; in other words, psychologists and the whole range of things needed to get the mind in order as well as the body. She incurred huge expenses before the lap band surgery. After the surgery, over a period of time, all those expenses began to diminish because her health was in a much better state. We found that, firstly, the surgery was good for the person with obesity because they immediately lost weight; and, secondly, the costs of medication were dramatically reduced, therefore saving money for both the person and the government in the long run. We found from an Access Economics study that was done recently that obesity is costing us close to $60 billion. One of our recommendations was to ensure that we could get more people onto bariatric surgery. We are not talking about people who just want to wear a pair of bathers at the beach and look good; we are talking about people who are morbidly obese and who have tried absolutely everything to lose weight. Their health is being affected. The cost of looking after these people because of their obesity is escalating. In most cases, these people have no other choice and will go on to develop further ailments and illnesses and, in the worse-case scenarios, die. It was most evident in the inquiry that, with this surgery, there would be a reduction in costs to the government and there would certainly be health benefits to the patient. Some of the other things that we saw included urban planning, which was mentioned earlier. Urban planning is very important. We found that, for every new development that is opening up, councils and planning departments immediately ask for a hundred car parks or whatever for these businesses, which only encourages people to drive their cars and park them in front of the premises, the shopping centre or wherever they are going without thinking about public transport or perhaps walking or riding a bike. I think our planning laws over the last 50 years have just been catering for the motor vehicle and, therefore, we human beings, who used to do all our business by walking in our communities and our neighbourhoods, now MAIN COMMITTEE have to get into a car and drive to a shopping centre, get out, do our shopping, get back in the car and then drive back home. We found that urban development and urban planning will play a huge role. Another recommendation was about labelling. We saw quite clearly, through witnesses who came to speak to us, that people want to eat the right foods, but sometimes there is a myriad, a maze, of labelling and people cannot read through the labelling. We said that we need to simplify that labelling to conform across Australia and ensure that it is as simple as possible to read for the consumer at the point of purchasing a particular food product to know exactly what is in that product. They can then make the choice of whether they want to eat something that has high sugars or low fats et cetera. We found that at the moment it is a very difficult maze for people to get their heads around, so we have asked that industry and government get together and try and come up with some good, simple labelling that gives the information to the consumer while they are making the choice of purchasing the food product. I will not go on any further. I will just thank my deputy chair, Steve Irons, the member for Swan, the other members of the committee who are here today and all the other members of the committee for their tremendous support and the work that they did in preparing this report. The report has been tabled. It is now in the parliament. It is there for all to see and to use as they see fit. We are hoping that some of these recommendations will come to fruition so that we can go on to live healthier lives and ensure that we are not going to be the first generation to live for a shorter time than the previous generation because of the difficulties and health issues that we will develop because of obesity. Committee on Health and Ageing report Weighing it up: obesity in Australia. I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Hindmarsh and the member for McPherson. I also see other committee members here. The member for Dawson and the member for Kingston are in the chamber, and I look forward to hearing and reading their contributions as well, particularly that of the member for Kingston, who gave us a great display of Tai Chi prowess on the Gold Coast trip that we had. I am sure her hamstrings are still suffering from that trip, but it was a great display of Tai Chi. I spoke about this report previously and endorsed the chair’s comments at that time, and I also acknowledged his efforts during the inquiry. AgainI say to you, Steve Georganas, the member for Hindmarsh, thank you. I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise the efforts of your staffer Heather Atcheson, who travelled with us on some of the hearings and helped us tremendously during that period of time. If you could pass that on to Heather, that would be great. I also acknowledge the previous deputy chair of the committee, the member for Menzies, Mr Kevin Andrews, whose place I took on this committee. As I said previously, some of the other committee members are here, and I look forward to their contributions, as they were contributing during the inquiry as well. This inquiry was into what is seen as an increasing problem in Australia-the level of obesity amongst adults and children of our nation. This report made 20 recommendations, ranging from urging the government to continue supporting existing programs, such as the Active After-school Communities program and the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Programwhich unfortunately I was not able to attend, because I was not on the committee at that time, but listening to the member for McPherson and the member for Hindmarsh it seems as though MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Committees
243,Mr Irons (Swan) (10.18 Am),"I rise to talk about the House of Representatives StandingI missed out on an excellent meal and contributions by some young people in our community-through to recommending the development and implementation of the healthy food code of good practice in conjunction with industry. The recommendations considered tax incentives and what more governments could do. Food labelling was considered-and I know the member for Kingston was particularly enamoured with that approach. She unfortunately did not get up the recommendation that she wanted, but it was a great effort and she did a lot of lobbying in the background. Urban planning was seen as an important step to encourage Australians to be healthy and active. While the report recognises that individuals are ultimately responsible for their own health and well-being, the inquiry has highlighted that the modern environment in which we all live can make weight loss very difficult. It is stated in chapter 6 of the report that any strategy to successfully combat the growing problem of obesity will need to include community involvement and programs that are community centred. All three levels of government will need to be involved and be supportive of any group within the community that runs programs that are designed to encourage community participation and involve people from the local community to take ownership of these programs. Many areas were covered in this report. As the chair mentioned, the personal, economic and social costs to Australia from obesity place stress on our community and health services in all areas and underpin the need for action. Many people have different and varying views on this subject, extending from the simplistic solution-which someone contributed to me on a flight coming over from Perth one day-of increasing breastfeeding rates in Australia from 19 per cent to over 50 per cent to help fight obesity and other chronic illnesses in our society to another simple act of reducing our intake of fructose. Community awareness of this societal problem is increasing, and we must continue to alert all Australians to the benefit of a healthy lifestyle. In my previous speech I mentioned that I personally tried fructose reduction in my diet and six months later I am 10 kilograms lighter. Mr Bidgood interjectingcame and presented to us on the Gold Coast, for his evidence and his book Sweet Poison, which I know some of the committee read. I know the member for Kingston had doubts about it, but I am living proof that it does work. It focused my thoughts on what I was eating, on my intake, and also on my output of physical effort. AgainI thank David Gillespie. Not every solution is going to work for every person but it has worked for me, and I think if that can help other people to focus on a healthy lifestyle and activity that would be great. On the matter of submissions to the inquiry, I must congratulate all the groups, associations, businesses and individuals who presented to the committee. The individuals who had the courage to tell their stories were fantastic and I applaud them. The member for Lyons came and spoke to us as well. I was not at that particular hearing, but I applaud him for his opening up about his personal situation. The report also dealt with bariatric surgery, which is the surgical reduction of the stomach and includes lap band surgery and gastric bypass. Unfortunately the media focus after the release of this report was on the recommendation that said, ‘Obesity should be placed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule as a chronic disease requiring an individual management plan.’ The media were more interested in the fact that MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Committees
244,Mr Irons,"I will take that as a compliment, thank you. I thank David Gillespie, whothis would lead to people obtaining free surgery for stomach lap banding at the expense of the taxpayer. If the media had bothered to understand the full implication of the report, they would have understood that the inclusion of this type of surgery on the Medicare schedule would give access to people who could not afford it and, from evidence given during this inquiry, to people from lower socioeconomic areas, who are most likely to need the surgery. The benefits to society would far outweigh the costs and might also lead to social and economic benefits as well as just health and physical benefits. The media failed to recognise that the report indicated that people in certain environments need assistance and this surgery would have been a final solution, not a first choice, for anyone who qualified for lap-banding surgery. The reports we received on this surgery are positive but, again, as the chair stated, the committee is wary of giving open slather access to bariatric surgery. It has to be maintained in a clinical program, and many aspects of that program would need to go to the well-being of the people who are involved in bariatric surgery. On radio 6PR in Perth, this report was discussed on talkback radio twice during the day after it was released, with some radio callers calling in saying how their lives had changed since the surgery. We must all treat obesity as not actually a disease but a result of the person’s environment, lifestyle and eating habits. A holistic approach should be taken. The chair stated in his speech that a number of witnesses called for changes to be made to the health system to better treat and manage Australians who are overweight or obese. I believe that the committee has made recommendations in this report that will put Australia on the pathway to achieving a reduction in obesity levels in Australia. BeforeI conclude, I would like to say that in my electorate I have started to implement a program which will be called the Swan 10/10 program. That will involve the community as a whole in active lifestyles and healthy eating options. We are just getting our ducks in a row and making sure that all the i’s are dotted and the t’s are crossed before we launch the program. I look forward to that, and it is purely based on the efforts of this obesity inquiry that I have decided to activate a combination of the Gold Coast program and the WellingTONNE Challenge in my electorate. I hope this report contributes to the bettering of our lifestyles and health in Australia. I commend the report to the House. before us, which is Weighing it up: obesity in Australia. The committee has weighed it up, and the facts are that we are one of the most obese nations in the world. It is like the antismoking advert. We all know what we have to do. We all know that we need to exercise, to eat properly and to drink responsibly. We cannot afford to avoid the situation of obesity in our society. We have to address the situation as we have it now. We have overweight people in our nation far and above any other developed nation in the world, so we need to address that. The most important recommendation in this report, from my perspective, is recommendation No. 7, which says: The Committee recommends that the Minister for Health and Ageing place obesity on the Medicare Benefits Schedule as a chronic disease requiring an individual management plan. I personally argued very strong and hard that this be placed as a recommendation. Having run medical centres for nine years, looking after 10 GPs, 20 staff and the healthcare needs of MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Committees
245,Mr Bidgood (Dawson) (10.26 Am),"I rise to speak concerning the report that we have40,000 patients in the Mackay region, I have seen the success of management plans concerning asthma, diabetes, mental health and the aged, and this is what we need. If we are serious as a government and a nation, from a bipartisan point of view, if we really care about our people and we really want to do something constructive, this recommendation is an absolute necessity. It will give GPs, who are mainly the first port of call for people in our community, the access not just to a weigh-up to see how overweight you are but to a holistic plan, including the psychology of how you are motivated to do what you need to do. A lot of people lack motivation and self-esteem, and it becomes a vicious circle. Psychology is very important in breaking that vicious circle. We need to get people from the point of hopelessness, where they just feel they cannot do anything anymore about their situation, to a point where they believe: ‘Yes, I can change. Yes, I can do it.’ That motivation is very important. In a multidisciplinary plan, such as a Medicare obesity plan, we can have psychology and we can have dietitians advising the best types of food and not to go on radical crash diets. As you know, we go into those diets with New Year’s resolutions and by February it is all over. We need realistic, sustainable dietary plans. This needs to be backed up by realistic physical exercise regimes. The fact of the matter is we are a very sedentary nation. We drive everywhere, we do not walk as much as we used to and we spend a lot of time in front of televisions and computers. The basic bottom line here is: we need to get moving. The most realistic and easy way to get someone moving is to say, ‘Go for a walk.’ People who are obese are often very selfconscious about their size and have poor self-image. We need to encourage people to do basic things every day which are achievable, such as get up early in the morning, walk 15 minutes in one direction, stop, turn around and walk back home. That is very achievable. But for a lot of people who are acutely obese that is a very difficult thing to do and it is a big strain on their heart. Simple things like that need to be done. We need to take a holistic approach. We need to take an approach towards psychology, nutrition and exercise and we need to look at the environment in which people live, work and operate. These are very important keys to the holistic management of the problem of obesity in our society. A lot of where we are right now as a nation is due to our wealth and our success as an advanced economy. We have luxuries such as cars, televisions and computers which take up our time and reduce our physical activity. The human being is designed to be functional, moving and engaged in society. Obesity can cause a feeling of dislocation from society. It can cause loneliness and family break-up. These have far wider implications in our society. Recommendation 7 is, in my opinion, the most important recommendation, which I would like to see adopted by the Minister for Health and Ageing. We need change to address the problem now, and this addresses it. We need the political will. We need the determination to take on this goal to reduce the amount of obesity in our nation. We need to have a clear vision. Part of that is addressed by the economic facts and figures that we have before us in this report. I would like to draw your attention to the National Health Survey, which reported just recently. In 2007-08, 68 per cent of men were overweight or obese compared to 10 years ago, when it was just 64 per cent. In 2007-08, 55 per cent of women were overweight or obese compared to 10 years ago, when it was 49 per cent. We need to move towards addressing these problems. MAIN COMMITTEE Access Economics have worked some figures out on lost productivity and cost to society as a whole in dollar values. In 2008 they estimated the cost to the Australian economy was $49.9 billion. That is a very big figure caused by the very big problem of obesity in our nation. From a purely economic point of view, this needs to be addressed. There has been an increase over the years in discrimination and stigma and, as I said, the social isolation of people who are obese. They have lower levels of occupational prestige and lower levels of income. There is more sickness and there are more unemployment benefits being paid. There is a lower workforce participation rate and much higher absenteeism. This is having a very direct effect on the productivity of our nation. Just the productivity in the workplace is estimated to be worth $3.6 billion. Productivity is, in the long term, the key to building a more internationally competitive economy. So obesity has far more wide-ranging ramifications in our society than just the personal and local. It affects the whole community, the whole nation and our exports as well. The reason I am so passionate about this subject is that it is at the very core of our existence and our being to have people who are functional in our society-people who are holistic and happy in mind, body and soul. That is why, as part of the Rudd Labor government, I am so passionate about sports in our society. That is why I have been so passionately fighting for my community to have excellent sporting facilities, such as the Mackay rugby league stadium, for which I managed to get $8.8 million of funding, and, for Mackay cricket, the Harrup Park Country Club, which will have facilities of international standard worth $1.3 million. I am also proud to say that I managed to get funding of $114,000 for the Dolphins Soccer Club in Northern Beaches, Mackay. It is important to have our people engaged at a young level. Our children are our future. It is a cliche, but it is true. We need to set a child in the direction of the way and the manner that the rest of their lives will be. I personally have a very strong issue about having no salt in our diet. At the age of 50 I can honestly say I am glad I made a decision 20 years ago to cut salt completely out of my diet, along with sugar, and to reduce my intake of fat and other not-sohealthy foods. I can say honestly that my heart rate is way better than, perhaps, is normal for my age, even after doing a massive workload and carrying on in the stress of the job that I do and also in the physical activities that I do. We need to set examples as politicians. We need to get down to the gym. We need to walk in our communities. If we do not do that then who are we to say to others, ‘This is what you should do. This is the way to live a healthier life’? We need to get children into the routine of exercise through sport. We need to get them out walking as a family. Whether you are a single parent or in a couple, you need to go walking with your kids. It is a time to communicate and it is a time to exercise. As I said at the beginning of this talk, it is achievable, it is realistic, it is not hard. We need to get our nation moving. I commend this report because it really does address important issues in our society. This is an excellent report and I wholeheartedly endorse it. Of all the things I have done in this parliament, being involved in this report is the most satisfying thing I have done to date. I wholeheartedly commend it to the Minister for Health and Ageing and also to the Main Committee. the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, Weighing it up: obesity in Australia. I will not take a lot of the House’s time. A lot of this has already been said. I just will comment on a few things that I picked up from undertaking my role in the MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Committees
246,Mr Coulton (Parkes) (10.37 Am),"I also am pleased to speak today on the report fromcommittee to put this report together. I guess what really was highlighted was that obesity is a very complex problem. While this report is certainly not a solution to the problem, I see this as a tool for, hopefully, legislators in this place and also in other places around Australia, including local government, urban planners and whatever. I hope they will take the information that we have put together in here and use it however it is applicable to their area. We looked at a lot of different aspects in this report, from preventative measures with children right through. One of the more interesting and more sobering presentations was from Hunter New England Health. They spoke about the added cost to the healthcare system from morbidly obese people. I got hope out of this, as well. We had a couple of visits. We went to Marks Point Public School in the member for Shortland’s electorate, and we played sport there. I have to say that these kids were not selected athletes; they were the entire section of the school in that age group. They were healthy, active kids. There was no-one there that obviously, I do not think, had an unhealthy weight. On another visit we went to a primary school in Melbourne, where they were growing their own vegetables. City kids not only got the idea of where food came from and the joys of actually growing something-some of us who grew up in the country probably take that for granted-but also got to learn how to prepare that food. They said that, because of the lifestyles of their families, they very rarely ate together as family units. They did not see food that did not come out of a plastic bag. I was quite taken with that. If there is one thing that comes out of this report it is that obesity is not a condition of affluence. Obesity is a condition of disadvantage and poverty. In my own electorate the highest incidence of diabetes, obesity and heart disease is in the isolated areas-that is, in my Aboriginal community, in the lower demographic. A lot of the things that the previous member spoke about are not achievable in these areas. I was at Collarenebri Central School a couple of weeks ago. They do not have enough senior boys or girls to have a netball or a football team. But, even if they did, they would not have anyone to play against because of the declining population in the area. I think originally there were thoughts that there would be recommendations on junk food advertising and on the terror of the multinational food corporations, but in the areas in my electorate that have this problem there are not any of those. We do not have any fast food restaurants. Indeed, one highlight was the expense of fresh food. I commend the information that came from the Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service. They are not only one of the leading health providers in my electorate but recognised around Australia. They spoke about the problem of not being able to buy healthy food at a reasonable price. Another issue is education. If you have a young family-if you are a young, teenage mum with a couple of kids-and do not have a lot of education, it is hard to understand why you should pay more money and go to the trouble of preparing a healthy meal for your children when they can be easily satisfied by chips and gravy. That is the word of a witness quoted in this report. That is entirely correct. I have a relationship with the Lifehouse in Dubbo, which is run by the Riverside Church in Dubbo. It is a voluntary organisation. They are trying to reach out to these young mums. They have a food bank, where people can come along and for $25 buy approximately $80 worth of food. There is quite a complicated network to get that food there, but it is a fantastic thing. I have been trying to get funding for this since I came into this place. All they want is somewhere for the children to play so they can be supervised. Then the mums could be taught-you know, with a bag of rice and a few vegetables-how to MAIN COMMITTEE serve a nutritious meal to their family, as well as freeze half of it and feed them again in a couple of days time, for not a lot of money. I commend the people that are doing this sort of thing. Really, if we are going to address this problem, we need to start with the kids. It needs to be like seatbelts and smoking. I do not know how many people gave up smoking or started wearing seatbelts because their kids nagged them. I took great heart in what I saw with the kids coming through. But I will go back to the disadvantage. While it would be lovely to go walking as a family, in the housing commission areas in south Dubbo there are no footpaths. If you want to go walking with your family, you have to walk on the road. If you want to walk to the local shop, you have to cross over the Mitchell Highway. There are things like that, which we take for granted. It is a wonderful thing to do. Despite what might appear obvious, my wife and I walk on a regular basis in Canberra. We see people cycling to work and walking to walk-hundreds of them every morning-but there are cycleways, walkways and overpasses over highways. There are gyms if you want to use them. The building I live in has a gym in it. This place has a gym in it. My adult children, who work in professions, one in Newcastle and one in Tamworth, are members of gyms. They are members of boot camps that grind up and down hills at 5.30 in the morning. They have all those advantages. But the people in Collarenebri, Mungindi and Walgett or in certain parts of Dubbo, Wellington and places like that do not have that opportunity. So while I am loath to place any more burden on teachers, who are asked to do too much now, I think somehow-maybe not through the schools-we need children to form these habits for life. I am very pleased with this report. I have to admit I was concerned when we started that we were going to look for an easy answer. The more we delved into it, the more we realised how complicated it is. SoI would like to commend Sara, Penny, James and the other members of the secretariat who worked so hard on this. I would like to thank my fellow committee members. Indeed, one of the pleasures of this place, which sometimes may be few and far between, is the committee work we do and the inspirational people we get to meet. In some cases, the grinding poverty that we get to witness has been very rewarding for me. I thank my fellow committee members for their goodwill, fellowship and friendship in putting this report together. I commend this report and I hope that over the years to come many people who are involved in public policy and even private policy can use this as a very worthwhile reference tool. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (10.46 am)-I also rise to commend the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing’s report Weighing it up. I would also like to reflect on some of the comments that have already been made. This report was based on keen interest from all the committee members. We worked in a really constructive way to look at this issue of obesity in our society and how we might tackle it. On the face of it, it seems quite simple to address the obesity problem: people should take in fewer calories and burn off more calories by exercising. But, as we heard during this inquiry from witnesses and submissions, it is not that simple. What is very important about this report is that it picks up on many different levels of our society that need to tackle it. It looks at some of the grassroots programs. It looks at some of the structural issues in our society such as urban planning. It MAIN COMMITTEE also looks at some things that we as a government can do in collaboration with industry and other groups around the place. SoI think it is a report that looks into many different areas. As we know, the issue of obesity does get a lot of media, and certainly if you put the word ‘obesity’ in something then often it will get attention. I think part of the reason is that, as has been demonstrated as part of this report, there will be some very serious ramifications for our society if we do not tackle this problem. The report highlights that high body weight has been estimated to contribute to 7.5 per cent of the burden of disease in Australia, and this is nearing the 7.8 per cent contribution that tobacco use makes. The scope of this problem can be seen in the latest national health survey from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The 2007-08 figures found that more adult Australians were overweight or obese in 2007-08 than in 1995. That was when the previous survey was conducted. The survey found that 68 per cent of men and 55 per cent of women were either overweight or obese. It was similar for children. There was a significant increase in the proportion who were obese, from 5.2 per cent in 1995 to 7.8 per cent in 2007-08. So it would seem that we do have a trend where this issue is continuing to rise, and this rise is going to continue to lead to a very serious cost burden on our health system. In addition to the cost of overweight and obesity incurred by individuals, families and the community, there is a huge financial cost on the health system. As the report indicates, we got a submission from Access Economics who did a report, The growing cost of obesity in 2008: three years on, which updated their earlier report titled The economic cost of obesity. They found that the total cost of obesity in 2008 was around $58 billion. This sum includes costs of diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, various types of cancer and osteoarthritis. The figure has risen from the earlier estimate of $21 billion for the total cost of obesity. We can see that the cost of this problem will only increase if we fail to act. These costs will be compounded by the unique nature of Australia’s demographics. The 2008 Access Economics report predicted that population ageing alone will result in 4.6 million Australians being classified obese in 2025. So it continues to be an issue that we must address. We heard evidence that hospitals were also bearing a significant proportion of costs as a result of overweight and obesity. For example, the report showed that the increased cost of specialised equipment was a major concern for hospitals. We heard witnesses present this evidence. Similarly, there are also many hidden costs resulting from the obesity health issues. Professor Samaras from St Vincent’s Hospital, told the committee: Every time a coronary artery stent is put in, and obesity is the cause of that, that costs $10,000. You will not see it as an obesity statistic; you will see it as a cardiac statistic. In fact it is inherently related to the issue of obesity. The committee realised just how complex this policy area is, and that is why none of the recommendations are a silver bullet. We must acknowledge that the costs to our health system are not the only costs. As the committee observed, there is extensive personal cost incurred by individuals who are affected by obesity. It was very moving to hear evidence from witnesses to the inquiry identifying a number of areas, in addition to financial areas, where people bear what I would call the personal costs of obesity. These costs include particularly devastating emotional harm, from discrimination, stereotyping and bullying, that often lead to mental health issues. This was very important and certainly should not be seen as less important than the cost burden on our health care system. MAIN COMMITTEE Some of these negative effects are fuelled by the increased focus on obesity by the community which, although warranted, has had some perverse effects. The report highlights that too much of this media coverage has been overly alarmist and sometimes of a defeatist nature. Although it was recognised that popular weight-loss television shows draw attention to the issue, they can be somewhat extreme. TV reality shows that encourage people to compete to lose huge amounts of weight in a short time-although, once again, they draw attention to these issues-do not really provide people with some solid solutions that they can follow. In contrast, our report makes numerous recommendations that look at ways that we can improve a number of measures. Particular recommendations need to be highlighted. Recommendation 3 recommends that the minister for health works with states, territories and local governments through the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council to develop and implement long-term, effective, well-targeted social marketing and education campaigns about obesity, and more importantly about healthy lifestyles, and to ensure that these marketing campaigns are made more successful by linking them to broader policy responses to obesity. This is important, because as the report shows, social marketing, if well directed, can play a significant role in educating Australians about healthy eating and living. The report makes it clear that the message of the social marketing campaigns can increase people’s demand for healthy products as well as encourage physical activity and healthy eating to become part of everybody’s daily routine. An example of this is the How Do You Measure Up? campaign which includes a hard-hitting television ad and billboard posters. But this is not enough by itself. As the anti-smoking campaign over the last 20 years has shown, long-term ongoing integrated campaigns are the most successful in influencing behaviour across society. We also heard a lot of evidence from the witnesses and submissions about grassroots programs that are having an effect on the ground. As previous members have mentioned, the federal government’s Active After-school Communities program has certainly been supported. There are also programs such as the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program. I felt very lucky to attend the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program and see it up and running in Melbourne. This program is very inspirational. For people who do not know about the program, kids make a garden with some help from teachers and volunteers. They plant a whole lot of things and then they have a lesson in taking those things from the garden and cooking them, really making that connection between growing fresh healthy food in the garden and learning how you transform that into a cooked meal. We talked to one of the coordinators, who said that they do not talk about ‘healthy’ versus ‘non-healthy’ products. Really they are looking at making the connection between good food and the kitchen. I talked to some of the children in this program and one comment really stuck with me. I was talking to one of the young people in the program and I asked him whether he takes home some of these lessons in cooking. The young boy said, ‘Well, look, I do. In fact Dad used to cook everything from packets and now I take home the recipes and we cook fresh food.’ I think that was really important and it showed just how this program is making that connection between fresh food and the home environment. As the previous speaker said, our young people have the nag factor for their parents and, if we can get them nagging their parents about healthy eating and good eating as opposed to wanting to eat lollies, then that is certainly a positive thing. MAIN COMMITTEE One aspect of the integrated approach to fighting obesity that I am particularly passionate about is an improved food labelling system. I do believe that Australians need good information in order to make good choices and that an informative, simple food labelling system is really important in doing this. As the report shows, there has been overwhelming support for the introduction of an improved labelling system, one that gives you key information that is very visual and placed on the front of the package. The design of such a labelling system needs a lot of consideration. I know that as a committee we heard a lot of information supporting the traffic light labelling system. This is a system that does have a lot of merit. I will be particularly interested in the report commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency, which involves an independent group of experts studying over 18 months the most effective food labelling, to see how we might go forward on this. As we know with food labelling, there are always different issues, and I look forward to this report by the UK Food Standards Agency, which might show us how Australia might move forward with better food labelling. I note also recommendation 12, which talks about the industry and the government working together to provide better food labelling. I would also like to draw the chamber’s attention to recommendation 15, which looks at reformulation of foods. I think it is important that we reduce the amount of salt and fat in our products. We heard evidence from a lot of the canteens that we went to that they are opting to buy pies and pasties with reduced fat and reduced salt so that you can get products that can taste the same that may have reduced amounts of fat and salt and sugar. Recommendation 15 looks at that as well. I know there has been a lot of discussion in South Australia about how we might remove trans fatty acids, which are, from all accounts, a nasty fat, from food products. In conclusion, the costs of obesity in Australia are significant. The international evidence tells us that Australia is not alone in facing increasing rates of obesity. The World Health Organisation has classified obesity as a chronic disease and, as far back as 1997, declared that: … overweight and obesity represents a rapidly growing threat to the health of populations in an increasing number of countries worldwide. This threat does mean that individuals need to take responsibility. The report shows there are factors, though, that impact on people’s ability to control their weight, and that is where industry, government and other organisations have a role to play. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the other members of the committee. As I said from the outset, this was a particularly constructive committee report where everyone did work together very well. I would like to thank the secretariat-Sara, Penny, James and the other members-who did work very hard in providing us with a very interesting program. I would also like to thank all the witnesses that appeared before the committee, and those that made the many submissions. This did provide the committee with real food for thought, which we have certainly highlighted in the report. There is no silver bullet, but there are things that all levels of government can do, and that industry and individuals can do to address this problem. excellence of this report indicates the importance of the committee system to the House of Representatives and the need to continue to have a well-funded and working committee system. MAIN COMMITTEE",193,Committees
247,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.01 Am),"It is a pleasure to speak on this very good report. TheThe report came out of surveys from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that found that more adult Australian were overweight or obese in 2007-08 than in 1995 when the last surveys had been done. The survey found that 68 per cent of adult men and 55 per cent of adult women were overweight or obese. This shows a growing incidence over 12 years. There was a significant increase in the proportion of children who were obese. This has huge implications for us in the future and for the health system. There are, of course, high personal and economic costs associated with this increasing incidence. SoI was very pleased that it was decided that a report should be produced, looking at solutions right through to the design of urban development, where councils can play a role with exercise programs, community gardens and cooking classes-which I will mention a bit later. This is something very close to my heart, and I gave evidence to the committee about my experiences-wrestling with weight since childhood, but going through the adult stages of life when one is doing a lot more activity, one gets through those issues. As one gets older, one is inclined to put on weight because of lifestyle, and not doing the exercise one used to do. Of course, there is also the downhill spiral which we can all get onto, and I think it is important that we do have knowledge to assist us. I think recommendation 7 is very important. It asks the minister to put obesity on the Medicare Benefits Schedule as a chronic disease requiring individual management planning. This would make a huge difference to people struggling on their own to control their weight. I also think recommendation 9 is an important one. If adopted, the Commonwealth and states would develop a tiered model of health management, incorporating preventative community based primary care and acute care models. This is a bigger issue than just a medical model, and I think there needs to be a broader process in this area. There are recommendations for tax incentives for fresh food, which is an interesting one, as well as for access to physical activity programs, especially for those in the bush. The member for Parkes was very articulate about that, noting that there is little opportunity for people in those areas to access the modern gyms and programs which people in cities and certain occupations have access to. I think that is important for those bush areas. I have spoken before about the importance of urban planning and local government walking tracks. People will use walking tracks if there are signs on them saying how long they are. They feel safer about it and will utilise those tracks. We were talking earlier about how, in some of our low-socioeconomic areas, there are no footpaths for people to walk on. You have to walk on the road if you are going to go for a walk with your family and get that important exercise. Those are important issues that should be addressed and should be on the health agenda. The other issue that I am very passionate about is swimming pools. Local governments usually run the other way, trying to get away from swimming pools. Bureaucrats in councils are always talking about the cost of swimming pools. Of course, there is no economic gain for councils from health budgets, so the states and Commonwealth should be looking at how to help create those very important opportunities for people, particularly young people, to use swimming pools. Pools should be connected to the broader health debate as a part of the solution. It is important to understand food and the growth in easily available, cheap fast foods, which is an issue that is becoming more important and which has caused some of these probMAIN COMMITTEE lems as well. My colleague the member for Kingston spoke about the reduction of salt and fats in food. These are important issues-the eating of pure fat and salt and not much else. They are addictive and it is hard to give them up, just as it used to be with cigarettes. We are tackling a similar issue to smoking. We have achieved a lot in that area because we took it on as a nation, and a lot of people played a good part. Also important are cooking classes, starting at school, to help children get curious about food and what they eat. Knowing what they eat, knowing what is in the food, having the opportunity and the knowledge to grow food, knowing what growing is all about and knowing what nutrition is in that food are all important parts of the future. I am very pleased that Stephanie Alexander’s School Gardens programs are underway. These issues are very important. Those programs are marvellous things and I hope many more opportunities will grow out of them. I have a daughter who is a chef and who is now training as a teacher, and she is very keen in this area. I am sure that she will make a very good contribution to the future of this area. Getting young people to appreciate gardening and growing things will change things. We heard about the nag factor, getting kids going home talking about fresh food. There is a great opportunity to change how the nag factor usually works, when kids say, ‘Take me down to one of the fast food chains.’ Let us turn that around and have the nag factor working the other way. We can do that through good public education processes. Of course, making things fun and enjoyable is one of the important ways to do that. I come to the situation, which is mentioned in the report on page 56, which deals with bariatric surgery and the issues around that. I have had that surgery and it achieved great results for me. The figures that I have seen indicate that this is a very successful way of helping people to significantly reduce their weight and the effects of type 2 diabetes. The figures point to significant drops in blood sugar levels. This assists in turning around type 2 diabetes results and in people getting management of their sugar levels. With a cost of around four or five thousand dollars, this surgery is a very cost-effective way of managing such problems, as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of dollars of costs associated with the ongoing problems of having diabetes. As the report has recommended, I certainly believe in the need for a very tough criterion to limit how this surgery would be used but I believe it is one of the opportunities that we have to use another tool in the process. It does need to be done under a proper criterion, but the cost-effectiveness is very important here. Federal and state treasuries should look at this report as there are real important issues here about spending some money now on some of the recommendations because it will certainly help us reduce spending a lot more money in the future. There is a need for planning with this surgery and for people to understand that it is only a tool. There is also a need to continue to change one’s lifestyle, to think about one’s food and to take on the physical opportunities that will help to continue to reduce health problems. As other people who have been involved in this report have said, there is no silver bullet. As the report has recommended, you have to take a whole range of measures to achieve these goals. We should use the tools available and we should look at these. Of course, an issue with this surgery is that it has been very difficult for people at the low end to get it. Most of this surgery has been done in the private sector, in private hospitals, and not very often in the public sector. MAIN COMMITTEE We do need to turn that around and give people opportunities to use this tool to assist them in managing their health needs. I understand that the figures that have been used state that the cost of obesity is $58 billion in Australia. I think that is probably underdone. There are the ongoing costs of other complications that come out of some of the diseases that latch onto obesity. Through my conversations with the medical profession and the knowledge that I have gained, that could be a very conservative number. I think there is so much more that we need to do. The report gives us a great opportunity to pursue those. In starting with the kids and getting them to understand more about food, nutrition and eating fresh foods, I think there are great opportunities here for industry. In the way that we present food and fruit, there is lot more that can be done in the marketing of fresh foods. That needs to be given much more time and consideration. In relation to labelling, I have always found that there is a difficulty in using the knowledge you get from a GP or a dietician when you are in a supermarket looking at a label. There is not much of a relationship. There needs to be a lot more done in the area of what comes out of a GP’s surgery and what comes out of a dietitian’s recommendations as related to what somebody gains from a food label. I think we are underdone in that area. I am sure there is a lot of self-interest in that area that is protected. We should be putting the public health first, knocking over some of that self-interest and getting to where we can actually provide the right information for people who need it. kler. I am sure that somebody coming from a seat that has a fair bit of sugar growing would need to make sure that one is giving some consideration to the future of that industry and whether they make ethanol out of it or whether we are still putting it on our cornflakes. There are a whole lot of issues-including urban planning and educating young people for all of us to take on more fresh foods-and recommendations in this report which show us the importance of the committee system of the House. This report can play a significant role in helping make policy into the future. I congratulate all those members of the committee, particularly Steve Georganas as the chair and Mr Irons as the deputy. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.17 am)-This is quite a landmark report. I think it is a report that has only taken the format it has because of the enormous contribution by the secretariat. I would like to put on record my thanks to the secretariat for the work that they have done in relation to this report. They have been very dedicated in following up on the issues that we as a committee have raised and also been absolutely committed to the task of putting together the report that I believe is an excellent report. Obesity is a problem that is confronting our society and most developed societies throughout the world. In some ways the more affluent a society is the greater the number of people who suffer from obesity. If you live in a developing country you are much less likely to be obese than if you live in Australia, the United States or the UK. It is interesting to note that when we were receiving evidence in the committee there were a number of people who came along and gave evidence who had suffered from a weight problem for a very long time. They had tried numerous approaches to lose weight, to get their body mass index into the normal range, and had failed on numerous occasions. I think the reasons for this are extremely complex. I also believe that it is important that much more research is done in this area. MAIN COMMITTEE",198,Committees
248,Mr Neville,I do not think you and I have been looking at it that well.,201,Committees
249,Mr Adams,"We can in the future and we can talk about these things, member for HinI do not think there is any person not aware of the fact that they can address their weight issue by eating less and exercising more. I think everybody is aware of that. Yet, even with the knowledge and the ability to make that change, things have not changed. To me this is a very complex societal issue. It takes in enormous psychosocial issues. It is also interesting to put on the record at the commencement of my contribution to this debate the fact that there are socioeconomic factors involved with obesity and being overweight. I think the psychosocial factors have been underestimated in relation to obesity. I think that these factors need to be addressed in any lasting solution to this problem. Childhood obesity starts basically from the time of birth. Someone with fewer resources is less likely to breastfeed their baby. It is a known fact-and this is covered by every bit of research that has been taken-that breastfeeding provides the ground for a child’s nutritional lifestyle and those who are breastfed do much better in the fight against obesity. The propensity for a child to develop obesity can start basically from the time they are born. The media hype around the report related to bariatric surgery. That was just one recommendation in the report. A second recommendation that related to that was that a national register of bariatric surgery be established. I think the two need to be put together. It is important that bariatric surgery is available to people who do not have the same financial ability to access it as those who are accessing it at the moment. It is also very important that a register be developed because from the register the effectiveness of the surgery can be observed. Bariatric surgery on its own is not the answer. Once again I am touching on the psychosocial factors that I mentioned at the commencement of my contribution to this debate. A person needs to have support all the way through the process. They need to have access to a multidisciplinary team to ensure they get the backup and the support that will ensure that they succeed. Probably the most important thing in addressing obesity is that we have a whole-ofgovernment approach to the issue-an approach that goes across each and every level of government and that encompasses the community. The only way we can successfully deal with this epidemic that is increasing our health costs and so many other costs within our community is for everybody to work together. To some extent this has taken place already. The national Preventative Health Taskforce has been looking at obesity. The government has identified three key areas in preventative health that it wants to address-tobacco, alcohol and obesity. It is so important that we all work together on this. We need better research. We need research that gets to the core of why obesity is so prevalent in our society. We need to make sure that programs such as the Active After-school Communities program are retained, but extended. I touched on obesity from the point of view of breastfeeding and the importance of that baseline, but the committee was able to visit a number of excellent programs that targeted children. If a child develops the right exercise and eating patterns-like the Stephanie Alexander school garden program and other programs that target young people-and the right approach to healthy eating and healthy lifestyle then as they grow older the problem will dissipate. The committee believes very strongly that general practitioners play a very important role in the area of counselling and referral for their patients who are suffering from obesity. It was felt that the government needs to include them very much in any sort of consultation and MAIN COMMITTEE planning to address this important issue. There were some standout issues, issues that we were approached on by a number of people who came and gave evidence to the committee-and there were different perspectives on each of these. There was labelling, and we were lobbied very strongly to put in place a traffic light system. It was also proposed that food be labelled with the daily intake system. The committee believed that it was important that the Food Standards Australia New Zealand food labelling review all the issues relating to guidelines and that we have a uniform guideline placed on food so that people can make an informed choice. Labelling is a big issue. I do not know about other members, but whenever I go shopping I spend a lot of time looking at those labels and trying to find out what food is going to be the best. Advertising was another issue we received quite a bit of information on. I thought the information there was most interesting. We had people from the advertising industry come along and say that advertising does not in any way affect children’s behaviour or desire to eat fast foods or high-fat foods. They argued that there were studies that supported advertising not encouraging people to go down that track. We had other health professionals saying that advertising was an issue that did impact on the choices that children made. The committee came up with a recommendation that we have got this conflicting information and we feel that it needs to be investigated. It needs to be investigated whether the billions of dollars that advertisers spend on targeting children to purchase various foods is worthwhile or whether there should be some limitation placed on advertising directed at children. The whole industry that has developed around weight loss needs some regulation. I believe that there are so many claims being made by different people that it needs to be standardised and looked at so that you know that the information being presented is correct, and the committee made some recommendations about that. Recommendation 17 urged that we review the adequacy of the regulations governing weight loss products and programs. I think that is very important because so many people see an advertisement and then become involved in a particular program, or buy a particular product, but quite often there is no research to back up that advertisement. I think that really needs to be looked at. The other issue I would like to spend a little time on concerns planning. Planning is an area in which local government plays an important role. Planning the way we build our towns and our cities is extremely important. Urban design over the years has quite often led to an environment that works against a person being able to undertake physical activity. I think that all levels of government are much more aware now that we need to be mindful of creating a built environment that encourages people to exercise. I think that guidelines in relation to creating a built environment that is conducive to exercise are very important. Local government should be quite mindful of that need when they are putting together their plans for sporting facilities and bike tracks and the access to those facilities. This is an outstanding report. I think this is an exceptionally important issue for our society. If we do not act to end obesity now, the next generation of Australians will be dying earlier and will be sicker than the current generation. I recommend the report to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Craig Thomson) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Committee Report Debate resumed from 1 June, on motion by Ms King: That the House take not of the report. of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Funding regional local community infrastructure. In saying that, I want to add a qualification with regard to the preamble to the terms of reference from the minister, which says: ... make recommendations on ways to invest funding in genuine regional economic development and community infrastructure with the aim of enhancing the sustainability and liveability of Australia’s regions Liveability is certainly enhanced by community and social infrastructure. I would never resile from that nor do I suggest that it should be downplayed in any program. WhatI am suggesting is that, if you genuinely want sustainability in regions, they will not just be sustained by social and community infrastructure; they have to be sustained by economic infrastructure. In many regions that means more industry. Under the old ACC program, the Regional Partnerships program, which has been very roundly criticised by some people-and I understand that what is not said is that the vast majority of those projects were very good. Yes, there are always failures, and I know the member for New England, who is here today, has been quite critical of some of those projects. Nevertheless, in the wider picture, the vast majority of those projects, both social and commercial, were very good. I did not lodge a dissenting report through any bitterness or with any malice towards my Labor colleagues; in fact, I have a great deal of affection and respect for them. Let us say that on this report we agree to disagree on the emphases. There are two emphases that I think we disagree on. The first one is that community and social infrastructure should be the total focus of the new RDAs to the exclusion of commercial projects. The second one is the excessive involvement of the three tiers of government and the bureaucracy in the running of the program. I spent 20 years in regional development. It is a very exciting and challenging field. In fact, I probably came to politics through regional development. I think we all come here for two reasons. We come here because we want to make things better and we want to contribute. Obviously, we will come at this through different ways. Having seen regional development in this country in practice, I can tell you that under governments of both political colours at both state and federal levels it has been a dismal failure. If anyone really wants to understand regional development, there are various places around the world where you can go to see it, but I think the starting might be the Shannon Development corporation in Ireland. For a ministry that carries the title of ‘regional development’ not to engage in some form of private or commercial activity, to my way of thinking, is an abrogation of the role of the ministry and the department. Again, that is said with no malice; it is just a statement of fact. In spending those 20 years in regional development, it became obvious that regional development is not one for short-term initiatives. You might get a lucky industry at a first hit, but by and large it is a culture that needs to be in a community and it needs to extend over at least MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Committees
250,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.32 Am),"It is a pleasure to speak on the report of the Housefive, if not 10 or 15, years. In Ireland the two major parties have an agreement that when Shannon puts in its plan for 10 years they both agree to it so that the Shannon Development corporation-and, I imagine, other agencies like that in Ireland-can go about its work in the certain knowledge that there is going to be continuity. For regional development to become a culture and to start to make inroads into a regional community, you really need to have that longevity. This might surprise you. I think one of the things that Gough Whitlam got very right was the idea of having larger regional cities in Australia, and although some people will criticise the Albury-Wodonga experiment and say that it may become over-bureaucratised-and there is probably some truth in that too-I did a paper on this when I first went into regional development and I thought Whitlam had it pretty right. We need to have outside the capital cities of Australia large, inland provincial cities that are hubs for those areas. For example, I would like to see a large provincial city on the Darling Downs, west of Brisbane-not Toowoomba or Warwick but another large provincial city, perhaps around Clifton or in that area, of 150,000 to 200,000 people. Otherwise Brisbane is going to go exactly the same way as Sydney and Melbourne: it is just going to sprawl and sprawl and sprawl. I think Whitlam was saying to move some of the things out and develop them in those areas. Of course, you can do that by government intervention from above or you can do it from below. The best regional development is bottom up, but almost all regional development in Australia over the last 50 years has been top down. What happens in that circumstance is that, as governments change and ministers change and emphases change, the programs fall over and the new minister or the new government wants to stamp their character on what the new program will be. The minister might get promoted or the ministry might be changed in name six or 12 months later in a reshuffle and that all falls over again. That has been going on endlessly. I am thinking of the Queensland Department of Industry and Development. It became the Department of Industry and Commercial Development, then I think it went back to being the Department of Industry and Development, and then it became the Department of Business, Industry and Regional Development and then it became something else and then it became the Department of State Development and now it has another name. Each minister who comes to the department-and I am not querying the sincerity of those ministers-does not put in place a program with longevity at its centre. If you drive regional development from the bottom up, you need to involve the community. It needs to be driven by the businesses and the organisations of regional areas. These regions cannot be so big such that the focus is too amorphous or general; they need to be focused on the wider region. I think the ABS have got it pretty right. In most areas, the ABS regions are about right. I think there are 10 in Queensland and 10 in New South Wales. You all know the ABS regions. Some of them could perhaps be divided into two, but by and large they are right. They generally present a provincial city or a couple of provincial cities and the hinterland and, for those on the coast, the coastal towns of that region. That is the community of interest. That is where the business is done. That is where the accountants, the banks, the planners, the various industries, suppliers to industry and the transport companies hub. They are, if you like, the building blocks of regional development. You then need something to drive it; you need a board. The board should not be too heavily influenced by either local government or government. If it is going to be just an extension of MAIN COMMITTEE the local council, that is meaningless; you may as well do it in council. I think about half the people need to come from business itself; you have to headhunt a few leaders in these things. And then you have the chamber of commerce, the agricultural industries and certainly representatives of city and country local government and perhaps, if there is government money involved-and there should be-a representative from state or federal government. But the driving power needs to be the community itself. It is that sense of relevance, community and ownership which makes these things work. If you have top-down local government, the second the government gets an embarrassing situation or turns off the funding the whole darn thing falls over. It just stops overnight. There is nothing to drive it. Once the government money is pulled out, finito! If you want to see an example of that, there is the VEDC in Victoria. It was probably one of the best regional development programs. There was a bit of scandal in it. Again, instead of going in and fixing the scandal, they chopped off the whole program and went back to zero. I think to maintain the continuity of regional development you need to have those building blocks in place and government should fund the base running costs of those things. At present they spend up to about $300,000 on ACCs and RDAs. But I think federal government should put about $150,000 or $200,000 into each of those development boards or bureaus or whatever you like to call them-and perhaps the state government should put in $100,000-and then let the communities get on and do it. The next thing you need to do is a survey of your industries and your supply chain and the image that the broader Australian business and industry community has of your area. We go off and name things and we look at our navels thinking, ‘What a marvellous name!’ Everyone in town says, ‘Isn’t that a good name!’ What is important is what people in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, who are making the decisions, think of your area. If it is Bundaberg, Bathurst, Dubbo, Armidale or Tamworth, or wherever it might be, what does that conjure up? You have a survey and find what people think of your area-how they perceive it-because, if you are going to go out and market a region, perception is everything. You have to know what you need to correct in the minds of the decision makers and what they are looking for in your region. Honourable members, that seldom if ever happens. Governments devise a program and say, ‘We’ll call it Regional Partnerships or RDA or something else. We’re going to put all this money into it and it’s going to be marvellous.’ Then it gets bogged down, as this last program did, in bureaucracy. It was interesting to see what Bill Trevor, the former mayor of the Isis shire, said about it. He was somewhat critical of the bureaucracy around the program. He pointed out that the department just did not seem to have a handle on how things should happen. For example, he said there was a: Misunderstanding about the complex place-based issues facing communities; That is, there was no research into what is needed. There were: Unrealistic expectations of the capacity of community organisations to prepare complex grant applications; Unrealistic expectations about the capacity of community organisations to raise funds for local projects; Unrealistic expectations about the duration of funding required for projects to become sustainable; and MAIN COMMITTEE A lack of understanding about the damaging impact on community organisations and private sector applicants of delays in decision-making. What we need to do-and I could speak on this for an hour if I had to-is start with the building blocks, and then all the other things, the subregions, the liaison officers and the grant corridors for those things, would become relatively easy. My criticism of the report is not so much where it is going but the way it is attempting it. I call on my colleagues and the minister to give the sort of thing I am talking about today serious thought. tatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government report titled Funding regional and local community infrastructure: principles for the development of a regional and local community infrastructure funding program. From the outset I would like to put my thanks to the committee secretariat on the record. The nature of this inquiry and the nature of the work undertaken by this particular committee make the logistics of organisation challenging, and I am certainly very appreciative of the support provided by the staff of the secretariat. I would also like to put on record my thanks to the member for Hinkler who, through a period of this inquiry, acted as committee chair whilst the member for Ballarat was taking some time off with the birth of her first son, Ryan King. I very much appreciate that and I know other committee members do as well. I also acknowledge the contribution made through the course of the inquiry by the member for Hinkler. He certainly has vast experience in regional development. Whilst he has dissented from parts of the report, I know that we enjoyed his support for quite a substantial amount of the report. Like the member for Hinkler, I was motivated to seek public office by a number of issues and areas. Regional development, of course, was one of those areas that I had a pre-existing passion for. That extended back to my time in local government, where I certainly had some responsibilities, within the council that I served, in regional development and assisting in growing the economy and growing the liveability of a region. I think it is fair to say that the effort that we have put in through the course of the inquiry has led to some very substantial recommendations in this report. It is pleasing to see that government has, in a very short period of time, moved on quite a number of the aspects of the recommendations and the work within this report. I am tremendously pleased and grateful that that has happened. A government member’s perspective of why we thought there was a need to undertake this inquiry is that it arose from the previous program, the Regional Partnerships program. This government, then in opposition, was tremendously critical of the approach that the previous government took with respect to Regional Partnerships. We were particularly concerned about a number of recommendations that came out of the National Audit Office that were critical of the previous program. From my perspective, I know that I was very keen to ensure that, in the course of this inquiry and the report that we developed as a consequence, we picked up the issues that were dealt with there and the criticisms and concerns that we heard through the evidence in the inquiry’s work around the country. As you might well appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, by the nature of the work that the committee undertook, we needed to engage with all of the states and territories across Australia. We also needed to engage with local governments and regional development boards across Australia. I think it is fair to say that, depending on where we went and who we talked MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Committees
251,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (11.47 Am),"I rise to speak on the House of Represento, criticisms and concerns varied throughout the inquiry. But it is also fair to say that there were a number of very practical concerns that were raised with us, and I will deal with some of those shortly. The committee’s report specifically looked at a couple of things. We provided advice on the future funding of regional programs in order to assist in genuine and accountable community infrastructure projects. The evidence that was gathered through the course of this inquiry but also evidence and knowledge gained by committee members, particularly those who had presided on this committee in previous parliaments, was taken into consideration by a number of us. Clearly, local government has a very substantial role to play in providing infrastructure projects that lead to communities becoming more liveable and more sustainable, leading to healthier and more vibrant communities. We also know, through previous reports, that in many parts of this country local government practitioners are concerned about a growing infrastructure gap. We also examined ways to minimise administrative costs and duplication for taxpayers. One of the clearest observations that I made through the course of this inquiry was at a practical level. When a community group made an application for funding, under the previous program in particular, they often needed to make an application to local government, to state government and to the Commonwealth government. That led to many community groups and organisations being utterly daunted by the volume of paperwork and correspondence that needed to be entered into to access funding across those three levels of government. It became clear to me that, in many cases, there were competing priorities, making it difficult for communities to access regional development funding to address some of the significant challenges that they might have. The third term of reference was: Examine the former government’s practices and grants outlined in the Australian National Audit Office report on Regional Partnerships with the aim of providing advice on future funding of regional programs; We spent considerable time on this term of reference and considerable evidence was received in relation to it. The fourth term of reference was: Examine the former government’s practices and grants in the Regional Partnerships Program after the audit period of 2003-2006 with the aim of providing advice on future funding of regional programs. I know that the member for New England was particularly concerned with that. After undertaking the inquiry, the committee came up with five broad recommendations, which I hope provide clear guidelines to the government on how we might go forward in this area. Recommendation 1 was: The Committee recommends that the Government replace the Regional Partnerships Programme with a new program designed to provide ongoing funding support for regional and local community infrastructure. I might take a moment to speak on that point. It was absolutely clear through the work that we undertook that both the government and the opposition were firmly committed to the view that the Commonwealth government ought to play a role in assisting regional and local comMAIN COMMITTEE munities to grow. That became obvious throughout the course of our inquiry. The second recommendation was: The Committee recommends that the Government examine RLCIP applications received from local government and quantify the amount of funding which is being allocated to non-profit organisations. We spent considerable time discussing this. I think it is fair to say that there is more work for the government to do in this area. Not-for-profit organisations in many instances provide the glue that holds our communities together. Without the support, guidance and assistance that those organisations provide in our communities, things become that little bit harder. One of the previous occupations that I held before coming to this place was working for an organisation called Vision Australia Foundation, which provided services to the blind and vision-impaired. Whilst that organisation was of quite a significant size, of quite a significant nature, and, as a charitable organisation, had been around for a long time, I know that there are many others that have not been around for anywhere near that length of time and do not have their own internal resources that they have built up. I think accessing programs like this is critical in enabling those types of organisations to grow. The third recommendation was: The Committee recommends that the Government, in establishing a new regional infrastructure funding program, consider the need for clarity and simplicity when structuring guidelines that address an applicant’s eligibility and the manner in which it will assessed and funds awarded. It was clear under the previous program that guidelines and structures were not necessarily always followed to the letter that they should have been. In fact, it became quite clear that the majority of funds seemed to go-from my observations-into a limited number of National Party and Liberal Party marginal seats. I think that is a chapter in our history that we should not revisit in the future. We need to ensure that there are proper guidelines in place that enable a fair and equitable distribution of funding to all communities, with a discrete bucket of money being made available for applicants to chase on a more competitive basis. I note, with some pleasure, that the federal government moved down that path with its various stimulus packages. We provided substantial funding to all local governments so that they could make their communities much more liveable and sustainable into the future. I think that is very important. We also made funding available under a set of arrangements to ensure that small councils got more of a slice of the pie than larger ones. (Time expired) Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government’s report Funding regional and local community infrastructure: principles for the development of a regional and local community. I believe that supporting the programs that build and help communities is one of the most fundamental roles of the parliament and of local representatives. It has achieved real results for the community. Having only become a member of this committee in early November, I was not part of the full inquiry process and of the hearings. However, having seen the results of Regional Partnerships projects delivered not only to my electorate of Canning but to the whole of Australia, I obviously have an interest in this report. The government’s dismantling of the area consultative committees and Regional Partnerships will be seen as nothing more than a sham if subsequent programs fail to deliver to local communities. I agree with Deputy Chair Paul Neville’s MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Committees
252,Mr Randall (Canning) (12.03 Pm),"I am pleased to speak today on the Standingdissenting comments that the government’s proposed RDAs-regional development authorities-appear to take the process and the role of infrastructure development away from local communities and put much more of a heavy process on governments at all levels. It is bureaucratic nonsense. This is clear in the recommendation to have a departmental delegate as the chair of these RDAs. The Leader of the Nationals has suggested that the recommendations made in the report are likely to lead to a less efficient program that will favour large population centres and do little to stimulate local community growth. I agree with the comments of the member for Hinkler, Mr Neville, about an enlargement of the ACC role of strategically placed regional offices with skilled field officers. I think it is vital that these officers know the regions that they are in very well. Any intention to simplify the application and assessment process has been lost. The area consultative committees became the backbone of local development and infrastructure. In Canning, the entire community was lucky to have what would have been one of the most motivated and successful ACCs in the country. Why were they so successful? Because they knew the local area. They knew the needs of the local community and made a commitment to delivering the best results for the people of the Peel region. The Peel ACC covered an area of some 6,027 square kilometres and incorporates the local government areas of Rockingham and Kwinana, which are in the member for Brand’s electorate, and, in my electorate, the localities of Serpentine Jarrahdale, Mandurah, Murray, Waroona and now Boddington. The Peel ACC region remains the fastest growing in Western Australia and also one of the fastest growing in Australia. That made the work of the ACC vital to delivering infrastructure to cater for this growth. I will be sad to see John Lambrect and Noela Durnin leave at the end of this month and I want to pay special thanks to former executive officer Pat Gallagher. Pat was highly successful in delivering outcomes for the region because he was in touch with local people and local programs and he was very hands-on. He had the trust of those in the region to identify programs to help provide much sought infrastructure to add to their local programs. This Rudd government would have us believe that the Regional Partnerships program was all bad, but this program was highly successful and delivered real results. I will outline some successful Regional Partnerships projects that were delivered by the ACC and which will benefit the Canning local community for many years to come. One example is the magnificent war memorial in Mandurah, which was supported by the ACC to the tune of $275,000. There have been many fantastic ANZAC services and other services held there. In another project, the Waroona Town Square redevelopment, which was partnered with Alcoa, the sponsorship of the ACC was $286,000. A multi-use sporting facility at Peelwood Reserve in Mandurah was sponsored to the tune of $588,000 and is now being used by all the local soccer clubs, cricket clubs and schools. It is a multipurpose facility that is used all year and was sorely needed because the City of Mandurah could not afford it on its own, but the city did partner with the state government’s sporting programs. The Boddington Medical Centre was sponsored to the tune of $33,000 and the Peel Tourist Railway was sponsored for $969,000. This was a fantastic project that has brought a concentration of commercial development to Pinjarra and, again, was partnered by Alcoa. MAIN COMMITTEE Support for the Fairbridge Village redevelopment was $2 million. This was one of the most unique villages in Australia. Those present would know that this is the last of the Kingsley Fairbridge Villages from around the world and it was in decay. It was actually going to be bulldozed about 10 years ago until successive governments supported it. I have to congratulate the member for Brand because he is currently working with the Fairbridge executives to continue the support of this magnificent village, which delivers fantastic outcomes for young people at risk-Indigenous young people in training. This, and restoring the village back to its original use, is what this $2 million went towards. So it is a great program. None of the people that received these moneys ever said it should go back, because it is doing fantastic things on the ground. They all had partners. For example, because Alcoa is the largest employer in the area and abuts Fairbridge Village, they put money into this program, along with the Freemasons of Western Australia. The Freemasons are one of the biggest patrons of Fairbridge and many of the Fairbridgeans that came out there are obviously members of the Masonic Lodge and continue their association with the village. During the 2006-07 financial year 12 Regional Partnership applications were submitted from the Peel region, including the above-mentioned Pinjarra pool, the Meadow Springs open space facility, the Port Bouvard Surf Sports and Life Saving Club and the paediatric ward. Six projects were approved with the total amount of funding being $3,365,000. This funding was to contribute towards $20 million of capital development in the region. So the $3 million was going to actually enhance the region by bringing in other partners to make a total development of $20 million. It was a great outcome. Then we had the unfortunate situation where Labor decided to axe those projects that had not been approved in writing by the previous minister prior to the election. The Pinjarra Indoor Heated Aquatic Facility, the Meadow Springs open space facility, the Port Bouvard Surf Sports and Life Saving Club, the paediatric ward of the Peel Health Campus and the c-pod digital studios in the City of Gosnells, which is now in the area of the member for Hasluckjust to mention the details of a few. I am pleased to say that after rearguard actions, a lot of lobbying and some sensible behaviour with the support of the member for Brand, the Port Bouvard Surf Sports and Life Saving Club is now back on track. I visited this site last week to observe that the construction is well under way. Credit for this must go largely in part to the City of Mandurah and the Club President Ric Roberts, who recently received a Member of the Order of Australia for his work in surf lifesaving; but this in particular was one of his last and best projects. The club room’s proposal included a viewing platform for lifesavers, a first aid room, a training room, a kiosk, change rooms and storage-not to mention a base for the club’s 200-plus members. This will vastly assist the members to help save lives. Already there has been a death in this area because of the unmanned beach. Tragically, that happened before we could put this facility in place. Now that the construction has started, not only will the beach be patrolled but later in the summer they will have this facility to operate from. Finally, I would like to say that the Shire of Murray is in Canberra today. I know that they are seeking the funding for the Pinjarra pool project of $1.1 million which was committed to the expansion of the existing Murray District Community Recreation Centre to include an indoor heated, eight lane, 25 metre pool, spa and leisure pool. As I said, this was axed and now the project is at a standstill because it is waiting for funding despite the fact that the fundMAIN COMMITTEE ing had been committed from all other sources. Those other sources included, again, Alcoa helping provide the generation of power through their cogen facility, the shire and the state government. Now that the federal government has pulled the funding, it is at a standstill. It would be a great community facility that is sorely needed for the recreation, welfare and health of this local community. But I suspect that it has been knocked on the head because it was a commitment from the former government. It is tragic for the local community and I will do my best to try and help these people see this project come to fruition. With all the money sloshing around at the moment in the stimulus packages, sadly this magnificent project is being stymied because of what I see as spiteful and vindictive politics from the member for Grayndler. I hope that this is one of the projects that this program-and the governmentproposes to revisit and look at to see that it will be funded in the future. House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government today to discuss the second report on funding regional and local community infrastructure, which was released earlier this month. I very much enjoyed the work of this committee. I think we were very well led by Catherine King, and having the member for Hinkler, Paul Neville, with his 16 years of service to this committee and its predecessors, on the committee gives a wealth of historical context to the work that we are currently doing. I would just like to respond to a couple of things that the member for Canning had to say during his contribution just finished. He opened up talking about the area consultative committees and Regional Development Australia. This is not the time or the place for that debate. In fact, during the committee hearings and processes, we understood that this was not the time and or place for that debate, and yet, time after time, ACC witnesses appeared before us, seemingly more interested in saving their own necks than in coming up with a program of grant funding to help develop their communities. The transitioning from ACC to RDA is in progress. It is a government decision, not something that has been brought about by this committee or, quite frankly, something that this committee can influence in a major way at all. WhatI understand the government is doing is trying to harmonise across Australia all of the different regional development priorities-whether they be at state government or local authority level, or even developed by development associations-so that they are combining but not competing. The member for Canning spoke about the late unlamented Regional Partnerships program. Nobody ever said-as he claimed-that it was all bad. In fact, a lot of good work happened in the Regional Partnerships program. But it was open to abuse and it was abused quite widely. I suggest to anybody listening to this debate or reading it later in Hansard that they should go to the transcript of the committee hearings in Cairns on 25 July last year and read the words of the member for Kennedy, the Hon. Bob Katter, who probably represents as big a chunk of regional Australia as any member in this place. He was most disgusted by the way the Regional Partnerships program had been developed. In fact, the only way he could see out of the problem was to divide the money allocated each year by 150 and allow that amount to be spent in each of the 150 electorates. Obviously, we have not followed that advice, but he was most vociferous in his understanding that the program was rorted outrageously. MAIN COMMITTEE",209,Committees
253,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (12.15 Pm),I am pleased to rise to speak as a member of the,212,Committees
254,Mr Windsor,"It was a disgrace!whom, I know, also represents regional parts of Australia-and I am sure he is going to mention some of the problems that occurred in his area in his contribution to come. Local governments are struggling to provide both essential and aspirational infrastructure for their communities. This is evidenced by the massive oversubscription to the second stage of the government’s Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, known as the cils, and a second $50 million was set aside for competitive submitters. Some $1.3 billion worth of submissions were received-submissions for projects which, were they to proceed, would enrich community life in our country enormously. That is, $1.3 billion worth of submissions for $50 million on offer. I am pleased to say that the local government which includes my electorate of Longman, the Moreton Bay Regional Council, was successful in that competitive process and received $3.8 million towards the construction of a state equestrian centre at Caboolture, which will be a joint project between that council, the federal government and the state government. In February, the government had to defer the $500 million to the RLCIP as part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan stimulus package-an acknowledgement of the unmet need for community infrastructure and of the capacity of local government to move quickly on projects, thereby ensuring that the economy received the necessary boosts in a timely manner. The federal government, of all three levels of government, has the necessary power and capacity to raise revenue. I understand-and these figures may not be accurate-that revenue raisings by local governments amount to three per cent of government revenue in Australia. State governments amount to another 19 per cent, meaning that the federal government raises around about 78 per cent of government revenue raised in Australia. As I say, whilst I cannot vouch for the absolute accuracy of those figures, simply taking them as an indicator illustrates the magnitude of the problem. When it comes to day-to-day services and the facilities needed to provide those services, the local and state governments carry the burden of responsibility and are dependent in large part on the flow of funds from the federal government. Members of the committee recognise the absolute necessity of an ongoing infrastructure grant program to assist local government in particular but also to assist community groups to provide infrastructure sufficient for the needs of their community. This final report and the interim report tabled last November have focused on principles which we believe will ensure that the ongoing program is fair and transparent. Together they seek to establish a framework on which a program with the objectives of assisting local communities in this way can be a truly AAA program-available, accessible and accountable. The report sets out clear guidelines about who should be eligible to access the scheme and what they are able to use it for. It seeks to have an application process that is both simple and adequately supported, so that assistance is available when it is needed. It places great emphasis on the need for diligent acquittal, appropriate to the size of the grant, to provide assurances of a fully accountable program. Throughout the inquiry process, I developed a view that local councils’ priorities were routinely hijacked by requests from community groups seeking to access the former Regional Partnerships program for a matching contribution from council. The program recommended by this report seeks to eliminate that potentiality, but it does present a risk that community MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Committees
255,Mr Sullivan,"I take the interjection from the honourable member for New Englandgroups could be frozen out by any council. Recommendation 2 of the final report, which relates to the quantification of funding allocated to non-profit organisations, sends a message to councils that they need to be considerate of the needs of that sector, who have had their capacity to raise funds severely curtailed in recent years. I want to address in part the dissenting comments from the deputy chair-and, by dint of his 16 years service on this committee and its predecessors, as I said, its elder statesman-the member for Hinkler, Paul Neville. Mr Neville laments the fact that the committee recommendations exclude the profit sector-that is, businesses-from accessing this program. I have said frequently throughout the process, as Mr Neville will attest, that in order to have regional development you have to have social development and economic development. Yet, as loudly as he bemoans the exclusion of the profit sector from this program, I will applaud it louder. The first report acknowledged the need for programs to assist economic development in the regions and indicated a view that it would be better managed by another portfolio. That is a view that I hold very strongly. There is no reasonable justification for social infrastructure having to compete with business proposals for funding in any community. The quarantining of the social and the economic, each drawing from a pool of funds allocated by the government according to government priorities from time to time, is by far a more transparent process and, dare I say it, much less open to the types of abuse we saw with the former government’s Regional Partnerships program. During the inquiry process the committee visited the electorate of the member for Hinkler. There we saw evidence of many successful businesses who had received grants, gifts of money, from the former government under the RPP. These businesses had developed new products and had provided employment in the community. One firm in particular received about a million dollars of government assistance to relocate to Bundaberg from Nambour. It is claimed that, without the gift of a million dollars from the government, their bankers would not have provided the finance to allow them to make the move. Yet this firm paid farmers in the Bundaberg region over $2 million in their first year for the cane trash on the paddocks after the cane harvest. It seems to me that that was a pretty solid business, that it probably had a pretty solid business plan and that it was not a business that the banks ought to have been reluctant to finance. I believe a culture was developing within banks to send regional business loan applicants to the federal government for some ‘free money’ before agreeing to assist them with bank finance. This, of course, greatly reduced the bank’s risks, but at a cost to the taxpayer. I know that I am not alone in finding that kind of behaviour unconscionable. During the course of the public hearings in Bundaberg, witnesses who had received funding from the RPP agreed with me that businesses helped by governments should in some, if not all, instances have repayment responsibilities-for example, when an assisted business is sold or reaches sustainable profitability. Certainly the creation of jobs in regional areas is a legitimate consideration for government. However, money allocated for this purpose in successive budgets would be much more useful accumulating as it is repaid, so that each year more and more businesses can be assisted, rather than ultimately lining the pockets of clever and successful business people. I have great pleasure in commending this report to the parliament. In closing, like all members, I want to acknowledge the good work of the members of the secretariat, in particular those who were heavily involved with this report-inquiry secretary Michael Crawford, and MAIN COMMITTEE researchers Susan Cardell and Dr Brian Lloyd-who have served our committee with great distinction and served this parliament well in the report that they have helped us produce. endorsing the work of the committee secretariat in relation to this particular issue. I was seconded to this committee for this particular inquiry. I think a few members have alluded to my interest in this particular issue and the way it should be done into the future. I congratulate the government, in that there was recognition of the Audit Office report on the previous government. There was no doubt that there were absolute and shocking abuses of process in terms of the way funding was allocated to various organisations. I might spend some time on that in a minute. I think the main focus of this report was to put in place something that would work for the future. This document is not perfect, and what the government is doing so far is not perfect; but it is better than what was in place before. Time will judge its capacity to deliver. One of the important things that it has delivered so far is a degree of fairness to the process that was not there before. It was that unfairness in the previous Regional Partnerships arrangements that shone through when we had an application process that was open to all and a determination process that was not open to all. The Audit Office noted in a quite scathing report that there were many cases where there was abuse of process or the process was not even entered into. Almost by definition, that is unfair to those community groups and local government groups et cetera that applied thinking they would be assessed fairly against other organisations and bodies. I think what the government has done since is an improvement on that, in that the process of assessment is fairer. That is not suggesting that it cannot be politicised like the other program was. I would hope that it is not. I think the Financial Management and Accountability Act amendments are being looked at by the minister for finance, but I think they have to be improved more than what is being done there. One of the problems with the previous arrangements was that, if the minister-and you cannot take away discretion from the minister-or the government of the day determined that a particular program should get funding and did not adhere to the guidelines, quite obviously that is a breach of the Financial Management and Accountability Act. There were instances where people did not even fill out application forms and were still issued with funds. What happens when a minister does that? Virtually nothing. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, has looked at that issue and has in fact made some changes; there will be a process but there are no penalties. I find it quite interesting that last week we were debating-and we will waste time on this again this afternoon-who has done favours for whom on the back of this utility that is driving around Brisbane somewhere. The Audit Office report into the Regional Partnerships arrangements was essentially on that very issue: who was doing favours for whom inside a process that had various processes within it which, in a lot of cases, were being ignored. That is why this particular report was put together-to find a way forward which was better. In my view, what is better about this report is that it does involve local government. I am pleased to see here today a practitioner of local government, the Mayor of Gunnedah. He is one of the youngest mayors in Australia and, I might say, a very good one. I might add that he is not in my electorate, so I say that without displaying any favours towards him-but I do welcome him to this building.

There are positives in this particular arrangement; it does involve local government. One of the great problems with the previous program was that it was open to abuse in a whole range of areas. It could be abused at the area consultative committee stage. I am not suggesting that of any of the staff. The staff of the New England North West Area Consultative Committee are very good, and the board members are, in the main, very good, but the position of the chair became greatly politicised in recent years. I think it was back in the early 2000s that the Chairman of the New South Wales National Party was made the chairman of the area consultative committee, so you can imagine what sorts of processes started to unfold. He was replaced some years later by the current National Party member for Barwon in the state parliament, so you can imagine what sorts of shenanigans were going on regarding funding streams et cetera. There were some quite blatant abuses of those funding areas, which the New England North West Area Consultative Committee embraced, and some of those are still under investigation. There was a development, value-adding, of an orange farm in the citrus industry. I think about $280 million was accessed through Regional Partnerships. A photograph was taken of a cheque being presented by the former Deputy Prime Minister. Nothing has happened; the money has gone but nothing has occurred. I am told that there are still some investigations into the probity of that particular process. There was a guideline within the Regional Partnerships process where what were called ‘competitive neutrality issues’ were breached. That has been clarified by this recommendation. By competitive neutrality I mean where favouring one business gives another business competitive advantage. I disagree with the member for Hinkler and I agree with the previous member who spoke. I argued on the committee that the commercial organisations should not be funded through these discretionary funding arrangements. They should not be funded. They were funded. As with the citrus business that never occurred as one of those commercial activities, nothing ever happened. It was open to abuse at that particular stage and, within the electorate of New England, for instance, the breaches of the competitive neutrality guidelines did occur on a number of occasions. There are two zeolite mines within 15 kilometres of each other; in fact, they can see each other’s dust on a still day. One was granted Regional Partnerships funding-they are private businesses-of something like $300,000 to upgrade its plant and equipment, not to do some marketing exercise with the Chinese or the Russians or someone else externally but to upgrade its equipment. Obviously, because they are in the same business-they are both mining zeolite-that would have a competitive effect on the non-funded business. Both these businesses are run by very decent people; I know them both very well. But that is an unfair advantage that was bestowed by government.

260,Mr Windsor,"I wish the member for Gippsland well. He does not have any boundaryberating the Prime Minister and the Treasurer over some sort of unfair advantage that some fellow in Queensland was getting with his motorcars. We have not seen any proof of that yet, but for some of these people in the parliament to be getting on their hind legs and suggesting that granting someone an unfair advantage is a crime, when these crimes were committed under the former Regional Partnerships arrangements, I think is quite interesting to watch. There have been, as I have said, other areas where I believe the previous program did not work and was blatantly politicised. Let us look at the example of the much reported Australian Equine and Livestock Events Centre in Tamworth that I was involved with and have been for over a decade. I was the state member when we received funding from the state government at that time. I was involved with keeping the various national equine groups together on a committee. I was brushed aside, in a sense, because of my political persuasion-being an Independent-and then other people were installed in that position. The applications for funding that went on at that particular time were brushed aside, as independent people came in and assessed the project-which was valued at about $13 million at the time-as being nonviable. So the Commonwealth was unable to fund. That particular project now, instead of costing $13 million, costs about $35 million and is judged as being terribly viable, and that amount of money was requested from the Commonwealth parliament. SoI think that is a demonstration of the lengths that some people went to in order to create circumstances not to fund and then to create an opportunity to fund the same projects. Another improvement noted in the document that we are debating today is that the acquittal processes are much clearer. They were quite blurred in some areas and abused in others. I think there is less opportunity for the politicisation process to occur. I would recommend to the government and to the minister: do not go down that path. In fact, great credit comes to government when it does not politicise the funding and try and take political advantage of it. A classic example of that I am sure the mayor of Gunnedah, Adam Marshall, would agree-was the previous government’s Roads to Recovery program. This was a very fair program, where everybody got their fair share and people appreciated it. They still appreciate it out there now, and they appreciate what the current government is doing. But as soon as a government try to abuse the process, they abuse the people, and the people are more likely to abuse them at the polls. So it is a counterproductive exercise. The National Party took hold of what was originally a very good program with quite good intent-it was actually initiated by Simon Crean many years ago-and abused that intent over time and politicised it. As a consequence, they have not gained seats but have lost them. They have lost credibility and respect in the electorate, even from those who received money from that program. There were deals done in coffee shops. There were deals retrospectively. There were deals done all over the place. People do not respect those who do deals of that nature, particularly when they are using taxpayers’ funds. I think the involvement of local government is a positive because local government is elected and at least there is some stream of accountability in that process. Under the previous arrangements, local governments could apply and, if they were of the right political flavour, they might have a chance and, if they were not, they did not. There was a range of ways you could dodge and weave around them, but they were not considered as the elected body with a legitimate priority in terms of which of their major projects should be looked at. MAIN COMMITTEE I agree with the changes proposed in the report. As I said earlier, I think there needs to be a firming up of penalties on ministers that abuse the Financial Management and Accountability Act. There need to be real penalties, not of the kind where a minister will have a black mark against their name or their conduct will be noted by the Audit Office. I make this plea to the Audit Office: look at this program as it unfolds over time and see whether there are any abuses of it and make sure that, where we can, we strengthen the FMA Act so that, if a minister starts to interfere in a fair process and politicises it, as happened under the previous government, they are penalised with the loss of their job. Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government into funding regional and local community infrastructure. I certainly acknowledge the comments made by the member for New England and the member for Longman and also their intense understanding of what this report is challenging us all to consider. But I should say that, from my perspective, we have moved forward from where this report details methods by which governments should engage communities in providing them infrastructure. The report is very good. I applaud the secretariat. They did a lot of work in providing not only the information and the logistics for the hearings but also a quality report from this inquiry. The notions of probity and integrity in terms of how a system like this should operate are very important. My own personal experiences have brought this home to me, especially when I was campaigning for the seat of Forde prior to the election. We all know the program that existed prior to the election-the Regional Partnerships program. Some communities appeared to do very well out of the commitments made by the then government. I have spoken many times in this House about how an area like mine, the seat of Forde in south-east Queensland, has been underresourced in terms of community infrastructure. The reality then was that we were a black hole when it came to being on anyone’s map in terms of the infrastructure that we required as a community. In the lead-up to the election campaign, letters from the then minister, who is now retired from this parliament, had committed the then government under the RPP to three major community projects in the Forde electorate. When the election was over and there was a little bit of backtrack over the detail, it was found that there were no contracts and no commitments made. This indicated to me that this was very much an election campaign against my attempts to be the local member. We understand that these things do happen, and I think this report goes a long way to understanding the direction that we now need to take. The community of Forde has essentially been passed by on many occasions, but it was eventually promised some fairly crucial pieces of social infrastructure only to find out later that there was no veracity to those claims or commitments. So, as the member, I have had to go back to the community and say that these commitments were made but were unfunded and uncontracted. However, good things do come: there is the fact that this report was commissioned and the inquiry took place. It also built along the way an understanding by our current government, the Rudd government, of the need to look at how we might provide community infrastructure, and the large commitment of $800 million has been made. That is going into community infrastructure via a process of engaging local government. I certainly reflect on the words of the member for Hinkler and his concern that the private sector or organisations for profit cannot benefit from this funding. There is a fundamental problem with that approach. You are sugMAIN COMMITTEE",216,Rlcip In November Last Year $250 Million Was Shared Among All Of Australia S Local Coun
261,Mr Raguse (Forde) (12.41 Pm),"I also rise today to speak on the report by the Standinggesting that the only way community infrastructure can be rolled out is by the private sector. Another good thing about this report and the approaches we have taken as a government now is that it is about a partnership. It always has been about a partnership and while it is clear that the private sector has a role to play, it is very much the case that if you give the private sector the incentive, the motivation and the direction in terms of how they can be involved in investment in the community then they can make their business decisions based on that. In one of the recommendations we talk about local government and local government involvement. As the member for New England said, local governments are elected representatives; they are people who have an understanding of their community needs and the priorities for the community. As I mentioned, those three projects that were promised by the previous government in my electorate had very little input from the local authority. When you look at the liabilities that were being placed on the local authority through those commitments, it is not just the building of infrastructure but, as we all know, it is the recurrent costs that may go into provision of any infrastructure. To have a process that has the integrity that I believe has been outlined in our report, the way forward is to look at how we as a government are providing that infrastructure on the ground right now. As I said, the 24 recommendations very much put in place the approach and some suggestions about how government can certainly provide a process that is watertight. It is a perception of wrongdoing that is more damaging than the actual accusations-the fact that there can be allegations or accusations made about a process that is not complete. So this report, which outlines through those 24 recommendations a way forward, is very important. The way forward is to look at what we have done as a government and to certainly take note of the intent of the report, even at this stage, in the rollout of infrastructure. There is now the ability for local government in my community to put their hand up and ask for some very important pieces of infrastructure. I would like to detail a little bit of that investment. Given our approach and the suggestions and recommendations made by this report, the approach forward seems to be working very well for many communities. We had the Australian Council of Local Government, which formed last November, again in Canberra this week in conference talking about their move forward and the ability of the federal government to engage with them. In fact we had all levels of government-federal, state and local-working together to provide essential community projects. You have heard me almost complain in this House about how the electorate of Forde has been overlooked. I am very pleased to say that now we have some leverage on the ground we have got good projects and we are getting support from the federal government, at the local government level and also from the state government. I can name a couple of large projects in South-East Queensland in which I have been involved. There are some just outside of my electorate. You are aware of the AFL stadium on the Gold Coast-a large investment by the three levels of government working together to provide that outcome. There are also projects on Tamborine Mountain, a very beautiful part of my electorate. Traditionally that is a very conservative community but they boast that they now have their first Labor member. It is interesting that they can see that Labor governments have a philosophy and an understanding of what we need to provide to communities. We have been able to provide their community with a number of very important but very fundamental resources-sporting facilities. MAIN COMMITTEE I always consider mountains to be like islands; you have limited resources. Tamborine Mountain, which has nearly 9,000 residents, had no sporting facilities of note-there was a park somewhere and another little bit of equipment somewhere else. With cooperation from the local government-the Scenic Rim Regional Council, once known as the Beaudesert Council-and the state government and federal government commitment of $3.6 million, that community will be able to build very important, very fundamental basic sporting facilities. This means that children and families on that mountain will now no longer have to travel for an hour or an hour and a half for sporting events down on the Gold Coast or further north towards Brisbane. They will have their own facilities. Again, it is through that partnership that we have been able to create this in a very short time. This was a project that has been on the drawing board for nearly eight years. The community have lobbied, have spoken to state members, to their council, to the federal government. They were essentially ignored by the federal government. Their concern about those other projects that were promised under the RPP left them somewhat dissatisfied. They believed that not only did they not get a look-in but these other projects certainly did not warrant the support that they got or the political involvement that was provided for those particular projects. While we have received a commitment of $3.6 million to the community for those sporting facilities, there is also a restoration of a very important iconic piece of community infrastructure: the Zamia Theatre, which has a long history. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am a bit of a thespian; I tramped the boards for a couple of years in my early life. So theatre and that kind of cultural expression are very, very important for a community. The Zamia Theatre company, on a promise from the federal government-what was a bogus promiseundertook with their own money to strip the facility of its lining, its roofing and make major changes to its foundation. Of course, it could not proceed-no money. The federal government commitment at the time was not forthcoming, yet here was an iconic community facility that was certainly being challenged by weather conditions and was very much in a poor state. Through the Community Infrastructure Program, and with the Scenic Rim Regional Council, we as a government were able to commit $179,000 to that particular project. This will now bring that community facility back to use and also protect the heritage that is very much a strong part of the mountain community. Other proposed infrastructure includes projects like a skate bowl and park in Tamborine Village. If you know the region, you have Tamborine Mountain and Tamborine proper is actually a village at the bottom of the slopes of the mountain. For that community, we are providing some very simple infrastructure that they would not have otherwise been able to use or have installed. In talking about this report, I mention that it is about partnerships and the three levels of government working together. The fourth column to this is the private sector. I know the member for Hinkler’s concerns, and I would like to allay his concerns. As the member for Longman mentioned, there are opportunities that the private sector can tap into. If the community is getting a basic piece of infrastructure and there is an economic outcome that can be generated further by private investment, that is essentially the stimulus that that community needs. Let me give you an example of a little bit of infrastructure that has been provided very recently in the electorate of Forde. You have heard me in the House and this particular chamber MAIN COMMITTEE talk about the ‘great south-west’ and the development of a strategy to open up the electorate of Forde as a major transport corridor. We talk about Australia’s freight effort and of giving alternatives to the region, in terms of how we might move freight and other forms of transport through a region. Some of the simple infrastructure that we will be providing to the region essentially allows the private sector to come on board. The private sector will tell you that all they want is certainty about what infrastructure will be provided. And that provision of infrastructure by government agencies-in this case, the federal government-means that they can invest with some certainty. So, while I understand the member for Hinkler’s concerns, I would like to allay his fears and say that the private sector will be supported, as it has been by our general rollout of infrastructure around the country. Communities generally cannot afford the total provision of infrastructure, but the stimulus that local, state and federal government working together can provideMs George-Together with the great federal representative in these parts! I won Tamborine Mountain through the help of the member for Throsby, who visited in her shadow parliamentary secretary role and did a wonderful job. In fact, we had a huge turnout. Ms George-It is a wonderful achievement. been able to achieve those outcomes for our community. Again, the private sector can certainly benefit. The projects that I have been outlining and the strategies that I have brought forward to our region will include multibillion dollars worth of investment in the area of Bromelton on the standard gauge railway line. Essentially, small pieces of infrastructure in other parts of the country-when you talk about transport corridors-can bring about those sorts of outcomes: the major investments, the multibillion dollar investments that will bring to my region and the area of Bromelton some 8,000 jobs in the next 10 years. This occurs not necessarily through governments providing money to the private sector; this provides other community infrastructure that then allows the private sector to have some certainty that governments will be supporting the rollout of further infrastructure by the private sector. CanI say in closing that in the seat of Forde we have been able to move forward with a commitment from government in terms of community infrastructure. The recommendations in the report put forward a solution in terms of how we may be able to look at regional development. I know the deputy chair, the member for Hinkler, who is passionate about regional development, gave a lot of information, and we value his understanding of the history through his involvement in regional development. CanI say that the report, therefore, brings to us recommendations that will certainly support the government’s infrastructure rollout. Debate (on motion by Ms George) adjourned. Main Committee, I would like to welcome the representatives from Bundaberg Rum who have been brought in by the member for Hinkler. I trust they have an interesting time during their visit to parliament and I thank them for coming to check out the Main Committee. We do not get many visitors, so we thank them.
