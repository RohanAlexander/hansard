Mr J. H . CATTS -Owing to the inadequacy of the information concerning the production of iron in Australia which is now available, rendering bonus proposals mere matters of speculation, will the Government agree to the appointment of a Select Committee to provide Parliament with reliable information on which intelligent legislation can be based? the information is inadequate. As the appointment of a Committee would mean the indefinite postponement of the Manufactures Encouragement B ill , I do not think it should be asked for. Similar legislation has.been before us on two or three occasions; and in the debates upon it f u l l use has been made of the results of the prolonged investigation of a Commonwealth Royal Commission.

This process of to the member at his own cost, by private companies, run for profit to the members, and, the police from local government, the education of thc people from the religious bodies, short? Personally, I think it will not be allowed to so continue, although I am not yet strongly; but we must certainly expect a steady increase in this governmental interference. At the present moment in this Commonwealth we nre promised new insurance legislation, and in this I hope our society will make its influence felt. The development on collective lines will not come all at once; it will follow the present course of social development, and gradually nationalize one industry after another. There is but little room even now for small omnibus lines, factories, gas companies, water companies, tramways or shops; the field is occupied more and more by large companies, mammoth stores, universal providers, and so on. The same is true in insurance companies, everything points to the business being done by a few giants in place of a multitude of small companies. Tbis may be strictly "" economic"" as far as the nation-unit is concerned, and 1 have no doubt that it is; but as far as the individual unit is alTected he may be excused for looking at the prospect from his own or selfish point of view. Now he is a man able'to look forward to working his way on to independence, trusting to the might of his own right arm and brain; in the future all but a very few can only look forward to positions of salaried servants in huge offices or companies. The prospect is not too alluring, but that is how it appears to me. panies will practically form monopolies-and since monopolies are 'rightlv distrusted except when under very stringent legislative conditions, as far as the indispensable necessities of l if e and irresponsible evasions. We want prosare concerned, the State will practically have to lake charge of them. Insurance will not for long be permitted to remain in the hands of private bodies, mutual associations or proprietary companies. It will be supplied by the State at public cost to all. Not only insurance against death, but also insurance against ill House to carry a proposal of this kind. ness, and consequent lack of income for those dependent on the sick man, and also provision for maintenance and old age will be provided by the State. Every man will be assured that in case of premature death his wife ancl children will not be left to the somewhat cold mercies of a heedless public; he will know that if he falls ill , he and his will be kept during the period of his incapacitation, he will know that if from old age or from incapacity through illness he will have a steady income. The field of insurance companies will be restricted to providing additional benefits over and above those provided by the State; friendly societies and accident assurance will probably find themselves functus officio. Insurance thus being a matter of State concern, like education, many companies will disappear as so many private schools have done. The field for managers and actuaries will be sadly circumscribed in comparison with the present field. In the field of life assurance as we all understand it, the principal shoals seem to be well and clearly marked', and every one who has well and truly learned his trade can safely steer his way through ancl reach his port safely. Of shoals known to exist, but not precisely surveyed, buoyed and lit, is one, namely, the admission into a valuation of -the lapse elei ment. This element does exist always, and in any particular experience follows a law varying in each case, of course, much more steady Mr King O'Malley. and calculable than some are disposed to admit. To treat this factor as absolutely non-existent we know makes for safety, but to know of the existence of a factor always existent and yet to contentedly remain ignorant of how and to what extent it affects our results is, I venture to think a reproach to us as a scientific body. t I have quoted largely from the remarks of Mr Moore, because he is not a labour man or a Socialist, and because he recognises that in this age of progress and civilization, the time has arrived for the State to do its duty towards the poor and the weak of the community. One of the fundamental functions of Government is to keep the peace. The Government must interfere whenever necessary to prevent violence, oppression, extortion, or any other wrong sought to be inflicted upon the people. We ought to have in Australia laws regulating and governing fire, l if e , and industrial insurance; but, if we have any of consequence, I have failed to discover them. It seems These huge offices and comto me that fhey live only in the imagination, or that, if they do exist, they consist principally of statistical inventions perity for all in the Commonwealth, and honourable members w ill stand in their own light if they attempt to oppose the inquiry for which I ask. A t times it appears to me to be almost preposterous to ask the I admit that to a certain extent the inquiry w i ll involve an interference with vested interests; but no honourable member desires even to attempt to touch or interfere with legitimate, honest business. Honest business and prosperity are synonymous terms. Wherever a business is honestly conducted, wherever it is legitimate, the people engaged in it need have no fear. It is unnecessary for me to enlarge upon this subject. Honourable members are familiar with it, and I understand that the Government do not intend to oppose my motion.

The question of insurance has agitated some of the State Legislatures for a good many years, and it is quite true, as the Attorney-General says, especially in South Australia, that it is difficult to get the necessary information. I am satisfied, however, that a Committee would get information, because, as a private member, I was able to get information that ought to have been given to Parliament at any time, and yet such was the power of the companies that it was imsible for it to be given. found that it was possible to learn sufficient that the Cabinet will at once take the questo make what turned out to be an accurate guess as to what happened. ance companies in South Australia were so anxious to hide their business that their compliance with the law was practically an evasion. returns as to premiums received, and losses paid, had to be sent in to the Fire Brigades Board, they used simply to be handed to the secretary, and the members of the Board did not see them at all, because they were locked up in a drawer. of course, was that one company should not know another company's business; but we have a right to know a good deal more of insurance companies than we do at present. It is no secret that there is a solid ring controlling fire insurance-on e that has operated most injuriously for years, according to some of the leading business people of South Australia. There will be -no difficulty in getting information in regard to that matter, and I ami satisfied that if a Committee were appointed, information would be obtained that, whether complete or not, would be useful to the House and to the Government in framing legislation.

That may well be left t ill we have the conclusions of those who will have an opportunity of thoroughly examining the methods at present in force, and recommending alterations which will be satisfactory to the public.

Only in bad times can the stability of insurance companies be tested; we have had no such cataclysms as those which occurred in the United States, and good times have really preserved the solvency of many of the institutions. In other words a succession of good seasons has put a screen across most of the insurance companies, and there has been no severe test of their solvency. I make no charge of insolvency, because to do so would be unfair; but I have a strong suspicion that many of the companies are levying unfair charges on the public. have ""gone under."" funds of the poor; and it is in this regard that I desire to have information elicited. This is a very inviting subject; but, as I said before, I do not desire to make any charges. I certainly hold the view that there is not room for all the present insurance companies in a small community We all know what an abiect like that of Australia; and I am astounded that they should continue year after year to declare such enormous dividends. The honourable member for Darwin is to be conplimented on bringing this subject before us.

I was somewhat surprised at the proposal of the honourable member for Coolgardie, that we should deprive members of Parliament of the right to examine into the statements, whether true or false, that are, or may be, made against any of these companies. Under my amendment the Government would have power to appoint any honourable member as a member of the Royal Commission. honourable member desire that the majority of the members shall be actuaries or accountants ? ber has moved an amendment providing for the omission of the words "" Select Committee"" with a view to inserting words providing for the appointment of a Royal Commission consisting of persons "" with special knowledge."" I would ask the honourable member what the policy-owners in these various companies would say if we proposed that a charge against a lawyer should be investigated by a Judge and jury consisting wholly of lawyers, or that a charge against a doctor should be dealt with by a jury consisting wholly of medical men. the most lowly positions are mulcted in larger percentages than are those in the higher walks of life, and I am satisfied that they will have more confidence in a Select Committee consisting wholly of members of Parliament than they would have in an expert board. If a Select Committee is appointed, it will be able to avail itself of expert skill; it will be able ance companies incur heavy expenditure, to take upon oadi the evidence of actuaries, accountants, and others familiar with the technicalities of insurance business. Like the honourable member for Darwin, I do not intend to make an attack upon any company. names, and I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Dalley, whose views I almost wholly endorse, refer specifically to one company. I propose, however, to put before the House what was my own experience. I had taken out a policy of insurance, and being somewhat pressed for money, inquired at the office of the company how long my policy would remain in force if the premium remained unpaid. I obtained from the company a statement in writing on the subject. In the course of a few years, I mislaid that document, and subsequently received from the company a peremptory note. I may say, in passing, that it was not a mutual company in the highest sense of the term-suc h as the Australian Mutual Provident, the National Mutual Life Association, and other mutual societies, but I was determined not to Ipse my policy. Having perhaps a little more fight in me than the average man, I instructed a lawyer to take the matter in hand. I could not discover the missing letter from the company, and in the circumstances my lawyer was surprised at my action, and advised me to pay up. My reply'was: "" No ; I intend to stand on my rights."" Ultimately the letter on which I relied, but of which the company could find no record, turned up, and my legal adviser was then informed that, in the circumstances, mv policy would be continued, and I would be allowed to nay my premiums. I venture to say that had my experience been that of the average working man, or one who did not care to consult a solicitor, the policy would have been sacrificed. As it is, my lawyer's bill of costs has not yet been paid by the very wealthy company in question. Reference has been madeto the profits of these institutions, and I believe that many honourable members agree with me that it would be to the advantage of the people to establish We all know that those occupying a Government system of fire, life, and marine insurance. I have here copies of Bills dealing with the question of insurance which were passed by the Parliamenr of New Zealand as far back as 1874. One of these is out of print, but by the courtesy of the late Mr Seddon, who was my friend, I am able to produce three copies of Acts.

Sites which have received Ministerial support have loomed so largely in the public eye as equally deserving of attention j but I hope that the data which 1 propose to give, and which have been culled from official records supported by sworn evidence, will do something to affect the decision of the House.

I am prepared, however, to trust to the actual information to hand in regard to it to support my case.

173,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [4.49],"I saidration, I deny that it is the only one. I would remind those who run away with the idea that it is the sole point that we should have in view in making a selection, that there are many other considerations considerations in regard to which Lyndhurst outweighs all other sites-and that this preponderance overcomes any little deficiency that may appear to exist by comparison, and by comparison only, in respect of it . Lyndhurst has recommendations which apply equally to the adjacent towns of Bathurst, Orange, Millthorpe, and Carcoar-bu t as it is the site in the district concerning which inquiry has been made, I must pin my allegiance to it. It boasts of no less than five sources of water supplyI n the first place it has the Coombing rivulet to draw upon. am led to mention a rivulet in this connection because Canberra, as we all know, depends upon such a stream for its water supply. I believe that it was in flood when a number of honourable members inspected the site some time ago, and that consequentlv it has risen in their estimation to the distinction of a river j but in its normal condition it is only a rivulet. The Coombing is only 9 miles from the site. Then we have Flyer's Creek, 15I miles away, Cadiangullong, 18 miles distant, Brown's Creek, Laehlan, 22 miles away. latter be obtained by means of a pumping scheme, but from the other four sources, water could be supplied by gravitation to the site selected by the Commission. The fact that that site is 2,280 feet above sea. level, should be a guarantee of the purity of these streams at this point. In such high country, they must be tapped practically at their source, and a large expenditure would not be necessary to enable Lyndhurst to draw its water supply from them. From one of these sources alone could be obtained a supply sufficient, to satisfy the requirements bf the Capital for the first few decades of its existence. If the Laehlan were drawn upon, the scheme would involve 1,400 feet of pumping. That, however, should not put it beyond the pale, because I understand that other sites which are favoured by some honourable members, would depend upon similar schemes to place their water resources in an indisputable position. would also remind honourable members that at the present time, a very large scheme to eonstruct a dam at Wyangalaa very little distance from Lyndhurst-is under consideration. A surveyor is now at work there, and the project is likely to reach maturity. Its magnitude is such that it would bear comparison with the great Barren Jack scheme, the largest undertaking of the kind in Australia. The Barren Jack reservoir is capable of damming back as much water as is contained in Sydney harbour, ancl, although the Wyangala scheme would entail pumping, it would place the Federal Capital at Lyndhurst beyond the possibility of an inadequate water supply. The point at which the Wyangala supply would be tapped is 20 miles from the suggested site, but pumping would be entailed. The official reports show that the minimum supply that would be obtained from all four gravitation I schemes, would be sufficient for a population of 89,000, and that; with the Laehlan pumping scheme there could be obtained a supply sufficient to meet the needs of a city with a population of 292,000. This estimate does not allow for the Wyangala darn, since that scheme was conceived after Mr Oliver took evidence on the subject. Mr Wade, the Engineer-in-Chief of Water Supply in New South Wales, in discussing the water possibilities of Lyndhurst, makes _ this comparison12 miles distant, and the The daily consumption of water by Sydney, From the with its population of about half-a-million souls, an inexhaustible * supply may is about 20,000,000 gallons. Mr Wade estimates the storage capacity for Lyndhurst at equal to 135,000,000 gallons per day, which, as shown by the quantity consumed in Sydney, would be equal to the requirements of ""acity containing a population of several millions. As the requirements, with the Federal Capital at Lyndhurst, would only be 9,000,000 gallons per day, there would be close on 130,000,000 gallons per day available for irrigation and other purposes. In this connection of water supply notice the contrast between Dalgetv and Lyndhurst in regard to the rainfall. The"" mean annual rainfall at the Lyndhurst site for the 21 years ending 1902 was 29.54 in., distributed over 87 mean annual rainy days, whilst the mean annual rainfall at the Dalgety site for the 15 years ending 1902 was only 26.37 i m distributed over 80 mean annual rainy days. These facts should satisfy honourable members that Lyndhurst is capable of meeting all the exactions in the matter of a water supply that are likely to be placed upon it. Eveni f it involved the expenditure of a few thousand pounds more or less upon I a water supply, that should not deter us. . from selecting Lyndhurst as the site of the Capital, having regard to the many otherconsiderations in its favour. CommissionerOliver-and I quote the separate authorities on the question of water stuSpIy^ because they express somewhat divergent views, but of the two we must favour the allowing for run off and evaporation, would provide 12,500,000 gallons daily. Sydney with its population of half-a-million persons consumes 20,000,000 gallons daily, and therefore we can fairly allow that Lyndhurst could sustain a quarter of a million people with its water.supply from gravitation schemes only; because this estimate, which is a moderate one, and lower than that which Mr Wade's would pan out at, allows for a supply of 12,500,000 gallons daily. Of course, one cannot question the Dalgety water supply; it stands supreme, and therefore I do not propose to say more in that regard, than that the water is very cold; but that I presume is a detail. In ""their report of 1903, the Commissioners state that a scheme for 50,000 persons at Dalgety would cost £328,000 approximately/ whilst at Lyndhurst it would cost £427,460 approximately to supply the same number of persons with water. Now, considering all the wonderful facilities there are at Dalgety for a water supply, and that we could get an adequate supply for the same number of persons at Lyndhurst by an additional expenditure of a little more than £100,000, that is, in my opinion, a very good argument indeed in support of the latter site. circumstances, and seeing that when such a large issue is at stake we cannot be narrowed down to one consideration, the argument which, it is said, should place Lyndhurst beyond the pale goes to pieces. The deficiency at Lyndhurst in regard to water supply is more than set off by the many minor deficiencies at Dalgety, which in the total sum amount to a very great deficiency. The Lyndhurst site is well equipped in every other regard, while in most other considerations the Dalgety site is deficient. I contend that the former is far superior to the latter, as I shall endeavour to prove -from the data I have at hand. We are told that the Snowy River has electrical possibilities. WhilstI do not despise electrical possibilities, still I have reliable authority for stating that coal is more economical' than water for the production of electrical power, even when the latter is present in abundance. wav. may be an expert authority on such matters f am not-bu t Mr J. Haydon Cardew, M.I.C.E., quoted Mr Thomas Rooke to that effect in his paper read last year before the engineering section of the. 'Royal Society of New South Wales. to a place like Dalgety, to which the coal would have to be carried. statement to mean that if we have water in abundance at one place, and coal in abundance at another place, it is cheaper to produce electricity at the latter than at the former. That is a fair way of reading the statement.; and, coming as it does from a very reliable source, I consider that it is preferable to the ipse dixit of the honourable member for Bass. In addition to that, the water power, which, of course, does exist at Dalgety, is regarded by the New South Wales authorities as a State asset. I make bold to say that, even if this House should select Dalgety, we shall again be faced with the difficulty of getting the selection endorsed by the New South Wales Government. difficulty than that, and that is the difficulty with the members of this House. with the members of this House will be the first stumbling-block. At Lyndhurst we have a coal supply only 95 miles away. Under such That distance, of course, is a detail compared with the fact that the nearest coalfield to Cooma is 170 miles away'. I contend that the coal supply is sufficiently adjacent to Lyndhurst to justify the contention that electrical power could be developed there by the coal which is accessible at a cheaper rate than, or at an equally cheap rate as, it could be generated by water at Dalgety. The cost of coal delivered at Lyndhurst is 15s. per ton. chances a.re that, with the greater demand, the price of coal would be reduced, because the fields on the Blue Mountains are hardly tapped yet. honourable member has overstated the price. figures. I do not pin my faith entirely to official figures, but we have to be guided by them, and I quote them for the other place. As they were taken at about the same time, I expect that anv excess will bear the same proportion in each case.",28,Philip To Completely Overshadow Others That Are

At Dalgety there is no alternative, and we know that the rigour of its climate demands that we must haive warmth. So that, apart from the generation of electricity for any manufacturing industries which may be developed, there is the fact that for ordinary everyday purposes coal will have to be taken to Dalgety. In a cold country that is a vital point, and one which I desire to emphasize. Honourable members will have to view this question from a very matter-of-fact stand-point when they are cooling their heels at the foot of the Snowy Mountains, possibly waiting for the delivery of coal, and having no means by which they could facilitate its delivery. In addition to the authority I have quoted in regard to water supply, Mr Blomfield, Resident Engineer of the Department of Public Works of New South Wales, reported in 1900 that, as regards the Carcoar-Garlanc1 site-that is, the Lyndhurst site-ther e was no difficulty about supplying water foi a large population. I just add that, because in New South Wales his opinion is regarded as eminently reliable. I suppose that we must take the Canberra site very seriously. It appears to command a sort of semi-Ministerial support, and, therefore, it has been made to loom very large in the public eye, and the rivulets that we have heard so much about call for a little investigation. Tn his report, the honourable member for Swan said he believed that there need be no anxiety as to the sufficiencv, although there was not a splendid supply of water at Canberra, referring, presumably, to the Cotter and the Gudgenby, two small streams. Mr no guarantee that the Parliament will not Weedon, another authority, says that the Cotbe sitting at some time during winter |pr scheme would involve 24 miles of pipe line, and the Gudgenby scheme 25 miles of pipe line, before any reticulation could take place, and further, that 225 square miles of catchment area would be wanted for those two streams. That is a very large consideration. There we have two little streams, ancl naturally they Avantn wider area in order to insure the purity of the supply. As the possibility of our acquiring control over 225 square miles of country is rather remote, the possibilities of the Canberra water supply are much inferior to those of any other site, so far as I can gather. If any site should be placed outside the pale on account of deficiency in that regard, it is Canberra, and certainly not Lyndhurst, where we have not only the water supply, but the rainfall, which permits the water supply beingsupthe Premier of New South Wales, I believe-say s that the Gudgenby scheme presents none of the advantages shown by the Cotter scheme, and he suggests recourse to the Barren Jack, which is 36 miles off, as a source of electrical power. That is a far-away cry. they are having very great trouble now, and knocking off the men. about that. I am not quoting Barren Jack in support of Canberra, but merely to show how far away are the possibilities of a water supply for Canberra. Thirty-six miles off, Mr Wade says, there are possibilities of getting sufficient water power for electrical purposes. The Lyndhurst site has a scheme only 20 miles away, which is equal to Barren Jack, and that is the Wyangala scheme. It is not quite so far advanced as is the Barren Jack scheme, but is more than in the air, ancl therefore I feel quite justified in quoting it as a possible source of supply in the future. The soil of the Canberra district is inferior, whilst the rainfall is only 15 inches as against 30 inches at Lyndhurst, and 36 inches at Orange, with an average of 23 or 24 inches. I therefore contend that Canberra is not in it in regard to either water supply or rainfall. We cannot ignore the importance of the climatic conditions of the site selected, and on that account I could wish that the members of the Federal Parliament had been given an opportunitv to visit the most southerly site at midwinter, or during the winter, because we can have months. We cannot presume that the Federal Parliament will be sitting only in the summer months, when the district around Dalgety becomes a tourists' resort. that it is proposed to make a number of people live there all the vear round.",30,Philip To Completely Overshadow Others That Are

The records of winter temperature at Dalgety are such as to make it very questionable whether, as a matter of life and death, we should take the risk of moving to such a place to transact the legislative business of the Commonwealth. that Australia for the most part is a semitropical country, and we have some honourable members in this Parliament who come from districts which may be regarded as being in the tropics. opinion, unreasonable to ask them to go to a place with a climate resembling that of the South Pole to legislate. It is not calculated to give the best results in Federal legislation, or to attract desirable men to Federal politics, that members returned to this Parliament should be penalized by being asked to go to a place like Dalgety. I contend that we shall take our lives in our hands in undertaking to settle in such a place. I know something of a cold climate, but, when it comes to living in a place where it is io or 20 degrees colder than the place in which I have been accustomed to live, I think it is time to object. people, and it cannot be expected of them that they will do their best work in Arctic regions.'

There is not soil enough there to grow a sapling. an official report, for which the Commonwealth paid dearly. I do not expect that the Minister of Trade and Customs will quote these extracts from the report, and; I have therefore taken the trouble to cull them so that honourable members may not. be misled by a one-sided representation of the case. The report from which I quotefurther statesThe site is somewhat exposed. The Commissioner who wrote this report was a genial man and a gentleman, and heput it very nicely. When he says that the site is somewhat exposed, we shall be justified in assuming that it is so very It should not be forgotten much exposed as to be bleak. We have been informed that the site is really somuch exposed that, at any time, one is bell, Director of Agriculture in New South It is,, in my Wales, found thatThe Bathurst, Orange, and Lyndhurst sitesoverlapped, making it difficult' to outline the advantages of one of these sites over the others, but he said that probably it-was the most genial and reliable climate for vegetation and stockthe best climate and soil for the varied products for the requirements of a large population. With respect to rainfall, I find that the annual rainfall in Dalgety is 26.37 inches, over eighty mean annual rainy days. I take this from an unofficial report. W'e have been told that the data supplied with regard to climatic conditions are unofficial, and we are justified in assuming that they are, therefore, largely tinged with local bias. If a district has the reputation of Australians are a warm-blooded being somewhat cold, the tendency of local bias in the compilation of records of temperature is to add a few degrees to the records. In the same way, where the rainfall is somewhat scanty, the local manwould think nothing of adding an inch or two to the annual record of rainfall, or of regarding a year in which there has been a heavy rainfall as an average year. I allow for this kind of thing, and honourable members will take unofficial records with a grain of salt. I have said that the mean annual rainfall at Dalgety is said to be 26.37 inches for a mean of eighty rainy days annually. This is the It is record over fifteen years'. The official record for Lyndhurst is a rainfall of rainy days annually, over a period of twenty-one years.

The temperature at Dalgety is given as unofficial. It is stated that during the summer months it ranges from 70 to 80 degrees, and there is a tardy admission that on rare occasions it reaches 104 degrees. The winter readings are as low as 26 and 30 degrees, and -one reading of 11 degrees is admitted. Nothing more is said on the subject. As unofficial records, these may be assumed to be affected by local bias, that ttie best face may be put upon the facts when submitted to the public. ject, I may quote from the report of the Commonwealth with respect to the climate at Dalgety.

That place is only 7 miles distant, and is 83 feet higher than is the proposed site at Lyndhurst. There the highest reading within 16 years was 98.4, and the lowest 1.5.4. The highest reading at Dalgety was 104 degrees, and the lowest n degrees. which has not been stated by the Minister of Trade and Customs. It is admitted that at Dalgety the thermometer has recorded 104 degrees during summer, whereas the highest reading at Lyndhurst during While on this subsixteen years is only 98.4.

The mean temperature at Lyndhurst during the four hottest months of the sixteen years to which I have alluded was 78 degrees, whilst for JOHN FORREST -We have no rethe four coldest months it was'35.2 degrees. That is a very modest record. We cannot find any other place in Australia which boasts such an equable temperature, and, therefore, one which is so suited to the varied experiences of those who will have to reside there during the greater part of tal at Dalgety, where the temperature ranges from 11 degrees in winter to 104 degrees in summer, we should be practically inviting legislators to tlieir doom.

The idea is that it is rather a beautiful place-that the country is nicely undulating. dulating, but there is too little known about it to enable me to pronounce a definite opinion upon it. Very little significance can be attached to a casual visit to any site. For instance, one might strike the Cotter River when it was in flood and come away under the impression that he had seen a noble river, or he might visit Dalgety when the glass registered 90 degrees and consequently be induced to believe that it possessed a lovely climate. On the other hand, he might visit the latter place when a blizzard was blowing, and leave it under the impression that a blizzard was always blowing there. Any casual inspection to be of value must be supplemented by considerable data. From the standpoint of productiveness, Lyndhurst can safely challenge all other sites. HereI might pause to inquire whether productiveness is not one of the first essentials of a Federal territory? We have heard a lot of sceptical talk about the means of transit being sufficient to render unnecessary special attention being given to productiveness. But in selecting the Federal Capital we must prepare for all contingencies which we know have beset similar cities in the past. It is more than likely that oui permanent Seat of Government may have to withstand a siege. In any case no harm can result from locating it close to our food supplies. That desideratum can be secured by the selection of Lyndhurst. I hold in my hand a comparative statement of the production for the year ended 31st March, 1904, within a radius of seven miles of four suggested sites, namely, Lyndhurst, Dalgety, Tumut, and Yass. From this table I learn that during the year in question Dalgety produced 5,943 bushels of wheat, 427 bushels of barley, 1,905 bushels of oats, 2,695 tons of hay, and 377 tons of potatoes. Lyndhurst during the same period produced .1,239,903 bushels of whea|t, 71,275 bushels of maize, 2,786 bushels of barley, 190,683 bushels of oats, 26,410 tons of hay, and 12,318 tons of potatoes. 195,393 bushels of wheat, 232,362 bushels of maize, 659 bushels of barley, 14,268 bushels of oafs, 5,528 tons of hay, and 503 tons of potatoes. As I am given to understand that Yass is not in the running, I shall not quote the statistics relating to it. Lyndhurst is a leading producing centre of these staple products. This claim is amply demonstrated by the fact that little railway stations, such as Millthorpe and Carcoar, show far larger returns than do other larger places. In other words, when one is at Lyndhurst, he is at the very source of our food supplies. The country there is closely settled, and its products always command the highest price in the Sydney market. Its volume of trade is simply enormous. No valid argument can be urged against a site which can boast of such possibilities. From the stand-point of fruit culture, its potentialities are simply limitless. The land is specially adapted to the cultivation of fruit. Around Bathurst and Orange, fruit culture is being actively carried on, and experimental farms have justified the farmers there in considerably extending their operations. The fruit commands the highest prices, not only in the Sydney, but in the London market. From the stand-point of food supplies, therefore, this locality stands pre-eminent. These areas are practically regarded as the granary of New South Wales, and certainlv as the source of its fruit supplies, Sydney waiting every year for the early fruits from the high lands around Orange and Bathurst. As an example of what may be done there, I may mention that the average return for 1,000 acres within a radius of 30 miles of Lyndhurst, is estimated at ,£5 2s. per acre. That circumstance indicates that the residents of this locality are in an affluent position. But it has still deeper significance. It proves that if the country isutilized for a Federal Capital, the Commonwealth will get a splendid bargain. A l though the cost of resumption might be greater than it would be elsewhere, that fact should not weigh with honourable members if they are satisfied that the Federation would be obtaining a better bargain. It would be preferable to pay £10,000,000 for the purchase of land upon which wecould .obtain an adequate interest immediately than to spend £2,000,000 upon the resumption of land at a place like Dalgety, where we could not secure any interest whatever upon the outlay. At Dalgety, it Similarly, Tumut produced is too cold to grow maize, and it is ad'mitted that dairying cannot be carried on tliere in the winter. The local witnesses would not admit that within a radius of 50 miles of Dalgety, sufficient food could""",33,Chapman Bu T The Refer The Year I N Fixing The Federal Capi
213,Mr Reid,Has the honourable member,34,Chapman Bu T The Refer The Year I N Fixing The Federal Capi
214,Mr Carr,"It may be beautifully unbe grown for the requirements of 50,000 people. I am prepared to say that within a radius of 10 miles of Lyndhurst, sufficient food can easily be produced for a population of that number. In view of the fact that we are about to select a Federal Capital for all time, and of the contingencies which must sooner or later beset it, I ask whether it is not wise for us to see that our food supplies are light at hand? For this reason, I contend that we ought to select a capital away from the coast. There is nothing to hinder the Commonwealth from owning a port, but that matter ought to be considered quite apart from the question of the establishment of the permanent Seat of Government. A highway from the Capital to a port for. us will also mean a highway from a port to the Capital for an enemy. That is an undesirable state of affairs. Al l principles of strategy and military precedent point to the necessity of entrenching the Capital in such a way as to make it as inaccessible as possible to an enemy. On those grounds there is every justification for selecting the Capital on the other side of the Blue Mountains. There are other sites which would do as well from that point of view, but Lyndhurst is one that has been reported upon as being admirably situated in regard to its strategical position, as well as in regard to food supplies. If due weight is given to these considerations there can be no valid argument against the selection of that site. In regard to building material, the official reports do not disclose very much difference between the sites in question. course, we do not live upon stone, and the food supply question is much more important than that affecting building material. Still, it is as well to point out that there is ample building material available to meet all requirements in and about the suggested area. Not very far away we have the Molong and Borenore marble quarries, which have supplied marble for some of our best works, including the hall of the new Sydney railway station. This marble could be' used for the Federal Capital buildings. stone is available in limitless quantities. In that respect there can be no gainsaying the possibilities of Lyndhurst. As to fuel, the same arguments as are used in regard to coal for electrical purposes will apply. A good supply of wood is available at Lyndhurst, but is not available at Dalgety-thoug h that, I suppose, need not enter largely into the question, seeing that coal is now regarded as the main essential. As to timber for building purposes, Lyndhurst is very favourably situated. It is not far awav from an abundant supply of cypress pine. It is generally known, I think, that that is the only class of timber that will withstand the ravages of white ants. No matter how hard may be the wood from other parts of Australia, white ants will attack it j but cypress pine is absolutely immune from them. There are also available black butt, tallow wood, peppermint, and turpentine, forests of which are found witihin 20 miles of Bathurst, and that means that they are not very far from Lyndhurst. Any amount of hard wood of the nature of cypress pine can be obtained at Lyndhurst from 7s. 6d. per 100 feet. To obtain cypress pine at Dalgety would, I suppose, involve a much larger costprobably up to £ 1 per 100 feet. In regard to accessibility-anothe r of the main considerations, so far as Australia is concernedI said just now that we want a site that could be made as inaccessible as possible when necessary. But that is only so when there is danger of invasion. It would be inadvisable, however, to ihave a site that could be cut off. So far as internal accessibility is concerned, we. want a site that will be easily reached from other parts of Australia. I contend that Lyndhurst in that respect is the best site that has been suggested. Assuming that access by railway is provided ere long, and that such lines as that from Dalgety to Bairnsdale and that But, of from Wellington to Werris Creek are built, according to whichever site is selected, the following figures show pretty clearly the respective distances of Lyndhurst, Dalgety, and Canberra from the capitals of the States of Australia. Assuming the construction of the lines of railway I have mentioned, the distance from Lyndhurst to Sydney would be 191 miles; from Dalgety to Sydney, 296 miles; Canberra to Sydney, 204 miles. The distance from Lyndhurst toMelbourne would be 443 miles; Dalgety to Melbourne, 355 Ordinary building miles; Canberra to Melbourne, 431 miles. The distance from Lyndhurst to Brisbane would be 654 miles; Dalgety to Brisbane, 950 miles; Canberra to Brisbane, 929 miles. The 'distance from Lyndhurst toAdelaide would be 749 miles; Dalgety to Adelaide, 835 miles; Canberra to Adelaide, 914 miles. The distance from Lyndhurst to Perth would be 2,317 miles; Dalgety to Perth, 2,492 miles; Canberra to Perth, 2,449 miles. The distance from Lyndhurst to Hobart would be 902 miles; Dalgety to Hobart, 1,064 miles; Canberra to Hobart, 912 miles. The average mileage to all the capitals would be, from Lyndhurst 876 miles, Dalgety 998 miles, and from Canberra 981 miles. considerable advantage in favour of Lyndhurst in respect of the mean average distance. The advantage amounts to about 100 miles in the case of each capital, and that I maintain is a large saving, which should be considered by the representatives of the respective States. I also have some figures before me which show that' Lyndhurst as compared with Dalgety is nearer to Sydney by 105 miles, to Brisbane by 296 miles, to Adelaide by 86 miles, to Perth by 17,2 miles, and to Hobart by 162 miles. Lyndhurst is further from Melbourne, but I consider that, in view of the advantageous position which Melbourne has been occupying for so long, no rational objection can be taken on that ground. striking -feature of these figures is 'the aggregate distances between Lyndhurst and Dalgety and the six State capitals, Dalgety being 734 miles further away than Lyndhurst. Leaving Hobart out of the calculation, because of the sea journey, the figures show that if Dalgety were finally selected as the Capital, 572 more miles of railway would have to be kept up to express traffic standard than if Lyndhurst were chosen. tion. connecting the site with existing lines, estimated at upwards of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in the case of Dalgety, the expenditure in the case of Lyndhurst would be £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 , that place being already on a railway line. The fact that an expenditure of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 would be involved immediately in bringing Dalgety into touch with our existing railway systems, whereas only £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 would be required to bring Lyndhurst at least in reach of all'the capitals, has to be considered in conjunction with the facts that in Lyndhurst we have a site that is thoroughly equipped in every respect in regard to climate, arability and other requirements, whereas Dalgety has nothing to recommend it apart from its beauty and its altitude. I urge that it would be most unbusinesslike to choose a site involving an expenditure by the Commonwealth of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 on railway connection, in return for which we should obtain a site possessed of nothing beyond altitude ancl picturesqueness. the case of Lyndhurst we should obtain Mr Carr. an adequate return for our money immediately. Further than that, the trend of population is undoubtedly northward. That has been shown by several honourable members whe have preceded me. Seeing that it is impossible to go as far north as ArmidaleThose figures show a so far as I can gauge the opinion of the House-the next best thing that we can do is to obtain a site that is reasonably near the part of Australia to which population is trending, and which will be more and more the centre of gravity in regard to population. So much can be said of Lyndhurst, whilst it cannot be said of either Canberra or Dalgety. tically the centre of population. Mir. CARR It is not quite the centre yet, but it will be the centre in a few years to come. The fact that there is not a railway to Dalgety shows that the district is not a productive one, and this was emThe phasized by Sir Hector Carruthers when he wroteThe most ardent advocate of Dalgety would not claim that it can be regarded as a district that wil l be capable of the production of food supplies to any serious extent. According to a writer in tlie Sydney pressDalgety is, however, cut off by mountain ranges on the west and south from the possibility of any but a most restricted system of That is an important considerarailway communication-by the Cooma line with In addition to the immense cost of Sydney, and by a line from Dalgety to Bairnsdale,. en route to Melbourne, at an immense cost. The only advantage would be to Victoria. The disadvantage would rest with the four other States-the e of them the most progressive in the Federation. Seeing that the trend of population is northwards it would be ridiculous to place the Federal Capital in the south-eastern corner of the continent. The fact that Dalgety will in the future be remote from the centre of population should, apart from all other considerations debar it, and the objection that it would be a coastal Capital puts it entirely beyond the pale. The weakness of the contention that its nearness to Twofold Bay is an advantage has been made plain by previous speakers; but I would again lay stress on the fact that to make that port equal to the demands of shipping generally it would be necessary to construct a very expensive breakwater, and, as that portion of the coast is most exposed, the In taxpayers would have to provide for frequent and costly repairs. There is no reason why the Commonwealth Government",34,Chapman Bu T The Refer The Year I N Fixing The Federal Capi

Connecting lines from Wellington to Werris Creek (New South Wales), and from Warwick to Brisbane (Queensland), give a nearly straight line between Lyndhurst and Brisbane. hurst to Perth (Western Australia), includes the extension from Cobar to BrokenH ill , vid Wileannia, then lo Port Augusta and vid the trans-Australian line, an almost direct route to Perth; but this distance could be shortened by upwards of 30 miles at least, by a line 'from Condobolin to BrokenH ill , vid Menindie. It must be remembered that the tralian line is one that must be built for defence purposes, if for no other. That was a weighty argument at the time in favour of Federation. The distance from Lyndhurst to Adelaide appears to be fairly direct with the connecting line from Hay to Morgan, vid Wentworth. The present estimated distance, however, will certainly be decreased, as, for instance, by the proposed line from Temora to Barellan, and carried thence to the Hay line, all through fine country; and possibly a branch from the Temora line to a point on the Blayney-Harden railway. The ramifications of the railways on the line commanded by such a position as Lyndhurst are capable of immensely wide expansion, with the probability of access from the north-eastern .districts of Victoria, and the south-eastern parts of South Australia. Lyndhurst is now. the centre of a very comprehensive railway system, and will inevitably have its communications with distant parts of the Commonwealth greatly increased in the near future. Lines intended to open up the far inferior will of necessity be connected with that now in touch with Lyndhurst. In short, every facility will be available for getting to what must be the Mecca of Australia, if the Capital is placed there. Dalgety, on the other hand, is out of the way, and will not have the advantage of the network of communication which will join Lyndhurst with the capitals of the States and other parts of the Commonwealth. The ordinary development of the country will cause a vast improvement in the already extensive railway communication of Lyndhurst, and the selection of that site for the Capital site will be more and more justified as the years,go on, whereas, if Dalgety is chosen, there will be but an accumulation of regrets. To connect Dalgety with other places by rail, it will be necessary to continue the present railway from Cooma, at a cost of As to the relative accessibility by £ 1 4 2 , 0 0 0 , whereas Lyndhurst is already on a main line. According to official figures, railways to link up Dalgety with other parts of the Commonwealth, would cost £ 8 , 3 4 1 , 6 8 3 , and similar railways in respect of Lyndhurst £ 8 , 4 3 3 , 5 9 7 ; but, whereas the improved railway communication of Lyndhurst will be of material benefit to the State, because the trade of Australia must pass its doors, the railways built to Dalgety will be useful for no other From Lyndpurpose than to enable persons to travel to and from the Capital. communication given to Lyndhurst will be due to State expenditure. ject in making railways from Dalgety, because there will be no traffic to gain thereby. w ork of connecting Lyndhurst would, inr the natural course of things, be done inany case, whereas the expenditure that would be entailed in linking up Dalgety to make it reasonably accessible would amount to nearly as much, and there would be no other object in spending that monev than to bring there those who would have to go there. There would be no return from it as the years went on. It would be a burden to usa capital expenditure the interest upon which would stare us in theface year after year. In the case of Lyndhurst, however, the expenditure must be incurred anyhow, will be amply justified, and will engender no vain regrets. If ' there is one thing that we need to avoid in selecting a Capital it is the vain regret for which there is no redress. The cost of resumption for a city site and catchment, area for 50,000 people at Dalgety is estimated at £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 . A t Lyndhurst it is estimated at .£180,000. That is just thedifference between buying a good thing and buying a bad thing.' It does not matter how little the bad thing costs, if it is not going to give any return, you are betterwithout it, but if you can see returns immediately ahead, it will pay better to giveeven £10,000,000 for a good thing than .£50,000 for something that will not only give no return, but on which you will have to spend money perpetually' to make it worth having at all. That is the differencebetween the sites so far as I can assess it.",36,Chapman Bu T The Refer The Year I N Fixing The Federal Capi

218,Mr Carr,"Yes. A good deal of theAnother factor which has not been touched upon is the question of liability to earthquake shocks. ' The Rev. W. B. Clarke, who has made a special study of seismic disturbances, has compiled a record of from 200 to 300 shocks experienced in New South Wales. Most of them have been felt between Goulburn on the one hand and Albury on the other. Lyndhurstis without any record against it. Bathurst has had two shocks, one in 1872 and another in 1886. Goulburn has had ten since 1871; Yass, three since 1871; Lake George, three since 1886; Queanbeyan, seven since 1871; and Braidwood, five since 1871. At Dalgety there have been five within comparatively recent years. An earthquake shock may 'not result in the death of anybody, but in view of the great expenditure tliat is bound to be entailed in ornamental buildings at the' Federal Capital, of which, of course, we expect to be very proud, and which will be the cynosure of all tourists' eyes, an earthquake shock there might do a million pounds' worth of damage in a single night. That is a thing to be guarded against, or at least taken into consideration in selecting a site. At places within the area determined on by the Commonwealth Parliament in selecting Dalgety there have been earthquake shocks as follow :-A t Boloco, one on 27th May, 1894, and another on 25th February, 1897 ; at Bobundara, one on 25th February, 1897 ; two on 27 th March, 1901-if there had been expensive buildings there then, irreparable damage would probably have been -done to them-and another on 22nd April, 1901. That makes a total of five shocks in the Dalgety area within comparatively recent years. ' We cannot say how many more there will be, but the fact that there have already been more 'there than anywhere else in New South Wales in the time, is a distinct mark against the selection of Dalgety as the Federal Capital. I leave the matter in the hands of the House with every confidence, that, if a. dispassionate view is taken of'the data available, Lyndhurst or some similarly situated site will be found to best meet all requirements. I admit that it is not pre-eminent in the matter of water supply, but that is not everything. Its abundant sources of food supply and security are quite as valuable as is'a surplus water supply, which seems to be the objective of those who seek to fix the Federal Capital at Dalgety. .Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. Mr Carr. should have offered an apology, at this stage of the debate, for attempting to occupy the time of the House, if it were not for the very important nature of the proposal' we have to consider. We have been told that we are to look at this question from' a national point of view; and I fear very much that there are other than national interests creeping in which mayresult in our selecting a spot to the detriment of Australia for all time. I feel that I should be recreant to the trust placed in me if now, or at some time during the debate, I did not raise my voice in protest against the action of some honourable members in favoring a site which I believe cannot be to the best interests of the Commonwealth. The honourable gentleman who leads the Government is held up to us as one of our great Australians; and there are some measures on the statute-book, not only of the Commonwealth but of Victoria, in which he takes pride; but I fear that if the Bill we have now before us becomes law, and the site proposed is made the Capital, he will have done much that will militate against the good he has accomplished in the past. I am afraid that if that site be selected the name of the future capital city of Australia will be known as "" Deakin's Folly."" Folly""? is the nominal head of the Commonwealth, and has to bear the responsibility of this Bill, although we know that the Cabinet is not at one on the question. The Minister of Trade and Customs, in spite of his pleading that we should treat this as a national question, is continually dragging in parochial interests, and lowering the debate to the level of a mere squabble between electorates. I desire to take exception to the manner in which the attitude of Mr Wade, the Premier of New South Wales, has been regarded by honourable members of this House. Apart from the correspondence between himself and the Prime Minister-in which Mr Wade represents, and is bound to represent, the State view-the action of that gentleman has been in all things careful, and has shown an earnest desire not to dictate to this Parliament. Only yesterday he answered a question asked in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales as follows :In the Legislative Assembly to-night Mr Morton asked the Premier whether he was aware",37,Chapman Bu T The Refer The Year I N Fixing The Federal Capi

221,Mr Bowden,"Becaus e Mr Deakinin regard to the Federal capital question that if Canberra were selected the Federal Government would necessarily require a seaport, and if with a view to inducing the Government to accept Canberra he would bring before it the claims of Jervis Bay as a seaport, and would offer a strip of land from Jervis Bay to Canberra to provide communication. Mr Wade, in reply, said there was no doubt whatever regarding tlie admirable facilities offered by Jervis Bay as a port. As for the suggestion that the Government should offer access to the sea for the purpose of inducing the Commonwealth to select Canberra, such a course would be unwise and impolitic. The Commonwealth was in this sense master of its own business, and if it had any request to make to the State it would be received in a reasonable as the memorandum of the Premiers spirit, with a keen desire to arrive at finality and compromise. That is the attitude which Mr Wade has assumed all through; and the expressions used by the honourable member for Hindmarsh are not at all warranted by the facts. The honourable member for Wimmera specially urged the New South Wales members not to be governed by parochial views, but his view is that the Capital site should be selected somewhere on the border-land of that State and Victoria. The honourable member endeavoured to show that the selection of such a site would be to the best interests of the Commbnwealth; but when . he was directly asked whether,' in the event of Dalgety being accepted, he would be willing to proceed at once with the erection of a bush capital, he could only say that after a reasonable period-whateve r that may meanhe would be willing to commence building operations. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, in a very able address, discussed the legal and constitutional view; but I do not think that the legal view is disputed. one admits that if we take merely the letter of the Constitution, the arrangement with the Premiers cannot be relied upon. It is admitted that any document which led to the passing of the Constitution-an y document other than the Constitution Act itself-woul d be blocked as evidence in a law Court. I think, however, that New South Wales is entitled to ask that something more than a mere legal view should be taken of the question. Continually Parliament is applied to in private interests, as an ultimate court of appeal against legal decisions which work injury and hardship. It is the right of any member of the community to petition the Housei f he thinks he has a grievance ; and such petitions are dealt with in a spirit of justice and equity, without regard to strict legal technicalities. If that be so in the case of individuals, why should it not hold good in the case of a State? When a State is applying for justice to this Parliament, are we to take into consideration only such matters as might be regarded as evidence in a Court of law? Are we not to have regard to any facts that will enable us to arrive at an equitable decision? It is true that the Constitution says the Federal Parliament is to be situated in New South Wales, beyond the limit of 100 miles from Sydney; but it is equally true, shows, that that decision was arrived at with a view to placing the Capital within a reasonable distance of that city. The Premiers were the agents of their respective States, and that memorandum, which was published throughout the length and breadth of Australia, ought to be taken into consideration as showing their intentions. ' The honourable member for Gippsland the other day interjected that this memorandum was not known to the different States; but even if that were so, it would not alter the fact that the arrangement was known in New South Wales; and the agreement ought to be adhered to. I contend, however, that that memorandum was made known to all the States, though I was challenged by the honourable member for Gippsiand when I previously made a statement to that effect. The memorandum was published in the newspapers of all the States of the Commonwealth; and, as showing the attitude of the States at the time, I quote the following from a leading article in the Melbourne Argus of 31st January, 1899Every There is not the slightest hope of Queensland entering into the Federation without New South Wales, and it is admitted it would be useless the other Colonies uniting without them. This feeling, which is being displayed in the deliberations of the Premiers, must have a marked effect upon the decisions of the Conference. It was because the States recognised the necessity of having New South Wales and Queensland in the Federation that it was deemed advisable to make concessions to New South Wales after the Constitution Bill had not been carried by a sufficient majority in that State. was carried by the majority originally agreed upon. first instance, the Bill was not carried by a sufficient majority to make it law.",38,Chapman Bu T The Refer The Year I N Fixing The Federal Capi
222,Mr Chanter,The Constitution Bill,39,Chapman Bu T The Refer The Year I N Fixing The Federal Capi
223,Mr Bowden,"I say that, in thein spirit by New South Wales. I am called upon to defend the attitude of New South Wales on that occasion. There was a feeling amongst some that it would have been fairer to put the question to a straight-out vote; and there has been no reason to alter that opinion since. However, the Constitution Bill was not carried by a. sufficient majority to make it law in New South Wales; and, under the circumstances-in order to make concessions to the anti-federalists anti-Billites. make concessions to that large majority of the people, the Premiers met, and made the arrangement to whicb I have referred. In the Melbourne Age of 3rd February, 1899, and also in the newspapers of New South Wales and South Australia, the terms of the memorandum were published, and on the following day the Age, in its leading article, used these wordsFor one o[ the improvements in the Bill the Age is entitled to take some credit; for if Mr Reid had insisted upon Sydney being nominated by the Federal Parliament 'for the Federal Capital, as his New South Wales friends urged him to do, Victoria would never have consented to federate on such terms. The suggestion that we threw out on Monday last, namely, that it should be expressly provided that in whatever Colony the Federal Capital should be situated it should not be the capital of the State itself, has been happily adopted by the Premiers; and in doing so they have not only removed a fatal source of friction, but they have been able to advance the cause of Federation by. conciliating the anti-federationists in New South Wales. The Argus of 3rd February, 1899, published the memorandum before mentioned, containing the clause about which we have had so much discussion(c) The Capital of the Commonwealth. It is -considered that the fixing of the Capital is a question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide, but in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales the Premiers have modified the clause, so that while the Capital cannot be fixed in Sydney provision is made in the Constitution for ' i ts establishment in New South sion, that Melbourne was jealous of Sydney, so Wales within a reasonable distance of that city. In a leading article of the same date, it -statedThe settlement of the Capital is a question which will attract most popular interest. New South Wales obtains the Capital, but it must not be within a hundred miles of Sydney. We do not think it would be at all fair to ask Victorians to vote for Sydney as the Capital, because the arrangement would be so manifestly unfair, but any proposal which excludes Sydney as well as Melbourne would be acceptable here. On the following day an Argus reporter had an interview with Mr now Sir Edmund, Barton, with reference to the Federal Capital, and Mr Barton was reported to have saidWe must give all credit to Victoria in the person of Sir George Turner for having behaved SJ patriotically in relation to the question of the Capital. In return for the entire exclusion of Victoria from the privilege, that .Colony has only asked that the Capital may not be nearer to Sydney than a distance of I'oo miles. On the 6th of February, 1899, there appeared a report of an interview at Albury with Mr Reid, who was then Premier of New South Wales, as to the possibility of Albury being selected as the site of the. CapitalIn the course of the interview Mr Reid said he fancied that the Federal Capital would be fixed somewhere about Goulburn. In the Argus of 8th February, the following paragraph appearedThe Sydney Daily Telegraph says Mr Reid will try to please Sydney by inferring in his campaign speeches that the limit of 100 miles from Sydney w i ll be exceeded as little as possible when the Capital is located. ' Mr 1£. W. Knox, of Sydney, denounced the Convention B ill , and he is still dissatisfied. In a letter to the Sydney papers he seems to anticipate that the Federal Parliament will meet for all time in Melbourne, and his wrath is very great. It is evident that the alleged trick of the Conference in respect, to the Federal Capital will be worked for all that can be got owt of it by the Sydney anti-Federalists. So unfederal a suspicion betrays itself. I am led to make these quotations, because some question has been raised as to whether the people of Australia, and more particularly the people of New South Wales, had this matter in mind when they voted on the Bill at the second referendum. The Sydney Morning Herald, of 3rd February, 1899-the date on which the memorandum was published-containe d an article in which it stated thatVictoria gave way upon the question of the Capital. . . . It was evident, after discuscertain provisions were inserted with a view of preventing Sydney ever being made the Capital. Sir George Turner said he could not tolerate Sydney being made the Capital on any conditions whatever. . . The site must be fixed at least 100 miles from the city of Sydney. Mr Reid congratulated New South Wales upon its bargain. As a matter of fact, the New South Wales Premier was never favorable to Sydney being the Capital.

227,Mr Bowden,"Well, in order tofavours a spot, say, between Moss Vale and Goulburn, in a cool climate and mountain breezes. On the following day, the Sydney Morning Herald reported Mr Reid ashaving saidThe other Colonies granted you the Capital. I think that the solution of the difficulty regarding the Capital is one which will be viewed with the liveliest satisfaction by the people of New South Wales. It fixes the Capital now and for all time in the very heart of our territory. On the 7 th February there appeared in the same newspaper a statement that Mr ing to vote against Dalgety. Reid did not care to enter into a controversy ori the subject, that the Federal Capital would never be fixed, that Parliament would meet in Melbourne, and continue to meet there for all time. That was one of the arguments that the antiBillites usedduring the campaign. The report readsMr Reid says he does not care to enter into a controversy on the subject. As a matter of fact, there is no need. and the Premiers of the other Colonies are honourable men, and are not likely to endeavour to draw out of the agreement which they entered into. have been repeated in the House on several occasions'. ber may have heard them, but I wish to place on record these quotations as showing the feeling that existed in Sydney at the time of the second referendum, and the understanding arrived at by the Premiers of the several States, in order to induce New South Wales to accept the Bill. following appeared in the Sydney Morning HeraldReplying to an interview to-day, Sir George Turner said he was perfectly certain the representatives of Victoria would not attempt in any way to block the Federal Parliament from selecting a site for the Federal Capital in New South Wales, and having the necessary buildings erected thereon at an early period of the Federation. Furthermore, he has not the slightest doubt that the question of the site will be submitted to the Federal Parliament during its first session. . . . He was confident none of the Colonies would attempt lo do anything unfair. A compact had been made that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales, and whatever his feeling might be concerning that concession to Ihe Mother Colony he would not lend himself to any movement to back out of it or to nullif y it in any way. member sling this at the head of his conGeorge stituents?

Having had this point conceded to him, if he had not agreed that the first session of the Federal Parliament should . be held in Melbourne, he would have been mean indeed. In the Sydney Morning Herald, of 14th February, 1899, the present Minister of Defence published a letter, in which he contended that, according to the ordinary practice of measuring distances, neither Bathurst nor Goulburn should be considered as outside of the 100-mile limit. Evidently, at that time, the honourable gentleman considered that the Capital was On the 8th February, 1899, the going to be somewhere near the ioo-mile limit, and was arguing that by ordinary methods of measurement, Bathurst and Goulburn, which by radial measurement were excluded, ought to be included and be open to selection. In an interview with a press representative, Mr Peacock, now Sir Alexander Peacock, is reported to have saidSir George Turner has conceded the Capital to New South Wales, and has asked that the first Parliament should meet in Melbourne. There are only two other quotations that I wish to make. On the 21st February, 1899, the Parliament of New South Wales met, and in the course of the debate on the Address-in-Reply in the Legislative Assembly, Mr Reid saidIt was only a reasonable request that Sir Turner made that the first session of bourne-",40,Chapman Bu T The Refer The Year I N Fixing The Federal Capi

Mr Reid had ference met with a request from the Legiscome fresh from making a compact with the representatives of Australia in Melbourne to the lative Council of New South Wales that effect that the federal capital should be in New the Federal Capital should be situated in South Wales, and that it should not be less Sydney. than 100 miles from Sydney.

In regard to the 100-miles limit, Mr Barton, member for Hindmarsh, that because we now Sir Edmund Barton, said :; miles from Sydney it will still be within I think, not a proper one to employ. a three-hours rail journey, and I take it that it will be the endeavour, however Surely in order to observe the spirit of that' federal and however patriotic-minded compact we should, other things being tliey ma}'be, of a large number of the reequal, get as near to the limit as possible, presentatives of New South Wales, and if we have two sites of which one is near most of them, so long as considerations the l_irr.it and the other altogether outside of position and climate are faithfully observed, to see that that Capital is it, then, in order to give effect to the comnot placed too remotely from either pact which was made between the States, Sydney or Melbourne.""

As aresult of his bitter experiences in the Western deserts, I have no doubt that when he sees a. decent stream of water anywhere it appeals to his heart. orable members that the right honourable member for Swan has shown us what can be done by engineering skill, even when, by force of circumstances, a city is established, as Coolgardie was, in the middle of a desert. was it that he was able to take water to that city, and make the scheme a financial success? We should need nothing of that kind at Lyndhurst, because within 20 or 30 miles, around the Canoblas, we could get all the water we should require for ordinary purposes, whilst, for the generation of power, we should have the Murrumbidgee not very far away. there are other factors besides that of a .good water supply which must be taken into account in estimating the suitability of a site for the Federal Capital. I repeat .that Dalgety has nothing to recommend it but a good water supply, and it is, amd .always will be, absolutely unsuitable as A site for the Federal Capital, except in that one respect. and Customs has exhibited a picture of a very pretty f a l l somewhere on the Snowy River, near Kosciusko. We all admit that Kosciusko is a very nice place as a tourists' resort, and I admit that a visit to the district might be very enjoyable. But it is 40 miles from Dalgetv, and, if ease of access is taken into account, it will be found that it is almost as close to Canberra.

There is a difference of only some 300 feet in altitude between Lyndhurst But I remind honand Dalgety, but the fact that Dalgety is on the eastern side of the Dividing Range makes the difference most appreciable.

282,Mr Bowden,"Let me put it in thismember for New England who made the comparison which the honourable member is attributing to me. form honourable members that there is a difference of only 3 degrees between the mean winter temperature of the city ot London and that of Dalgety. The mean winter temperature of London is 39.3 degrees, whilst the mean winter temperature of Dalgety is 42.2. Comparing Dalgety with the capitals of the States in this respect, the mean winter temperature of Melbourne is 49.2, or 7 degrees higher than that of Dalgety; Adelaide, 52 degrees, or 10 degrees higher; Hobart, the most southerly capital of all, which is open to the Southern Ocean, has a mean winter temperature of 47 degrees, or 5 degrees higher than Dalgety. Those honourable members who have visited Hobart in the winter, and have learnt how the wind can blow from Mount Wellington when it is covered with snow, can imagine what it would be to have the wind blowing from Kosciusko down upon Dalgety in the middle of winter. member -get those figures ? statistics. If the honourable meinber wishes 'the Canberra site is sheltered, and under to verify them he cari do so by reference to two volumes, which can be obtained in the Parliamentary Library. Sydney has a mean winter temperature of 53 degrees, or 11 degrees higher than that of Dalgety. Brisbane boasts a mean winter temperature of 60 degrees, which is 18 degrees higher than that of Dalgety, and Perth has a mean winter temperature of 55 degrees, or 13 degrees higher than the winter temperature of the site in which we are asked to shiver. Dalgety, besides being unsuitable on account of its climate, is also unsuitable byreason of its inaccessibility. I would remind honourable members that the New Zealand Parliament was removed from Auckland to Wellington because, although the former city is the capital of the island, it was not sufficiently accessible to members of the New Zealand Parliament. In view of that circumstance, I ask honourable members to imagine what will happen if we establish the permanent Seat of Government at Dalgety after wasting £500,000 in constructing a railway that will never pay? Some reference has been made to the possibility of connecting a railway from Bairnsdale with Dalgety. that is impracticable. Commissioner of Victoria is opposed to that scheme, and unless almost insuperable difficulties are overcome, most of that line would have to be built with a very narrow gauge and with very steep gradients. entirely wrong. very nature of the country that the line would traverse. The journey would be a very slow and tedious one. Eveni f that line were constructed, I venture to say that the representatives of Victoria would travel to the Federal Capital via the longer route. ever seen the country of which he is speaking? able member will have an opportunity of refuting my statements. Personally I am in favour of the selection of Lyndhurst but I am prepared to accept Canberra as a compromise if I cannot obtain a better site. It is true that the temperature of Canberra is higher than that of Dalgety by only 3 degrees but we have to remember . that while the Dalgety site is according to Mr Oliver situated in an exposed position, such circumstances the climate is not half so trying. That -is a matter of common knowledge to every person who has lived in the mountains.

297,Mr Bowden,"In going from Dalfrom ""Dalgety. I would further point out that if a line were -constructed from Tarvago to Jervis Bay it would traverse a much bigger strip of dairying country than would a line from Dalgety to Twofold Bay. The reason that Twofold Bay has not progressed more than it has done is that the mountains approach the shore too closely and that there is very little good grazing land in the neighbourhood. upon Twofold Bay £4,000,000. New South Wales in building breakwaters in the northern portion of that State do not encourage the belief that any breakwater at Twofold Bay could be erected that would effect much improvement. Another reason why I prefer Canberra to Dalgety is that the land around the former is very much superior to that around the latter. is very good grazing country at Dalgety. As a matter of fact, any rotting granitic country is good grazing country. The honourable member for Hindmarsh described the Canberra site as an admirable cricket pitch I would remind him that it is -impossible to get a cricket pitch at Dalgety. Something has been said about the difference bf opinion amongst the New South Wales representatives. been told that if they would only agree amongst themselves something might be -done to meet their wishes. But with the -exception of two of the New South Wales (representatives in the Ministry, every honourable member from that State is opposed to the selection of Dalgety. Consequently, although we may not"" be unanimously in favour of any particular site, we are unanimous upon the question of the unsuitability -of Dalgety as the site for the future Seat -of Government. 1 thank' honourable members for the patience with which they have listened to a rather long speech, but T felt that it was due to myself and my constituents that I should place upon record my opinion in reference to this measure. Should Dalgety be chosen in spite of all that I have said, 1 shall, at any rate, have the satisfaction of having discharged my duty, and future generations in Austialia will hold the representative for Nepean guiltless of having committed the egregious ""blunder of voting for the selection of the most"" unsuitable of all the sites that have ""been proposed. ""The honourable member for Nepean dissolely because extraneous purposes and * 05] covered one argument to support his case which may be used with greater force against him. He urged that we should not select Dalgety as the Federal Site because the trend of population is northward. But that is a reason for not selecting any site , , at all just now. If the centre of population is likely to shift, and it is desirable for the Federal Capital to be near the centre, then we ought to delay the selection, since we do not yet know where the centre is to be. It would certainly be rash to assume that settlement in the honourable member's State is to be confined to present limits. It may happen that one, if not both, of the leading States will lose their predominant position, and that a capital situated near the southern coast will be too remote from the population centre. Personally, I have recently come to the view that the selecOf course there tion might advantageously be postponed for at least a generation, and until development more clearly reveals the necessities and potentialities of Australia.

Not one fact, reason, or argument can be adduced that has not been already advanced ad nauseam, both in this House and in the press. As, however, I .have made only brief reference to it during previous discussions, I may be pardoned for saying a few words now in justification of the vote which I propose to give. It seems regrettable that this issue is not being decided squarely on the floor of the House, but that its settlement is being affected by such influences as were the subject of complaint during the Tariff debates. ber give us an example? matter the better. I merely desire to express my regret that such influences have been operative. The one paramount consideration in the settlement of this question is not the welfare of any particular State or capital city, but the welfare of the future Australian nation.

If such an undertaking had occurred with reference to Perth, what would my right honourable friend have said if there was a project to put the Capital up at Geraidton? Supposing there had been a similar compact with reference to Melbourne, what would have been said to a proposal to put the capital at Mildura or Echuca? We should have heard torrents, volumes, of righteous indignation at the breach of this distinct understanding-a n understanding which enabled Australia to federate. Now, when this great achievement has' been won, the way in which that bargain is, being observed does not reflect great credit upon those who were immediately concerned in making it .

The fact thac we come from New South Wales does not, I hope, make us any the less Australians. The fact that the people of New South Wales represent much more than one-third of the population of Australia does not, 1 The right honourable gentlehope, make them less worthy of consideration and respect. I wish to admit at once -becaus e I do not want to pitch this claim ot New South VVales too high-that there is no word in the agreement that binds this Parliament to choose an unsuitable site anywhere. Unless we have a site within a reasonable distance of Sydney, suitable for the Capital, New South Wales has no right to ask this Parliament to choose an unsuitable site simply because it is within a reasonable distance of Sydney. It is only fair to honourable members who differ from us on this subject to say that if they are of opinion that we have no suitable site within a reasonable distance from Sydney, they are perfectly justified in voting for some other site. I put the Canberra site forward as an eminently suitable one, but I shall not repeat all the arguments which have been advanced in respect of the different sites. I shall only refer briefly to the three or four leading points by which such a matter should be tested. Convenience of access tp the people of Australia is an important matter in an Australian sense, quite apart from any interests of New South Wales. Surely, comparing Canberra with Dalgety, there is no doubt as to which is the 'more convenient point for Australia. honourable member mean present conveniT h e honourable member is ence ? future, I admit, but, whether present or Then there was the future, Canberra is the more convenient site.

There are beautiful spots 50, 60 or 80 -milesaway, but the place itself is one of the bleakest in all Australia. state the matter. the bleakest. Sir WILLIAM LYNE would do the Minister of Customs a good turn if he could, but Dalgety is too much of a demand upon his brotherly feeling. It is a sacrifice which Damon cannot make to Pythias. Do the Government really mean to go on with this Capita.!, because there are a number of questions lying under the surface? Are we to take the action of the Government, in bringing forward this Bill in a short session, when there are a number of important matters to be considered, as a declaration on their part that they are honestly desirous of settling this question? Settlingi t does not mean passing a B ill . It means building a Capital. The mere passage of a B ill is simply an affront to the legitimate demands of the people of Australia.. May I suggest, as a matter far above a question affecting the people of New South Wales, that it does not befit the dignity Australian people to be without a Capital? It does not befit .their dignity, to remain the guests of a generous community, such as that of Victoria has been. We must thank the people of this State for the generous way in which tliey have acted towards the Commonweath; but we desire to have a home of our owna Capital in which the power of the Commonwealth may be exercised free from any strong local influences. The question whether the Capital should be in the country or in a large city, was fought out and settled at the Federal Convention; and hence the provision as to the area of the territory in which the Capital was to be. On the question of expense, I wish to say at once that, if we desire to study economy, we shall not have the Capital in a big city, but in the country. we took' some part of Melbourne or Sydney for the purposes of a Capital site, we should not have to pay for it? Do we expect any large city to present the Commonwealth with buildings which have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds? And, even if that were so,should we be mean enough to take the territory and buildings? Honourable members will see that if we were to attempt to found the Capital in a large city, the money problem would be infinitelymore serious than if we were to fix on a site in the country. However, that matter I do not want to overwas settled in the Convention. I now desire I say that it is one of to show how rapidly the Government are advancing in legislation on this subject. The bleakest. By Act No. 7 of 1904 this Parliament 1 am sure the Treasurer solemnly resolvedI t is hereby determined that the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be within 17 miles of Dalgetv, in the State of New South Wales. And now, four years later, we have before us a Bill for an Act"" to determine more definitely "" the Seat of Government. Four years ago we determined that the Capital should be within 17 miles of Dalgety; and now we are asked to determine more I ! definitely "" the site, and our way of doing that is to provide that i,t shall be anywhere within an area of 900 square miles. This is one of the incidents of comic opera legislation with which we have become familiar. Indeed, it is one of the silliest things in the world, as is shown in the fact that those of us who are altogether opposed to Dalgety are absolutely compelled to vote for the second reading of ' a Bill to "" determine more definitely the Seat of the Federal; ! Capital at Dalgety. Is this not rather too of the clumsy a way of settling this question? What is the simple issue before us? and not a Sydney question. nothing to do with steamers to Tasmania or anything of that sort. The question is whether or not we are going to stand by Dalgety. That is the simple issue, as I am sure the Minister for Trade and Customs will agree. right honourable member declared emphatically for Dalgety when he was a member of the Government! of Trade and Customs in supporting Dalgety, as against some other sites; that is, I preferred his cemetery to another graveyard. Do honourable members think that, if But my original choice, as the honourable gentlemari knows, was Lyndhurst; and when Lyndhurst was rejected, I voted in favour of Dalgety as against Tumut and Bombala. with an idea, which is quite fallacious, that I have some personal animosity to him.",52,Willis Th E Honourable The Real Question It Is Simply This A

As for Tooma, I have not yet had an opportunity of inspecting the site; but I do say that, in my opinion, the selection of Tooma would represent even a graver infraction of the spirit of the arrangement entered into than would the selection of Dalgety. rather remarkable that the Treasurer should have occupied a seat in the Government for four years since the Seat of Government Bill was passed, although he has been moving heaven and earth to undo what Parliament directed the Government to do. I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs had better address his colleague on these inconsistencies. Mir. AUSTIN CHAPMAN I shall address him just as I shall also address the right honourable member. of Trade and Customs will not be led by his praiseworthy devotion to this part of his electorate fo seriously imperil his returning health. PerhapsI may now be allpwed to point to one or two extraordinary provisions in the Bill. The Constitution provides, of course, that the Federal Parliament shall determine the Capital, which must be "" within territory which shall have been granted or acquired."" The logical process is to determine the locality in which we are going to have the Federal Capital, and then take the territory, but not ""to tie ourselves to one particular part of the territory. In other words, we should first fix on the territory and leave ourselves open to afterwards select the site of the Capital. But the other process was adopted of fixam with the Minister of Trade ing the Capital at the centre of an area of 900 square miles, the provision being that it should be "" within 17 miles of DalIt is quite true that gety."" I think that clause 3 of the Bill is one of the most original provisions I have ever seen in any Bill. It readsThe Minister is empowered -to obtain, and the Governor General is empowered to accept, 011 behalf of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Seat of Government, a grant by the State of New South Wales to the Commonwealth of the territory described in Schedule A. to this ActThat is a definite proposition; and if we turn to schedule A we find the territory defined in & most correct and accurate manner as to its outward boundaries. However, I will read the rest of the clauseto the f u l l extent to which the territory can be granted by the State within the meaning of section one hundred and twenty-five of the Constitution. There is an extraordinary anti-climax. In one part of the clause provision is made -for 900 square miles, while in another part we are told of a grant "" to the full extent to which the territory can be .granted by the State within the meaning of section 125 of the Constitution."" be decided by the High Court rule our legislation is not contingent on what the High Court may«say. refer to unalienated land? whole area-bot h Crown and private lands. the territory to be granted by the State to the Commonwealth.

We could not take 1,000,000 square miles, because the Act refers to "" not less than 100 square miles."" some area within a reasonable proportion of the area mentioned. In many cases a question has arisen as to the meaning of an agreement to deliver so many sheep, more or less. able member, who was a member of the Convention, enlighten us as tp what the Convention meant when it embodied the provision in the Constitution as to the 100 square miles of territory ? meant is not a canon of interpretation, because a hundred different members might give a hundred different interpretations, of what was intended by such a provision. We must have' regard to. the legal interpretation to be put upon the words used. Those who think we have a legal right to claim an area of 900 square miles merely because we have in the Constitution the words, "" not less than TOO square miles,"" make a grievous mistake as they will find. There should be some sort of friendly disposition to deal with the Government of New South Wales in this matter. If the one party stands upon its strict rights in a harsh spirit, the other can do the same. There is not a word in the Constitution about New South Wales granting a means of access to the sea. That is a request for a concession which New South Wales is not bound to give. who say that they want to stick to the bond. traordinary way of treating the Mother State. 'First of all, she is to grant an H. IRVINE -It could not area of not less than 100 square miles, and' that provision in the Constitution is tortured into one to require 900 square miles.

In other words, there is to miles across New South Wales, by a breadth of thirty miles. I , do not say lhat the whole area of thirty miles wide' is to be taken; but the right to a meansof access within that marked area is desired. That is a pretty considerable liberty to take with the territory of a friendly State, and to embody in an Act of the Federal Parliament. When honourable members approach the Mother State That must mean with a desire to arrive at some friendly settlement of these difficulties, a generousdisposition on the part of the FederalParliament should be shown.. 'Would it not be a generous action on the part of New South Wales to grant us ari area of 900 square miles under a Constitution which speaks of an area ot "" not less than 100 square miles"" being granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth ? Would it not be generous if New South Wales gave us a right of accessfor 125 miles across its territory from the Capital to a port? The concession asked for is a serious one.

Every humanbeing within a State, white, yellow, red, or black-Commonwealt h or State-ha s the right to use the public highways. Sir wealth would have to get permission to build a railway members who are talking so strictly about Honourable members must recollect that the building of a railway involves the resumption and severance of private lands, and the erection of fences, but a public highway injures no one. I wish to see all these questions settled in a thoroughly amicable -spirit. If the Federal. Parliament thinks that it is worthwhile to have a means of access, I raise no objection, though I . do. not see the slightest necessity for it. Buti f it is to take the form of a public road constructed by the Commonwealth, I think that the State might well welcome it. Roads are out of date. do not think, that the grant of a means of access involves the right fo construct a railway ! Surely some more power should be taken! Sir meant, I should think. so? Can the Commonwealth build a railway under cover of the expression "" means of access"" when the. power to construct railways within States is specially provided for in the Constitution? Under paragraph x x x i v . of section 51 this Parliament has power to legislate with respect toRailway construction and extension in any State, with the consent of that State. It is therefore absurd in this Bill to use I quite, agree with the the words "" means of access "" as meaning something contrary to that. We cannot amend the Constitution by using such vague words in an Act of Parliament. If , however, that is meant, this is a very The honourable member dangerous way of trying to get it ; it is not ti straightforward way. .u what is meant.

But may I ' suggest to honourable T h a t is another matter. the terms of the Constitution that if they read it in that rigid way, this demand of .1 means of access is absolutely unconstitutional and wrong. It is craving a concession. Speeches such as the honourable member for Coolgardie made are an insulting way of approaching .any one from whom honourable members wish to get aconcession. There is an air of lordly superiority about it, an unfriendly suspicion that the body to be ""done "" is the Commonwealth, not the State. But the terms of this Bill mean that it is the State whicli is to be "" done "" by means of a Commonwealth^ demand. If honourable members will have access to a port, and still select the Federal territory 125 miles from the sea, I ask them asmen of common sense to try to meet the State to some extent in the way in which they exercise their choice. If they want favours they had better act liberally. If they want to JOHN FORREST -That is what is get a harbour, let them take a Federal territory with a harbour.

He spoke of Dalgety as a. bleak desolate spot, and yet was prepared to allow the Federal Capital to be placed there rather than in a fertile district which would be a little closer to Melbourne. away from the honest understanding? this honest understanding? Prior to Federation it was thought that New South Wales was trying to induce the other States to join, but after it had been agreed by the representatives of Australia that the draft -Constitution should be accepted by a ma[16] jority, consisting of at least 5*0,006 voters, an act of treachery to the other States took place while the right honourable gentleman was leading the New South Wales Parliament, the maximum being increased to The title meant 80,000. knows that I opposed that alteration. and Customs, who was a member of the New South Wales Parliament at the time, did not oppose it.

The raising of the minimum in New South Wales was a breach of faith with the other States.

The right honourable member for Swan, whose reputation is equal to that of the right honourable member for East Sydney-whic h is one to be proud of, although he has played so many parts that, when he referred to the comic opera attitude of the Government, I thought that he must be speaking of himself-ha s no recollection of any understanding. bers of the Premiers' Conference were the late Mr Dickson, who represented Queensland, the late Sir Edward Braddon, representing Tasmania, the late Mr Kingston, representing South Australia, the right honourable member for Swan, representing Western Australia, Sir George Turner, representing Victoria, and the right honourable member for East Sydney, representing New South Wales.

If I produced a statement from the steam-ship company's office, stating that two or three weeks ago their ship of 5,000 tons, which draws nearly 20 feet of water, was alongside the wharf in that port, the honourable member for Lang would probably contend that the ship must be a dream. I prefer to rest my case on facts. Now it is urged that Dalgety is 125 miles away from the port. It is a good thing that it is some distance away. We want to be able to defend our Capital. But it would be a good thing to have an outlet to the sea and a good thing also to have an outlet to another State.

I hope he will be able to explain that to the people of Tasmania. the present Treasurer give it access? was the Treasurer in power there? But compare his record with that of the right honourable member for East Sydney, who was in power for many years and promised to do a great deal. ' Look at the great democratic measures that are on the statute book of New South Wales owing to the Treasurer's efforts! Sir Henry Parkes addedAs far back as 1S73 I advocated the construction of a railway to the port to bring the traffic of Monaro to the bay. I will now show what the Treasurer thought of the site. He cannot be accused of being biased in its favour, but I will say for him that he does not disguise his opinions. He has always been against it. He never declared, as the right honourable member did, that he would stand by it to his last dying gasp, and that it would be unfair to attempt to alter the decision in any way. The Treasurer tells us a nice little story about it now, but he has never been at Dalgety in his life. He went once to Bombala, but, unfortunately, fell ill and had to hire a special coach to get away. He brought the honourable member for Perth with him, but, notwithstanding all the dismal stories I have that faith in the that the Treasurer told .him on the way, that honourable member has always stood, and proposes now, I believe, to stand, solidly b^' Dalgety. What did the present Treasurer, Sir William Lyne, say when he expressed an honest opinion of this part of the country? He saidI think if there is a district in which a 'tableland to the port of Eden.

The reputation of the Bulletin as a newspaper that is prepared to fight for a cause that it regards as a good one is well known. the Tobacco Trust. events, I wish, as far as I am personally concerned, to absolutely deny the statement that I am interested in the selection of Dalgety. As a matter of fact, all my interests are centred round Canberra. The selection of that site would put money into my own pocket, and thousands of pounds into the pockets of my relatives. That being so, honourable members may imagine how deeply I feel the insinuation that I am directly interested in the Dalgety site. And what is my position from a political stand-point? As a matter of fact, there are more voters in my electorate in favour of Canberra than there are in favour of Dalgety. But I intend to fight for what I believe to be the best site. I know both Dalgety and Canberra well. I have not a word to say against the latter, but, in my opinion, there is no comparison between the two. Canberra is close to my home, and its selection, as I have said, would increase the value of our property; but those who know anything about the two sites, must agree with me that to compare Dalgety with Canberra is like comparing this House with a 6 x 8 tent. There can be but one selfish reason advanced in favour of the selection of Canberra, and that is that it is closer to Sydney than is Dalgety; that if it were chosen Sydney would be, for all time, the centre of its trade; and that Sydney merchants would be benefited, since the Capital would have no other port. If the Capital be established there, it can never have a big population, and we cannot hope for that class of Federal legislation that we require. That is my answer to those who say that Canberra should be selected. I have nothing to say against the district itself. It comprises splendid country; but, in my opinion, is unsuitable for the site of the Federal Capital. We should try to view the question from a purely Australian stand-point; we certainly ought not to attempt to deal with it from the pettyfogging view advanced to-night by an honourable member. We ought not to consider it merely from the point of view of Sydney or Brisbane. What divine right have those big centres of population to all trade? Centralization are seeking a change. Yet, when the opportunity offers to open up an area that is a State in itself, to open up immense tracts of country where there is no railway communication; where there is no cultivation simply because there is no market; where there are hundreds of thousands of acres ready for the plough; and where homes for the people can be made, we are told that we ought not to embrace it. Are we to sacrifice this great opportunity to petty provincial ""feeling-to a desire to help Sydney? I would not insult the intelligence of honourable members by urging provincial considerations. I have not pressed any one to vote for Dalgety. I have put the facts before the House, and I leave them to the good sense of honourable members. I believe that this is an Australian Parliament. Probably not many of us will see this Capital completed. able members laugh, but the Capital cannot be dumped down in a day like a tent. First there will be the necessary surveys to be made. Then will follow the laying out of a great city; a city not for to-morrow or for next year, but for all time. A city unique in its beauty and utility, with broad avenues intersecting its regular squares, with frequent reservations of grass, flowers, and fountains, with its trees and parks, substantial business houses and sightly dwellings, its schools, universities, galleries, and museums, its monuments and pubiic buildings, its noble rivers and picturesque landscape, its rugged mountains and fertile plains, with Kosciusko in the distance, piercing the sky and lifting itself like a heavenly dome. These, ancl many other natural advantages, will offer a noble panorama and a more inspiring contemplation than can possibly be afforded by any other city in the world.

We must have new railways, the means of communication with other great cities, necessary public buildings, and suitable accommodation for Parliament, press, and people.

WhatI said was that I had in my hand a document which I was informed it? that it was made a public document. I was informed that the honourable member for North Sydney had applied for the information, and it seemed to me that it was a way of getting behind the Constitution, -or trying to get round it, because Moss Vale is well known'to be within the 100mile limit. But immediately he told me that it was not so, I said that I accepted his disclaimer. the honourable member's disclaimer now, and I believe that Hansard will bear me out that I accepted it in the first instance.

I hope that he will not suggest to the Opposition such a terrible temptation to vote for Dalgety-becaus e we have sufficient trouble amongst ourselves without having an awful temptation of that sort held out to us. I also trust that the Treasurer, if the House should select Dalgety, will not apply any of his infernal tactics, and accuse us of blocking the movement for a Capital.
