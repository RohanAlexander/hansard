221,Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 11 p.m.,The following answers to questions were circulated: Tasmania: Commonwealth Staff (Question No. 1283) Mr Kerr asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 16 March 2000: How many (a) full time, (b) part time and (c) casual staff were employed by the Commonwealth in (i) Tasmania and (ii) the electoral division of Denison on (A) 2 March 1996 and (B) March 2000. I am advised that information is not available against the categories and dates specified in the question. Goods and Services Tax: Education (Question No. 1737) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: Has the Government defined what is an education course in relation to the application of the goods and services tax on education; if so, (a) how is that definition applied to adult and community education courses and (b) when was the definition released to the public. able member’s question: Parliament defined the terms “education course” and “adult and community education course” in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999, which received the Royal Assent on 8 July 2000. An “adult and community education course” is one kind of GST-free “education course”. Two important elements of the definition of “adult and community education course” are that, broadly speaking, the course of study is likely to add to the employment related skills of the people undertaking the course, and that it is of a kind determined by the Education Minister to be an adult and community education course. The Education Minister issued a determination on adult and community education courses on 20 June 2000 and the Australian Taxation Office issued a taxation ruling on the meaning of the term “likely to add to employment related skills” on 28 June 2000. Veterans: Vietnamese Awards (Question No. 1875) Mr Edwards asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 29 August 2000: (1) Has he received a letter from Mr Bob Buick MM regarding the unfair treatment Australian veterans are receiving from the Government over approvals to wear Vietnamese Awards granted following the battle of Long Tan. (2) Will he ensure that this matter is reviewed and will he give personal attention to that review; if not, why not. (1) and (2) A letter has been received from Mr Buick regarding South Vietnamese awards to Australian servicemen following the battle of Long Tan. This matter has been carefully examined since it was first raised some years ago. I am advised that it was established that the South Vietnamese Government made no awards of medals to Australian veterans of the Battle of Long Tan although it had been that Government’s intention to do so. There is, therefore, no further action that the Australian Government can now take. Immigration: Pacific Islands (Question No. 2010) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 3 October 2000:",109,Notices
222,Mr Howard,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,110,Questions On Notice
223,Mr Costello,The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honour,110,Questions On Notice
224,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Are the Government’s various visa requirements for skilled and extended family immigration designed to cater only for individuals coming from countries that have the educational and technical base to achieve high levels of skilling; if so, what is the Government’s response to claims that the requirements discriminate against people coming from countries such as the Pacific Islands where skilling opportunities are rarely available. (2) Will he introduce immigration guidelines which permit a variation in skills assessment such that people coming from those countries where skilled training opportunities are less available, or not available at all, would be given the opportunity to enter Australia on the basis that they can complete their training in this country. (3) If not, will the Government introduce a special immigration program for people from Pacific Islands, as currently exists in New Zealand, including a program to bring Pacific Islanders to Australia for skills training. (4) Have Australian parliamentary committees in the past recommended such a course of action. (5) Has the Government received representations from Pacific Island governments in relation to the availability of visas for Pacific Islanders; if so, what has the Government’s response to the representations. (1) No the Government manages a Migration Program that is non-discriminatory on the basis of race, religion and ethnicity. The Program is designed to select people who satisfy a number of selection criteria, including relevant work experience and qualifications, business skills and capital, and close family links. While some Pacific Island nations may not have educational and training facilities akin to those available in Australia, it is equally true that many Pacific Islanders obtain academic qualifications and employment experience and subsequently migrate on this basis. (2) The Government will not resile from its commitment to administer a non-discriminatory Migration Program. I note that people from all parts of the world are able to study and work in Australia under existing arrangements. The Government has introduced a range of policy changes to enable overseas students to become permanent residents on the basis of their skills. (3) See the answer to question (2) above. (4) I am advised that during the past four years there have been no such major recommendations made by Australian parliamentary committees. However, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended in its March 1989 report “Australia’s relations with the South Pacific”, that a work experience program be established for South Pacific countries, in particular Kiribati and Tuvalu, to assist their citizens gain access to the labour markets of the more developed nations in the region. The then Australian Government examined this recommendation together with a number of other private sector contract related recommendations and decided not to pursue it. (5) I am advised that from time to time oral approaches are made from government representatives in the Pacific region to Australian missions about the availability of visas specifically for people from the Pacific region. The Tongan Ministry of Foreign Affairs approached the Australian High Commission in Tonga on 21 September 2000 about the possibility of Australia facilitating the entry of a group of Tongans from the outer island under a work scheme as they were without a reliable source of income locally. The Australian High Commission advised the Tongan Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 6 October 2000 that there was no visa available under Australian immigration law that could be used to facilitate a scheme of the type proposed. Second Sydney Airport: Location (Question No. 2046) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 11 October 2000: (1) Apart from Badgery’s Creek, what other sites is the Government considering in relation to the location of a second airport for Sydney. (2) Is he able to confirm recent media reports which record him as saying that Sydney Airport coped well during the Sydney Olympics.",110,Questions On Notice
225,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) In light of the success of Sydney Airport coping with the Olympics, does Sydney need a second airport. (1) On 13 December 2000 the Government announced its decision that it would be premature to build a second major airport in Sydney. The Government is confident that the policy measures it announced on 13 December, together with commercial decisions by the airlines, will ensure that Sydney Airport will be able to cope with increasing air traffic until the end of the decade. (2) Yes. (3) See the answer to (1) above. People with Disabilities: Telephone Services (Question No. 2216) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 5 December 2000: (1) Is the testing of telephone lines by persons with a disability who are dependent on emergency telephone services a necessary function that must be performed once per day. (2) Can the cost of such services total approximately $90 per year. (3) Is the $16 telephone allowance insufficient to cover this estimated $90 per year bill. (4) For the average disability pensioner is this added telephone expense an unjust burden. (5) Will the Minister recommend a review of the telephone allowance for people with disabilities and who are on a disability allowance for the purpose of raising the telephone allowance in parity with their telephone expenditure which is necessary for the servicing of their emergency telephone system. has provided, on advice from the line testing service provider and the Department of Family and Community Services, the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The testing of a telephone line to verify the line is operable is a commercial service offered by some security firms as part of 24 hour monitoring back to base alarm systems. Telephone line testing is not essential for persons with disabilities, nor is it part of the standard telephone service provided by Telstra in fulfilment of the Universal Service Obligation. (2) Line tests are generally conducted for the cost of a local call. The intervals at which the testing occurs can be negotiated by the customer. The total cost of the service will depend therefore on the frequency of the testing. (3) I am advised that the Department of Family and Community Services provides pensioners (including Disability Support Pensioners) and other eligible persons with a quarterly Telephone Allowance. The Telephone Allowance is designed to assist with the cost of rental of a domestic telephone service. It is not intended to cover all the costs associated with telephone usage. The Telephone Allowance is indexed, and currently is $17.20 per quarter for a single person and $8.30 per quarter for each eligible member of a couple. (4) The decision to obtain a telephone line testing service is optional and a matter of choice by the customer. (5) This is a matter which falls within the portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for Family and Community Services. The Department of Family and Community Services has indicated a review of the Telephone Allowance is not considered necessary at this stage. Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders: Reconciliation (Question No. 2226) Dr Theophanous asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 6 December 2000: (1) Does the Government support the process of reconciliation; if so, why is it opposed to the establishment of a treaty with Australia’s Indigenous population.",111,Questions On Notice
226,Mr Howard,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,112,Questions On Notice
227,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(2) Given the positive outcomes of the actions of nations like Canada and New Zealand, who have established treaties with their Indigenous populations, what are his detailed reasons for the belief that the establishment of such a treaty would not be positive for Australia. (1) The Government is committed to the goal of lasting reconciliation between indigenous and nonindigenous Australians. That is why the Government is providing $5.5 million to Reconciliation Australia (the successor to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation) to help ensure that the momentum for reconciliation is maintained. In addition, the Government has agreed that contributions to the new foundation will be fully tax-deductible. However, the Government does not support calls for a treaty. It is concerned that a treaty would create legal uncertainty and result in greater recourse to litigation (by both indigenous and non-indigenous parties) to try to define and clarify the terms of the treaty. The Government also believes that the concept of a treaty remains a divisive issue and will not solve the real issues confronting indigenous Australians, such as social and economic disadvantage. The Government believes that practical and effective measures that address this legacy of disadvantage are the cornerstone of true reconciliation. Accordingly, the Government is spending $2.3 billion on indigenous-specific programmes in 2000-2001. (2) The reasons for the Government’s belief that a treaty would not be positive for Australia are set out in (1) above. Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders: Reconciliation (Question No. 2227) Dr Theophanous asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 6 December 2000: (1) In light of the estimated one million Australians who have attended demonstrations around Australia in support of reconciliation with the Indigenous community, does he consider further concrete action is necessary in the process of achieving real reconciliation. (2) If so, will he reconsider the abolition of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation on 31 December 2000. (3) If not, how does he propose to further the process of reconciliation without the input of such a source of input on issues facing Indigenous Australians. (1) The government recognises that while progress has been made, the process of reconciliation is not complete. To ensure that the momentum towards reconciliation and the reconciliation process is not lost the government has contributed $5.5 million seed funding to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation’s successor body – Reconciliation Australia. Donations to that body have been made fully tax deductible. In addition the government has also announced the site of Reconciliation Place in the Parliamentary Triangle which, in depicting the shared journey between indigenous and other Australians, will also perpetuate in the minds of the Australian public the importance of the reconciliation process. The government remains committed to practical reconciliation and overcoming the disadvantage that many indigenous Australians experience. To this end the government has allocated a record $2.3 billion in targeted programmes for indigenous Australians this financial year. (2) No, the Council’s legislation lapsed on 1 January 2001. (3) The government will continue to receive input on the issues facing indigenous Australians, including through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the processes outlined above.",112,Questions On Notice
