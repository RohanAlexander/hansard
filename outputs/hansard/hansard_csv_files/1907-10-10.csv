Fortunately mere force of delivery does not constitute argument. that preference has been given to the consideration of the item of wire-netting, since it affords us a striking illustration of the difference between the two systems of protection and free-trade-the difference between fhe system of protecting our primary industries as against that of protecting our secondary industries. Notwithstanding the great importance of this question, we find that only two witnesses were examined in regard to it by the Tariff Commission. ' One of these was a representative of the employees in the wire-netting industry, whilst the other was a pastoralist representing employers in one of our chief primary industries. It is singular that where such large interests apparently were at stake, only an employee in the wire netting industry came forward to give evidence. During the progress of this debate the president of the company concerned has been in the galleries, but when the costly Commission sat in Sydney no representative of the employers appeared before it. The employee who gave evidence certainly presented a written statement, which put his case clearly and concisely, but as soon as his evidence was submitted to the crucial test of cross-examination his arguments fell to the ground. Speaking 011 behalf of the employees, he complained that he was working only half-time, that he was making not more than £ 2 2s. per week, and that, as a matter of fact, all the workers in the industry were sadly underpaid. Nevertheless, he would not admit that any employ^ was earning less than 30s. per week. We have been told during this debate that there are between 500 and 600 employees in the industry, and the amount which the Treasurer said last night was paid in wages by the company would not provide for an average wage of more than 28s. per week. It is impossible to reconcile the statement of the employ^ with that made by the Treasurer. that there were 400, not 600, employees in the industry ? able member of the Labour Party said that there were something like 600 employed. If there were 400. the amount said to be distributed by way of wages by the company would not be sufficient to provide all these employees with I am pleased what the honourable member would describe as a living wage. could more be paid under free-trade? why the company should not succeed under free-trade conditions. How could a business concern expect to succeed when it entered the market bearing a burden in the shape of a liability of .£100,000 to be paid off? In such circumstances, how could we expect its employees to be properly treated, and the industry to be satisfactorily carried on ? I think that the business must have been badly managed. pany lost ,£100,600 under free-trade conditions does not suggest that it could carry on under free-trade. .incurred by the company were not due to the fact that free-trade prevailed in New South Wales. Is it not a fact that industries in that State had gone ahead by leaps and bounds? The country is so rich that it can nourish industries without the assistance, df protection. The suggestion made by the Treasurer that the position of this isolated company i l lustrates the evil of free-trade will not bear a moment's consideration. In a country like this the outlet for wire-netting is-so extensive that any company properly managed should be able, with the greatest of ease, to produce netting in open competition with the foreign manufacturer. Although manufacturers of wire-netting in Germany arev encouraged by the Government, we are told, by means of a bounty of 15 percent -althoug h their goods are carried over the railways at specially low rates, and shipping companies are subsidized to convey them to Sydney at a cost of something like ios. 6d. per ton, whereas the cost of conveying wire-netting from Sydney to other Inter-State ports ranges from 15s. to 22s. 6d. per ton-the y are unable",16,Tariff

The Treasurer claims that, as the result of the imposition of a high protective duty, prices will f a l l , and that, as a matter of"" fact, Lysaght Brothers have already made -a reduction of £ 1 per ton in their selling rates. That, however, is a very , small concession, having regard to the fact that the duty originally proposed by the Government is equivalent to -£6 per ton. It was urged last, night that farmers and settlers are not interested in this question -that it is a question affecting only the pastoralist, and that he can well afford to pay a little more for the use of his land. That is an entirely erroneous assumption. We know that the farmers and settlers, equally with the pastoralists, fear the inroads of the rabbit. I have before me a letter signed by Mr J. R. Fulton, secretary of the Farmers and Settlers' Association at Underbank, near Dung°g agent ? and he writesHad there been sufficient time not only our Farmers and Settlers' Association, but the whole district, would have signed it to a man. The reference is to a petition praying the House not to agree to these excessive duties.

There may be only a few there at the present time, but it cannot be denied that the great army of rabbits is gradually approaching the district. land-holders do not have an opportunity to erect rabbit-proof boundary fences and to resort to poisoning and trapping in order to keep the pest in check there will [159] be nothing to prevent the rabbits extending beyond the larger areas, and, more particularly in bad seasons, raiding the dairy farms and the holdings of the small settlers.

Unless the rabbits a farmer or an on the large areas are kept in check, they must gradually encroach on the holdings He is a dairy farmer, of the small settlers, and until we have closer settlement they will always be a menace to the farmer as well as to the,pastoralist. The wire-netting industry at present is a small one, but even if it were an extensive industry, capable of supplying all the wire-netting required in Australia, it would be insignificant when compared with the great pastoral and farming industries.

Let honourable memliers reflect for a moment upon the employment which is provided by the pastoral and the dairying industries. this aspect of the matter to the notice of the jocular leader of the Labour Party, whose members are always complaining that huge estates employ only half-adozen hands. In 1903 there were 69,000 hands employed in the pastoral industry, a n d 43>9^4 in the dairying industry, a total of, approximately, 113,000 hands. Since then the dairying industry has progressed by leaps and bounds, but, unfortunately-owin g to' dilatoriness on the part of the Government-n o statistics are available to enable me to bring the figures up to date. Upon this question I claim that I am in a position to speak impartially. Last night the Treasurer taunted the leader of the Opposition with the fact that he represents a city constituency. The honourable gentleman also declared that for 27 years his constituents had been satisfied with him as tbeir representative, and that he represented a district whose interests were almost entirely pastoral. was the big land-owners who backed him every time. a position to take a broad-minded view of this question, because I am not the representative of any particular class of the community. In my electorate is Cockle Creek, from which supplies of spelter are obtained. The district also embraces extensive mining interests which employ a large number of workmen, and large areas which are occupied by settlers and pastoralists. In a young country like Australia, whose population is crowded into the larger cities on our coast, we should do all that we can to encourage our primary industries. The way to encourage them is not by imposing a duty upon wire-netting, but by allowing that article to be admitted free. I intend to vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Illawarra. From the printed schedule in the hands of honourable members, it appears that the recommendation of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission was that a 5 per cent, duty should be levied upon wire netting, t h a t is somewhat of a misrepresentation, because I am given to understand that the duty in question was recommended in connection with a scheme which included a number of other duties. Unless this scheme could be adopted in its entirety, the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission declared that no duty should be imposed upon wire-netting. I would commend Mr J. H . CATTS.'-They recommended a duty of 5 per cent. that the material should be admitted free. The position was explained very thoroughly by the honourable member for Illawarra , yesterday. Last night the Treasurer stated that the small farmers and agriculturists did not fear the rabbits, and that the remedy for this pest. was to be found in the subdivision of the large estates and in the closer settlement of-the country. I think I have shown that his statement is entirely inaccurate, and that the small settlers equally with the large land-holders dread the inroads of the rabbits. I also desire to take exception to the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney last evening. He spoke with a good deal of heat, and with a certain amount of ill nature. If any member of this House was ever a, free-trader certainly the honourable member used to be one. What he is now I do not know. But I do say that for him Until the last election it to affirm that the present Tariff is the result of the action of the leader of the Opposition is nothing more nor less than a most I think that I am in despicable misrepresentation. The party which is responsible for the introduction of the Tariff is that which is commonly known in this Chamber as the Labour Partv, and which is known outside of it as the ""Socialistic"" party. the ""yes-no"" party. that this wretched remnant of the Government could not live for an hour if it were not for the support of members who are supposed to represent the labouring classes of Australia. For the members of that party to declare that the leader of the Opposition is responsible for the Tariff is absolutely ridiculous. I am very glad that the honourable member for West Sydney has entered the chamber, because I do not like to attack a person when he is absent. For the honourable member to make the remark to which I refer last evening was beneath the dignity even of a member of the Labour Party. I have nothing more to say upon this matter. I do hope that as the result of the protests which have been presented to Parliament by those who feel the hardship of being compelled to pay a.",18,Tariff

But honourable members, I am sure, will bear testimony to the fact that I have not delayed the settlement of tlie Tariff question by any speeches which I have delivered upon it. The Government are asking this Committee to vote for a protective duty upon wire-netting, and therefore I take it that we are entitled to consider the extent of the disadvantage under which the factory of Messrs. Lysaght Brothers has to work by reason of the increased wages which it'has to pav in comparison with those which are paid in other parts of the world. Australian industry placed at a disadvantage by reason of its being called upon to pay higher wages than those which obtain in other countries, I am prepared to extend to it such a measure of protection as will at least _ equalize matters or incline the balance in favour of our own people. kept down for .the consumer? tection scheme will do that. scheme?

We might be prepared to accept even a scheme of the deputy leader of the Opposition if it were a good one. brought forward? the ability of the leader of the Opposition in persuading the honourable member to adopt his reasonable methods in dealing with the Tariff. I ask the Committee to consider the wages which are paid in the wire-netting industry with a view to ascertaining what duty will fairly meet the case. We were told last nieht by the Treasurer that £ 7 0 0 per week is disbursed amongst the employees in the wire-netting industry. That is the total amount of the payments. We have also been told that Messrs. Lvsaght Brothers' factory is producing miles of netting weekly. Sir WILLIAM LYNE The ' average pro.duction is 300 miles per -week. [i59]2 at least £ 3 0 a mile. netting of a different type is sold at a much lower price. but I also know that some wire-netting is sold at even a higher price. The firm turn out 33S miles of wire-netting per week, which, sold at £ 3 0 per mile, means over £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 ; and it is a fact that they are also engaged in manufacturing other commodities. For the production of that wire netting, , £ 7 0 0 in wages is paid; so that, if there is a difficulty in competing witb the cheaper article from abroad, it cannot arise, to any great extent, from any difference in wages If the wire-netting workers of Germany worked for nothing, the firm WhereverI see any would be at a disadvantage of only some. £ 7 0 0 , which could be covered by a duty of 7 per cent. MrJ o s EPH COOK -Four-fifth s of the wire-netting comes from Great Britain. and in England were ever so much cheaper -eve n if it were procured for nothingI contend that the firm will be at a disadvantage of only some 7 per cent. But I think that the new proseeing that the workers in England and Germany arepaid a certain wage, I venCOOK -Wher e is this ture to think that a duty of 5 per cent, would more than compensate for any difference If we impose a duty qf I do not suppose that it 5 per cent, on English wire-netting, and, if desired, an extra 5 per cent, on foreign wire-netting-and I am prepared to support a preference-w e shall be treating this firm handsomely, and doing all that is necessary to equalize conditions in the manufacture. Can the Treasurer see his way be to accept a suggestion to that effect? *A duty of 5 per cent, may be regarded as not T h a t depends largely uponvery much; but it amounts to a great deal when we consider the value of the output; and I think that in view of the fact that Lysaght Brothers have carried on their business for some years without any protection, they will be able to do very well under such a' duty as I have indicated. On the output of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 a week, a 5 per cent, duty means placing outside competitors at a disadvantage of £ 5 0 0 a week. Honourable members who represent oountry constituencies are aware that the local article enjoys a natural protection which must amount to fully 5 per cent, at present.

In doing this, I am not so much -concerned about the wire-netting workers .in Sydney, because I regard this as an industry which is not of much value to the -community. Those who carry on the industry engage a large number of boys for five or six years at wages ranging from 25s. to 35s. a week; and, when those boys grow up and require men's wages, they are turned out to compete in the unskilled labour market. Such an industry is not. in 'my opinion, worth any great sacrifice. If it could be shown that Lysaght Brothers could maintain the existing competition without a duty, I should feel disposed to place wire-netting on the free list ; but I am not sure that the industry will not go to the wall unless it be afforded some protection, however small. "" gone to the wall "" all these years. understand that this enterprise has changed hands once or twice since it was initiated. I make no appeal for Lysaght Brothers or their 400 workers, most of whom are juniors; but I am satisfied that if this factory be closed, it will not be long before the importing ring will proceed to rob the selectors as they have done in the past. Almost every day we have some new experience in this connection. Only yesterday we were informed how importers had combined to rob the people in the matter of infants' foods and other commodities sold in chemists' shops; and certainly the importing ring misses no opportunity of the kind. We have a chance to prevent such practices by affording such protection as may be necessary to maintain this industry, and give the people on the land the advantages of competition. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [3.28]. endeavour to restrain ourselves within the limits of ordinary Committee debate, or I am assured that it is the I am afraid we shall never conclude the difficult task before us. AlthoughI should like to say much on the subject under discussion, I shall confine myself to one or two important questions which seem not to have been full y touched on! First, what is the relation which this proposed As I have said this gives duty holds to the new schedule in divisions VIA . and VIB . ? If we place a duty on wire-netting at this stage, and we subsequently adopt the provisions of division VI A, and place a duty of i 2 | per cent, on the raw material, wire, there will be a very strong case on the part of the wire-' netting manufacturer for an additional compensating duty of at least 8 or 10 per cent. I ask the Treasurer whether it is intended to press the proposed duty of 12 J per cent, on wire? I do not ask the honourable gentleman to commit himself to any definite course at the present stage; but, without that information, it is almost impossible to estimate what is a fair or adequate duty on wire-netting. wire, I should not like to speak positively; but my inclination is to think that the duty ought to be lowered or . removed.

Despite that statement, the members of the Opposition arenow saying that they do not desire protection for this industry. The honourable member foi; Dalley said that the protectionists sitting on this side of the Chamber would be afraid to vote protection for New South Wales industries; but I am prepared to vote the highest protection.

The workers in the industry have asked for protection, and the Government proposes to give it to them. The workers of New South Wales have asked for generous all round protection, and yet, in connection with one of the very first items, we are called-upon to deal with, we find that most of the representatives of New South Wales are opposed to any duty.

He said that he desired to keep the rabbits off his land,. and that he did not favour any duty on wire-netting. He admitted, however, that' even if the wire-netting industry in New South Wales were able to supply local requirements,, competition would lead to a reduction in prices. The evidence given before the Commission was in favour of a higher duty, and the protectionist section of that Commission recommended the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent.

When we reach other items relating to the industries of Australia, it will ' probably be found that there is not much difference of opinion between the Government and the members of the Opposition corner. the prosperity of Australia as a whole. For a long time we have been confronted with the problem of what steps are best calculated to enable us to cope with the rabbit invasion, and I think that this item is, therefore, not in the same category as many others in the Tariff. I should like to read a short extract from The Commonwealth of Australia, by Professor Harrison Moore, with a view to showing what a long time the rabbit has been with us. This book, I may mention, has been kindly placed in my hands by the honourable member for Parkes. page 34 I find the following:It was not until the conference of 1SS1 that the matter passed beyond the stage of a discussion and a Bill was agreed to, which, saving the Prerogative, provided for an Australian Court of Appeal. But it was entirely in accordance with custom that the matter should end there. The Tariff as a subject pf conference had been already considered ; and the other principal matters suggested for joint action were the regulation of Chinese immigration, and the suppression of another "" undesirable immigrant,"" the rabbit. That was as far back as 1881, but we arestill fighting the rabbit pest. monopolist in our midst. will displace, not only the land monopolist, but the farmer, and everybody else connected with the land. I have seen rabbitsin country which was covered with snow io feet deep. I recollect that at one time it was urged that rabbits would not live in I was not; I . am Gippsland.' But the fact remains that today that country is threatened with an invasion of the pest. I look upon this question as an extra-fiscal one, and I say that it ought not to be dealt with from a fiscal stand-point. I am one of those who favour the establishment of local industries, and, be in order that we may place a check upon our importers by insuring healthy competition, and thus allow the users of wire-netting to obtain that material as cheaply as The Government possible, we ought to impose a fair duty -upon it. By that means we shall preserve The the industry, which has already been established in our midst. With that object m view, I think that we might levy a duty of IO per cent, upon netting of foreign manufacture and of 5 per cent, upon netting of British origin.

120,Mr Fairbairn,"We are quite wilbe acting wisely if they agreed to levy a duty of 10 per cent, upon wire-netting of foreign manufacture and 5 per cent, upon netting of British origin. member think that 5 per cent, would be any protection at all? think that the industry requires any protection. The duty is merely a revenue duty. I know.that a little protection very frequently has the effect of imposing a healthy check upon importers, and of thus allowing the consumer to purchase commodities cheaper than he would be able to get them if no duty were operative. Further, in the absence of any duty, rings and combines are likely to be established. I believe that such a thing is not unknown even in labour circles. The general experience is that directly a local industry has been established, clown comes the price of the imported article. I do not blame importers for endeavouring to get as much as they can out of the consumers. I am a business man, and I always try to get as much as I can for my money, and I know that others endeavour to get as much as they can out of me. I have no desire to detain the Committee at greater length. A duty of 10 per cent, upon wire-netting of foreign manufacture, and of 5 per cent, upon netting of British origin, over and above the cost of the raw material, would, I think, represent a fair compromise. The actual cost of the raw material has not yet been stated. Any impost upon that material must necessarily increase the price of the locally-manufactured article. I repeat that, in my opinion, the duties should be 10 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively in excess of the duty which may be levied upon the . wire. manufacturers a clear protection of 10 per cent, in the case of wire-netting of foreign manufacture, ancl of 5 per cent, in the case of netting of British origin. The users of this material would then be able to purchase it as cheaply as possible, and that would be a consideration to those upon the land, who are really building up this great country. rather a pity that the Treasurer was not in his place yesterday when the honourable member for Calare addressed the Committee. The latter gave honourable members a graphic description of the labour conditions which prevail in the factory of Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, Sydney. Had the Treasurer heard the honourable member's speech, he would have derived a great deal of information, which, I venture to say, was not -proffered to him by those who were instrumental in persuading him to propose this particular duty for their especial benefit. WhatI am I really do not surprised at is that a large number of honourable members, who claim to directly represent labour, should be found supporting a proposal to encourage the wire-netting industry by means of a protective duty after they have heard the deliverance of the honourable member for Calare. Just now, we had a most impassioned deliverance from the honourable member for Batman, who is a staunch protectionist. Of course, we can all admire his loyalty to thecause which he advocates and the fervour with which he advances his views, although we may disagree with his conduct in' arrogating to himself the position of lecturer-general to the Committee. orable member occupied that position. assumed by new members who occupy seats upon the Ministerial side of the Chamber,, or in the Labour ""corner. In horrified terms, the honourable member for Batman referred to the immense importation of wire-netting from Germany. He said that he was not only prepared to protect Australian industry against the competition of foreigners, but that he was so ardent a protectionist that he did not care twopence for the preferential sentiments which are supposed to permeate the Ministry he was elected to support. He declared his willingness to increase the Tariff against both British and foreign manufactures. That would leave our VVe hear so much from the Treasurer and his followers in regard to the importation of wire-netting from Germany that any one who did not know better might be pardoned for believing that the great bulk of the netting imported into the Commonwealth is of German manufacture. But, as a matter of fact, it is of British manufacture. The value in d origin of the imports of this material „-ari be ascertained from the Customs returns, i com those returns I find that the total importations in 1905 were valued a t ^ 3 3 5 > ° i of which £ 2 2 0 , 0 0 0 worth0 o or about two-thirds-cam e fr->m the United Kingdom.

Yet the Treasurer and his supporters speak of this importation as if . it were of foreign origin. It is perfectly clear that Great Britain does not require a preference in this connection. She already enjoys a natural preferenceprobably because the British article is superior to the German. Perhaps those who advocate the imposition of a high protective duty upon wire-netting are not aware that they are desirous of subsidizing an industry which employs chiefly boy labour, and which, from its very nature,, can never do' anything else. I think that the proportion of boys to men engaged in the industry is as four to one. It is certain, however, that boys are mostly employed. manufacture is not one that involves any specially skilled labour, except in regard to the fixing of the mesh and the width. The netting is woven on a power frame, and, after the frame has been set to the mesh and the width, the labour required is simply that of feeding, which is done by boys, who are engaged at comparatively small wages. The honourable member for Calare told us yesterday that the most skilled workman, who was supposed to be an expert, received no more than £ 2 2s. a week, and we may well wonder what the boys are paid, if that is the remuneration of an expert. with the firm for ten years ! also informed that the labour cost per mile is something like 23s. 6d., while the price charged for the netting runs from £ 2 7 to £ 3 7 per mile, in some cases, perhaps more; and yet we are asked to afford enormous protection to the industry. What is to become of the boys when they become too old for this class of work? They will drift into the world, with the best years of their lives, which shouid be devoted to learning some trade, absolutely wasted on work the knowledge of which is of no utility in their future. ' Only a small proportion of those boys, even if they do become skilled workmen, can be employed in this or any other factory of the kind. alone/ from the labour point of view, the . duty proposed by the Minister, or the proposal of the honourable member for Riverina, is most, undesirable. Something has been said about the reduction in the price of wire-netting, and the Treasurer informed us that if the duty proposed be passed, the manufacturers in Australia are prepared to give a bond not to increasetheir present charges. It will be interesting to consider the question of cost. Theprices I am about to quote were sent by Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Company, the. Melbourne agents of Lysaght Brothers, toone of the principal hardware merchantsin Melbourne on the 3rd bf this month. For imported wire-netting f.o.b the cost per mile in June last was £18 19s. gA. r for wire-netting 36 inches wide by if-in., mesh, and 17-in. gauge.

Lysaghts' price for the-same article delivered, net cash, was£ 2 7 2s. 6d.; so that it will be seen that thelocally-madearticle already commands a. higher price, and that there is no necessity for' imposing a duty in order to raise the imported price. ber quote the price for Lysaghts' standard 1 wire-netting 42 inches by 1 j inch ? is for wire 42 inches by inch, and the price is ,£37 per mile. Another quality of imported wire-netting is 36 inches by i j in. mesh by 17-in. gauge. The cost per mile, f.o.b., was £ 2 7 16s. 2d., and importing expenses £ 2 18s. pd., or a total of £ 3 ° 4Snd .

Buti f no such action is taken, we shall probably be engaged in the discussion of the Tariff until June next. would resign rather than be dictated to in that manner. being dictated to now, and could not exist without the support of the Labour Party, which is dictating to it all the time. I hope that the leader of the party will intimate to the Treasurer that the Tariff is not satisfactory, because it presses heavily on the masses of the people, who are complaining loudly. He has only to say the word and it will be thrown under the table immediately. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [4-35]-I have listened with a great deal of interest to a number of the speeches which have been delivered. Although the discussion has been long, I ' do not think that the time small blocks, the farmers have little trouble has been wasted. As has been observed by several speakers, the item before us is one of the most important in the schedule. But its discussion has involved some rather comical elements. We find that some of those who in the past have proclaimed protection from the housetops are now going to vote for free-trade, whilst others who have preached free-trade all their lives are now going to vote protection. I listened with a great deal of interest and profit to the pathetic and eloquent appeal of the leader of the Opposition on behalf of those who are suffering from the rabbit pest. But some of the grounds on which he based it I regarded as very faulty. Taking, up the schedule, he pointedout that the duties collected, on machinery used in hat and woollen mills are to be refunded to the manufacturers, and he asked why the farmers should nof be similarly treated. If it were a right thing to return the duties that I speak of, it might also be a right thing to return the duty on wire-netting; but I say, emphatically, that it is not right, and being wrong in one connection, it is wrong in both. I am going to be consistent in this matter, and shall therefore do my best to remove the exemption in favour of the manufacturers of Jiats and woollens. But I do not think that a case has been made out for admitting wire-netting free of duty. I have tried to ascertain how the proposed duty will affect the farmers. For many years I lived in a farming community, and a number -of small farmers are my personal friends, so that I kno\v exactly the diffi: culties with which they are faced in rabbit infested country. But those difficulties have been exaggerated. It is those who hold large tracts of country who find the rabbit pest most serious. In a sense thispest is likely to prove a blessing rather than a curse, because it will bring about the cutting up of large holdings and the increase of small settlers. holdings is increased, a larger quantity of wire-netting will be needed. Mr J. H . CATTS -Wher e there is closer settlement, the rabbit pest is. a less serious thing than where the holdings are large. I admit that where closer settlement is confined to a small area, and is; surrounded by a large area of practically unoccupied land, the position is different; but where there is a large extent of close settlement, the land being divided up into in keeping down the rabbits, with the aid of their children and a few sporting dogs. settlement in the western district of New South Wales, where a man cannot make a living on 50,000 acres? The rabbitcannot live there half it.s time. Mr J. H . CATTS -Then there is no wire-netting problem there. acre block there for almost nothing. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member for Calare said that on inquiring the price of wire-netting, he was told that it was £ 4 0 a mile, or per ton, to the consumer, whereas the manufacturers sell it for £ 3 0 , and the imported article is brought in at about £ 2 6 ios. He pointed out that the farmers are, therefore, called upon to pay £ 1 4 a ton for the expenses of retailing. But I do not think that we are called upon to safeguard the farmer when he has at hand the means of studying his own interests. In many cases the farmers have gone in largely for cooperation, and, by joining associations, are able to purchase wire-netting and other requirements at wholesale prices. Therefore, they have a remedy in their own hands. To ascertain the probable effect of a duty",28,Tariff

CATTS I hold in my hand an estimate, of Mr Bent's undertaking, which sets out the capital required to start the manufacture of wire-netting. The only difference between the amount that would be needed under his scheme-which , by the way, does not commend itself to meand that required under a proper scheme for its nationalization would be accounted for by the fact that he would get his labour for nothing, whereas we should have to pay for it. Mr Martin, the Secretary of the Public Works Department of Victoria, estimates that the erection of a plant, including house, machinery, and appliances, would be £7,000. This plant would be .capable of turning out sixteen miles of 42-in. width 17-gauge netting per week-, equal to 22.2-5 to n s A mile of this netting weighs 28 cwt., of which 24 -cwt. consists of wire, and 4 cwt. of zinc {galvanizing). The cost of wire delivered is £ 1 4 ios. per ton, and of zinc £ 3 1 12s. per ton. Mr Martin considers that the cost of a week's operations, resulting in the production of 22.2-5 tons of wire-netting, would be as follows:-Ra w materials, wire and zinc, £379 ios.; labour, one exipert at £ 4 ios., and thirty men at an average wage of £ 2 , £ 6 4 ios.; allowance for wear and tear, and depreciation in value of plant, at 10 per cent, per annum, £ 1 3 9s. 4d. j or a total of £457 9s. 4d. That represents the cost of manufacturing 22.2-5 tons, so that the cost per ton would average £ 2 0 8s. 5d. If we add to that, interest on capital at 5 per cent, per annum per ton of output, it would represent 5s. 6d., and 2 per cent, as office and selling costs would represent 8s. 2d. ; so that the estimated cost of placing one ton of wire-netting upon the market would be £ 2 1 2s. rod. Lysaght Brothers charge? Mr J, H . CATTS -About £ 2 6 . .£30 a ton for rabbit-proof netting. Mr J. H. CATTS -Thei r quotation for 36-in. wire of i j in. mesh is £ 2 6 ios. per ton. The cost of the 42-in. wire is set down at £ 3 1 per ton, or £ 3 0 ios. upon trucks. The Treasurer stated that, at the present time, Messrs. Lysaght Brothers were selling wire-netting, 42 inches wide, with i£-in. mesh, at £ 3 0 ios. per ton. He added that they had agreed to alwayskeep the price down to £ 1 per ton less than that charged for the imported article. Mr J. H . CATTS Mr Martin statesI have endeavoured to make liberal allowance . for all costs, and I calculate that the annual profit on outlay, including plant, material, labour, allowance for wear and tear, and selling cost, would be 7.15 per cent. the honourable member has quoted refer to the Pentridge factory ? Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes. placed upon the wire-netting manufactured there ? Mr J. H . CATTS I do not mind an occasional interjection which is destitute of point, but continual interjections of that character I protest against. Mr Martin continuesThis is on a very small scale of operations. A larger plant would, perhaps, return quite 8 per cent, per annum. In England raw material would cost less; labour would also be cheaper. Against these are c.i.f. charges, which would amount to about £ 2 per ton. I say, again, that if , under the new protection scheme, we cannot control the manufacturers of wire-netting-if we cannot insure that the consumer shall be called upon to pay only a fair price for this material, and that the operatives engaged in the industry shall receive a living wagethe State should establish its own works. I am sure that if the industry were nationalized it would be able to produce quite as good, if not a better, article than that manufactured by private enterprise, and any profit that might accrue from the undertaking would find its way into the Treasury. ber suggest that the broad arrow be the union label ?

That honourable member, with a great deal of force, urged that we were beginning at the wrong end in the consideration of the item of wireber knows that I am now a strong advonetting-that there were other matters which ought to have been dealt with before we fix the duty on this commodity. It was exactly such a consideration as' that which caused the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission to draw up a classification;, in a friendly attitude towards the Government, whom it would have enabled, in our opinion, to place before the House a Tariff which would have been scientific in its incidence, and which would probably have been disposed of at a much earlier date than is possible under present circumstances. gested by the free-trade section of the Commission, the Tariff could have been made either moderately protective, highly protective, or merely a revenue Tariff; whatever rates of duties might, have been selected, the Government would have found a method by which to build up a Tariff containing none of the anomalies and absurdities which, I feel bound to say, will be found in the present Tariff when it is completed. It is true that in the classification of the free-trade section of. the Tariff Commission, wire-netting was subject to a duty of 5 per cent, j and we have been twitted"" with the fact that most of those free-trade members intend to vote that the commodity shall be'placed on the free list. The position is like that .which would arise if the Government had taken a -brick out of a house that I had built, and, having put it into an> erection of their own, asked me to come along and approve of the latter as my owrt building. The Government have taken a section of the Commission, and put it in> are, gentlemen; there is a building that' contains one brick of yours, and you ought: to admire the structure."" But we decline very respectfully to do anything of the The position that sort. However, I say, in reply to the honourable member for Cook that, if the Government, or any one else who desires toadopt our systemi of classification in its' entirety, I shall, although there are several1 anomalies in it, and several duties which I should not be prepared to support individually, vote for every particular item as it stands. free-trader to talk about a revenue Tariff with this enthusiasm! cate for the new protection, and that I can even claim to have led the Government into the right path by. some amendments which I proposed in the anti-trust legislation of last year. AlthoughI am here as a Labour representative, I must say I am getting somewhat tired of listening to this claptrap about the necessity of protecting the worker in this particular industry by a. high duty. It has been shown this afternoon, that even if Germany-to the competition of which members like the honourable member for Batman so much object-di d this work Under the system sugfor nothing, 7 per cent, would more than equalize the difference as represented by the wages. Mr J. H . CATTS -Something more could be said on that point. had been anything more to say, the honor-' able member would have said it ; but I take it that he dealt with the subject, from his own stand-point, in the most effective way of which he was capable. At any rate, considering that 7 per cent, would cover the whole cost of labour, I fail to see any necessity, in the interests of the workers, for any higher duties. Honourable members who",34,Tariff

On the contrary, it is the foreigner whom those honourable members desire to keep out of the market, and not the manufacturers of Great Britain. ence scheme amounts, according to a confession by one protectionist before the Tariff Commission, to a prohibitive wall against Great Britain, and an ornamental -coping on the top against the foreigner. I ask honourable members, who hesitate about placing the white workers of Australia in competition with the workers of Germany, whether they intend free men in Australia to work in .competition with unfortunate prisoners in Pentridge gaol? Is that the idea? There is no doubt that the Government of Victoria intend to establish this industry in the principal gaol of the State, and I , for one, do not desire to see free, honest men in competition with those engaged in what the State Government intends to make the occupation of criminals. In view of other facts that have been placed before honourable members, showing that' there is much.more labour involved in the erection of wire-netting, if it can be obtained at reasonable cost, than in its mere manufacture, I believe that, if there is any virtue in protection, the policy' ought to be applied to the greatest number. _ If promanufacturers will see that the price is intectionists are true to their own principles, they will follow the example of the honourable member for Batman, who, having a large confectionery establishment in his electorate, voted for the introduction of glucose free of duty. That is undoubtedly common-sense protection; and yet a good many protectionist members gird at the free-traders as being more or less inconsistent. I expect I shall have an opportunity to retort on some of those protectionists more than once before the Tariff is disposed of. The honourable member for Cook thinks that the rabbits might be allowed to run the squatters out of the country. I have strong objection to the man who takes up an area of land which might be occupied by many more human beings -with advantage to themselves and to the country. But I believe in changing the present conditions, from which Australia undoubtedly suffers, by an honest and straightforward method. I hold the opinion that even a squatter ought to be treated according to the rules of ordinary justice. times more small farmers than it does this to be altogether a squatters' question, I say,_ in regard to the evil of squarterdom, that we have no right to create conditions The preferwhich would enable the rabbits to do what we cannot honestly and straightforwardly do for ourselves: But I do not agree with those who say that this is merely a squatters' question. It is. unfortunate that many honourable members have addressed themselves to this subject from a very local point of view; but, seeing that they have clone so, it is necessary for me to add more local colour, so that by-ana-by we may have a general blend applicable to the whole of the Commonwealth. I come from Western Australia, the whole.of the southwestern portion of which, with very few exceptions, is being taken up in comparatively small areas. Although there are no rabbits in that part of Western Australia, the settlers there suffer from the dingo pest, and many of them are compelled to wire-net their holdings. The honourable member for Cook says that the imposition of the duty will impose a tax of only £ 1 5 on the farmer who has 640 acres to wirenet. Mr J. H .

These people cannot spread it over a number of years, and many of them have to look at every £ i they spend, because their capital is very limited, so that an addition of £ 1 5 to the cost of their wire-netting will be a very serious thing to them. No doubt, the effect of the duty will be that many persons will be prevented from using wire-netting, and thus settlement may be retarded. However, as the debate has been so fengthv, I shall not say more on the subject. I do not think that votes are changed by the speeches which are made in this Chamber) and I am becoming very cynical as to the effect on the views of members of parliamentary discussions. opinion, they might be curtailed with great advantage to the country. agree with the honourable member for Perth that 'nothing that may be said is likely to influence votes, but it is necessary local cement in the construction of thethat members should, on occasions, state their reasons for voting in a certain direction. I shall vote for the highest duty on wire-netting that I can get. I am sorry that the Government has agreed to a reduction of the original rates proposed. With regard to what has been said about the making of wire-netting in a Victorian prison, I think that the Minister would be well advised to propose an Excise duty, which would enable the Commonwealth to control these operations. Mr ""HUTCHISON -Why not give the farmers the benefit of them? the competition of the wire-netting produced in Pentridge will cause Messrs. Lysaght Brothers to reduce their prices, to the consequent benefit of the farmer.. But as this Parliament has enacted that goods made in prisons abroad shall under no circumstances be ""admitted into AusH. CATTS -In New South tralia, I am opposed to the making of goods in Australian prisons. If an Excise duty were imposed on wire-netting, and the Government of Victoria desired! to have it made in the prisons of this State,, it would be compelled to pay the regulation rates of wages. The speeches of members of the Opposition must lead a stranger to conclude that those who support the Ministry desire to prevent the farmers from getting wire-netting cheap ;but, as one who has the interests of our settlers at heart, I say that we shall bedoing them the best service by imposing, a high duty on wire-netting, because that will _ cheapen its cost. When the first Commonwealth Tariff was under consideration, the honourable member for Adelaideproposed a duty on cement of is. per cwt., or about 3s. per cask, which Parliament in its wisdom or unwisdom reduced too,d. per cwt., or about 2s. 6d. per cask.

But what has happened?"" I take the facts which I am about to relate from the Sydney Morning Herald, afree-trade newspaper.

The honourable member for Boothby stated last night that the New South Wales industry has grown to its present proportions without the assistance of protected duties, but, according to the Statistical Register of New South Wales there was a duty of 5 per cent, on wire-netting in 1887 or 1888 when the industry was established. The JenningsDibbs Government was then in office, but the previous P.arkes Governmenta free trade Administration-ha d imposed a duty of 20s. per ton on wire work. Besides, those who are conversant with the affairs of New South Wales must know that differential railway rates in favour of locally manufactured articles, such as wire-netting and galvanized iron, ruled there even when the -present leader of the Opposition was in office. I am sorry that the Government has suggested a reduction of these duties. I shall vote for a rate of 15 per cent, against all imports, abolishing the preference, and if that be not carried, I shall vote for the highest rate that I can get. hope that the Treasurer will stiffen his back as regards this duty, and that he will also take into consideration my suggestion to impose an Excise on wire-netting, to enable the Commonwealth to control prison manufacture. not think that the solution of the whole social problem is involved in this question, or that the position of the States in regard to closer settlement will be seriously affected whether we impose a duty on wire netting or place it on the free list. In any event, we must have closer settlement. When the first Federal Tariff was under consideration, the principle which guided us in determining the rates of duty to be imposed was that some protection should be given to industries already in existence which needed assistance, but that the requirements of the people on the land should be absolutely free. therefore placed on the free list, and I have heard nothing during this debate to satisfy me that we should depart from the decision then arrived at. Eveni f the wire netting industry is a going concern, we have to consider whether it really needs protection, and whether, in the absence of a protective duty, it would be crushed out. ' As a matter of fact, the wire-netting industry was in existence in New South Wales when the first Federal Tariff was under consideration; but we then heard nothing about it . It is a remarkable fact that Lysaght Brothers did not see fit to give evidence before the Tariff Commission. The Commission visited Sydney and other cities, and invited every one concerned to appear before it, yet no representative of the company in question saw fit to go before it and submit himself for cross examination. I do not believe in attaching much importance to ex -parte statements by those who have neglected an opportunity to give evidence 'before a ""body of men who could submit them to the test of cross-examination. It is true that one of the company's experts, receiving the remarkably high wage of 42s. per week, went before the Commission, but he could say nothing as to the profits of the company or the lines upon which it conducted its business. We are now asked to impose a duty in favour of a company which has enjoyed a monopoly, and which' has not been paying extravagant wages. I high wages? ought to know that wages have no relation to profits. Some companies, making very large profits, pay very low wages. Apparently Lysaght Brothers were so well satisfied with existing conditions that they did not think it necessary to go before a Commission specially appointed to inquire into the conditions of Australian industries to ask for a duty. One honourable member seems to think that it is undesirable to allow wire-netting to be used for rabbitproof fencing purposes. He spoke of the rabbits as being a good thing, and a source of profit. If he paid a visit to my electorate, he would have his eyes opened to the true position. I happen to have within my constituency the greatest number of persons directly interested in this question. They comprise, not big pastoralists, but the smaller men, who are entitled to expect the support of the Labour Party. These. Wire-netting was men carry on operations in the western part of the Central Division of New South Wales, and their holdings are within the drought area. The Government subdivided the land in that part of the district into blocks of 2,560 acres, and a little further on they offered blocks of from 5,000 to 10,oooacres to settlers. Those holdings have been settled. A number of Victorian farmers, who were sturdy protectionists, and whose knowledge of farming could not be gainsaid, took up land in the neighbourhood of the Bogan River. Every one of them went there with plenty",37,Tariff

215,Mr Spence,"The honourable memberof money, yet to-day they are practically down to their last copper. Their losses have been due, not to want of skill or -enterprise, but to purely adverse conditions. it. What nonsense it is to talk of this item I suppose that the 2,560-acre blocks were intended for mixed farming; yet I know of holders of such blocks who have not had a hoof on their land for five years. I wish to appeal to the Committee on 'behalf of these people. Representatives of metropolitan constituencies seem to know nothing of the actual situation in rural districts. The erstwhile Victorian farmers to whom I have referred, although stout protectionists, are crying out against this impost. I have received letters from every Farmers' and Settlers' Association in my electorate, and have presented to the House a petition from fifty-four shire councils in New South Wales, praying that these duties be removed. The farmers and settlers are absolutely unanimous in their opposition to the duties on wire-nettirig. I suppose that the men to whom I have referred, on an average, do not enjoy more than three good -seasons out of ten. When they do have the good fortune to be blessed with a good season,, and secure some grass, the rabbit comes along and eats it up. I have just returned from the Trangie district, where the farmers just now have, to combat, not only rabbits, but a plague of -grasshoppers. One could pick up bucketfuls of grasshoppers from the ruts along the road. Imagine the position of men who put in a crop, not"" knowing whether they are likely to have any rain, or when theiT work may be destroyed by rabbits or grasshoppers. It may be true that some years ago wire-netting was used mostly by the pastoralist. The Australian rabbit, however, is more enterprising than any of his brothers in other lands. It has been said that he can climb trees and get over a wire fence. He has, at all events, worked his way from the pastoral areas into the farming districts. Last year I saw magnificent crops being destroyed by rabbits, and t-he pest is working its way from the wheat growing centre of Naromine right down to Bathurst. In these circumstances, therefore, the bond fide farmer has been forced to buy wire-netting. As a matter of fact, in the trans-Darling, wire-netting is not of . much use in combating the pest. There sand-drifts are formed by the wind, and bury the fences. I have driven over a -stock-yard 'fence entirely covered with sand, tion of duties upon such -articles as bags, and, on some runs, have seen sand ridges as high as the homestead. . I have also Mr Spence. seen a place wheTe a wire fence was buried in the sand within three years of its erection, and another fence erected on top of being one that affects only the big man. The smaller settler also needs wire-netting, and must have it. The Victorian farmers found that in the Bogan River district the soil was rich, and paid no heed to the big pastoralists, who told them that the rainfall was insufficient. They were inclined to believe that the pastoralists, as they sometimes do, simply desired to discourage them from taking up the land, but they have since found that the statement was absolutely justified. The Government of New South Wales let a contract for the supply of 4,000 miles of wire-netting, and Mr Ashton,. ex-Minister of Lands in New South Wales, states that applications have been received by the Government for 9,000 miles of netting. No private firm could give the farmers wire-netting on the easy terms upon'which the Government are able to supply it. The advance of socialistic thought in New South Wales has led the Government to come to the assistance ot the settlers. A practical man, writing to the Stock and Station Journal, gives an estimate of the cost of enclosing with wire netting a small area. Taking-the case of a farmer who desires to enclose an area of 40 acres, he estimates that the cost of the wire-netting which he would requireplus the duty originally proposed by the Government-woul d be £ 5 0 ; that the cost of the fence to carry the netting would be £ 1 5 ; and'the cost of the wire about £ 7 ; or a total of £ 7 2 , equal to 36s. per acre. In the Bogan River district a man cannot make a living on a 5,000-acre block, and yet it is said that, it would be nothing to ask holders of such blocks, many of whom are in an impoverished condition, to pay these duties. Something like 16,000 of my electors require wire-netting, whilst, on the other hand, only 400 persons are employed . in the wire-netting industry. Are we to have no regard for the iC,ooo farmers and settlers? Is all tlv; considerationto be extended to the 400 men and boys engaged in this industry ? I should like honourable members to recollect the principle which guided us in framing the first Commonwealth Tariff. I notice that the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommend the imposisacks, tents, tarpaulins, hessian, and wire netting. They even recommend the taxation of the working man's regalia, of the pipes of organs such as are used in churches, and of brass instruments which are used in town bands. I should like the honourable member for Lang to recollect this fact, because, when he twitted the Labour Party with supporting the present Government he did not say a word about the only alternative which confronts us. When the Kingston Tariff was under review in 1902, a good deal of agricultural machinery which was not manufactured in Australia was placed upon the free list, so that the user might obtain it as cheaply as possible. If we do not assist those who are already settled upon the land, a number of the holders of small areas will be driven off them. We shall then find ourselves in this position: We shall have established a wire-netting industry, but there will be. nobody to purchase that material. I am speaking from personal knowledge of the circumstances of a large number of settlers.. learning their exact condition, and I say, without hesitation, that they ought to receive first consideration at our hands. Unless we do our best for them, they will disappear from the land entirely. In my opinion, the wire-netting Industry can be encouraged far better by the payment of a bonus than it can by the imposition of a protective duty. A t the present time there is only one firm engaged in the industry, and it is paying its operatives very low wages. carry on when it possesses a monopoly of the trade, I do not thinlc that a duty of 5 per cent, upon wire-netting will help it very materially. If we had the absolute facts before us, it would probably be found that the industry can get along without any assistance whatever. It is scarcely fair to. charge the Premier of Victoria witn being a competitor in this industry. understand that he intends to supply the farmers of this State with cheap wire-netting, but it is not to be inferred for a moment that he intends to enter into competition with the manufacturers of that article in the open market. I hold that to have a monopoly is worth a great deal to any firm. Brothers are not to have a monopoly, because a factory is about to start in South Australia. say that a factory is about to start. The statement of the honourable member reminds me of that of the man who had millions of pounds in his pocket. manufactdred in South' Australia at the present time, and the building for the manufacture of wire-netting is in course of erection. pose a sufficiently high protective duty we shall encourage other competitors to enter the field. I contend that if we promote closer settlement the rabbit pest can be easily dealt with. It stands to reason; therefore, that after a time the demand for wire-netting will probably diminish. Consequently that article can hardly be included in the same category as other Australian productions which we desire to encourage. The wire-netting industry is not one which will grow with the increase of population, as will most industries. The new protection scheme puts a different complexion on the Tariff generally, and if I I have had an opportunity of thought that there was any real danger of the wire-netting industry Being destroyed,, my view upon this question would be very materially .modified. But I see nothing to justify the belief that it cannot live and succeed under similar conditions to those which have existed since Federation was accomplished. member want it to expand? if it is unable to successfully would be cheaper to buy Messrs. Lysaght Brothers out and to pay thetr hands £ 5 a week for being idle than to impose a high duty upon wire-netting. would apply to three-fourths of our industries. J the industry will be seriously affected by placing wire-netting upon the free list.. The evidence available to us is that it has lived and thrived that. I cannot accept ex -parte statements. Why did not the principals in the industryappear before the Tariff Commission, and give evidence to that effect? I take no Messrs. Lysaght notice of these wild statements. I attach as much importance to them as I do to the statement of the man who declared that he intended to withdraw £10,000,00 0 from Australia because of the influence of the Labour Party in politics.

If the Government had attempted to press the duty they first proposed, I should have had no hesitation in voting for placing wire-netting on the free list. But the. Government have consented to make a big reduction; and, before casting my vote, I should like to know from .the Treasurer whether a duty of 10 per cent., as against Great Britain, and 15 per cent., as against foreign countries, is regarded by him as protective, or merely as revenue producing. as sufficiently protective to enable the manufacture to be carried on in Australia, it was, in my opinion, unfair, and, I might say, almost idiotic to, in the first instance, propose a duty of 25 per cent, and 30 per cent. duty which is merely revenue producing, commodity. scandalous to impose a revenue duty on wire-netting; and, before we go further, I should like an answer to the question I have asked. surer that the lower duty now suggested is sufficiently protective, I shall not object to its being imposed. The only justification for the existence of the present Ministry, is their protectionist policy. sion closes on this item; I shall answer the question of the honourable member. some advantage in having wire-netting locally manufactured, and, therefore, if a 10 per cent, duty will assist to that end, it shall have my support. Government now regard a duty of 10 per cent, as sufficient to enable the wire-netting industry to be carried on in Australia, because, otherwise, it was for the Treasurer to adhere to the original proposal. that the Government have given up their protectionist policy in regard to this item. ther that is so or not. It may be that the Government have obtained some further information which indicates that a duty of 10 per cent, is sufficiently protective; if not, they should have proposed a higher duty. WhetherI should support the Government in imposing a higher duty is, of course, another question. I am opposed to anv preference being given under this Tariff, because, in my opinion, whatever duties are imposed ought to. apply all round. A l though I am not a protectionist, I am prepared, under this Tariff, to give fair and reasonable protection in the case of commodities which can be manufactured in Australia, but, in the case of commodities which cannot be manufactured here, I shall vote for their being placed on the free list, no matter from what country they come. tured here. protection; I "" am to be the judge of what is reasonable, and I think I may say If the reduced duty is regarded the Government will not find me too exacting.

The matter, affecting as it does our Imperial relations, is one of the most important which can come under our attention. The preferences given last year applied to only £1,473,189 worth of British imports, {he total imports from the United Kingdom, in 1905, being £23,074,717; and of those affected, only £790,607 compete with foreign imports. Therefore, what was then agreed to was merely a petty modification of the principle of protection in favour of one of the biggest consumers of our exports, even if it were not the country, which, with real significance, we continue to refer to in the language of affection as "" Home."" The principle of reciprocal commercial concessions is now proposed to be substituted for the ties of affection and blood which have withstood every strain of Empire so well. I intend to state my objections to this recognition of Chamberlainism with as much effect as I can, while curtailing my remarks to an extent that the necessities of expedition justify. Honourable members will bear in mind that the question was raised in a speech made by Mr Chamberlain in, I think, May, 1903, in which he laid it down that preference must become the basic principle of Empire; that the Empire would fall to pieces unless it becamecommercially self-contained; that, in fact, unless we went, through reciprocal preferences, to an intermediate stage of free-trade between British possessions, and ultimate political union, the days of the Empire would be numbered. On the 8th December, 1904, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth took up the tune, and in a series of resolutions declared, in effect, that the proposals of the then Secretary of State for the Colonies must increase the unity and power of the EmpireI am pleased that some months ago the House of Commons absolutely repudiated the principle of preference as having anything to do withour continued Imperial integrity. If one had to rely merely upon expert authority as to the unwisdom of preference, I could quote several in support of my position. Let me first refer to Mulhall. He says thatAny attempt at an Imperial zollverein between Great Britain ancl her Colonies would be ruinous to the latter, and would ultimately break up the Empire. . In an article in the Spectator it is said that anything of the sort "" would act as a destructive force, and nothing else."" Lord. Rosebery, speaking on the 13th December, 1903, said that the return to protection through the preferential duties advocated by Mr Chamberlain was "" a blow which must be fatal to the majestic structure of our commerce, ancl of our Empire."" If we require proofs for those statements we mav find them in English experience. Great Britain recognized preferences up to sixty years ago, when they were abolished. In 1842, speaking on one of the first motions for their abolition, Lord Grey made a declaration which is applicable to the present momentIndustry should cease to be diverted from its natural channels, and a useless burden imposed on the consumer by different duties levied for the purpose of favoring colonial produce in our markets and our produce in the markets of the world. England abolished preferences in i860, while France and other countries have continued to grant them to their colonies; but the condemnation of the system is to be found in the fact that the external trade of British possessions is about ten times that of those of France. In 1842 a duty of 3s. a quarter was imposed on wheat imported from the United States into Great Britain, and a duty of is. on that imported from Canada, a preference of 2s. in favour of the Dominion. In 1846, when the corn laws were repealed, that preference, of course, ceased. The Canadians strongly remonstrated, and almost talked of secession, so that Mr Gladstone was obliged to mention in a despatch, dated 3rd June, 1846That it would be a source of the greatest pain to Her Majesty's Government if they could share in the impression that the connection between this country and Canada derived its vitality from no other source than the exchange of commercial preference. It seems to me that, when the real force fails upon which the unity of the Empire depends, when the subtle, magnetic, and attractive influences of race, tradition, and common destiny, which operate among nations as the domestic affections do among families, begin to wane, then, and not until then, need we feel anxiety as to the stability of the Imperial framework, or fear that the greatest alliance of self governing communities which the world has ever known, is approaching its dissolution. When sentiment fails, it will be idle to think that Acts of Parliament, or the power of purse can do anything to check the inevitable disintegration. The bane at present is that everything is measured by the mercantile standard. Let me refer to a resolution-on e of a class passed each year by this body-agree d to iby the Chamber of Commerce at its meeting in London on the 9th July, 1906. The members of that bodv then affirmed that the bonds of union would be strengthened by preferences. This reliance upon commercial preferences for the continued integrity of the Empire is expressed by bodies whose members have a direct pecuniary interest in the policy which they say they regard as the true nexus of Empire. Happily, the nation is not altogether imbued with the shop-keeping spirit and sentiment, and at the last elections it rejected, by an overwhelming majority, the declaration of the basic principle of connection contained in the resolution just referred to. the North American Review of last year, a Canadian protectionist writesIn Canada they want not to abolish the British preference or even reduce the percentage of preference, but to raise the general Tariff so high that when the preference is allowed the minimum Tariff will be high enough to set off the greater cost of labour and higher rates of interest, thus placing the Canadian manufacturer -on an equality with the British competitor. That was. the explanation of the protectionist policy of ' Canada given by a leading protectionist at a time when, I believe, the Canadian Minister of Customs was introducing a change from a 33^ per cent, preference to the present system of differentiating according to the item, which is the principle which we"" are asked to adopt. The best of the British writers at the present time condemn the principle of preference. from an article dealing with the result of the Imperial Conference which was published in the Edinburgh Review of July, 1907To our thinking the safest condition of that magniticent and unique political entity called the British Empire,, is that it should remain as Amorphous as possible, and that it is best described and will be most safely maintained as a number of practically independent States, acknowledging one sovereign, bound together by -unembarrassing ties of blood and origin, and of -consequent affection, filial and parental. There is no doubt that if the political goal which is the objective of Mr Chamberlain and those who follow him is ever attained, in. the matters delegated we shall lose our independence of judgment and decision. It means the submission of questions in relation to which we now have an absolute Mr Glynn. voice to the majority vote of a body in which we shall ultimately have representation in 'proportion to ' population. MightI remind honourable members that just before the opening of the last Imperial Conference a very strong series of articles appeared in the London Times, declaring the true objective of those advocating prefer 7 ence. In an article on the Conference and Imperial unity which appeared in*the issue of 12th April, 1907, a writer dwelt particularly upon the great burden of the defence vote, which is practically borne entirely by the Imperial power. After an elaboration of the position as regards what he considered to be the true nexus of Empire and the necessity of the dependencies of the Crown and its Colonial possessions recognising their liability for a more eauitable contribution towards naval defence, he In an article in continuedThe whole position is an impossible one, and cannot last. Some solution of the difficulty must be found. The one is separation, the other Imperial partnership. The colonies must become absolutely independent States, conducting the whole of their external affairs without interference and without help, or else they must become equal nartners in a united Empire, based upon the principle of mutual support and joint responsibility. There can be no final solution which stops short of the two alternative conclusions. I merely give this as a statement of what is in view in connection with the policy of preference. It is the deliberate pronouncement of the leading organ of public opinion in England, so far as the press can be assumed to be an organ of public opinion. What is meant, supposing that' we are berlain and the Times? The naval expenditure of the United Kingdom is 15s. 5^d. Let me give an extract per head of its population, and the average per head of the seven colonies is 6d., and that of the Commonwealth is. 3jd.

I have just said, whatever control we were entitled to, either on the basis of wealth and' population or on that of population alone.

239,Mr Glynn,"We should have, as the independent voice of Australia, to submit ourselves to the rule of the majority. Let us consider for a moment the position of the mother country. It is a country of vast responsibilities. any of its dependencies give rise to international troubles, the burden of the responsibility has to be. borne by the home country. Wo all remember the tremendous outlayI think it was £235,060,000-in curred by England in connection with the Boer war. That was a colonial war, in which she had no direct interest; but up to the present she has practically borne every penny of the direct outlay, represented by payments out of revenue, and the debt incurred. I believe that the responsibility as to £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 which was to be undertaken by the new self-governing colonies of South Africa is still merely a 'possibility, rather than a real burden shifted from the Imperial taxpayers to the Colonies in question. Britain this preference we should net increase her burdens. berlain. It is not for us to embarrass the Liberal Party at Home by giving Mr Chamberlain and his party an opportunity to say that we have made a specific offer of preference to the mother land. If we do, we shall put the Conservatives, in a strong position when they attempt to renew the agitation for reciprocal preference. The position is that France, Germany, Italy, the United States, and Japan, during the last twenty or thirty years, nave become powerful competitors with the United Kingdom for the trade of the' world. Nevertheless, Great Britain has 38 per cent, of the total external' trade of France, Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom. galled upon to make any petty preference for the purpose of strengthening her sogalled waning supremacy. The imports of Great Britain in 1906 were of the value of £607,000,000 , and 76.6 per cent, of those imports came from foreign countries, only 23.4 per cent, coming from British Possessions. If we glance at the comparison of percentages of imports from 1854 to 1906, we find that they are practically constant, and therefore, as being, apparently, natural commercial relations, ought not to be disturbed by any new system. In addition to that, the effects of the unfettered policy of the mother country justify a continuance of the old system. The exports of the United Kingdom, deducting re-exports, are equal to £ 8 15s. per head, those of Germany to£ 5 2s. i d . per head, France£ 5 3s. 6d. per If tlie politics of head, and America£ 4 12s. 4d. per head* of the population. That is very strong evidence that there is no necessity to make any petty concessions in favour of the mother country. Let us take the positions of Australia. It was said during the disr cussion at -the Imperial Conference early this year that Great Britain's trade with Australia was gradually diminishing. I think that the present Federal Treasurer, in a speech extending from page 325 to P ge 330 of the Minutes of the Proceeda ings, gave a rather doleful description ot the position of the mother country, in so far as her exports to her possessions were concerned, The burden of his tale was that, unless some system of reciprocal preference were instituted, the mother country would go to the wall. ports were diminishing, or that the relative increase in them was not being maintained ? words used by the Treasurer, but the effect of his speech was that the exports of B r i tish products-and I think he was dealing with manufactured products-to British. Possessions, and especially to Australia, were gradually diminishing. rect statement. at hand a report of the exact words used"" by the Minister. The position is that, deducting exports to us representing loans, from 1881 to 1905, the value of British exports to Australia increased from£69,500,000 to £141,000,000. There has been undoubtedly a slight decrease recently in her exports of manufactured That being so, we are not products to us; but in reports from the Colonies or Dependencies, obtained some years ago by Mr Chamberlain, as Secretary of State for the Colonies, that was attributed to the increased manufacturing activities of the Colonies. That fact ought to be borne in mind in connection with our present scheme. We are now imposing, under the guise of preference to Great Britain, new duties irjoon articles that we are importing from the old land Thus we shall be checking our import trade with the Home country by the imposition of duties on articles whdch, under the old Tariff, were free or, at all events, subject to lower imposts. ;",43,Smith Th E Inference Is In Australia

In 1905 the Commonwealth exported to the United Kingdom £26,995,126 worth of goods, of which only £ 1 4 8 , 3 4 8 worth were subject to duty. Where, then, is there room for anything in the way of reciprocal preference? On the other hand, what do we do?

If there is to be a preference I hope that it will be one of 50 per cent. I should, like to refer to 'fifteen or sixteen items to show what the proposed amounts to,' and to ask Ministers, if they really mean business, to accept the larger abatement which is suggested on the import duties. The preference is given in somet cases in respect of goods which Great Britain is not naturally favoured to produce, and therefore to the extent to which it is not ""the tax will be one upon imports. As Great Britain cannot supply under the lower rate, the higher rate against the foreigner will be the operative one, ancl to that extent it will mean protective taxation, or taxation of the local consumer.

These are the leading characteristics of the scheme suggested by the Government. Let me take a few items by way of illustration. The Tariff imposes a duty of 5s. 6d. per cwt. upon ammunition from foreign countries, and of 5s. i d . per cwt. upon ammunition from the United Kingdom. In 1906 the imports from the United Kingdom totalled and of these the 233 cwt., those from Germany3 cwt., and those from the United States4 cwt.

All sorts of reasons have been given why we should not protect this particular industry, and I shall, as briefly as possible, indicate some reasons why we should. It is said that this is only a small industry; and the honourable member for Darling trotted out the old argument of the free trader, that we might as well support the 400 employees in idleness. If that argument were applied to all the small industries of the Commonwealth, I am afraid we should have a large army of men out of employment. But is this a small industry ? It is stated by the Treasurer that one firm alone employs 400 hands, and a further statement, has been made that the employees number 600. spelter was obtained in this country, it was alleged that the wire-netting industry was not worth preserving. But, as a matter of fact, not only wire-netting, but spelter is produced in New South Wales at the present time, and it is to be hoped that spelter works will be started elsewhere than at Cockle Creek.' I am glad to say that iron is now being made in Australia; and it will not be long before there will be manufactured locally the wire necessary for making the netting, and in this way employment provided for more men. pose, we are to let the rabbits have their fling. men of the ridiculous statements we hear from time to time. would lead one to believe that the proposal is that, if the Tariff be agreed to, no farmer or pastoralist will be able to get a yard of wire-netting. procurable, of course, but at £ 8 more a ton, ' £ 8 a ton more under this Tariff, we may be sure that it would be £ 1 0 or £ 1 5 if [160] the local industry were destroyed. The honourable member for Grey knows very well that, before this industry had attained any proportions, the importers of wire-netting in South Australia charged much more than the present prices. According to the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South Australia, as shown in an Otherwise, we shall official record the other day, the importers time and dislocate the were then charging £ 3 7s. od. a ton more than a fair price. industry had been started in Australia. fact, the price was j£6 per ton more than it ought to have been, but there was a desire to keep within the mark when making the calculation. At that time, comparatively speaking, only a few yards of wire netting were produced per week, and the industry was conducted under free-trade conditions. If we ask manufacturers to conduct their business under free-trade conditions, we shall have but small hope of extending industries in Australia. I do not intend to speak in favour of Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, who, I believe, have not treated their employees f a i r l y ; but the Ministry, and the party to which I belong, When it was denied that intend to insist that firms to which protection is given shall in the future act fairly towards their employees. This firm turn's out 330 miles of netting a week, so that its business is considerable, and will have the effect of preventing importers from charging such prices as they may think fit to impose. No honourable member has shown that the local manufacturers are likely to increase the price of wire-netting. They have already reduced it by £ 1 a ton. Buti f Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, and the South Australian firm which is now making barbed wire and nails, and intends to make wire-netting, increase the price after the Tariff passed, the Board which the Minister intends to establish will 'have an opportunity to declare whether T h a t is a specithev are charging more than is fair.

When fhe Government of South Australia found that the farmers and pastoralistsof that State were being charged £ 6 a ton more than the fair price for wire-netting, it acceded to a request of a deputation from the Labour Paity, asking it to purchase netting and sell it to the people on the land. If , after thc Tariff has passed, the local manufacturers and importers combine together to raise prices, it will be open to this Government to buy wire-netting in the old world and supply it to the people of the Commonwealth, or, if they cannot get it reasonably enough in that way, to manufacture it.

Undoubtedly the price of commodities will, ir* many instances, be reduced by the imposition of protective duties.

South Wales for the express purpose of fighting against the Carruthers Government. So much for the consistency ' of an honourable member who attacks others for their lack of it. Although he is now a pledged member of the Labour thers in the terms I have just indicated. WhilstI have pleaded guilty to inconsistency, I have the right to plead absolute justification for the attitude I take up in regard to this item. If I were the staunchest protectionist in this Parliament I should still consider that I was justified in abrogating the principles of protection in relation to the duty on wire-netting, having regard to its important bearing on our producing interests, and to the mighty financial, propositions which are involved in the production of wool, wheat, and butter. In the interests of those great and important industries upon which the welfare of Australia depends, I feel that I am justified in the course that I have taken up. I am prepared to support the Government generally in respect of a policy of moderate, reasonable, and sensible protection, but I am not prepared to penalize the whole of Australia, and to make our producers pay, so to speak, ""through the nose,"" for' commodities with which we ought to supply them as cheaply as we can. P resent the attack that has been made upon the honourable members of the Opposition corner. The peculiar circumstances and conditions of the case absolutely require that on the present occasion we should rise superior to party politics and give a vote, in the interests of the producers as well as in the interests of the commercial prosperity of this great Commonwealth. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [9.8] I should! like to reply briefly to the remarks just"" made by the honourable member for Echuca.. The honourable member for Lang would have acted wisely had he done His own dirty work instead of delegating it to another. I saw him call up the honourable member for Echuca, and I think that he might very well have dealt with the letters to which reference has been made. given to the Committee in regard to the honourable member for Cook was obtained by myself. Mr J. H . CATTS -This is not the first occasion on which the contents of the two letters in question have been thrown at me. I may say at once that some years ago Mr Carruthers wrote to me and that I replied to him under the seal of confidence. Subsequently, I was asked to permit my replies to be published, but I refused to do so. Notwithstandingmy refusal, these letters were published for political purposes. They were written some years ago. The Labour Party in New South Wales for some years had followed the present leader of the Opposition, and this had induced the young labourites to follow free-trade labour men. Since they had supported the right honourable gentleman in politics for some time it was difficult when the rupture took place to wean them. There was a special reason ruthers. At the time in question, in the district from which I came, some labour members were making speeches in regard to the Boer war member think that matter has anything to do with the question before the Chair? Mr J. H . CATTS I merely wish to say, sir, that the reason why I nearly broke off my connection with the labour movement was that several of the party, at the time in question took up in regard to the Boer war an attitude to which I absolutely objected, and some correspondence with Mr Carruthers took place in respect of it. The publication of private letters written by me to Mr Carruthers was a breach of confidence. Every one knows that in a private letter one often expresses opinions to which one would not give utterance in a 'public statement. -The speech delivered about half-an-hour ago by the honourable member for Angas, who was emulated by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, will make it clear to the Committee that .we are upon the eve of drifting into a wide discussion upon the broad principle of preference. I do not think it desirable at present for the House to deal with that question. So far the discussion has been devoted almost exclusively to that of whether any duty should be imposed upon wire-netting, and, if so, as to what should be the rate. The question of preference has really not been considered except in so far as it has been incidentally involved in a variety of statements as to what duties should be imposed",52,Smith Th E Inference Is In Australia

I want, in the first place, to comment upon the absolutely drifting conduct of the Government with respect to the Tariff. terial policy was announced in a cock-adoodle-doo speech, delivered at Wagga by the Treasurer. It was said to be one from which the Government were never going to depart. The honourable gentleman on that occasion threw down the controversial glove, and practically told fhe people of Australia that the Tariff must be passed as introduced. find, however, in accordance with the habit of the Government, that as soon as the Labour Party display a desire or indicate an intention in the direction of modifying the Tariff the Ministry, like the American bear, immediately come down. The absolute want of resolution on the part of the Government in dealing with the Tariff is illustrated by the fact that they suddenly depart from a proposal to impose 25 per cent, and 30 per cent, duties to a proposition that the duties should be only 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, respectively. I wish the Committee to see what the effect of that drop is. upon tihe preferential percentage. Every one knows that preference is represented by the concession which is offered to what are called, diplomatically, the "" most favoured nations."" The normal duty is the higher one, and th<> lower duty is that which involves the concession to those particular nations upon which it is desired to confer an advantage over other nations. panied by reciprocity. aspect which I am discussing. duties originally proposed by the Government in respect of wire-netting were 25 per cent, upon imports of British manufacture, and 30 per cent, upon those of members will take the trouble to calculate what the preference was intended to be upon those duties, they will find that it was proposed to drop the duty, so f a r as tbe mother country was concerned, from 30 to 25 per cent. That was a preference, roughly speaking, of icT oer cent, of the duty. But when the Labour Party intimatedI will not say "" intimated,"" because its members had merely to suggest th?* there-was a "" r if t in the lute,"" in order to induce the Government to at once change its attitude knows that that is not so, because the members of the Labour Party have a free hand The Minisupon fiscal matters. of the honourable member is quite compatible with what I am saying. The Government were under the impression that the Labour Party would support their proposals, but when the honourable member for Maranoa, in a perfectly straightforward way, informed the Committee that We now he intended to support the |proposal to place wire-netting upon the free list, it was a sufficient intimation to the Government that they must devise some compromise in order to make their party a compact one. I have shown the Committee that, under the original proposals of the Government, the preference to the mother, country amounted to 16 per cent, of the duty as compared with the Canadian preference of 33.1/3 per cent. Now as soon as the Government altered those proposals by substituting a duty of 10 per cent, upon wire-netting of British manufacture, ancl of 15 per cent, upon netting of foreign origin, the preference to the mother country became increased to 33 per cent. The normal duty in that case is 15 per cent, and they proposed to lew a duty of only 10 per cent, upon imports from the mother country, thus offering the latter the preference of 33 per cent. A great many members haye intimated that they favour ^placing the item upon the free list, but a still larger number are apparently prepared to levy a duty It is generally accomof 10 per cent, under the general Tariff, and of 5 per cent, .upon imports from Great Britain. What does that mean from the stand-point of preference? If the The normal duty is to be 10 per cent., whilst the duty upon the imports from the mother country is to be only 5 per cent., it means we are going to offer the latter a preference of 50 per cent. So that the foreign manufacture. If honourable Committee are hanging in the balance between extending to Great Britain a .pre-' ference of 16 per cent., .of 33 per cent., and of 50 per cent.

It is not the fiscal division in the ranks of the Labour Party that concerns honourable members of the Opposition; the whole trouble is the attitude of the ""push"" in the Opposition corner. It amused me very much to hear the honourable member for Echuca plead guilty to a charge of inconsistency, and, a few moments later, declare that he always believed in straight dealing. I , too, am a believer in straight dealing, even in politics; I call a spade a spade, and not a scientific instrument for removing soil. The honourable member for Cook, after he has had the experience that some of us have had, will not be much concerned about inconsistency in politics, because it"" is inconsistency that makes politicians. The Melbourne Argus, of 9th -October, contains an article which, in my opinion, expresses all that any honourable member could desire to say on the subject of the proposed duty on wire-netting. In the first place, that article takes manufacturers of wire-netting to task for not taking the opportunity to lay their case before the Tariff Commission. We have it on the authority of the honourable member for Illawarra that the Commission asked again and again that some witness might be sent to give some information regarding the industrv ; and the only response that the manufacturers made to that invitation was to send one of their employees, .who contended that a duty ought to be imposed, because the industry employed eighty trade unionists. If we are to impose a protective duty in the case of every industry which employs eighty trade unionists, I should say, with the honourable member for Darling, that it would be much better to pension the employees. It is not just, in my opinion, to tax every individual in the community for the sake of providing eighty trade unionists with employment. In my constituency everything we eat, drink, wear, or use is imported, there being no manufactures of any kind. In that part of the Commonwealth, however, there are carried on the two great staple industries of woolgrowing and cattle breeding, which form the backbone of our industrial pursuits. Many representatives of metropolitan constituencies are under the impression that those interested in the industries I have men. tioned are not worthy of any consideration, but are, rather, to 'be regarded as something in the nature of fiends in disguise. I may' say that there are now no strained relations between the pastoralists and their employees in the' Western districts of Queensland. The work is being carried on amicably; and the only desire of those engaged, whether as employees or employers, is to be left alone. They desire no protection, but merely to be permitted to carry on their work without interference. There is no doubt that the rabbit. pest is a national disaster. Every sheep, horse, or beast is an asset of the Gommonwealth, and the periodical droughts which afflict the country occasion, not only individual loss, but suffering to the community as a whole. Instead of imposing a duty on wire-netting, and thus increasing the burdens of the pioneers of the western country, we ought to give them a bonus on every .mile of wire netting which they erect. I should like to read the following letter which I have received:Brisbane, 3rd October, 1907. Hon. James Page, M.P., Federal Parliament, Melbourne.

That as the principal use to which wire netting is devoted is the prevention, and destruction of the rabbits and 1 marsupial pests of these States, any increase in the cost of wire-netting will add to the burden which thesepests already impose on the primary industries of the Commonwealth, and defeat the object to be obtained' in their destruction. 2. That increasing the burden of taxation. upon the producing interests is contrary to the policy of the closersettlement of people upon the land, which has been the aim of all the States of the Commonwealth for some years past. 3. That copies of this resolution be sent to all the associated bodies interested, and to the members of the Federal Senate, and House of Representatives. Trusting to receive your influence and support in the prevention of any increase of the CustomsTariff on the articles above mentioned. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Secretary. I think that is one of the most reasonable requests I have received during the whole of my parliamentary career.

That would seem to be what the honourable gentleman is aiming at, nothing more or less.

When the very first words' which the former said were, "" I am pleased to meet you. but I am against you in politics, becauseI am a strong free-trader."" As honourable members may imagine, the two gentlemen, from that very moment, -got into "" holts,""' and Mr Jowett proved a foeman worthy of the Treasurer's steel. Mr Jowett, when the Tariff Commission was in Brisbane, gave evidence on the item of wire-netting, and .he was the only witness who did so.. Mr Jowett owns several stations, and is a man of wide experience; and I am surehis evidence may be relied on, because it has not been questioned by any one so far.

I am sure that the honourable member would not be allowed to do so. My experience of banks is that they always put on the screw unless they have a pretty good thing. I should like to know fro m the Minister of Trade and Customs on what basis the duty was fixed at 30 per cent. ? it was fixed because of an ex parte statement of the managing director of the company.

It is a good thing to cherish sentiments regarding the great mother country whence we came, whose prosperity, we hope, will be immortal. But often, as a great writer has stated, patriotstatement is not ism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. The honourable member for Maranoa has well said that he thinks of the mother country as of his own family, that she is entitled to every consideration, and that he would stand The company is by and support her to the last. I hope that we are all with him there. But when we come to deal with business matters, we I do not believe that. If change our ground. If the honourable member had five brothers, apd the half dozen agreed among themselves, supposing ' they were all in business, to buy exclusively If the company has got from each other such commodities as one might require and another sell, while the agreement might evidence great' harmony, there would be, before twelve months were over, a row such as is rarely heard.

That is to say, he has supplied the cost of the imported wire-netting plus the cost of delivering it in trucks at the Darling Harbor railway station. We are thus able to make an equal comparison between the cost of the imported wire-netting in the trucks at Darling Harbor and that at which Messrs. Lysaght Bros, tendered to supply in trucks at the same place. Tenders were called for two lines, the one being for 42 x i£ x 18 and the other for 36 x i j x 18. Four British tenders were received in addition to one by Lysaght Bros. The accepted tender for 42-inch wire-netting delivered in the trucks at Darling Harbor works out at £ 2 5 ns. per mile, whilst Lysaght Bros.' tender works out at £ 3 1 , a difference of £ 5 9s. per mile. tender ? the accepted tender? sideration when we are making a comparison of prices. averaged it might make a difference, but when a distinct tender is accepted the question raised by the honourable member is unimportant. In the case of the 36-in. wire netting the difference between the accepted British tender and that of Lysaght Brothers was not so great. The accepted tender was at the rate of £ 2 2 3s. per mile delivered in trucks at Darling Harbor railway station, whereas Lysaght Brothers' tender was £ 2 6 10s., or a difference of £ 4 7s. per mile. in quality? Govermnent of New South Wales would impose proper business conditions in order to insure the supply of wire-netting of a satisfactory quality. these tenders were invited long before there was any question of trying to persuade this Parliament to do all sorts of wonderful things. When a Tariff is under consideration men make the most marvellous offers ns to what they will do if they get what they want. But these tenders were invited before there was any disturbance in regard to the old Tariff. Wire-netting was then on the free list. If Lysaght Brothers are able to turn .out 300 miles of wire-netting per week, a difference of £ 5 per ton on that output would represent £1,500, or more than double the whole of the wages paid in that factory during that time. We are told that £700 per week is paid by way of wages by this firm, and a difference of £ 5 per ton per mile on the weekly output of 300 miles is not only greater than the difference between the rates of wages prevailing in the old country and Australia, but represents double the total wages paid.

I have never felt at all ashamed of my connection with that tax, and I may mention that I received the greatest assistance from the New South Wales Labour Party in carrying it . I do not forget the help which the honourable member for West Sydney himself gave me in those years when I was Premier of that State. When any man is Prime Minister, nothing can exceed the devotion and respect which the honourable member shows him. But when one ceases to be Prime Minister, nothing can exceed the devotion which he shows to one's successor. I know that if , in the course of time, I should rise to the top again, I shall receive the same touching devotion and affection from the honourable member that he has showed me in the past. The honourable member who endeavours to reproach me with being untrue to the cause of free trade ought to recollect that during my twenty years of fighting for that causealthough he was only too glad to come to me and get my endorsement of him as a free-trader--h e never once stood upon a public platform by .my side and endeavoured to strengthen my hands in that fight. Yet he took all the assistance that he could get from us by being announced in the newspapers as one of our candidates. has he done recently ?

I have been attacked in the same way by the honourable member for West Sydney, and I am replying to both attacks at the same time. I wish to point out that the party to which the honourable member belongs has all along worked upon the basis of allowing its members perfect freedom in respect of their fiscal convictions, whilst uniting .free traders and protectionists upon matters of high concern. I adopted that course at the last general election. I thought that the time had arrived when free-traders and protectionists might work together upon the basis of perfect freedom, so far as their fiscal convictions were concerned, and I am glad to say that none of my friends have charged me with acting unfaithfully towards the cause of free-trade.

There was no feeling on either side that there had been any treachery or unfairness. In the high position I occupy as a leader in public life, it is my duty to decide which 'are the questions of most pressing importance; and I took the attir tude I did because at the late elections I felt that the dominant question was Socialism versus anti-Socialism. How could I fight that battle if I endeavoured to start a cross fight on the fiscal issue? To do so would have been contrary to common sense. The honourable member for West Sydney, the basis of whose whole political existence is a fiscal truce, admitting of an alliance of free-trade and protectionist members, should give me credit for equal political honesty in following that example. The indignation which is expressed against honourable members in the Opposition corner passes over the head of the honourable member for Boothby.

It is a pity that reflections should be cast from side to side at this early stage of our proceedings, because we have a long road to go. In reference to preference, it is inconvenient to deal with the question bn this particular item. But we have discussed this matter in the light of the proposal before us; and it would be most awkward to depart from the shape the debate has taken.

I am sorry that the honourable gentleman felt that anything I said called for such a lengthy criticism; but I have to say again that he seems incapable of understanding the difference between his own party and the party to which I belong. From the w r y beginning the right honourable gentleman knew that members of the Labour Party did not put their fiscalism first, but always second; and I remember that for years that was the gravamen of the complaint against the party. the other hand, the right honourable gentleman has always put his fiscalism first. He speaks of a period of twenty years, during which, he said, I did not go upon the platform to help him. to say that I have not been in politics for twenty years-that I have taken'an interest in politics for nothing like that period. But during the whole of my political career I have never once given a vote in favour of any duty, though it is perfectly true that 1 never went on the platform' and advocated free-trade. I belong to the Labour Partv. and a man cannot serve both God and Mammon-h e cannot serve two parties. The honourable gentleman said that I was glad of his support, and so I was; but 1 does the honourable member -for most emphatically say that he also was very glad of my support. I never underestimated the support. ever, that I was returned in spite of the honourable gentleman, who knows very well that in 1894 the Labour Party put up Mr Reeves against him. I did what I could to keep the honourable gentleman out of Parliament, and he did what he could to keep me out; but that was not the attitude he took in 1895, and for the best of all possible reasons.

I had nothing to 'do with the alteration, and it was not fair for the honourable gentleman to try to fasten upon me something which was clone by the Department for convenience. The same arrangement was made under the old Tariff, but the form of words in the new Tariff is clearer than that formerly adopted. Questions have been asked in reference to the probable effect of the proposed duties of i o and 5 per cent. I am a protectionist, and, if I had my will, I would impose stronglv protective duties on wire-netting, because I do not think that that would make it dearer or injure those who have to use it. I believe that in a short time it would reduce the cost, because uncier it the internal competition would break down the importing rings. Duties of 10 and S per cent, will, to a limitedextent, protect the industry. protect it as I should like to see it protected. member mean by ""to a limited extent?"" Sir WILLIAM LYNE they will impose a check upon importations. I do not think that any one will say that in a case like this duties of 10 and 5 per cent, give effective protection, but they will put a stop to some of the inferior importations..

Still, if the Committee will not vote for higher rates in this special case, I must be satisfied with what I can get. [10.53] I do not know that I should apologise for rising, because I have not spoken on this subject before, although several honourable members have spoken more than once. If it be true that coming events cast their shadows before, we may say, after what has occurred, good-bye to the protectionist policy. back on the protectionists. the Opposition admitted that the country declared for protection, yet we have offered to us duties of 15 and 10 per cent.

Christmas is rapidly approaching, we-have, yet most important questions to deal with, and every honourable member declares that we should expedite the consideration of the Tariff. Nevertheless, nearly every honourable member seems to have his own little axe to grind, and the consequence is that our proceedings are disturbed by the noisy whirr of the personal grindstone. The are advice I wish to give is that we might well relegate personal matters to the limbo I intend to stand by of forgetfulness; whilst the warning I wish to offer is that on the very next occasion upon which personal recriminations are indulged in I intend to move the closure.

I shall vote for protection, believing, as I do, that'fair protection will secure in this case, as it has done in others, an almost immediate reduction of prices, and will therefore benefit those whom we all desire to assist. wish to know whether the Treasurer regards the duties now proposed by him in reference to this item as merely an expedient to obviate any dumping in anticipation of a higher duty, and whether, when the local industry is able to cope with the demand for wire-netting and to turn out a satisfactory article under the new protection system, he will be prepared to submit a proposal for the imposition of a prohibitive duty ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [10.59] I have in mind an intention, before the Tariff is finally passed, to submit 'a certain proposal in reference to this matter which I hope will not increase the price of wire-netting, but will afford an opportunity to deal with the question in another way. I also hope that the proposed duties will, to some extent at all representativesof events, prevent dumping. to know whether the Excise duty which the manufacturerwill have to pay if he does, not give fair wages will' be based on .the higheror the lower import duty that is .proposed..

540,Mr Tud Or (Yarra) [11.0],"I desirethe duties proposed by the Government are to be reduced to i o per cent, against foreign imports of wire-netting, and to 5 per cent, on imports coming from Great Britain, it will be interesting to learn whether the local manufacturer will have to pay an Excise of 5 per cent, or of z\ per cent. If he is called upon to pay an Excise of s per cent, he will be placed in a worse position than that occupied by his competitors in Great Britain. ' tection breaking down ? that the honourable member who sneers at the new protection policy, and many other honourable members of the Opposition, would like it to break down. They know f u l l well that the workers will never have a chance of obtaining justice from them. be glad if the Treasurer would give some information regarding the question I have Sir' WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.1] -The Excise duty will be based on the general Tariff, which is the higher duty. to know whether the Government now propose to support a duty of 5 per cent, on imports of wire-netting from Great Britain and of 10 per cent, against imports from other countries, or duties of 10 and 15 per cent, respectively. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [ n . 3 ] wire-netting being placed on the free list. I hope that we shall be successful in securing the imposition of 10 and 15 per cent, duties, but I do not know what the decision of the Committee will be. I shall get the best duty, that I can. In a leading article published in the Age thismorning it is stated that the contract entered into by the Government of New South Wales for the supply of wire-netting has ""been made with a German firm. understand that that assertion is based on a statement made by the Treasurer in his address last night, and I should like him to say whether it is correct. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.5] I cannot answer fifty questions just as we are going to a division, but I wish, to give what information I can to the Committee. I said last night that I believed that a proportion of the 'wire-netting to be supplied under the New South Wales contract would come from Germany. I believe it now. If honourable members knew how the Germans carried on their trade, they would be aware that a quantity of material has been imported into England, and re-exported to Australia as British goods. That practice has, I believe, been stopped by the Board of Trade. The goods which now come from Germany have to be branded with the name of their place of origin. They canI s the new pronot, therefore, be exported from England as being the product of British labour. fore a division is taken, I desire some information. The right honourable member for East Sydney has referred to a motion of which I have given notice. I have no hesitation in saying that if the duty is reduced to the extent to which T h a t is all cant. the Government seems inclined to agree, A t all events I should it will be of no value to the industry. In that event, I wish to know what the Government are prepared to do in the way of assisting it by a bouuty? I am speaking, -not merely in the interests of the manufacturers, but also of the farmers. I can assure the Treasurer that I have had conversations with several honourable members. I wish opposite, who have told me that they are prepared to vote for a bounty. I am a protectionist now, as I have always been. I am not going to vote for a revenue duty. But the people who sent me here are suffering extremely, and I have to regard this as an exceptional case. As honourable I am going to vote against members are aware, I have given notice of an amendment to reduce the duty from 30 per cent, to 15 per cent. Some honourable members, however, are prepared to vote to kill the industry altogether. In my opinion, those who have invested their capital ih the wire-netting industry in Sydney have as much right to be protected as have the land-holders. The amendment to make wire-netting absolutely free is, of course, a party challenge. If the duty is reduced to the point which some honourable members. I seem to desire, I shall do all I can in the direction of securing assistance to the industry by means of a bounty. latest information appears to be that the Government are prepared to agree to duties of 10 per cent, and 5 per cent, on wire netting. As this is a New South Wales industry, I am prepared to see some assistance given to it, especially .as a number of the operatives reside in my electorate. I intend to vote for duties of 15 per cent.",68,Honourable Members Divide

By that means we shall keep within our Standing Orders, and overcome the difficulty. ness, I desire leave to withdraw my amendment temporarily. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. decided against wire-netting being admitted free, is it now competent for the honourable member for Capricornia to move the amendment which he has indicated, as regards the United Kingdom? moved by the honourable member for .Illawarra was to the effect that the item should be-free altogether. The honourable-member for Capricornia suggests another, alternative-that the duties should be "" 5 per cent."" and "" free."" That is quite, a different amendment. for Capricornia could have his proposal decided free from complication, even if the amendment of the honourable member for Grey were agreed to, because the honourable member for Grey proposes to insert "" five "" in the first column. I understand that that is also' what the honourable member for Capricornia wants-. The discussion is rather complicated because of the two columns of proposed duties. It would be'-'wise to distinguish between those columns right through the Tariff, .so that honourable members may move any amendment they desire in the first column, and, if that is defeated, still, have the right to move, a'namendment in the second column. It should be quite competent for any honourable member to take that course, because the general Tariff column precedes the other, and figures in the first column, as they' come first, are open' to amendment first. Isuggest that you should rule that the first column is open to'amendment before the second column in any particular item.. "" I do not see how it is possible to avoid a difference 'of opinion as to the degree of difference between the two columns. :I do""not agree with any of the later, suggestions that have been made, but we ought to facilitate business by settling the. procedure clearly about the suggestion of the honourable member for South Sydney is that we should affirm the principle of preference by adopting it. Assuming that there is to be a preference, no doubt the honorable member's suggestion is a first-class one. The proper method of testing whether there should be preference or not, without inter> fering with honourable members' preferencesfor 5, 10, or 15 per cent, duties, would be to move to strike out the heading, ""Tariff on goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom."" stage. possible way to test the question of preference, and to draw protectionists and free-traders together on that.point.

' We do nqt propose to omit a figure with a view of inserting another, but we propose to add to the matter already standing a complete sentence-that ""on and after a certain date so-and-so shall apply."" . In dealing with such. amendments I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney thatr it is advisable to vote first upon one columpand then upon another. The method to be adopted should be for the honourable member who desires to move the lowest duty, and whose amendment is, therefore, taken' first, to move with regard to the ' general Tariff first, and indicate at the same time whether he intends to' move with regard to the second column at all, and, if so, to whatextent. In that way it would"" be quite competent for honourable'members to move amendments' in their proper turn. I would also suggest that the mere fact of an honourable member stating that he desiresto move an amendment should, not be taken to mean that he has actually moved it. , separate the columns it will be possible to form almost endless combinations.
