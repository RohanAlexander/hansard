Tl-95, T2-95, T3-95, T4-95.Thursday,2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1487 Thursday, 2 March 1995 Employment, Education and Training Committee Report on violence in Australian schools Debate resumed from 7 December 1994, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. the first response to the government's response to a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Sticks and stones, which was a report on violence in Australian schools. It is interesting when debating in this chamber that, unlike the major chamber of the House of Representatives, the enemy faces each other eyeball to eyeball across the chamber. This report of the committee, which is an all-party committee of this House, was a unanimous report. I learned a number of major things in participating in this inquiry. The first thing that I learned which was most significant is that teachers believe that those who commit physical violence generally lack self-esteem. The second thing that I learned which I believe is of significance is that over the past two decades, as a permissive society has developed, we have increasingly given children their rights, but, in the absence of parental discipline and the structures of dos and don'ts, children have been left to flounder, without direction and experience in how to take responsibility for their own actions and deal responsibly with their peers and with the broader community. That is a substantive problem. The third major thing that I learned during the inquiry was that there are models of school practice which generally exhibit strong leadership and a whole school approach, creating a culture of caring that negates both violence and bullying. In that respect, I discussed the experiences of Mayfield Primary School in Launceston. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training( Mr Free) has largely accepted the findings of our report. I would now like to deal with some of the more major recommendations. The minister has said in his report that he believes that a series of forums on violence in schools held in each state and territory would be a very useful process for compiling the good practice that is occurring in schools around Australia. I have no major philosophical disagreement with the minister about holding forums, but it seems to me, in a practical sense, that we would be doing an awful lot of spinning wheels, bringing together a lot of people for lots of discussions, which would simply parallel other meetings and other discussions. The committee mentality and structure carries on. I would have much preferred that the minister had accepted our recommendations in principle and then an expert go out and do some fact finding. Let us fund an expert to do some fact finding and report on the primary schools of Australia: to report on good practice, particularly where their practice has acted to almost totally eliminate the concept of bullying; to report on practices which have been successful in integrating strong approaches at dealing",113,Notices
394,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,,115,Representatives Main Committee
395,Mr Charles (La Trobe) (10.01 A.m.),"I am delighted to have the opportunity to makeMC 1488 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 with problems of illiteracy, particularly in the early years of primary school; and to disseminate that information widely to primary and secondary schools throughout Australia. An expert charged with this responsibility could call for submissions from schools that had demonstrated exemplary practice. That person could then collate the information and make it available. This would be more useful than holding a series of talkfests. The minister dealt firstly with our recommendation that the ministers of the Commonwealth, states and territories fund the evaluation of successful approaches adopted by schools. It was his response to hold a series of forums, which I have dealt with. However, he did go on in his recommendation and canvass the possibility that the Commonwealth would investigate establishing, in cooperation with the state and territory governments, a best practice award for schools that display leadership in this field. I commend the minister for that response; I think that will be really useful. One of the things that we have learned through this committee, in travelling around the country, is that the apprenticeship awards-the awards that deal with excellence in the international skills olympics-have been a tremendous boost to T AFE colleges and to the apprenticeship systems around the country. Many of those young people who have participated in the international skills olympics have gone on to find rewarding, responsible and satisfying jobs very early in their careers. No doubt their participation in those skills olympics has enhanced their career prospects. They provide an example for their peers who are studying in the skills field. I compliment the minister on his suggestion for a best practice award and would suggest that that is appropriate. We recommended that the minister, in consultation with the states, finance the development of a national school violence data collection system. The minister has in total agreed with us. I thank the minister. The minister said that the Commonwealth will refer this recommendation to the School Statistics Taskforce of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs and that he would ask the task force to examine how more extensive national data on the issue can be obtained and how the data could be used for the development of performance indicators on school violence. That is a very good initiative. There is no way the Commonwealth could now impose its will or the committee's will on the states, and nor should it. This is a complex area and involves issues such as: the definition of violence-and levels of violence; the issue of bullying and where it fits in those definitions; and how we report on those issues. It does need to be decided by consensus. All the states need to agree finally on a formula of definition so that the data collection can recommence throughout the country in an identical manner, so at the end of the day we have some numbers that are of use to us. This committee was told anecdotally that physical violence was on the wane and that there was less physical violence in schools in Australia today than 30 or 40 years ago. That is a very positive outcome, but we are not sure if that is true. The problem ithere is no data to back up the observations. We really need a comprehensive but simple data collection system that will give us some numbers and allow people to take actions based on the findings. For example, if some mechanisms in some states are working and producing outcomes which are better than the models in other states, certainly it would behove the states who are having poor results to take cognisance of the fact that they have colleagues in other places who seem to be doing it better, and perhaps they should shift their practices. This data collection issue is really quite important. Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1489 Another of our recommendations was that the minister discuss with the state and territory ministers the need for early intervention strategies to address violent and anti-social behaviour in students. In part,the minister's response said that the Commonwealth government endorses the committee's finding that preventative action in the early years of schoo ling is far more likely to prove effective than any piecemeal or remedial solutions focused on students in older age groups. I thank the minister for that. We are convinced that is right. If we get it right early, the chances are that behaviour will be vastly improved in the later years of schooling as well. However, we did receive some evidence that some young people who demonstrate no tendencies to violence or bullying in primary school seem to go a bit haywire under some peer pressure or community or social mores when they reach their teens, and there have to be different mechanisms to deal with that. The minister talked about the gender and violence project, developing a video on violence for use in primary schools, but this issue is not just a gender issue. It is not just that little boys beat up on little girls or big boys beat up on big girls; in fact there was some anecdotal evidence that young girls are increasingly resorting to verbal bullying themselves, and that is quite worrying for many of our educators. I am not sure that this is totally a gender issue. Certainly, the physical violence occurs largely between young males-Qr young males physically violating young girls-but the bullying aspect seems to be more evenly balanced and the fact that there seems to be some increasing physical violence amongst young girls was worrying to the committee. One of our recommendations was an examination of the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. The minister agrees with our concern that media and entertainment may have an effect on violence and behaviour of children, not only in the school setting but in the broader community. The minister says that the communications and the arts portfolio already makes a significant contribution to safeguarding the well-being of children in relation to media content. I think I would have to question the minister's statement. I am not totally convinced that our classification mechanisms do work. When I turn on my television, which is rare I must admit, there certainly are days when no matter what channel I switch to there is nothing but violence on show. I am not convinced that that is for the betterment of our young people. I note that the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) has recently called for the examination of the possibility of a fourth free to air television channel, largely dedicated to families and children. I suppose that is worth exploring, although I am not sure that there is enough market and I think that market research would have to be done. I can tell you that many families would support a reduction in the amount of violence that we see on free to air television in Australia. Perhaps pay TV will help solve part of this problem. One can only hope, but we will never know until we get there and unfortunately we are a bit slow in that regard. But, in discussing our recommendation on the International Year of the Family, the minister went on to compliment the government for supporting the parents' role in school education by providing $555,000 to the parents association over three years, and that is in rather dramatic conflict with· the donation of the Minister for Health (Dr Lawrence) of a quarter of million dollars in one shot to the December issue of Cleo, which goes out, unfortunately, to 13to 18-year-old females, which I believe was inappropriate in all the circumstances, dealing with the issues that we are dealing with here. MC 1490 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 Ms HENZELL (Capricornia) (10.16 a.m.)-I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the government's response to the report Sticks and stones, a report on violence in Australian schools by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I acknowledge the contribution by the chair of that committee, the member for Forde (Ms Crawford),and the previous speaker, the member for La Trobe( Mr Charles), who was the deputy chair of that committee. This is an issue of very considerable concern to parents. In my previous professional experience I had some involvement in counselling victims of violence in schools, and also as a parent, as I charted my own daughter's journey through primary and secondary education, I have been a concerned consumer in this area. It is very pleasing to note the general support of the government for the committee's report and a number of initiatives that the government is taking on board in response to this report. The response has actually been presented very quickly, in my view. I want to make some comments about the general area. I certainly think there is a need for further research but also, as the government indicates; it is prepared to participate in the collection of data and the dissemination of that data to schools, particularly on the incidence as well as benchmarks and best practice options that the committee was able to pick up during the course of its inquiry. One area that I have some concern about is the evidence on the causal relationship between violence and self-esteem of the perpetrators and the victims. I believe there does need to be much more research into what determines why some children choose to bully. However, I acknowledge that it is not simply an individual psychological problem but that we have to look at a number of factors that cause violence in schools. I note the committee's comments on page 11, paragraph 2.3: This committee agrees with the view that violence does not arise from a single cause. In this, it agrees with the national committee on violence. It says: Evidence suggested the following influences in the school context: the family; cultural factors, especially social and economic inequality; media influences; and aspects of the school environment. I believe that not only a whole of school approach is required to combat violence but a whole of community approach, and it does mean getting parents involved and out of school factors as well as media, and in particular the social structure of the school system. One of the initiatives that I as a parent was involved with in the primary school that my children attended was the development of a human relationships education program. This whole issue had a very long gestation and parents fought for it in the dark days of conservative rule in Queensland. When the green light was given for the development of human relationships education, a great deal was done by the Queensland education department to foster community involvement. There were a number of participants in my small mining community. What was interesting, I have to say, was that a minority group which represented-if one would describe it as such a 'fundamentalist Christian' position had a very narrow view of what should constitute a human relationships education. I would have to summarise it as a 'God, queen, country and the Bible' type of approach, with very limited opportunities to present the plurality of society. However, the consultation, with the support of the Queensland Department of Education, went ahead, and we developed a very positive program for our school community. Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1491 One of the issues that I believe is very important is the recognition of the power structures within a school. That very much involves having the adults in the school system be aware of the sort of power that they have, and of when the system can get into the abuse of power. It has been my experience, in observing children, that they have a very strong sense of social justice and are very aware when teachers override what could be seen as fair play or a fair and reasonable outcome. It is very important that teachers be aware of that when they use their power as adults: their power to be more articulate and more analytical, and to put students down. So, when we look at the structures that need to be in place to provide a really caring school, based on mutual respect, all relationships need to be taken into consideration. One of the very important findings of the committee is in relation to the importance of early intervention. I quote from page 8 of the introduction. It says: The majority of evidence suggests that inappropriate behaviours are identifiably in children as early as pre-school and kindergarten. Changing a child's behaviour patterns after the age of eight requires significantly more resourcing, with reduced changes of success, than if the problem was addressed in the earliest schooling years. Indeed, I can remember observing a number of children who went right through kindergarten, preschool and grades one and two with my daughters. It was very clear that they had already embarked upon a career that would ultimately isolate them and nominate them as troublemakers and difficult children. I then saw the responses that were used-being, at that time, very traditional school discipline responses-having absolutely no success at all. At that stage, I was not practising professionally, but I was bringing my professional eye to my observations. Living in a small community, I could also see the complementary family problems that were contributing to the way these children would present at school. I was feeling very concerned to know that this would be the ultimate outcome for these children. SoI fully endorse the recommendation of the committee about the need for early intervention strategies, and I endorse the response from the government in this area. The other very important area that I think we should spend a couple of minutes on is the types of violence. If one looks at the media representations, one tends to see the more overt type ()f bullying. But, as the previous speaker said, actual, overt. physical violence-the 'putting kids' heads down the toilets' type of harassment, which still happens-is less rare than other forms of bullying. However, the other forms of bullying are particularly destructive to the developing selfesteem of young people. I quote from page 7. It says: The Committee was told that one of the biggest unrecognised aspects of violence in schools was gender harassment. As a component of violence, it was widespread in schools and was largely unrecognised as a violent act. One survey found that, as part of their day to day routine, girls in co-educational classrooms and school yards suffered sex-based harassment from boys and sometimes teachers. The Committee was also advised that physical violence amongst girls was more likely to occur than it was in the past. That was mentioned by the previous speaker. It goes on to say: Harassment and violence is also directed towards gay, lesbian and bisexual students. On that point, I want to quote from an article headed 'Homophobia starts at school, let's stop it here' in the Australian of 1 March-just yesterday, in fact-which gives an account of a high school assembly on 1 August last year where it was suggested that an absent student was gay. When this student attempted to have redress for this accusation, and the resulting hostility MC 1492 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 and isolation, he got no support at all. I gather this case is now subject to some further investigation. This is one of the newer types of harassment-attempting to pigeonhole all the students in terms of their gender orientation. But it is absolutely inappropriate, whether it be in grade two or in grade eight or nine, where I believe it reaches its zenith. It is a way of isolating and imposing a power differential. Often that involves a peer group-there is an in-group and an out-group, whether it is the cool group and the not-so-cool group or some other group. But to raise suggestions that someone is not in the mainstream of heterosexual orientation is very distressing to many students who, of course, have not really developed a clear sexual orientation. It is very important that those kinds of issues are addressed and students learn to understand the type of process in which they are all unconsciously involved. I have certainly seen this operating in schools in my electorate. Racism and talking about different ethnic backgrounds is very important. The other issue that is part of this is where students are different and I suspect this is what the previous speaker was mentioning. Gender harassment is not all about violence from one sex to the other, although the evidence indicates that it is males who primarily are the perpetrators. However, it is about students who are different, and one of the things that all schools must address is the importance of allowing people to be themselves. Not everybody is going to be the best cricketer, the best netball player, the most beautiful, most Elle look-alike girl in the school, or the person who looks like whoever the male role models are at the moment-probably Shane Warne or someone. thing is that, across the spectrum, children are as individual as, dare I say, my colleagues in this parliament-and most of us would not make it onto the big screen. I believe it is a very important part of the whole school approach to allow boys to be more feminine and more interested in quieter pursuits, to allow girls to be more assertive and interested in sport and computers, to allow variation and to help students and teachers value that individual difference in people. Teaching students assertive techniques and to be constructively assertive, rather than aggressive, is very important. But clarifying communication is also very important. To return to the gender violence issue, the other part of that that we have to address is the structural inequality in many schools. As the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training said on page 14 of its report on violence in Australian schools: The committee understands that while eighty per cent of teachers in primary schools are women, only twenty to thirty per cent are principals. So already there are a number of power differentials that provide role models for the students. We have to get away from what constitutes masculinity and femininity. I believe' it is an excellent report and I certainly applaud the government's response. That response mentions many of the government's current initiatives that will assist the provision of a much more effective, whole of school approach. For example, on page 13, the Commonwealth reminds us that: Funding totalled about $3 billion in 1993: $1.29 billion supported government schools; $1.59 billion supported non-government schools and $64 million was provided jointly in the two sectors.",115,Representatives Main Committee

Obviously, once again, cooperation from state governments will be required. Issues such as literacy have been responded to. The committee has made a very positive contribution and I am delighted to see that the government is responding very significantly. MightI say in the last few seconds available to me that my own daughter has won an award to present a film which will go to the issue of violence in families, so I am hoping that her role will make a small contribution. member for La Trobe( Mr Charles). Having heard the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), I am sure there are a lot of people oil both sides of the chamber who have·dealt with school violence and its results. The member for Capricornia, of course, is a former social worker. I am sure that she has seen that for herself. I will not take much time from the comments I am just about to make but-with all due respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I find it quite extraordinary that we are addressing a report on violence in Australian schools which is of the utmost importance to parents right throughout Australia in what I consider the Clayton's chamber. My views on the necessity for this chamber are well known. I think it is a disgrace that we are not debating this downstairs. Again, I hasten to add, that is said with no disrespect intended to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words before the Main Committee as we take note of the government response to the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, Sticks and stones, on the issue of violence in Australian schools. The issue of school violence is justifiably of great concern to many in the community. As a parent, I do not think it is too much to expect my children to feel safe and secure when I leave them at school in the morning. I would also expect that my children would learn both respect and responsibility for their fellow students. I think this is an expectation shared by all parents but, regrettably, for some it is not a reality. A recent MBF survey conducted in New South Wales found that a vast majority of primary school children starting high school feared initiation ceremonies and bullying by older students. This fear is real; this fear is genuine. Ms Victoria King, an education consultant from Victoria, states quite correctly that students had limited-what she called-coping skills to deal with being put down or to deal with conflict and bullying. It is these limited coping abilities which result in violence in schools having such a detrimental effect on the victims. Research conducted in the ACT suggested that nearly a quarter of children were likely to be physically or verbally harassed. However, as bUllying rarely occurs in front of an adult witness, it is quite possible that this figure could be higher. I am pleased to say that many states and territories have already recognised the seriousness of this problem and are putting in place strategies to combat it. For example, the ACT education department will move this year to implement an across-the-board policy on school bullying and similar moves are under way in other states. . In Queensland, the government has instigated a school based program called 'Enough's enough'. It is based on the findings of a study which found boys verbally attacked girls on the basis of their sex and boys also suffered similar attacks from other boys if they were seen as too feminine. Indeed, the member for Capricornia has raised an issue that has come to light in the last week.",120,Representatives Main Committee
398,Mr Ronaldson (Ballarat) (10.31 Am.},"-I support the comments made by the honourableMC 1494 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 We all know how.cruel children can be. Unfortunately, what is now called abuse will possibly always be a part of growing up. But what starts out as children acting as children always have, and possibly always will, can become very serious and a cause of great concern for both the children themselves and their. parents. I recently received a letter from a constituent which really brought home to me what we are talking about in this chamber today, I would like to read a section of this letter because I believe that it provides us with an opportunity to focus on the real life consequences of bullying. The names, of course, have been changed. The letter reads: I am writing on behalf of my daughter Jane ... My daughter was descending the stairs during her practical cooking class to do an assignment outside. She was accompanied by Lucy also in that class. The other girls had gone ahead a bit earlier. Lucy was on Jane's right and just after starting down the stairs Lucy put her leg out and tripped Jane. Jane fell between 4-8 stairs before stopping. Lucy stopped for a few seconds, saw a graze on Jane's right wrist then sniggered and continued on down the stairs and out to the other girls. As Jane fell she twisted around catching and ripping a hole in her top from a piece of wirestickirig out from the banister. She hit her head, right shoulder, right elbow, left knee and landed on the back of her right hand, not the palm ... We wentto the hospital for a bone scan. There is 'uptake' to the right hand and wrist and we were informed that she needed extensive physiotherapy and must see an Orthopaedic Surgeon for follow up treatment and another bone scan. While waiting at the bus stop to go to the hospital Jane was harassed by other students at the college who. called her a 'snob' sarcastically mocking her injury and how it occurred. We took Jane to the College to take back the homework she had managed to do, when one of the girls at the College advised Jane not to walk down any dark alleys as, in her words, she might get 'egged'. We are a low income family and we cannot meet the expenses for the physiotherapist or Orthopaedic Surgeon. I realise that this appears to be a silly scrabble between teenagers but my daughter has been injured. It may come as a surprise to many in this chamber that this incident occurred between 17-yearold girls, people on the verge of being treated as adults. Action following the Sticks and stones report should aim to give hope to the Janes across Australia, and to not allow such incidents to occur. I believe the main report makes a valuable contribution to a debate that involves schools, parents, teachers and state education departments throughout the country. The coalition enthusiastically embraces the view of the committee that Australia's schools must provide a safe environment where teachers and students alike can learn; work, play and interact free from fear and abuse. The coalition also supports the committee's finding that it is the right combination of action at the school level that can have the most effective impact on addressing violence in our schools. What the committee's findings show is that strong leadership provided by the principal combined with the teachers working together on the basis of a whole school approach in addressing school violence have proven to be the most effective way of achieving changes in student behaviour. Critical in ensuring such positive changes in student behaviollor is maximum involvement by parents and students. Such programs are already successfully operating across Australia, and I commend the report for acknowledging the role they.play. While this report has my support, some comment needs to be made about certain aspects of the government's response, which again shows the extent to which this government has become glass jawed. Lately it seems that When faced with the slightest bit of criticism about its performance the government reels back and resorts to half truths and distortion of the factsThe government and the minister have clearly been stung by the report's findings and this is clearly evidenced by the contents of the response which is before the chamber today. Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1495 The first 12 pages of the response are the standard reply that the coalition and the community have come to expect: nothing new, just your typical Labor rhetoric which will result in little or no action. The only proviso I place on that statement is that with an election due the government may act---or, more likely, appear to act-for the most cynical of purposes and that is its re-election. The remaining 21 pages of the document are committed to the government indulging itself in self-glorification. No matter how long the bow is drawn it has fallen over itself to explain ways in which it has allegedly supported or addressed issues raised by the Sticks and stones report. And no stone is left unturned. All this, however, is a rather pathetic attempt to deflect some of the criticisms and conclusions which the committee has drawn. Labor falsely prides itself on being able to lead the country. Leadership is about being able to take on board criticism and learn from it; it is not about indulging in an orgy of self-glorification every time someone suggests ways in which issues could be better handled. The committee reached a very understandable conclusion, and that is that school violence is the end result of a number of factors. The committee has identified family breakdown, illiteracy, violent movies and television as just three of many factors which contribute to violence in schools. I read with interest in the government's response that it claims: . . . more details about the funding arrangements for improving government services to families are given in section 4. But nowhere in section 4 do we find details of Labor's true commitment---or, more truthfully put, its lack of commitment-to families. The promised tax cuts, which were to be l-a-w, turned out to be a l-i-e. Or what about the taxation and family payments system, which is biased against families, giving too little recognition to the expense of bringing up children? Perhaps the government could have mentioned that over 800,000 dependants are in families where no parent has a job, or the widening gap between rich and poor with 78 per cent of those in poverty being family members and 64 per cent of these being in families with children. Again, the government failed to mention the derailed child-care system which in September 1993 saw 214,000 women claiming that the absence of child-care options was the main reason they were not actively looking for work, with 26 per cent of women identifying lack of child-care options as their major career barrier. Mr Deputy Speaker, it might seem to be drawing a long bow to discuss these matters, but when you look at the government's response you will see the long bow that the government has drawn to justify its lack of action. Perhaps the government could have finally mentioned how it has relied on interest rates to squeeze families financially, by constantly lifting home mortgage rates and, even as we speak, keeping families in doubt as to whether they will be undergoing further. interest rate rises or even tax rises. None of this, unfortunately, is mentioned. Neither is the fact that a recent, independent report showed that some 30,000 secondary school students become homeless over a year. Instead, the government has devoted 21 pages to: The following national policy initiatives and programs, in which the Commonwealth plays a major role ... provide structures and support for schools and systems ... That is, families. Let me turn to the issue of literacy. The committee concluded, and I quote, that: The Committee supports the views of principals and teachers that there is a link between student behaviour and poor literacy. MC 1496 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday,2 March 1995 The committee goes further, to recommend that a concerted literacy program would lead to reduced levels of anti-social behaviour in schools. The true extent of literacy in this country was revealed by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training( Mr Free) in an. interview on SBS World News on 18 January this year. The minister was asked what the current state of our literacy was. He replied, 'We're not sure.' The minister says 'not sure', despite the schools council report of December 1994 showing that up to 25 per cent of Australian school children are battling literacy problems, despite the International Literacy Year in 1990, the International Literacy Day on 8 September 1990, The literacy challenge: strategies/or early intervention/or literacy and learning/or Australian children of December 1992, early literacy programs, adult literacy programs, the 1991 Australian language and literacy policy, the 'Book it' program of 1990 and the literacy awards in 1992. After all this, the minister says, ' We're not too sure about the state of our literacy.' It would appear that the government is somewhat confused by the relationship that the committee says exists between literacy and school violence. Remember the committee explicitly stated that: The committee supports the views of principals and teachersthatthere is a link between student behaviour and poor literacy. However, to quote from the response: The Government believes that the causes of violence in schools are many and varied, and notes that any causal link between literacy and violence is not established. Not only does the government not agree with the views of principals and teachers, but, it would appear, the government disagrees with the committee and, therefore, does not agree with its own members. The fallacy of the government's position on this issue is no more clearly shown than on page 34 of the response, where it proudly asserts that the students at risk-Star-program funds a range of school based projects which may assist in addressing violence in schools. Guess what one of the programs is which Star suggests will address violence in high schools? You guessed it, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is basic literacy. The government has fallen in a heap on the issue of literacy. When trying to justify its failings, it does little more than expose its total confusion and ineptness on this issue. There are many examples of the government's attempting to deflect conclusions made by the committee. So insecure is the government on this issue that it has deliberately tried to avoid the committee's findings. The report identifies increasing retention rates and changes in student population as factors that encourage violence in schools. I stress that the committee did not state that these factors cause school violence, but merely stated that they encourage violence in schools. However, so stung is the government by this claim that the government response states: The assertion is made in the context of assumptions about causesI repeat' causes'which have not been supported by credible research. That comment demeans the extensive and far-reaching results of the committee inquiry, pays no regard to the committee's very exhaustive investigation into violence in schools, and is a totally unwarranted attack on the members of that committee. Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1497 Let me say that the standard, conclusions and recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education .and Training are in stark contrast to this pitiful reply made by the government. Where the committee has sought answers, the government has sought· excuses. Where the committee has sought to place responsibility, the government has run a mile from it. Where the committee has sought team work, cooperation and facts, the government has sought to demean the committee's work and to demean the outcome of the committee's exhaustive inquiries. When taking note of the paper, let the House take note of the quality of the report-a quality that stands in stark contrast to the qualities of the government's response. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the government's response should be called' 12 pages of platitudes and 21 pages of excuses'. Ballarat( Mr Ronaldson) that there are only two governments in this country that have shown a commitment to education: one is Queensland, and the other is the Commonwealth. Every other state government in this country that is largely responsible for children of this age group has denied funding and reduced funding. In fact, Mr Kennett in Victoria has reduced funding for education by some half a billion dollars. The member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew) will know that his Premier has reduced funding to education in South Australia by $40 million, with more to come. The member for Franklin( Mr Quick), the colleague behind me, knows that the Liberal government in Tasmania has reduced funding. Western Australia has reduced funding. Let us not get facts in the way of a good story! In taking note of the government's response to the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training called Sticks and stones: report on violence in Australian schools, I would like to comment on four of the seven major matters raised. They are positive parenting, best practice in schools, data collection in schools and early intervention. Parents are key partners in education. Their role as primary educators of their children and their continuing support during the years of schooling are critical elements in ensuring successful outcomes from their children's education. Along with those statements, the Commonwealth· government recognises the pivotal role that parents need to play in strategies to tackle violence in schools. No-one in this chamber would disagree with the sentiments of the government's response, but what exactly is positive parenting? What are the fundamental and essential attributes? I spent 25 years of my working life as a teacher and a principal of primary-aged children and obviously I came across children predisposed to verbal and physical violence and antisocial behaviour. In dealing with those children and their parents, I learned by experience and analysis of what happened that certain characteristics were always common. The child always had a parent or parents whose own behaviour and relationship with the child were dominated by inconsistency. Let me try and explain with a few real life examples. I remember a child whose parents were obviously part of the alternative society. In that family there were very few, if any, rules other. than that, if a problem arose, a situational negotiation took place to attempt to solve it. The parents' dress and behaviour was often remarked on in the community as outlandish, and I am sure that the parents in question enjoyed their shock on the local community with quiet humour. However, the point I want to make is that the child was very well adjusted indeed, and in fact was a real asset to the school community; From the child's point ofview---:-and that is often overlooked-his parents, in their behaviour and relationship with him, were totally consistent, fair, predictable, and",121,Representatives Main Committee
399,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (10.45 A.m.),"I think I should remind the member forMC 1498 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 providing the child with the necessary security and certainty in dealing with everyday situations, without the need to resort to verbal or physical violence. I also experienced examples at the other end of the spectrum from that laissez-faire example. Another child I remember had parents who had a rule for everything and a punishment that, without exception, was always carried out if a rule was transgressed. It was a very strict household but, as with the laissez-faire family, I would not try to emulate it myself. Nevertheless, the child from that strict family was extremely well adjusted. Again, from the child's point of view, his parents were fair, consistent and totally predictable-even if I thought they were too strict. In other words, whether parents were strict or laissez-faire or somewhere in between did not seem to matter, as long as the relationship was consistent between the parents and the child. It also did not seem to matter-and this goes against a lot of the research-whether the child was a girl or a boy. Gender issues did not matter. Socioeconomic status did not seem to matter. Religious, cultural or racial status did not matter. By contrast, and without exception, all children I have dealt with who were predisposed to violence had a parent or parents unable or unwilling to develop a relationship with their offspring that could be described as consistent. The result was children whose sense of selfworth was confused, diminished, or even inflated; whose relationships with other children and adults were marked with conflict; and whose skills in dealing with often everyday trivial circumstances were minimal. The point I make about positive parenting, and I much prefer. to call it 'consistent' parenting, is that the views of children themselves must be valued and acknowledged. AlthoughI wel<;ome the government's response on initiatives to ask parent groups to provide advice about the role schools should play in promoting positive parenting, and I acknowledge the positive parenting approach underpinning the national prevention strategy for child abuse and neglect-as well as a major community education campaign and an independent assessment of all major parenting programs currently delivered in Australia-that information will never be complete or effectual, and will provide a poor framework for policy if the views of children themselves are ignored. All the partners in the relationships between children and adults need to be considered, and to leave children out of the equation is totally unacceptable and downright foolhardy. There are many schools in this country which, in different ways, exemplify outstanding behaviour and school management-and then there are others in both the private and the public system. I find it very hard to accept that, after well over 100 years of compulsory education in Australia, some things have simply not changed in many primary schools. The most remarkable aspect is the basic structure used in these schools: that is, one teacher is largely responsible for the school education of a class of around 30 children for 10 months of the year. That structure is repeated year in, yearout, for seven years. It is too bad if there is a relationship breakdown or indifference between pupil and student; too bad if the teacher has neither the interest nor the skill in the four major curriculum areas of language-including a foreign language-mathematics, environmental studies and the expressive arts and physical education. In 25 years I have never seen a teacher expert in all of those areas; the expectation that any teacher could be is totally unrealistic. Thirty years ago, some primary teachers could get away with basic English, simple arithmetic, a bit of history and geography, music lessons from a radio broadcast, a pastel lesson Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1499 once a week and a game in the park. But that curriculum structure is long gone; it has outlived its usefulness. Today, primary teachers are expected to teach all aspects of language, including a foreign language. They are expected to teach all aspects of mathematics: sets, logic, graphing, basic algebra, geometry and numeration. They are expected to be up to date with computer and information technology. They are expected to teach health and science. They are expected to teach environmental studies. They are expected to be aware of behaviour management, gender issues, sociology, psychology, collaborative learning and to be sensitive to cultural and racial matters. The list goes on and on. education, and there are many other subjects. Teachers are expected to teach art and craft and design; music, including the learning of a musical instrument; dance; gymnastics; and major and minor sports, including personal fitness. The message is clear-it is impossible. Children need to be skilfully exposed to all of that curriculum. No-one would disagree with that contention. The problem is that no one teacher has the interest or the skills to do what is expected. The expectation from the community and government that teachers should do this is patently ridiculous. It is too bad if you are a child with a teacher whose interests and skills differ-you are stuck. Bored and uninterested students are potentially violent and anti-social students. Students unable to succeed in their chosen areas are potentially violent and anti-social students. Students unable to develop a positive relationship with a teacher, because of different interests or personality, are potentially violent and anti-social students. The chief determinant of a successful school will always be a quality education program, enhanced by the principal's leadership, in which a group of teachers-not individuals-with complementary skills and interests are responsible for children: that is, the children in any school year will be exposed to several teachers and not just one. However, with the teacher resources available in most primary schools, that is not possible. In many cases it cannot even be considered. But in the few schools that do expose children to a range of teachers, what do we find? We find that behaviour management is a very minor issue. It does not matter whether they are middle class or working class or top-of-the-range schools. Interested, motivated, happy, enthusiastic students do not become behaviour problems, irrespective of their home circumstances. I am, therefore, very pleased that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training( Mr Free) has indicated a willingness to investigate the possibility of establishing, in cooperation with state and territory governments-we might remember that these are the people who are largely responsible for the education of these children-and non-government school authorities a best practice award for schools that display leadership. They are out there, but they are seldom acknowledged other than in their local community, and even then sometimes not acknowledged for the right reasons. The third area I would like to address is the matter of data collection in schools. It is extremely important that the Commonwealth support the standing committee proposal for a consistent approach to the collection of accurate data, not only on violence but on a whole range of matters that affect our younger generation. We cannot afford to ignore any more the generation of the future now aged under 12 years. I am very pleased that the minister and the government concur on this matter.",125,Representa Tives Main Committee

Yet here we are, in an age of national lobby groups for everything-almost one for ink lovers; you name it, there is a national lobby group. There is basically no effective, successful national lobby group for children between the ages of five and 12. Why are the resources allocated to this age group so much lower than for any other age group in Australia? Why are they so powerless? Why are per capita grants for a 12-year-old in a primary school up to $1,000 lower than for a 12-year-old child in a secondary school? Does something magic occur to children in the Christmas vacation before entry to secondary school? Does paper cost more, do books cost more, do photocopiers cost more? Nonsense, Why are there, for exactly the same number of students, up to half as many teaching staff in a primary school as in a secondary school or TAFE institution? One would think there must be an educational reason for those huge differentials. There is not. The current allocation of educational resources in this nation reflects historical tradition and power. There is very little or no educational merit or rationale whatsoever. It is about power, and these children and their teachers do not have any. That is why they do not have adequate funds. That is what seems to be the continued fate of primary schools in the bringing up of our children. The younger the learner, the more dependent, the more vulnerable, the more precious, and the greater the chance for something to go wrong. The older the learner, the more independent, the more self-reliant, the easier to teach, and the less the chance for something to go wrong. That is not rhetoric. That is facts. Why is not it acted upon? Even if acknowledged, it is acknowledged in a very disingenuous way. Collection of data on children is a sensitive matter and is recognised as such by teacher and parent groups. But this is little excuse for the political naivety of teachers and parents in resisting some forms of data collection and being manipulated, albeit in a subtle way, by bureaucracies to, in reality, sit on their hands and conduct talkfest after talkfest. The 10 or 20 per cent of children who have literacy problems in our schools and their lack of success in school are potentially the angry and violent students of tomorrow. Poor parenting increases the risk dramatically. Poor schooling also increases the risk dramatically. Add a failure by the community and governments to adequately allocate a fair share of resources to children aged five to 12, and this nation has a recipe for a monumental and very expensive problem which is now evident to anyone who cares to observe what happens in schools and the community. Early intervention works. Many members here this morning have mentioned that. It is cheaper than remedial measures. Remedial measures often do not work, and the increasing need for remedial measures in schools is ample evidence of system failure. Early intervention makes good sense, and prevention is cheaper and more effective than cure. (Extension of time granted) I welcome the standing committee's report, and I commend the minister for the government's response in moving the debate onwards; but no-one ought to be deluded. This nation needs Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1501 to acknowledge the needs of young children, and eventually will be forced to do so for a very simple and fundamental reason: that it is in the best interests of this nation, in a very nonforgiving and highly competitive world that will be ever more so in the future. In this opportunity to take note of the report this morning, members of both the opposition and the government have shown that there is a great deal of interest in this; but there has to be a lot more than talk. It is time that a group of people in Australia who have the most minimal resources spent upon them by state and federal governments is recognised, because it is in all of our interests that children get off to a very good start, both socially and academically and in all other ways. That happens in our primary schools and in the relationships between parents and children. They need assistance, and it is time both Commonwealth and state governments, with all the members of this parliament, recognised that. I thank you for the extension of time. this motion that we take note of the report Sticks and stones, done by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I first congratulate the member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford) on the contribution he has made to the debate. I hope he does not regard this remark as in any sense belittling his speech: I think it is a speech that could have been made by members on either side of this committee chamber. some strange reason, because we were not being antagonistic, we in some way belittled the contribution he had made. I would also say that it reflected the professionalism that he brings into this chamber in view of his 25 years of experience in the teaching profession. I was very appreciative of the illustrations he brought from the experiences he had had as an educator. I am not one who has had any professional involvement in education at all. But I have, in common with other people in the chamber, an interest in what education is all about; because I am, in common with most others, a parent. As a parent all too frequently absent from the role that ought to be exercised in the education of children-and that is a frustration we all face as members of the federal parliament-I nonetheless have endeavoured to be familiar with what was happening to my children in schools. I have been advantaged by the fact that my wife was herself, prior to the children arriving, a secondary school teacher, and that she is therefore anxious to ensure that their education is of the highest order. She has always kept me briefed on what she thought were the various strengths and weaknesses of their education and of the schools they were attending. In thumbing through the report Sticks and stones-and I am not on the standing committee, so I was not directly involved in its preparation-what impressed me most was that violence is not a regular feature of Australian school life. That was an observation I expected to be able to make, because my children have not been any more exposed to bullying and violent behaviour than I was 40 years ago, as illustrated by the comments by member for Port Adelaide. In fact, as other members would be aware, the reports of antisocial and violent behaviour in New South Wales schools affected, it was alleged, only 0.04 per cent of students. In the case of ACT schools, in 1991 the number of suspensions was 447 out of 40,000 students, representing 0.01 per cent. My observations are that my children are no more exposed to verbal harassment and physical harassment than I was-and, in fact, probably less so. I think that children have a right, as",127,Representa Tives Main Committee

404,Mr Andrew,"And should be, I clearly agree. I simply did not want him to feel that forMC 1502 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 everyone else would agree, to attend a school feeling safe and secure, being reassured that they will not be belittled, and to feel that, in the school environment, they will have a real opportunity for their own self-esteem to be enhanced. If there is one thing that has been brought home to me as a parent, it is that the self-esteem of individual children is of fundamental importance. The honourable member for Port Adelaide reinforced this not only with the illustrations he used from his own experience but also with the comments he made as a professional. If people feel they have self-worth and feel they have a contribution to make to society, it is highly unlikely that they will be involved in violent behaviour. I have only one problem with the honourable member for Port Adelaide's comments. He said that interested, motivated, enthusiastic students do not become problems regardless of their home background. I expect he is right; however, very few interested, motivated, enthusiastic students come out of a difficult home background. merely making the observation that it is much easier to be an interested, motivated and enthusiastic student if the parents have already cultivated that sense of enthusiasm at home. I well remember what for me was the most terrorising book I have read. I read it very early in my primary school days, which was probably a mistake. I was amused by one of my colleagues who observed the other day that the best three years of his life had been spent in year one-that was a mischievous remark. I remember that it was not long after I acquired the capacity to read that someone gave me the book Tom Brown's Schooldays. I read it and I was mortified. I feared that I would experience either in the latter part of primary school or in secondary school the sort of bullying that was characterised in the book Tom Brown's Schooldays. I was obviously much too immature to have read the book at the time; it set an artificial scene for me of what secondary school life would be like. For most of us, some sort of verbal harassment and, I suspect, for most of our generation, some physical harassment was a reality of the schools in which we grew up. That did not make it defensible, but it was a reality, and I suspect that exhibits itself less frequently today than it did in my own day. From my experience as a parent, bullying and harassment is less of a feature of all-girls schools than it is of all-boys schools. My children spent their primary school years in public schools. They spent their secondary schooling in private schools, with the exception of one child, who had two years of his secondary schooling in a public school. From my daughter's experience in an all-girls school in Adelaide, it was the best thing we did for her. Her sense of self-esteem was enhanced and there was relatively little physical bullying. Of course, there was some verbal bullying that characterises what we would loosely call-and I use the term advisedly-the 'bitchiness' of an all-girls school environment. On the other hand, my oldest son for the latter part of his secondary schooling went to an all-boys school where bullying was more a part of the scene-and we all know what goes on at all-boys schools. As a result of his experience, we have sent our younger son to a school catering for both sexes. Lest it be thought that I am being critical of the schooling experience of my older son, I should say that, in confronting the headmaster with our decision not to send our younger son there, I was impressed with what had been done in the intervening years by that school community to address the problem of both bullying and verbal abuse. I frame my",129,Representa Tives Main Committee
405,Mr Sawford,Not true.,130,Representatives Main Committee
406,Mr Andrew,"Rather than debate this across the chamber, we can pick it up later. I amThursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1503 remarks this morning around the fact that I believe that, without exception, switched-on schools are doing something about bullying and verbal abuse. I pick up the remarks made by the member for Port Adelaide. I entirely agree with him that it does not matter whether it is a private school or a public school; what is happening in violence in schools is very much a reflection on the principal and the staff of a school. My own view of the public school system has been that my children were being well served there by teachers who deserved to be paid twice the salary they were being paid, because of the effort they put into effectively parenting at school, and were served there by other teachers who were not worth feeding and who could not be disciplined in an effective way. I have no doubt the member for Port Adelaide faced some of this frustration as a principal when he had staff members for whom he wanted to offer a greater remuneration and was unable to do so, and staff members whom he would gladly have shown the front gate but was unable to do so. And that has been one of the difficulties that I felt has characterised the public school system more markedly-not exclusively but more markedly-than the private school system. What is important for all of us is to ensure that our children, both at home and at school, have a real sense of self-worth and self-importance. Any form of bullying, whether it is physical or verbal, breaks that down and does untold damage that takes a long time to address. I want to pick up the recommendations that were made to the minister and his response. I am not quite as enthusiastic as the member for Port Adelaide about data collection, though I clearly recognise his professionalism in this area. My attitude comes rather as an observing parent. The first recommendation was that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in consultation with state and territory ministers for education, fund the evaluation of successful approaches adopted by schools to determine the best practice, and that the result of that evaluation be published and disseminated. This recommendation was encouraging the ministers to hold a series of forums and to thoroughly consider the practices that were working effectively in schools. That recommendation ran parallel to the second recommendation, which was that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training fmance the development of a national school violence data collection system referred to by the member for Port Adelaide. My own view was that, frankly, it is not this sort of data that we need as much as we need concerned parents anxious to ensure that at home there is a positive home environment to reinforce the positive environment that we would seek to cultivate in schools. It may well be that data collection is n-cessary, but I fear that data collection of itself achieves very little and I would not want the resources funnelled into data collection to be at the expense of resources that we could make available to encourage young parents to be more effective and more positive parents and to take the assets they have in children and build them up and give them a greater sense of self-esteem. The third recommendation was that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training discuss with state and territory ministers the need for early intervention strategies to address violent and anti-social behaviour in students. We would all agree with that. I think it is important that students' capacity to live with others, to cooperate with others and to recognise the worth of others is inculcated at an early age, because the later it gets the harder it is to develop the sort of human behaviour techniques that we would want to encourage. MC 1504 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 The next recommendation was that the Minister for Communications and the Arts examine the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. This is a recommendation that has largely been endorsed by people on both sides of this chamber, and the plea has been for greater recognition of the damage that violent television viewing can do to young minds. It is the reason we have some sort of categorisation system and it is the reason all of us, as concerned parents, are very anxious to ensure that our children do not see the sort of movies that we would not want them to see. The problem we face, once again, is where there has been family breakdown and there is not the same level of intervention in children's viewing. I pick up the interesting remark made by the member for Port Adelaide about a family experience he had had where the parents were rather laissez-faire in their approach to upbringing and the children were nonetheless well adjusted because the children knew the parents cared. The secret, of course, is in reassuring parents and children, where they are in a disciplined house, or what we would call a relatively non-disciplined house, that mum and dad are worried about their outcome. In that sort of environment, what they view is conditioned by mum and dad's attitude anyway. It is to those who grow up in families where mum and dad clearly appear not to care that the damage is truly done. Recently, I reluctantly went to see the film Once Were Warriors. My post-teenage children recommended that father should see it. I was sure they were anxious to cultivate what little was left of my left-wing tendencies. I was wrong. It was an excellent movie. I recommend it to everyone. It was a very graphic illustration, not of domestic violence in an horrific sense, but of the way in which a particular circumstance makes domestic violence almost inevitable. J left the movie chastened by what I had seen. I recommend Once Were Warriors because it illustrates how the breakdown of family life has an impact on every individual member of the family. Finally, I turn to the recommendation that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training review the attendance and performance eligibility criteria for Austudy for students in years 11 and 12. I represent an electorate in which Austudy is a major problem. The major problem is not that the criteria are unfair. In fact, having spent a lot of time following up Austudy cases, I am not a critic of the way in which the government administers it. The problem that I face-and it is a problem the government is familiar with-is in terms of people who remain asset rich and, particularly in recent times, cash poor. I do not have a simple solution to make Austudy available to those in rural areas who have assets that they cannot readily dispose of because they need them in order to run an effective business when, in this case, the drought is over. However, no doubt there are many cases where the capacity to educate children is directly affected by the unavailability of Austudy. I encourage the government to look at the way in which Austudy is administered, particularly in rural areas. A number of people are denied it because of their assets, but they are unable to offer their children in years II and 12 and in tertiary education the sort of education those children need. This builds up frustration, which can lead to violent behaviour. Mr Sawford interjectingremarks, I did not doubt that the government was aware of the problem, but it is a critical one. I once again make the plea that all children be given a greater sense of self-esteem, for that is the secret to a fulfilled life. (Time expired)",130,Representatives Main Committee
407,Mr Andrew,"I thank the member for Port Adelaide for that. As I said in my earlierThursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1505 Adelaide( Mr Sawford) on his excellent speech on school violence. This subject is something near and dear to me as, like the member for Port Adelaide, prior to coming into parliament a couple of years ago, I had been in the teaching profession for most of my working life. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion to take note of the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on violence in schools, which is commonly known as Sticks and stones. As a member of the committee and as a former school teacher, I appreciated the opportunity during the inquiry to broaden my understanding of what to me has always been a most pressing problem, not just for education but because it impacts on so many other aspects of society. While travelling around Australia, hearing from state departments, principals, teachers, parents, and students, one soon gained a feel for what is happening throughout the country. One of the aspects that I enjoy about being a politician is getting the big picture in that way. It was pleasing to note, as it said in the introduction to its response, that the government welcomes the report. It says that the report is: A timely and important contribution to the current debate in Australia about the nature, impact and incidence of violence in our schools. As previous speakers have noted, the issue of violence in schools is a very complex one, and there are no simplistic answers. Unfortunately, many people in our society-including many politicians-seem to think that the whole issue can be dealt with by schools and within schools. One of the common problems is that many politicians do not focus, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide said, on the primary school years. We are taken to universities, technical colleges and institutes of further education and we are overwhelmed by the technological impact of what we see. Thus, we think that we should fund those areas. However, when we go into a grade 1 class and see a young teacher with 30 young children in front of her imparting knowledge, values, ideals and basic learning techniques, we cannot see any benefit. It is all theoretical. It is only 10 years later that the impact of what has or has not been done in those very formative years becomes obvious. The manifestation of violence or anti-social behaviour within the precincts of schools very often has nothing to do with what is happening in the educative process of the child. But because it does happen in schools, teachers, students, social workers and parents are forced to intervene in order to impose some order. Very often due to inadequate resources they are never able to properly address the real reason behind the violent outburst. I would like to provide honourable members with some first-hand true anecdotes of such anti-social behaviour to highlight and complement the recommendations from the report and the government's response to them. The first example is of young Brian. I well remember him coming to school. Not long after we had started work early in the morning in the grade 4 class he violently and without provocation assaulted one of his classmates. I had been teaching for quite a few years at that stage and sensed that something was not quite right. Because he trusted me, after some reluctance and embarrassment on his part and having been withdrawn from the rest of the class, he tearfully explained to me the reason behind his outburst. By the way, it was a very hot day and it was rather unusual that he was wearing a polo-neck jumper. He finally peeled back the jumper to show me the cuts on his neck where his mother's boyfriend had used a knife to assert his authority over the young child. Brian's mum had just had a new baby by the boyfriend and Brian really was not wanted as part of the new family.",132,Representatives Main Committee
408,Mr Quick (Franklin) (11.18 A.m.),"I also compliment the honourable member for PortMC 1506 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 He came to school angry and frustrated and hit out at the first person that he came in contact with. Because we had adequate counselling facilities at that school, the social worker from the department of welfare was quickly able to become involved and the local police responded rapidly and effectively, I am pleased to say that Brian today is a very well adjusted young man who recently finished his apprenticeship and is now living in a loving relationship with his family. That was possible only because we had the resources there and because the teachers fostered a caring atmosphere in the school. As the inquiry noted, the community at large is becoming increasingly concerned about violence in schools. This concern is placing increased pressure on state governments, which is resulting in the .issuegaining a high priority. As previous speakers have mentioned, programs are now being introduced by the states and territories to alleviate this problem. It was interesting to note that when the inquiry was in full swing only the states of South Australia and Queensland and the territory of the ACT bothered to make submissions. It was rather disappointing that in the case of my state, Tasmania,· rather than get involved in the inquiry, the government handed the task over to a Tasmanian education council to do its own special report. Its report consequently dwelt on the problem from an educational perspective in total isolation. The announcement on the solving of the problem was to provide an additional teacher to every secondary school and college to handle disruptive students. To me, that is far too late. Surely, as a society, we have two issues to address: firstly, to put in place programs to solve the current problems; and, secondly, to ensure that we have in place strategies which will reduce the number of children leaving primary schools who are still at risk. Just to address the first issue is self-defeating. The numbers keep on rising and the problems will surely escalate to what is happening overseas, especially in the United States of America. I have had the privilege--doubtful though it might be.:......of actually working in schools there, and I know exactly what the problems are that they face: they are horrendous. In all states, as the member for Port Adelaide mentioned, education departments have initiated large cutbacks, especially in the area of support staff. I think it is vital that all primary schools have a full quota of specialist teachers. In most schools in Tasmania-in primary schools-there are in excess of $70,000 or $80,000 of library books and no librarians. There are no music, phys. ed., or special ed. teachers, and those kids are at risk. As we found out in the violence in schools report, close to 15 per cent of primary school children who leave and go to high schools are now at risk. We need to solve the problem before they leave. From my 20-odd years in primary school teaching, one of the ways is through providing strategies and teachers to enable a child to reach his or her full potential in those specialist areas as well as providing the excellent teaching that takes place in the classrooms. We will not then be putting those children at risk. On that point, one of the principal recommendations and one which I think the government supports wholeheartedly is the need for this identification of best practice in schools. As the previous members have mentioned, too many schools in Australia have been working in isolation and merely solving the problems associated with their own neighbourhood. Their best practice school behaviour, peer support and development of a school-wide ethos of nonviolence must be extended throughout the nation. Part 1.12 in the report states: A whole school approach to student behaviour necessarily involves a number of elements: Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1507 the provision of a caring environment; the establishment of firm behaviour limits where students' rights and responsibilities are clearly stated; the implementation of fair and consistent sanctions when rules are transgressed; monitoring of children's behaviour both in the classroom and playground; the adoption of a method of 'mediating' poor student behaviour; the training of staff in 'mediation'; and the encouragement of parental involvement in their children's lives. All these sound so simple and so self evident, but I can assure members that these criteriaare missing in many schools throughout our nation. I can take members to a school close to my electorate office where the primary school principal refuses to allow parents to become involved in his school. There are schools where caning is still meted out to deter anti-social behaviour. These activities are knowingly condoned by the education departments. In my electorate I am delighted to say that we have some visionary teachers who, despite all the setbacks, have some wonderful early intervention programs. I would like to take this opportunity to note them in public: Herdsmans Cove Primary School and the excellent work of Doreen Lutjens in running an early intervention program pre-school for· in excess of 60 parents and about 90 children; Geilston Bay High School under Trevor Rootes; Rugby High School under Greg Cairnduff; Geeveston District High School and the excellent work in the Star program by Greg Suitor; Bridgewater High School and the tireless work in the intervention process by Graham Speight; and, Peter Marmion and his wonderful staff at Franklin Primary School. , I also welcolJle the federal government's support for a series of forums on schools held in each state and territory. I think it is essential that, rather than having the bureaucrats and the experts as the member for La Trobe( Mr Charles) mentioned, we identify these best practice schools, document what they are doing, have them talk together and then follow up the key findings of these forums and develop policies, programs and performance indicators based on their best practice activities. These best practice schools do have the answers. We need the bureaucrats from the education department and from the departments of community welfare, health, housing, sport and recreation, and community services, to be able to listen in and find out just how important their roles are in this process. It is not just an issue solely relatedto education. To highlight this need for an interdepartmental approach to this problem of violence in schools, I would like to place on record the wonderful work that is happening in the northern suburbs of Adelaide.· My last example of first-hand information is young Jimmy. I first came in contact with him in grade 3. He had serious problems-sadistic behaviour from an early age. He used to feed kittens to his german shepherd to get his kicks. He delighted in hurting young people and girls. We fought in vain to involve the necessary support personnel in Jimmy's case but there always seemed to be someone with a more pressing need. Jimmy stabbed his mother to death and was sentenced to life imprisonment at the age of 17. Throughout the inquiry the committee constantly heard about the need for early intervention and support for families so that they could deal with the problem of violence in schools. I welcome the government's very supportive and constructive response to the recommendations concerning the piloting of positive parenting programs and the examination of the manner in which government services are delivered to students and families requiring support from more than one agency. The development by state and territory governments of a youth strategy MC 1508 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 coordinating committee is welcome news. However, one hopes and prays that there will be more benefits flowing from this committee than from the youth affairs departments which each state has-usually attached to the Premier's office-and which were supposedly set up to monitor such issues. I have mentioned the role of the Commonwealth in the students at risk program as being one of the examples of the government's involvement in initiatives which support issues raised by the Sticks and stones report. My only criticism of the students at risk program is that it is far too late. I want to see the program widened and supported financially by the states so that it can be introduced to primary schools, where, by supporting school based programs, the number of young children leaving primary schools while they are still at risk can be reduced. I want to point out the role of the media in this situation. Less sensationalist and more investigative journalism is needed to promote the best practice that is happening around our country. I cite two examples from the Mercury of Wednesday, 1 March in its reporting of the government's response. The headline says 'Tackling teacher abuse'. One gets a totally incorrect idea from a quick glance at that headline. The Mercury has another headline saying 'Call for more resources for problem students'. It can be seen that the whole issue of journalists getting involved needs to be looked at. I welcome the bipartisan support in this very important issue, and I hope that people take note of the report and of the government's response. the Sticks and stones report. In doing so, I must say how much I enjoyed the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in this particular exercise. The committee which worked on this report was a very positive and friendly committee, and it was bipartisan in the way it approached each of the topics that it met during the course of the report. Nevertheless, I have some reservations about the government's response, and I will deal with those reservations. From the outset, I must say that one of the early disappointments was the way in which the government glossed over the connection between violence and bullying. It is very important that this difference is noted. The committee was able to differentiate, as it moved around Australia, that bullying is becoming more prevalent and that overt violence, if anything, is becoming somewhat less prevalent. It is interesting to note that, while acts of overt physical violence are rare events in most schools, bullying is prevalent. Australian research found that one child in seven reports being bullied at least once a week by other children at school. While the distribution of bullying amongst schools is uneven, in some schools it is as high as one in four. That information is contained in an extract from the report of the committee. As I said, the incidence of overt violence seems to be on the decrease, at least within the schoolyard. The committee found evidence of overt violence outside the schoolyard, but it also found that bullying is a much more profound occurrence, and, in a way, it is much more insidious. This point was made to the committee by the New South Wales Teachers Federation, which pointed out that, in three-quarters of a million students, there are only 50 to 100 incidents of actual physical violence per semester. Although that would not appear to be a big problem, bullying is prevalent across the spectrum. The National Committee on Violence, in its report Violence: Directions/or Australia, said it agreed that:",133,Representa Tives Main Committee
409,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.32 A.m.),"I broadly welcome the government's response toThursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1509 · .. there are disciplinary problems within many schools and that there are offences of various kinds and degrees of seriousness committed in and around schools, but that they are not necessarily cause for alarm or for vigorous reaction. So, at this point, we need to move on to where we feel the distinction lies. This is where the bulk of the work must be concentrated-at that fine point between violence and bullying. In our report, we defined bullying as: · . . repeated and unprovoked negative behaviour (both physical and non-physical) directed by more powerful students or groups of students against less powerful students. However, we went on to say that what seemed to affect the extent to which bullying occurred was the extent to which school staff were involved in the students' lives. Here we discovered quite a distinction as between schools and I believe this distinction revolved around how well the holistic school approach was applied to student behaviour. This approach needs to include a number of major elements which we listed in our report: · the provision of a caring environment; · the establishment of firm behaviour limits where students ' rights and responsibilities were clearly stated; · the implementation of fair and consistent sanctions when rules are transgressed; · monitoring of children's behaviour both in the classroom and playground; · the adoption of a method of 'mediating' poor student behaviour; · training of staff in 'mediation'; and · the encouragement of parental involvement in their children's lives. It is interesting that two of the best schools we found in that regard had invoked all or most of those particular key points. It is also interesting that my colleague opposite, the member for Bass( Mrs Silvia Smith), is here because we found that the Mayfield Primary School in Launceston was one of the best examples, among primary schools, of the adoption of that school regime. Another interesting aspect of this, which was touched on by other speakers earlier in the debate, was the quality of leadership within the school. We found that in Mayfield-as we did at the next school I wish to refer to, which is the Patrician Brothers High School at Granville in the western suburbs of Sydney. This old school is not unlike the ones we used to see in the old English films-the twoor three-storey brick schools surrounded by asphalt courtyards with very little in the way of sporting facilities. The school is in what you would have to describe charitably as one of the more depressed parts of the western suburbs of Sydney, 76 per cent of the students come from ethnic backgrounds, and yet it was arguably the best school we came across in our study. Again, the reason was that these key pointers we identified were largely invoked in that school. For example, one of the requirements of a teacher being on the staff was that he or she-be they religious or lay teachers-had to participate in the pastoral care of the students. There was a regime of respect-this idea of privilege and responsibility-and that was demonstrated very clearly in a rule that the school had invoked. That was that there was to be no touching of another student, other than at contact sport. In other words, everyone had to respect everyone else's space. There was also a great sense offamily both within the school and with the involvement of the students' families from outside the school. While I have never been a great believer in corporal punishment, I never go to the extent of saying that we should deny all schools in all circumstances the right to administer limited MC 1510 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 corporal punishment. Although corporal punishment was not administered in this school very often, when I questioned a group of 29 students I asked the worse boy how often he would be punished by the strap. He said, 'Perhaps two or three times a year.' People would hardly say that that was a violent atmosphere in that school. Interestingly, it put an ultimate sanction into the system. Sometimes, in this age of anti-corporal punishment, we have gone too far to the other end of the spectrum in allowing teachers or principals to exercise a right which may prevent worse behavioural problems. If the right to administer corporal punishment came from the degree of control, happiness and general well-being that was in a school, then this principal earned the right to administer it because he certainly had a school which, against all odds, was a great example. Moving on to the government's response to the committee's recommendations, notably that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in conjunction with the state and territory ministers, find an evaluation of successful approaches which might lead to best practice, the government has said that it would set up a steering committee for the dissemination of results in this field and that it might consider an award system for schools that show leadership. I commend that particular recommendation. The government also acknowledged our recommendation that the minister, in conjunction with his state and territory ministerial colleagues, develop a school violence data collection system-I am paraphrasing the recommendation. I do not have any hang-ups about this and about privacy. It is just raw data. The minister has delegated that to the statistics task force of the ministerial council, the McEETYA. We also had the recommendation that the minister, with his state and federal colleagues, look at early intervention strategies to address violence and anti-social behaviour. As we worked through the ministerial responses, I had a feeling, as a previous speaker mentioned, that while the government was sensitive to the committee's needs in theory, there was not much happening in practice. Again, it was referred to a ministerial council, and to the committee, saying that it was to reassess the level of Commonwealth recurrent funding to government primary schools. If the government set up this inquiry, gave this committee a reference and went broad-ranging across all of Australia, it could not hide its response in the great litany of programs, many of them most commendable, that are in the addendum to its response on the one hand, nor can it say that it is going to fix it up by a series of ministerial councils. It is going to have to have some hard edged contribution from the Commonwealth. That may mean some form of direct government funding or funding through ministerial councils for specific projects. I am not satisfied with the government's response to effects of television, video film, video games, et cetera, on learning outcomes and behaviour. The fact that there is an overlap between the Department of Communications and the Arts and the Department of Employment, Education and Training is not a sound basis for stepping away from this problem. Did we not all last Sunday hear the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) say, with his new-found zeal for a fourth family television channel, that the current fare being dished up to families was largely-and I use his own words-' American bilge'. I think that the Department of Employment, Education and Training must take an interest in these matters. We have had all sorts of inquiries into television, videos and video games. We sit on the edge of the information superhighway, and we turn around and duck the issue Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1511 on the most fundamental level of all entertainment: its effect on children and the spin-offs it has on the children's behaviour and educational outcomes. If we duck this particular issue, we are kidding ourselves. During our inquiry there was a lot of anecdotal evidence, at least, to point to a need for greater attention to that field. In the time remaining to me, I would like to touch for a few moments on the link between violence and educational outcomes. The government has said in its report that it believes the causes of violence in schools are many and varied, and it notes that any causal links between literacy and violence are not well established. I do not think that that is a fair assessment. There may not have been many great causal links between smoking and lung cancer, initially, but there was a lot of anecdotal evidence that should have been acted on. I think this holds true here, because further on in the report, where the government quotes the Star program, it goes on to say that the improvement of basic literacy, numeracy and social skills necessary for students to function in society, raising their self-esteem and skills for coping with conflict and aggression, was an essential feature. But the government cannot say, on the one hand, that there is no causal effect, and then quote its own Star program saying that there is. this House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report on violence in schools called Sticks and stones, and also to speak to the government response to that report. As my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Hinkler( Mr Neville), has said, I was also part of that inquiry. Along with my colleagues, I wish to offer my appreciation to all of those who participated in any way in this report. It was not only those members of this government and those opposite who participated in bringing down this Sticks and stones report: various groups, organisations, schools and children participated, and it is already proving to be a valuable document due to the information that was gathered and the recommendations that it proffered. Our schools must be able to provide a safe learning environment for our children. That environment must be a caring environment, an environment that establishes firm behavioural limits, where students' rights are clearly demonstrated and their responsibilities are clearly stated. There must be sanctions when rules are transgressed, monitoring of children's behaviour in the classroom and in the playground, and a variety of other measures. We must not automatically assume that schools are either safe or unsafe, and it is by proceeding with inquiries such as the Sticks and stones inquiry that we can assure our children and their parents that the school environment will be safe and conducive to the learning process. The media, in its reporting of often very singular and isolated incidents, has often blown this issue out of all proportion, and has perhaps contributed to the community perception that our education system is violent or chaotic. We need to consider that perhaps schools reflect the behaviour patterns of our society, the society in which they are located. Throughout the deliberation of the committee, it was found that there are many schools where the principals have shown, and are showing, strong leadership---especially in those instances where there has been recognition that violent behaviour can be changed. These schools have developed a whole school approach to addressing school violence, alongside ensuring that their students are very much aware of their rights. Major importance has been placed on students taking responsibility for themselves and others, as well as on teachers taking their responsibility.",136,Representatives Main Committee
410,Mrs Silvia Smith (Bass) (11.48 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise today to speak toMC 1512 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 I take this opportunity to focus on two particular recommendations and the· government response to those. The committee recommended that: . the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in consultation with State and Territory Ministers for Education, fund the evaluation of successful approaches adopted by schools to detennine best practice; and . the result of that evaluation be published and disseminated. As we conducted our inquiry, it became quite evident that there were schools operating under a best practice system with a whole school approach-in particular, when dealing with violence in the school environment. I will take the time to quote part of the report itself. The honourable member for Hinkler, who spoke previously, mentioned the Mayfield School in my electorate of Bass. When we visited Mayfield, the committee did so with my encouragement, as the school had not proffered a submission; but I knew what was going on there from close contact with that school, and I was determined that the inquiry and the committee should see that there was a program in place where a whole school approach had been taken to look at this issue. Mayfield Primary School drew its student population from family situations where 70 per cent of parents were unemployed. Mayfield is a very depressed suburb of Launceston in many ways-and, I might add, a suburb where I spent a couple of years of my own life. As recently as four years ago, the playground of that school was considered unsafe. The introduction of the supportive school environment approach eliminated these problems. The program which operated in the school was not an isolated program but an integral part of every aspect of school life. There was recognition by the principal and teachers that violent behaviour could be changed, and their dedication to effecting that change largely contributed to the turnaround in behaviour which the school experienced. The program endeavoured to promote the well-being of all those who worked within the school community. Throughout the program, children in particular learnt skills in behaviour management and conflict resolution. Students learned mutual respect and cooperation. Students in year 6 provided guidance and support for younger pupils, and all students were responsible for observing and reporting incidents which were contrary to the philosophy of the school. By being successful, children gained confidence and felt positive about themselves and others. The school had developed a clear set of rights, as well as of responsibilities. These were developed between the teachers, pupils and parents, and were considered to be owned by the whole school community. The school developed rules that related to learning, movement, treatment, problem solving, safety, and talking and communication. While there was concern about the lack of resources, the environment in the school was improved immeasurablywithout the allocation of additional resources. This school had clearly stated consequences for behaviour. These consequences were positive for positive behaviour, and negative for inappropriate behaviour. The rules were also applied consistently. In all academic streams, the children were taught appropriate behaviour as an integral part of the teaching process. As an ex-schoolteacher, I know that has been the philosophy in my life: we need guidelines for our young people so that they know what the parameters of behaviour are. They also need to know that they may have to pay some price if they overstep those parameters. The government's response has been for the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training( Mr Free) to seek the cooperation of state and territory ministers and non-government Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1513 systems to hold a series of forums to certify and identify the best in practice in whole school approaches to address violence in schools around Australia. This is a very appropriate action. As the honourable member for Hinkler said, the government also hopes to establish a national mechanism for evaluating and disseminating the results of those discussions. This can only help and benefit those who look after our children in school hours. There is also to be an investigation into establishing a cooperative best practice award for schools. This would be something to display for leadership in this field. The committee was also keen to note that principals, teachers and community groups identified violence via the media, film, video games and negative modelling. That was one that came in quite unawares to the committee. In particular, via the media, a lot of negative modelling from some of the negative behaviour of our sports heroes has influenced how children react. I am sure we are all aware of that. They see their peers and their role models doing something and they think it is okay for them to do it as well. The committee also accepted that the media and entertainment industries were out of the control of the schools. It was hoped that parents could and would exercise control over the programs and video games that their children watch and play. Therefore, the second recommendation that I would like to focus on deals with the media and entertainment side of violence that is seen in our schools. The committee recommends that the Minister for Communications and the Arts( Mr Lee) commission a national research project to examine the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. In this part of the argument, we cannot ignore the influence of parents and the extended family on student behaviour. Therefore, it is essential for the government to respond to the needs of families. All children should receive the necessary support to provide a safer and nonviolent school environment. There was evidence of violence by the media throughout the committee's deliberations. It is stated vehemently in the Sticks and stones report. It says: The influence exerted on children by the media and entertainment industry in general, was overwhelmingly identified in evidence as a contributor to the acceptance of, and the use of, violence by children. Children do not distinguish between violence outside the school and violence inside the school environment. The report continues: Evidence from the Australian Children's Television Action Committee stated that on average, by the time an Australian child was fourteen or sixteen years old he or she would have seen some eighteen thousand murders on television. This is quite alarming. It goes on: They referred to three thousand studies which identified a connection between the impact of media violence and the instigation of later violence. Mr Deputy Speaker, you must agree that is damning evidence of the control that some media may have over our children's future lives. It is not only in that type of movie or video that children gather violent behaviours. The report goes on: F or example, teachers also referred to changed playground behaviours, such as kicking and punching by primary pupils, which coincided with the televising of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I have evidence of that in two nephews whose behaviour changed quite violently after having watched that particular program. MC 1514 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 Further, television series such as Neighbours and Home and Away were identified as programs providing questionable role models for children developing social values and models for future behaviour. These programs were watched by children from six upwards. As Gclassified programs they did not require parental supervision but, while not explicitly violent, they modelled belligerent attitudes and showed little respect for important values which children were learning. To counter the effects of programs such as these, the council argued for two levels of Grated programs, one for adolescents and one for sixto 12-year-old children. It is interesting to note that so many people and so many groups identify media as having some influence on the violence of children. That is not necessarily just in the school environment, although it does manifest there in particular, as we found in this inquiry. In the government's response it was agreed that there was some concern that the media and entertainment industries have a clear responsibility to discourage the production of material which promotes violent and aggressive behaviour and attitudes. Processes to disseminate results of findings in this area to organisations such as school parent bodies will be a focus of the government's response. The communications and arts portfolio is already acting to safeguard the well-being of children in relation to media content, as well as the broadcasting services through the Broadcasting Services Act 1992; and committee members, along with other interested members, groups and organisations, will keep a watchful eye on all research projects and processes in place now, to ensure that wherever possible children are not subjected to undue violence and harmful material via films, media, video games and even advertising material. This report must be looked at by everyone. I am pleased to say that within my own electorate many schools have asked for copies of this report so they can look at our findings, look at our recommendations and develop whole school approaches and best principles for looking at violence within their schools. I support the motion that the House take note of the paper. about the report on violence in schools. I speak as a member of the education, employment and training committee, even though coming in a little later, not initially being a member of that committee for that inquiry. FirstI would like to say a few words about the history of our schooling system over the last 20 or 25 years, in my experience of it. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, are a former teacher and many former teachers bring their professional background and their understanding of educational issues into the parliament. I bring a somewhat different perspective, as someone who experienced the education system for only about 10 years of my life. However, in my early adult experience of the education systems, as my children were growing up, I became aware that the education system had approximately a doubling of the resources in the early 1970s and a doubling of the staffing, as the government of the day saw that as a priority. I guess the promise in those times was that, if we could put more resources into education, we would reap a reward. Looking back over that 20to 25-year period, however, at best we could say that the results were mixed. I offer one statistic-the youth unemployment statistic. We might look back over the last few years and say that there are certain areas where the resources are limited and where resources have been reduced. But if we look at the span of",139,Representatives Main Committee
411,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (12.03 P.m.),"I too welcome the opportunity to say a few wordsThursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1515 history, especially over the last 20 or 30 years, we find that there has been a very significant taxpayer contribution to education. I have to say that some of the social issues around that expenditure bear greater scrutiny; What happened in that time was we had the three Rs being taught in the general curriculum of the day, which was seen to be appropriate. Then we saw more social experimentation, if you like. We got into a range of extra activities and put greater burdens on schools. Sadly, at the same time, parents were left out in the cold. I make these comments in preface to my remarks on this report because I think we have to see the report, and where our schooling system is at, in the context not just of the last few years but of a generation or two. As I said, parents were left out in the cold. As time went on, those in the teaching profession found that the load got too heavy. Parents were important after all. Parents were not just nuisances to be sidelined and prevented from being involved in the lives-and, particularly, the education---of their children. The moral self-righteousness that not all but many teachers had in those early years of enthusiasm in the 1970s gave way to a greater realisation that it was a full team and full community approach, that there were, indeed, limitations to what the schools could achieve, and limitations to the role of our teachers, that schools should not just be a social experiment, and that families were important in the overall situation. Gradually, as time has gone on, there has been a lesser expectation of what schools can achieve and of their role in society. In my own state of South Australia, the dear old South Australian Institute of Teachers will always campaign against anything Liberal, and I understand that. That is the traditional line-up of the political equation. But, in that process, we must be very careful that our schools, as much as possible, be apolitical. Our schools should not be involved too much in what is deigned to be 'politically correct' from a particular perspective. There should not be excessive denigration and ridicule of a person's value judgments, religious beliefs or, indeed, political beliefs. The atmosphere of a greater political tolerance that I hope might be emerging in our education system brings us to the topic of the day-the violence in schools report and the government's response. Violence in schools is, of course, only indicative of the greater violence in the wider community. Children are great mimics. We must remember this when forming any anti-violence policies for children. We must remember that children are just reflecting what they see around them, and they are highly influenced by family, friends, television and other segments of society. In that, of course, we must include the education system, their teachers and their friends and peers at school. One of the things which this committee found was that there is a lack of concrete evidence about the level of violence and bullying in schools, and a lack of research on the effects of television and media violence. That is a great pity, because it makes it that much harder to formulate policy. Therefore, the committee has recommended that further research and data needs to be collected. The previous speaker, the member for Bass (Ms Sylvia Smith), made the point that I was going to make about the 18,000 murders that children may view on television in their first 14 or 16 years of life. If it we,re not for television and other forms of entertainment, how much experience of murders would children have? Of course, we would all say, 'Very little or none, except perhaps some information from books and newspapers.' Therefore, clearly, television and movies have a very significant influence on bringing the world of violence into the homes MC 1516 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 of children. It is that casual exposure that, after a while, we need to understand far more, as a nation. The Prime Minister( Mr Keating) made sollie comments about a family TV channel, and maybe the idea has some worthy notions around it. It appears that his idea is called highly impractical, inherently unlikely, and ill-thought through. Be that as it may, the Prime Minister makes a reasonable point that the exposure of the family and of young children to these sorts of programs is something that the nation should be more aware of. We cannot have a slapdash solution thrown at the level of violence which children see through the media, and this is why the committee believes that substantial research should take place. Yesterday, the Advertiser, my home state newspaper, discussed a national survey on how TV influences children in the United States. More than two-thirds of the 10to 16-yearolds interviewed claimed that they were influenced by television, and that this influence includes an increase in aggressive behaviour. AlthoughI do not know how comprehensive the survey was, I believe it is time, and the committee believes it is time, that more work was done in Australia on this issue. In the state of South Australia, extensive research has been done on the subject of school bullying. I am currently involved with another inquiry which will expose more about the issue. Parents, of course, are concerned about the level of violence on television, particularly violence in cartoons. and in daytime programs which are especially for children. Violent programs often have their own line of merchandise in toy stores, allowing young children to dress up as their heroes and to re-enact the violent behaviour they have seen on televisiorL Children are simply being exploited in the violence industry, and parents cannot constantly monitor what their children are watching. There is a role for parents to play, and they should be involved to a greater extent and have a greater input into film classifications We have come to the qUestion of what governments can do. In 'my earlier comments I touched on the span of history over the last 20 to 25 years. The index shows that we have expended a significant amount of resource into our education system. The previous speaker, the member for Bass, mentioned a school in her electorate which the committee visited. AlthoughI was not able to be involved at that time, I make the point that the comlliittee found that extra funding does not necessarily ensure the success of an anti-violence campaign in schools: The point which I make with reference to that particular school in Tasmania is that a successful anti-violence campaign was put into place without extra funding. It is an issue, but, as the report and the response acknowledges, it is not extreme. However, it is something that we need to understand more about. The issue of Austudy is raised in the report. I support the comments of the member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew) when he said that there is a need for greater recognition of the problems in regional Australia. Regional Australia is going through massive adjustment-more so, I suggest, than most of metropolitan Australia. The people who live in regional Australia are primarily less well-offthan people in the metropolitan areas of our country, and I represent one of the electorates in regional Australia. Access to education represents the main opportunity for the people who live in regional Australia to break out of the very severe adjustment process that has been going on·out there over the last decade or so. We must, in the Austudy situation, recognise the extra costs and tht( pressures which these people have. It is now clearly recognised by almost everybody that ruraIstudents are the most disadvantaged of all students when it comes to accessing tertiary studies. I believe that the general issue of Thursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1517 violence is very much tied up with the necessity for a broader educational understanding of the issue and in giving people greater opportunities. The regional Australian needs to be recognised much more so than was the case in the past. the honourable member for Grey( Mr Wakelin) dealt with. He was talking about the political equation as far as teachers unions were concerned. He never really addressed private schools and the political equation that comes from that side of education, and maybe he should have a look at that some time in his long term. The TV question is certainly one that we need to be conscious of. A lot of violence-a lot of murders-is shown on TV, including in ongoing TV programs. We need to be conscious of the quality of those TV programs. There were murders before TV and you cannot just draw the conclusion that TV causes all the problems. The committee did try to have a look at that, but I do not think there is any research that actually ties that together. One of the recommendations of the committee was that there probably needs to be a reference, some time in the future, for work to be done in that area. That is very true. It is about quality TV, and I despair a bit in relation to that when I think about all the new channels that might start to enter homes in the future. The quality of all that cable TV could be something that we as a parliament will need to deal with in the future. I think there will be a lot of junk on it and it will come back. I was quite heartened by being able, on another committee, to visit the Australian Children's Television Foundation and see the work that it does in children's programming in this country. That is an excellent foundation, which needs support constantly to continue its good work and to lift the standard of children's TV. Sticks and stones is the report of a wide-reaching and detailed study of violence in schools and the possible causes and effects, with thoughts on what could be achieved if changes could be made. This government has welcomed the report brought down by the committee, because it has raised the profile of the problem of violence in the schools and the nature of that violence, and will seek state and territory cooperation in developing a national approach in addressing this difficulty. As we saw in some of the visits the committee made around the country, there are solutions being developed and there are mechanisms in some places that more than address much of the problems of violence and disruption that takes place in the schools. These need to be shared and to be taken out into the broader context of every state and territory. I look forward to hearing more of how that comes out of a stateiterritory-federal government committee process. But there were also places in which an enormous amount of work needs to be done and I am pleased to see that this government is prepared to pick up most of the recommendations from the committee, including a number of very positive parental programs as recommended. I was disappointed in the comments that it had not been established that there was a causal link between literacy and violence and therefore there was no link. I think that was a little short-sighted. For sure, if people cannot read and write it does not mean that they are, by definition, violent people, but an inability to communicate, on top of all the other frustrations that life can offer, must lead to expression in other ways. That can mean aggression, diversion, evasion and, if none of those work, violence. We need only to look as far as our gaols to see how many people in there have low literacy skills-a very high percentage. Illiteracy thus is not a cause of violence but an expression of the causes, which may include such things as violence or assault at home, loss of self-esteem, hopelessness, lack of",142,Representatives Main Committee
412,Mr Adams (Lyons) (12.14 P.m.),"I would just like to deal with a couple of matters thatMC 1518 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 achievement, lack of parental assistance or understanding-so many things can contribute to a young person not being able to pick up essential skills .. I am happy that the government has responded to the fact that literacy is a problem. There is to. be research funding that will investigate how literacy development can be encouraged in the· home and the school, and how to deliver that encouragement. There will also be an investigation of different approaches to overcome literacy problems. I cannot stress strongly enough how important literacy is to an individual. The inability to read and write can be very easily passed through generations if there is no-one in a family who believes in the importance of literacy. Some families only have newspapers and magazines in their homes because their skills are limited. How are their children to go on and understand the need for greater skills in reading and interpreting the written word? I recently participated iIi a seminar on youth suicide in my electorate that was set up to learn why so many young people, particularly adolescent boys, had found it necessary to harm themselves or kill themselves. This finding had come out of a study in Tasmania. I have also been reading in the press about how girls are now becoming the high achievers in schools, which is adding to the pressure on young males. We, as a society, are putting pressure on our children that can be so untenable that they can only see the 'final' solution-the bottle of barbiturates or the end of a gun. Since the 1960s, our comnlUnities have moved so quickly. Technology is allowing us more time to consider such issues as the environment. There are those of us who can remember marching to ban the bom-l am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you have been on those marches as well over your long political career-searching our souls after reading Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, and demanding·that something be done about our increasingly polluting lifestyle. We were full of doom and gloom: the world would definitely end if we did not do something. But the thing is that we did do something, and things have improved considerably since those days. Although some of us are still marching on some of those issues, each day something advances the environmental cause so that there is hope, there is change, and there is considerable improvement. What we have forgotten to do is tell our children. They do not believe that anything positive has happened. They still believe the world is about to end and they are hard pushed to do anything about it. They have not had the experience that we have had.and cannot see the change. It is the same in education. Our understanding of the need for flexibility and adaptability, and not to be frightened by change or technology, is gradually occurring. But our kids still do not seem to understand the value of education. It is still too hard to find ajob, so they say, 'Why should we bother to learn?' Violence in schools has a basein many paradigms that face our young people every day. How do we equip them better? I still believe that there needs to be an enormous change in the learning process: Teaching must become a communal process. Children should learn that participation in the learning process gives them certain responsibilities and challenges, but that there is a lot of hope and excitement in meeting them and there is a meaningful life after school-even if it does not mean full-time work in a traditional job. Our job as parents and teachers is to make sure that the message gets through. I believe that this report and the government's response to it helps us greatly in moving along the way to achieving a rewarding life for most of our youngsters.

With the Commonwealth taking an interest in this problem area, there are a number of issues that relate to the Commonwealth's role in the education system. When the member for Fremantle and Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was minister for education in the Western Australian government, she made a particularly pertinent comment about going to a conference on education in Darwin. She made the comment that, on arrival, she found herself in the position where she was educating hundreds of thousands of students in the Western Australian education system and had three or four advisers with her from her department, while the Commonwealth minister, who educated no students whatsoever, fronted up with about 20 advisers. It was an interesting comment, coming from someone who is now a Commonwealth minister, because it reflects somewhat the attempts by the Commonwealth to make inroads into areas which are essentially state jurisdiction-quite substantially so. Having read the report and the government's response, I believe that there are a number of areas in which the Commonwealth can provide quite handy assistance. In particular-and I intend to go through the recommendations shortly-the key areas are: collation of information, which obviously the states are not in a position to do on a national basis; and the compilation of that type of information and research, et cetera that is likely to be of assistance to those charged with the responsibility for administering education systems within the states and territories. . I find it somewhat of a contradiction in terms to look at the Commonwealth government's response to the report on page 3 where it states: The Government also fully endorses the proposition put by the Committee that it is the right combination of action at the school level that can have the most effective impact on addressing violence in our schools. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.31 p.m. to 12.42 p.m. response. I agree entirely with the committee's finding, and I am pleased to see that the then chairman of the committee, the member for Forde is actually in the chamber. The response says: The Government also fully endorses the proposition put by the Committee that it is the right combination of action at the school level that can have the most effective impact on addressing violence in our schools. The Committee found that strong leadership by the principal and the teachers working together on the basis of a whole school approach to addressing school level violence has proven to be most effective in achieving changes in student behaviour. I agree with that entirely, and add that I think it is in fact in the devolution of the administration of schools that we will see a greater level of that grassroots evolution of the whole school approach. I believe that it is when you have the imposition or overlay of central policy decisions or programs that one tends to see the distancing or the separation of that grassroots level of school life and, of course, the objectives that pertain to this particular report. In my own case, I am the elected member for the fastest growing area in the country, with the city of Wanneroo being the fastest growing municipality, outstripping the shire of Albert and having a growth rate of around 12,000 in population per annum, so it is a particularly large and growing area. According to the statistics that are provided from time to time to us as members, the area has the greatest concentration of fiveto 15-year-olds in the country.",147,Representa Tives Main Committee
414,Mr Filing,"Before we were interrupted, I was referring to page 3 of the government'sThursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1521 Ironicru.ly, it also has the greatest concentration of four-bedroom homes, which tends to suggest that this is an area where there are larger families than perhaps there are elsewhere, with children of between five and 15 years of age-with all the responsibility, cares and concerns that parents have in relation to their children's schooling. That is what makes the discussion of the issues arising from· the Sticks and stones report of great note. I was a policeman for nine years before I became a member of parliament, and I can say that the question of bullying at school and violence at school is a very difficult one indeed, particularly in relation to the investigation of particular offences and the treatment of complaints where people have been assaulted. How does one treat a complaint? How does one have the matter dealt with? Is it dealt with in school, or is it something that ought to be automatically dealt with by the police or other authority? The member for Lyons( Mr Adams), who spoke before me, made the most telling comment that it is a matter of leadership, in particular on the part of the principal, the teachers of the school and, in conjunction with them, the parents. I note that particular remark and agree with it wholeheartedly. Within my particular electorate, with well over 66 schools-and I am talking about major schools-I have found time and time again that where there is good leadership in the school the management of these particular problems tends to be much more effective. Particularly effective is a cooperative leadership among the staff, the principal, the parents and, to a certain extent, the students themselves. A grassroots, whole school approach is required in the context of this problem of violence in schools. I take a great interest in schools. I have a youth policy advisory committee, which meets monthly and comprises students from years 10, 11 and 12 at the schools, in my area. I have been running that now for five years since becoming the member for Moore, and I have always been very interested at the beginning of each year in putting together the issues which the students think are of most concern to them. We have a straw poll whereby we elicit the types of issues that they and their peers feel most strongly about. In all of the five years, the question of violence in school.has never really arisen, and that somewhat surprises me when I read the report and some of the evidence of the submissions that were received by the committee. That is not to say that it is not a problem; I am just saying that the people on the committee that I run-and I take the trouble to canvass their views-have not once indicated that violence is a particular problem. They have indicated, however, that juvenile crime is a problem, and I think that there is a convergence between the problems of violence and juvenile crime. We know from the evidence around us in the community that the two groups most heavily affected by violence in the community are the young and the aged. In the case of the young, more often than not the violence is perpetrated by one of their own. So it is, I suppose, a peer problem. I am not entirely sure whether it was identified in the report itself-I think there was some mention of penalties-that penalties in relation to violence, and particularly in relation to assaults, have lagged somewhat. It seems that assaults clearly deserve more stringent and substantial punishment. Because of a decline around the country in punishment being meted out, it seems that people have felt less constrained, less fearful, about the prospects of being detected and then punished as a consequence of their actions. It is very difficult for schoolteachers these days, and I have a great deal of sympathy for many of them in their job. It is a very difficult role to play in this day and age because of the limited sanctions available to them to be able to deal with a very difficult problem. Mostly MC 1522 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 March 1995 it is a problem that involves a very small minority and, as my own students in their committee identified, it is often a small recidivist group-to use a term that is perhaps a current one-who re-offend or commit the same offences over and over again. The students on my committee were very concerned about the unfortunate image young people have of being law-breakers, violent, or in some way less socially responsible. It is an unfortunate image because in 99 per cent of cases that is not the case. In newspapers and on television, we get to see only the extreme examples where some youngsters are identified as being problems to their local community with their antisocial behaviour. In the report, there is talk in the government's response about the problems associated with computer games and violence on television. There is clear evidence for this. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Quick) talked about causal effects. There is a very strong causal link between violence on television, in computer games and the young. There is a general ambience of violence in the community these days because of those particular media. There is clear-cut evidence that it affects adults and there is evidence that the young are affected too. My interest in computer games extended to warning the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training( Mr Free) in relation to his own inquiry and the legislation in relation to computer games, especially violent computer games. There are a number of loopholes within the legislation that would allow particular types of games-for instance, games with extremely unpleasant sound tracks-to slip through the legislation. I am very concerned about that. In particular, I am concerned that the Internet-this vast new information superhighway, as I think it is somewhat wrongly called-provides an opportunity for young people to have access to a free exchange of violent computer games or other material. In conclusion, I endorse the areas where the Commonwealth can have a role in education, compilation of statistics and other useful information on a national stage. I do not believe the Commonwealth has a particular role to play in the imposition of programs at the school and state level. I think it is to the Commonwealth's advantage to be an assisting and cooperating influence with the states to ensure that the problem of violence and bullying in schools is overcome. I look forward to the days when my children no longer come home and tell me about instances of bullying and that type of standover-type behaviour in our Australian schools. confined to gender, race, or any of the other areas of conflict that exist between people. As a general rule, society needs to express how intolerable violence is to it. That can be expressed in a number of ways, as it should be with other intolerable aspects that pervade our society: racism, sexism and so on. But one needs to have some inner strength to be able to stand up to the mob. In politics, we are always faced with this issue as, for example, with the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994, where the vast majority of the House stood up against minorities and the minority viewpoint, in a conflict situation. My message is that it is an attitude. I will put that in the context l)f the government's role as referred to by the honourable member for Moore( Mr Filing) in his summation. I think his suggestion that the Commonwealth does not have a role in specific programs has failed. I do not say this with any party political basis; I do it on a personal basis. I concede and bow to the honourable member for Moore's experience of police matters, since he worked for nine years in that job. I worked for 12 years in education as a librarian. I also went to both public and private schools for my schooling, in a heavily ethnic area. I saw the violence first-hand as a young male growing up in a school that was strictly split into four different groups. To",148,Representatives Main Committee
415,Mr Knott (Gilmore) (12.52 P.m.),"Violence is the raw exertion of power. It is notThursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1523 be able to go through and mix with all of those groups, to stand up and say something against the violence and violent interaction, is a very hard thing to do. For young Australians in our schools to have the guts to stand up and say, when a fight is beginning to emerge in the playground, 'Don't be stupid; pull your head in' there needs to be a backup from the staff and the rest of the pupils in that school. My attitude as a teacher when a fight erupted was to go in and collar the lot. Every person was treated in the same manner in terms of the punishments dished out by me. That included every observer. I would front a fracas, and everyone who was prepared to stand by, to allow it to take place and not object, I felt was partaking in it. In many instances, two frightened little boys or two frightened little girls would be pushed into a fight by a crowd egging them on. So we need to understand the nature of violence in schools. We also need to understand the plight of a 13-year-old Vietnamese boy who came to Warrawong High School where I worked. He was in the migrant unit, which was run by Bob King. This boy's family had been shot in front of him. To say that that childThis 13-year-old child had witnessed something that no Australian child, we hope, would witness. That child had been put in the situation of being in a country whose language and customs were foreign to him. That child was also part of a minority, which fortunately in the case of Warrawong High School was not unusual-and I am sorry that the honourable member for Throsby( Mr Hollis) is not in the House now, as that school is in his electorate. That Vietnamese child reacted violently to things. Should that child have been treated in the same way as every other child, or should we have tried to understand his unique situation? If the government has an immigration policy, I suggest that it should be backed up with services. We should look at being able to ameliorate the situation. Whether it is government interference or government influence with government programs involved in schools, I commend it. It should be done. The previoils speaker, the honourable member for Moore, as a former police officer, would understand that his job was only as good as the people who were around him. The community has to be behind him. That is what he referred to and I fully agree with his comments about parents and the broader community being involved. However, what I suggest-and that is what the government report seems to be hoping for-is an attitudinal change. When people incite racism for political purposes, or use ethnic groups in a political way to score points, or when people can or cannot speak about something because of fear of racism, I think the whole community, starting with politicians should not callously use those arguments and jump on those bandwagons. I was a teacher for 12 years. I went through public and private school education in a predominantly ethnic area. I am married to a Croatian who is now an Australian. I have heard my father-in-law called a wog. I understand these things. When we look at violence, we must look at the real causes. The report and the government's response have addressed the basic cause of violence. When the Australian Labor Party addressed the question of the number of women in parliament, it did it by setting targets and goals, achievable things, to make it happen, rather than letting rhetoric suffice. When we determined that we are going to take on Aboriginal affairs in this area and clean up 200 years of misgivings, we took it on and we led.

When those opposite talk about violence and talk about keeping violence out of schools, I would suggest that what they should do is address the real issue. If they talk about leadership, their own behaviour should be involved. In terms of schools and violence, my experience at Wyrallah High School was that we had a whole staff of people who did everything that they could to promote an optimistic framework, but, as I first said, violence is a raw exertion of power. Schools and police are no different in that they exert power rawly at times, sometimes for very good reasons. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 1.01 to 1.14 p.m. would like to pay a compliment to people I worked with. Those that I think found, problems and assisted in maintaining old attitudes to violence in schools were. those who would not listen, would not consult, would not talk and would not be open. As I said, violence is the raw exertion of power. Before the division I was about to speak of the police, any form of authority, of government itself. We were ringed around here with trucks. We had the potential to use violence as a raw exertion of power and bring in troops. I think there is not one of us here who would not suggest that, if we had brought in troops to move that blockade away, the outcome might have been violence. I think there are many of us who believe that the level of temperature amongst those troops out there might have been such that it would be that way. I am not trying to assert that in any way, but if we exerted raw power that would have been a response such as comes from human beings and animals. I do not think that most of us want to see that within our schools. The point I made before, the point that I have tried to reiterate, is that that needs to be part of our whole life and it needs to be an attitudinal thing. This government needs to take pro-active measures to put aside those levels of hatred in the community. One would have thought-this is of particular relevance to my family-when I was teaching at Warrawong High School, with every republic of the former Yugoslavia represented, during the conflict when war was raging, that there would have been violence in the school. One would have imagined that that would be the case. It was not the case, because the attitude of the teaching staff there was one of caring and of being non-tolerant of intolerance. This is the Year of Tolerance, yes. But even if tolerance suggests that I have to tolerate fascist viewpoints I will not. I will speak out against them. I will do all I can to make sure that the other person has the right to express those views but I will not do anything to assist. I will not make media platforms for such people to stand on. I reflect back to the attitudes and the behaviour of us here in this House, because if it starts with anyone, anyone who wants to open their mouth on this subject, it starts with that person. That person should reflect on how they vote and how they talk up or talk down violence. Mr Kennett, in Victoria, with a passionate plea to the Greek community, touched on something which I felt was extremely worrying in a country such as Australia. The debate about land bills and the divisions that we have just had in relation to the land fund bill, and the divisions that are projected because of that, do nothing for this nation. It is the community, the families that calI themselves Australians, who should change the attitude. We lead through what we do. AIl of us should examine our own lives.",151,Representatives Main Committee
418,Mr Knott,"I have had 12 years experience as a teacher. From that time as a teacher IThursday, 2 March 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1525 I have taught in schools with Asians who became Australians. I have taught in schools with Australians of all denominations and I have had the pleasure of the company and the pleasure of the insights that that can bring. We can look and count and go through the motions of describing and drawing a picture of this thing-violence in schools. But if we truly wish to do something about taking violence out of schools, we should do it by taking it out of our society. I will mention two last things. I came in as a schoolteacher when canes were allowed to be used. I refused to use them. I had great difficulties in that environment getting through to students. When I asked one class, 'What do I have to do to get you to work?' they called out in unison, 'Cane us, sir. Cane us.' They were a product of the environment in which they lived. A lot of those teachers had a hell of a hard time when caning was taken away. But you do not respond to violence with violence. Sir Julius Chan has had the courage of his convictions in standing up and saying that capital punishment is not on. That man, I suggest, is showing leadership. If we want to look at leadership to take violence away from women, to take violence out of our relationships and our schools, then we look at our own attitudes. It starts with each and everyone of us as individuals. I ask that, when we each responsibly put our metal to the earth, when we try to do our job, we do it with the conviction in our hearts that we will do that. Then we will change it.
