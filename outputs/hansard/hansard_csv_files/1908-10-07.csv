From The Prime Minister When We May Ex","pect the Government memorandum on the new protection. day or Wednesday. the Prime Minister been directed to the report of the Queensland Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the pearl shell and bcche-de-mer fishing industries, and particularly to the evidence given by Mr Farquhar, who has been engaged in the pearl shell fishing business for some following paperslaid upon the table the years, in reply to questions 3318 to 3328, in which Mr Farquhar states that there is no reason why white divers should not be employed in the pearl shelling industry? In view of Mr Farquhar's evidence, and the report of the Royal Commission in this connection, will the Prime Minister consider the advisableness of refusing to grant any further permits for the introduction of aliens to work in the pearl fishing -industry, either as crews or divers? the Queensland Commission, and, although quhar, am aware that the Commission PREPARATION OF DEFENCE SCHEME : found that white could be substituted for coloured diverse I did not find that white could be substituted for coloured crews. I am having a digest of the report made, with a view to the consideration of the question how far the matter comes within Federal and how far within State the Minister of Defence informed us that competence. was made between New Zealand and South Africa, under which South African, wines are imported into the Dominion on payment of a duty of 2s. a gallon, which is less than the duty imposed on Australian wines. I am informed that this differentiation is now beginning to seriously interfere with the importation of Australian wines into New Zealand, and I therefore ask the Prime Minister whether there is anything in our policy to which New Zealand objects, which accounts for the differentiation, or whether there is a possibility of successful negotiation for the admission cf our wines on the terms given to South African wines. Mi. DEAKIN -My attention has been drawn to the circumstances. No doubt tbe honourable and learned inember has not forgotten that the late Mr Seddon concluded an agreement with us for a treaty of reciprocity which would have obtained for our wine-growers reasonable advantages in the markets of New Zealand.. That treaty was rejected by the Dominion Parliament; consequently the Dominion can have no grievance against us. inquire further into the matter?

Any member of the Commonwealth Naval Forces, who possesses the qualifications laid down by -regulations, is eligible for appointment on probation to commissioned rank in the Commonwealth Naval Forces. There is no entrance examination as in the case of Military omcers, but, in view of the fact that the. requisite knowledge of the responsibilities attaching to the position can only be acquired by experience, the regulations provide that a candidatei .

29,Mr Reid (East Sydney) [2.41],"Ieight years, and afterwards with reference to the ultimate responsibilities of the future. As we all know, there is not a ship of war on the ocean to-day, not a weapon representing the most advanced naval or military experience and science, that may not become absolutely worthless in the space of a very few years. When we are dealing with the problem of defence during the next six, seven, or eight years, we must steadily keep that in view. No mistake could be greater than, that of spending money upon the basis of the usefulness of weapons or ships of any lengthened duration. member is not fixing that time, is he, because it agrees with the termination of the Anglo-Japanese treaty ? On the present occasion I am not haunted afflicted with that terrible difficulty which by fears of Japan, or any other nation on' was the cause of the schism between the the face of the earth. I am thinking of North and the South in the United States. this matter entirely from an Australian point of view, and my observation should less likely here! commend itself to the military knowledge of the honourable member for Corio. He must have come to that conclusion, which is from any internal dangers arising from obvious even to persons who have not had racial differences. One of the strongest his military training. Remembering that reasons for the policy of a White Australia factor, let us consider the next vital quesis that, by its means, we escape from the tion-wha t are the possible or probable most fearful of all social dangersa war dangers to which Australia is exposed? I of races. suppose there is no man in this community So affected by military glamour as to wish ber not overlooking the "" States rights "" to indulge in any unnecessary provision for party ? chimerical possibilities. This Commonwealth is not rich enough to throw money away upon shadowy, conjectures. It has to meet too many solid pressing claims, to deal with this matter in all seriousconnected with the development of this ness. I have, as the result of concontinent, and the advancement and prossiderable care in studying the question, perity of the people. The one thing arrived at a conclusion which leads me to which I think will not distinguish the memask the House most earnestly to give me bers of this Parliament is love of military their attention, while I deal with matters display, or a feeling in favour of warlike which, to my mind, are the most grave that adventure. I believe that we should adcan possibly, at the present moment, endress ourselves to the subject., not forgetgage the Federal Parliament. One of the ting our duty to the country, but seriously main reasons for the existence of this Parasking ourselves what are the dangers for liament to-day is that we have the"" rewhich we should make preparation. that candidly in public. serve on this occasion.

Now let me ""take in turn branch of the subject without treading on the three possible dangers I have menany tender ground. There are only three tioned, and first deal with the danger of possible dangers to which Australia can be exposed-(i ) invasion with a view to hostile settlement, (2) a sudden raid upon our coasts,, and (3) attacks upon our floating commerce. I suppose those fairly embrace all the possible lines of danger to which we can be exposed. Whatever the future may have in store for us, we never expect any additional dangers arising from internal disloyalty or disaffection. One thing inconceivable, fortunately, in a country possessed of the political institutions which we enjoy, is that we shall not. be able to develop to the utmost possible extent in a peaceful way our industrial and political destinies. able than it was in the United States before the Civil War? able member on this occasion to allow me sponsibility of providing for Australia a national defence; indeed we are now enthat we can ever be called upon to perform.",13,Defence Bill Second Reading

Is there any honourable member who regards this as a danger within a measurable period of time? speaking of the remote future, but of a period within reasonable contemplationsay, eight or ten years. than that to evolve an army, if we start today. those matters as I proceed. orable members think that invasion is one of the reasonable probabilities within the next eight or ten years, then I say that would justify any extreme measures we -could take; because the national danger of invasion creates a situation in which every man, and everything a man has, must be placed at the disposal of his country. I admit that I should regard more seriously, .and as a matter of grave concern, the possiously considered, namely, a possible bility of invasion, within a measurable distance, if this great Commonwealth stood .alone-if we had to depend on our own strength in the beginning days of our national manhood. But I cannot help remembering that we do not stand alonethat we are related, by every tie which can unite one community with another, to Great Britain. And"" Great Britain"" is a name which stands for much in power-powe r of in times of peace, and in power in diplomacy. I believe there never was a time at which Great Britain stood before the world in a position of more real power than she cloes to-day. Then, invasion means, as we all know, the equipping of a large expedition. Do we need to dwell on the serious problem of equipping a large expedition to move from some distant base into these southern waters, ancl land here troops capable of possessing and remaining in any part of Australia, which involves maintaining communications between that distant base and the point of conquest? A time may come when our flag is stricken down, when all sorts of dangers may surround us, but to my mind -and one feels proud in the convictionthat little bit of bunting which flies from the British vessel of war is the greatest protection upon the oceans of the world that any nation, however rich or powerful, has ever had. We may long for a time when our Australian flag will fly on the seas -whe n our fleets of battleships and cruisers will dominate the oceans of the southern hemisphere-bu t I think that that is one of those patriotic dreams in which we do not desire at present to indulge, except when I am not enjoying the lofty perorations of the Prime Minister. member does not find that in my perorations ! because it keeps us on the solid earth. lection of the right honourable member for East Sydney himself making a few remarks in favour of the principle of an Australian navy. mand of language occasionally tries to fly in a higher atmosphere. I now desire to deal with the next danger which has to be more seriraid. Our local authorities, and the I m perial authorities,, agree that that danger cannot extend beyond a small squadron of unarmoured cruisers, up to a possible number of four, with 1,000 men in the shape of an auxiliary force. Such is the force that represents the extent p f our danger from raid 1,000 men of a landing force, on the decks of one to four unarmoured cruisers, which defence, power of attack, power have to come across the wide ocean, and get past the British fleets. That is no light undertaking; if we have the slightest notion of the strength of the British Navy to-day, it represents no small adventure. And there can only be a raid, and not an occupation; because, I suppose, Australia is not afraid of meeting 1,000 men. 100,000 men, but not of 1,000 men. I do not think our fears are raised by the possibility of 1,000 men arriving on the coasts of Australia in three or four unarmoured cruisers. The third danger is a real one inseparable from any state of war-the danger to our floating commerce. The moment war is declared between Great Britain and any other country, a situation arises that requires immediate 'attention. There never was a time, I believe, when Great Britain was more competent to protect her floating commerce than she is now. By-and-by I shall 'ask the House to consider some facts which bring this home to us with marvellous force.",14,Defence Bill Second Reading

If it traversed 10,000 miles in safety, ancl were destroyed in the next mile it would be destroyed just as utterly as if it were destroyed in our own harbors. The protection of our commerce involves a gigantic task which all the submersibles, torpedo boats, and torpedo-boat destroyers in the world could not accomplish. It is a gigantic task extending over tens of thousand of miles of wide ocean, any point of which may be one of sudden attack and destruction. I should like to show the House how Great Britain has performed her duty in maintaining a strength equivalent to the honourable performance of this compact. In considering that compact we are not called upon to regard this or that cruiser in Australian waters. It is a guarantee behind which stands every man and every ship of the Mother Country. Do we not remember that, when a point was to be gained during our Tariff debates, the country which maintains these splendid fleets was described as containing twelve millions on the verge of pauperism. How has Great Britain, with millions of human being on the brink of want and starvation, discharged her. obligations even to this distant Commonwealth, remote to the furthest point from the centre of her Imperial strength?Referring to her expenditure and that talks more loudly than the most eloquent peroration, because it comes out of the pockets of the British peopleI find that her naval expenditure has been nearly doubled within the last few years. across the seas spend £40,000,000 a year on the upkeep of British fleets, and in the building of new ships, and about ,£30,000,000 a year in the maintenance of the British military forces. Fifteen times the amount of our subsidy is spent by Great Britain on naval repairs, the expenditure for one year being something like £3,000,000. sudden rise of other navies, and have been told that the power of the British arm is becoming paralyzed, that the strengh of the British Navy is failing in comparison with that of the navies of other countries.

Every ship that has been laid down in the countries named is included. they were laid down? dates, because I do not wish to weary the Committee with too much detail. The information is in Brassey's last Naval Annual. As my honourable and .learned friend is the real author of the conscription scheme, and will probably follow me, as he is entitled to do, he will then have the opportunity to criticise as he thinks fit my statements to the House. Built and building, Great Britain has sixty battleships to Germany's twenty-eight-o r more than twice as many; to twenty-four belonging to France, and to sixteen .belonging to Japan. Of first-class cruisers-honorabl e members know what magnificent ships such cruisers of modern type are-Great Britain has forty^eight, while Germany has only ten, France fifteen, Japan thirteen, and Italy seven. I shall not mention the fleets of the United States because it is inconceivable that Australia and the Mother Country will ever be engaged in war with the United States of America. That is a possibility which we refuse with horror to contemplate. friendly battles between the two countries to show which is the better. Great Britain has three more than those of Germany, France, Italy, and Japan put together, and, in addition, possesses a large fleet of second and third class Those poor people cruisers. Only the other day, 250 British war vessels were gathered for a series of manoeuvres in the North Sea. Captain Creswell, the very able naval officer in the Commonwealth service, has reported to the Prime Minister, as the result of his recent visit to England, that the British Navy of to-day is three times as strong as it was ten years ago. Admiral Fisher has We have heard of the cast on the scrap heap great hulking vessels that had ceased to represent the highest type of fighting efficiency. There we have a power strong enough to_ protect the commerce of the British Empire, which includes that of Australia. Can we improve upon that achievement?

I have spoken of the manner in which Great Britain has fulfilled her obligations to us. Prime Minister on behalf of the people of Australia, let me refer to the attitude of the Admiraltv in connection with this agreement for the defence of our floating commerce and the integrity of our coast. Australia has been represented as endeavouring to get out of this solemn agreement, ratified by Act of Parliament, in order to abstract our contribution of .£200,000 a year from the pockets of the British taxpayers, of whom 12.000,000 are said, I think absurdly, to be on the verge of starvation. That is the position in which Australia has been placed. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister has represented us in the Mother Country as a people wishing to escape its statutory obligations, and regarding the agreement with anything but feelings of satisfaction. The British people have been told that the agreement has never been popular in. Australia; has never been satisfactory to the Commonwealth Parliament; that it raises no feelings, of patriotic enthusiasm. If the Prime Minister took that view, he should have long ago tabled a motion or introduced a Bill to enable honourable members to express an opinion. have not tabled a motion. It is only just now that we have got the' Admiralty to come to the point. ""just now"" presently. I wish to contrast the attitude of the Admiralty with-what is said to be the attitude of Australia, though really the attitude of only one party in this House. In 1903, the Prime Minister andhis colleagues, and, generally speaking, nearly every member of the House, with the exception of the members of one party, voted for the agreement. ber spoke against it. terjection later. I am substantially correct in saying that the Labour Party voted solidly against the agreement. that occasion. illustration of the way in which the political power of Australia is being twisted by the Prime Minister. He got us to vote for the agreement; but he is now carrying out the wishes of those who voted against it, in endeavouring to destroy it. There are two ways of annulling such an agreement. One is to ask to be relieved from its. obligaIn contrast to the attitude of the tions, which would not be an offensive, though it would be a miserable, thing to do.

It is absolutely necessary, under our presentcircumstances, to have the protection of theBritish Fleet, or to see how we can get on without it. I wish to contrast the attitude of the Prime Minister, who so ill represented the opinions of the majority of members, with that of the British Government. I ask the House to bear with me while I read the words of the First Lord of the AdmiraltyWe want you to give us all the assistance you can, but we do not come to you as beggars.

I shall now show how our Government have kept their part. Are -our land forces, small as they are, efficient ? Have we equipped our men properly for -defence? It is not a large obligation, but have we honorably performed it? Do honourable members recollect how, a few months ago, the Prime Minister, after his Ministerial Committee had revealed the horrible mess that had been made in the Post and Telegraph Department, made a beautiful speech, in which he reviewed the situation, and caused many honourable members to feel a degree of rapture that we were honored in having a gentleman so able to grasp all the threads of the administration of a great public Department?

When I a Minister of Defence, I put into that Department the best man for the purpose who could be found in Parliament, a gentleman more eminently fitted for such a Department than was any other honourable member. But I wish now to quote a few items from the annual reports of Major General Finn and Major-General Hoad, to show that the state of chaos which exists in the Postal .Department also characterizes our military administration to-day. member's model Minister did not put it right. long, and we never had an opportunity of Major-General Hoad is still more emphatic submitting a set of Estimates of our own, on a number of points.

However, I will spare the present General Hoad bears testimony to the Minister. I shall quote only two or three I pointed out how the items from the annual reports for 1906 and 1907. Major-General Finn says in his last report-that for 1906-regardin g musketry, that a more up-to-date system would be welcomed by_ the Citizen Forces. Who is to supply that more up-to-date system? Evidently something has moved. Major General Finn goes on to speak of the position of the infantry and light horse. He says that he cannot consider them sufficiently skilful in the use of their chief weapon, the rifle. A possible reason may be found in the fact thatPractically no instruction is given in range finding in the light horse and infantry. One of the obvious lessons of recent wars has been that range finding is the vital point of all military efficiency on the field of battle. He addsThere are instruments available and at present lying idle; steps should be taken to have these issued There is a marvellous revelation of inefficiency. Parliament has voted the money, had been connected with the the instruments have been procured, the men are there giving their services to the If the country, but the range finders are in the Government stores, and the men who are expected to defend the country at the risk of their lives are not taught by means of those instruments the vital point of attack or defence in the field. had the opportunity of appointing have the power to issue them? had actually to report this fact, and to express a hope that the instruments would be issued. I wonder what would become of the British Navyi f it were administered on those lines? It is a much bigger contract than the one we have. Major General Finn points out that the horsing of the field batteries is such as to endanger the lives of the men who run the batteries and expose them to the ridicule of the public. I believe that condition still obtains. The large deficiency of ammunition waggons, reported last year, still exists The want of military maps would, in",19,Defence Bill Second Reading

Major-General Hoad points oiit that the strength is 2,000 less than Parliament bad provided for. With regard to the Warrnambool battery, allow me to mention a brilliant piece of administration. At Warrnambool there is a battery of 40-pounders -formidabl e weapons. In 1904 those guns were put in a position to deal havoc to any invading forces that might land in that delightful spot; but, during the ten years, they have been used only once. And why ? First, because, as Major-General Hoad points out, there were no horses; secondly, if there had been horses, .there was no harness ; and, thirdly, if there had been horses and harness, the trailers and limbers were so rotten as to make it impossible to move the guns. to shift 40-pounders. trailers and limbers are not the latest in -warlike imorovements? able member for Maranoa is not Inspectorhorses shifting one. the stores in the Government service are viously reported on as liable to floods, and wrong place for the purpose, contains more ammunition than ever.

Surely we might expect in our Permanent Artillery something like a sound state of things; but Major-General Hoad, speaking of the Royal Australian Artillery, says that the men are taken from their duties as gunners and converted into orderlies, cooks, assistant cooks, and grooms. One inspection and inquiry he made elicited the fact that 40 per cent, of the men had never been in the forts at all, that 40 per cent, had been in the forts for only three days, and that only 20 per cent, had been trained as garrison gunners. men? useful duties as grooms, cooks, and orderlies. a few officials require sacking ! orable member.

120,Mr Reid,"Unfortunately , the Primegram to the effect, "" The Admiralty absolutely dissociates itself from any desire to terminate the existing agreement, and considers your scheme needlessly expensive and inefficient."" So that, from first to last, in all his despatches, the Prime Minister has been trying to make outI shall not say that-bu t trying to induce the Admiralty to express dissatisfaction, and a desire to terminate the agreement, and each time the reply is, "" We will not join in cancelling this agreement, and you must not put us in the position of wishing to terminate it ; if you wish, in effect, to be relieved of the responsibility for your £200,000 a year, take your £200,000 a vear."" That is the attitude of the Admiralty, and it only sinks Australia into a deeper mire of humiliation. What is the use of professing our loyalty and readiness to shed our blood if we cannot shed £200,000 which we owe under an Act of Parliament? What ineffable folly and fustian it is to talk of patriotism while we contemplate retaining the beggarly pittance we owe for the magnificent protection we get on all the oceans of the world! opinion the Admiralty must have of Canada! Act of Parliament making a contract, and. then try to sneak out of that contract. Canada took a manly course, whether it was patriotic or not, and said, "" We won't ; we have a number of expenses here which we think are really Imperial."" I do not mind Australia saying that she will not do a thing-sh e may be right or wrong but she has a right to say so. WhatI do say is that when Australia passes an Act of Parliament to pay a trifle for magnificent services rendered, the contract ought to be kept. The position of honourable members who object to the agreement is slightly different from that of those who stood foiit, and even the former, I think, might honour the contract when it is law. That is a fair view to take of even their case, but I am speaking of those who asked Parliament to enter into this contract, and who, the moment Parliament agreed to do so, sought to vary it, and to vary it always in the way of taking money from others to provide for a duty that belongs to ourselves. Under the existing agreement we are responsible for our land and fixed defences. If we choose to enter upon a naval defence policy, it cannot be because the British Navy is not good enough for us, and, therefore, that policy, if we adopt it, should be carried out at our own expense. Do not let us take away from Great Britain the £200,000 per annum that we give for the real protection of our floating commerce and our coasts. I come now to a point that I wish to impress upon honourable members. One of the wrongs in connection with this policy of the Government is that it was kept back until after the general election of 1906. What was the attitude of the Prime Minister in September, 1906, just before the general election took place? In a speech on the Estimates, the honourable gentleman then saidWe have had a policy which though it has varied has gradually been taking a fixed shape. The present Estimates-10,06-7-represen t a continuation and the broadening of the policy which had previously .been followed, whilst the report of our Military Committee adopts that system as the basis of any recommendation that it makes. In that speech we had an endorsement of our policy as it ""had been built up for years. That was made on the brink of a general election, and not a word was then said by the Prime Minister as to a scheme of compulsory training or floating naval defence. Let us now consider the question of finance, concerning which my honourable friends of the Labour Party have become very keen. Can we forget the demonstration of patriotic prudence from below the gangway when the Treasurer sought to restore to the business-paper the Manufactures Encouragement Bill? The Minister declared that he could find the money necessary for the payment of the proposed bounty on iron; but the Labour Party were indignant with him. They asserted that a promise made by the Prime Minister had been broken, and tliey insisted upon knowing something of the financial position before the Bill was restored to the business-paper. Let me ask my honourable friends! whether they are concerned with the financial side of this new departure, unprecedented in any country inhabited by the British race. 1906 the Prime Minister pointed out that the local Military and Naval Committees suggested a scheme that would cost ,£1,650,000 a year, and that his own scheme would cost, during the first year, £1,700,000, or",22,Defence Bill Second Reading

After dealing with the scheme to provide for torpedo boats and -coastal destroyers-submarine s at that time were not suggested-a t a cost, including the ordinary expenditure, of £1,650,000 a year, the Prime Minister declaredSuch a scheme is beyond our means. The honourable member for Darwin ex-claimed, "" It would spell bankruptcy,"" and the Prime Minister saidI t would mean the diversion from productive uses of a very large sum of money. That was a sound utterance. same occasion, he saidSuch an inroad on our finances would meet -with the disapproval of the great majority of the people of the country. That statement was made on the brink of SL general election; the House, I think, was dissolved in the following month. The Prime Minister then affirmed the military system that had been built up, and which was part of the policy of the Government of which he was a member in 1902-3. The existing scheme was approved by that Government, and embodied practically in the Defence Act of 1903, which was passed in the same year as the Naval Agreement Act. On the brink of a general election the honourable gentleman declared that an expenditure of .£1,650,000 per annum in this direction was beyond the means of the people, that it would be unjustifiable, and that the people would disapprove of it. When a Prime Minister makes such -a statement, he has no right to propose a greater expenditure without -some reference to the people who at the time had his policy before them. Has our financial position so improved that what was impossible in 1906 is in 1908 .a practicable proposition? Let us consider our position. Since then, we have agreed to a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, involving an expenditure of j£i,8oo,ooo a year. ^£2,000,000. moderate estimate, and therefore I say that the expenditure on old-age pensions will be anything up to ,£1,800,000 per annum. We also know now that hundreds of thousands of pounds must be spent on the Post and Telegraph Department to secure common decent efficiency. Such an expenditure was not dreamt of when the Prime Minister spoke in 1906; but we have had from the Commonwealth Royal Coriimission revelations that show us that any amount, up to £2,000,000, must be expended, in order to bring that Department up to a reasonable state of efficiency. proposals for penny postage. I think, I need not consider in this connection. Since the Prime Minister's statement to which I have referred, we have also had a proposal, I think, for the On the purchase of the Northern Territory. What does that mean ? It means the purchase of about 500 miles of railway from South Australia-the purchase of one line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, and another from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. It means also an engagement to build a railway between those two points, a distance, I suppose, of 1,000 miles. the other day that the Government proposal would be brought before the House without delay. moment, what we shall have to pay in respect of the back debts of the Northern Territory; but I think .that the total is over ,£2,000,000. Then, again, we do not know what we. shall have to pay for the many miles of existing railway, or for the construction of the 1,100 miles of railway that I have mentioned. But in addition to those items, we have a proposal to construct the transcontinental railway, extending over another 1,000 miles to Western Australia. plated expenditure on the Federal Capital. to be a"" large expenditure.

The honourable member for West Sydney submitted a proposition that all British subjects who had been six months in the from eighteen to twenty-one years of age, should be subject to compulsory military training. Those are almost the very words used in this B ill . honourable member for West Sydney deserves every credit for this. ister of Defence, in criticising the honourable member's proposal, said that he supposed that these men would have to be paid 7 s. per day. proposal to compensate the employers of comes into force, that this burdenmen called upon to engage in military will f a l l. training. some claim in that respect. criticise the claim that these men should they can be brought out-to do what?

151,Mr Crouch,"The definition of "" time-the interpretation clause ? tween the two. That interpretation gives :an elasticity of which I was not aware. My main point is that there is no need for this gigantic effort. Our committee of naval officers agreed with the view of the Admiralty. The Government asked the Imperial Defence Committee to frame a scheme for Australia. That Committee is composed of eminent soldiers and sailors, who framed a scheme in which was pointed out -the possibility of attacks from raiders -carrying, perhaps, 1,000 men in two or -three ships. Our Naval Committee, in reporting on the scheme of the Imperial Defence Committee, agreed that there was a -possibility of the visit of raiding ships, and -that there should be some provision for -meeting it. curred in that in his policy speech of last year. how views have varied and authorities differ in reference to naval defence. The Prime Minister is at issue with his naval advisers on his naval policy. That is an extraordinary state of affairs. The naval advisers of the Government Captain Creswell and a commiltee of naval officers -ar e absolutely opposed to the obtaining of the submersibles which the Prime Minister -desires-probabl y on good advice from the Mother Country. Captain Creswell, however, was not long since sent to England to specially inquire into matters affecting naval architecture, and reported in August, 1906, as the result of experience in Government and private dockyards there, that submersibles are not suited for the defence of Ausfinances are limited, we can postpone detralia. Captain Creswell is the gentleman who, more than any other officer, has inspired the movement of naval defence. Our own Naval Committee also submitted a scheme of defence in which there is not provision for a single submersible, although expenditure over a period of five years is provided for. Our naval experts will not have submersibles; and Captain Creswell, after a visit to the Mother Country, says"" My opinion is confirmed by what I "" have seen. It would be a mistake to have submersibles. While they are exquisite pieces of mechanism, they involve a tremendous expense, and their value cannot be determined until they have been tested in actual warfare."" ago declared tliat vessels like the Protector were too small, and yet they are now proposing torpedo boats. years ago suggested the employment of ciuisers. £300,000 a year for ten years-£3,000,00 0 -o n four or five cruisers. I am now emphasizing, the fact that he and the Commonwealth Naval Committee are opposed to the employment of submersibles. No doubt the Prime Minister has received advice from eminent authorities ip the Old Country which has led him to propose them. The value of submersibles is yet to be demonstrated. What did the Imperial Defence Committee say on the subject? It said, ""You do not want these torpedo boats or coastal destroyers, and you do not want submersibles. We are responsible for the defence of Australia, and if there is any need to bring our ships into your waters, we will bring them there. If vessels are needed, we will provide them."" But under the influence of the exquisite affability, amiability, and ability of the Prime Minister, there has been a notable change. Seeing that the eminent sailors and soldiers comprising the Imperial Defence Committee say that we do not need these vessels, and that if' they ever should be needed they would provide them, are we going to rush into the naval expenditure proposed by the Prime Minister? I do not disparage the ambition to have an Australian Navy. In years to come it may be a grand thing. But while the Commonwealth is in its infancy, and its velopment in that direction. Those who doubt the efficiency of the naval protection of the Mother Country may hold different opinions. Buti f we have an efficient protection, why should we duplicate vessels merely for the sake of hoisting our own flag? I now come to a vital point. The Prime Minister says that there is a constitutional principle involved in the control of the Australian Navy. May I , incidentally, point out that we are falling into a singular looseness of language in thus using great terms to express little things?

162,Mr Reid,"The proposal was to spendboats will not make a navy. It is an abuse of the word to apply it in such a connection, ancl has led the public to think that it is to get an imposing fleet of battleships. The word is a ludicrous one to apply to the proposals of the Government. The constitutional principle which the Prime Minister says is involved is that we must have command of the ships which are here, because we have the responsibility. I believed there might be something in it at the time, but I have thought over the -matter, and I suggest for the honourable gentleman's consideration a different view of the matter. Let me put an illustration. Our law makes every one in Australia liable to serve anywhere within the Commonwealth. Suppose that the people of Mildura wished to form a special battalion, and asked to be allowed to control it, because they were providing for it. They might say, "" We wish to make it a condition that our men shall not march away from Mildura."" Would not the Government of Australia say, "" We cannot have a divided force. We must have an undivided force under the Executive, subject to the one set of rules, under the one control."" It is the same on the water. The British Fleet, being our main naval defence, must be uncler one Executive control. The statement of the Prime Minister, that we have the responsibility, proceeds from the fallacy that the responsibility for Australian ships, in time of war, would be Australian, not Imperial. A blundering captain on one of our torpedo destroyers might involve Great Britain in another Alabama claim. vernment that would be responsible for every shot fired by our. ships, and for the stoppage on the seas of every vessel under suspicion. The Imperial Government, and the people of the Mother Country, are responsible for every act of the Militarv and Naval Forces, whether Imperial or Colonial. They would be responsible for the act of a Colonial officer at: the Heads which offended the rightsof a foreign power. Germany would look, not to the Government of the Commonwealth, but to the Government of the Empire, for redress, should she have any complaint. The responsibility in time of war is absolutely with the Imperial Government 1 and the British people, not with Australia. It would be dangerous to ""leave a young group of loyal and good subjects in a position to compromise the vast responsibilities of the British Empire. ment was put by the Admiralty in its last despatch but one. but it seems to me a fair subject for consideration. I come now to the next proposal of the honourable and learned gentleman. When his project for a butter fleet was squelched, he went on another tack. He said that additional reflection had confirmed him in the wisdom of his conclusions, but he spoke no more about the butter fleet. Apparently, he had been confirmed in the view which inspired this precious idea, and yet he dropped it ! There is a bit of brother Jonathan in the Prime Minister. I give him every credit for his exploits in the domain of high finance. We were to get a mail service, and good transport for produce, out of the £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 to be paid .to the Imperial Government for defence. That was a splendid idea, but it did not come off. The next proposal was that, in time of war, vessels should be left here for our .protection. It might, however, be necessary to take them elsewhere. If there is one sea in which hostile vessels would not be stationed, and which it would take them some'time to visit, it is that which surrounds Australia. Who would dream of shadowing nothing? The mighty sea power of Great Britain has to shadow possible enemies wherever they may be. Should they start for the Antipodes, British war vessels would get there as soon. The Admiralty says"" Our policy is that of the race. Our vessels are rot a line ot It is the British Godefence, but must search for the enemy all over the world, and either destroy his ships, or be destroyed. We do not care where hostile vessels mav be, whether in the Mediterranean, or off Trafalgar, or elsewhere, we shall follow them to the ends of the earth. But we will not send our war vessels where there is no enemy."" According to the wisdom of those who study the movements of the warships of every nation of the world, we are defended everywhere. The Prime Minister then put forward a new idea. He suggested, "" We will give you 1,000 men, and take £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 from our contribution to pay for them."" Might not the Admiralty be allowed to manage its navy in its own way ? The Prime Minister wishes to become a non-official member of the Board. He says, "" I will find 1,000 men, and pay for them by deducting £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 from the contribution of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 . You must",26,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

164,Mr Reid,"I was not aware of it ,give us two ' P ' cruisers. But these 1,000 men are to be worked on ships which are not to leave our coasts."" Thus he proposed to keep two "" P "" cruisers to Australian waters in peace or war. It is not strange that the Admiralty reminded him that this was a new idea; that nothing was said in London about cruisers. The Prime Minister admitted that, and dropped the cruiser project. It was a splendid idea to anchor two "" P "" cruisers to Australian waters, getting the training of 1,000 men, and the cruisers, too. AlthoughI cannot praise the honourable and learned gentleman's patriotism, I admire his slimness in matters of finance. member will see that Lord Brassey is still advising it. is, that if Lord Brassey entered into a conuterances of the Imperial Defence Comtract to pay money, he would probably pay it. He is not under u contract to pay anybody money : we are. Does the Prime Minister really think £200,000 too much to pay for the protection of the Imperial Navy on all the oceans of the world ? over again, that it does not pay for it, or anything like it. would only act up tq that, having said it ; if he would only leave these people the £200,000, and go on Labour Party behind him? him and them. The Prime Minister thinks that he has gained a distinct advance, and that the Admiralty are coming towards his views; but I have read the' despatches very carefully, and I venture to say that the assertion of the unity of command is just as explicit and strong now on the part of the Admiralty as it ever was. It is, however, only fair to say that the Prime Minister has got some of the officials to admit that torpedo boats and submersibles might be a splendid thing; but in what contingency ? First of all, the enemy would probably never get here, and, in any case, those the statement of the Imperial Defence vessels are intended to work in connection with a battleship fleet. If there were a battleship engagement in the South seas, they might be useful; but if there is no such engagement, they are simply coast defences as before, and nothing more. differently at the 1907 Conference. Herecommended submarines as the most effective weapon for the Colonies to adopt. right. I practically said that a little while ago, without mentioning Lord Tweedmouth's name, when I stated that the people of England were beginning to talk of the value of such vessels in a certain contingency; but the contingency is one that is certainly in the distant future. They might be useful if battleships came here and found these ancillary vesselsreadv provided for them; but to talk of attacking with them the few unarmoured' cruisers which we may expect to see in these waters is an idle proposition. Much as the Prime Minister has done in the way of making the Admiralty officials come near his view, there is no doubt about the mittee. honourable member deal with the Bill now before the Chamber? and military defence are involved in this Bill. I absolutely repudiate the attempt to cut our defence into two. cedure; hot about the right of the honourable member to his opinion. am sure that I shall be called to order ; but the Bill covers both naval and military defence.

Localized vessels of the destroyer type could play no effective part in securing this object. There is the deliverance of those distinguished experts, both naval and military. Our Naval Committee say, "" We agree with Committee as to the most probable nature of an attack."" They therefore agree that the probable mode of attack would be such a raid as that to which I referred.

I do not think I have been out of order in what I have said, but if I have I am glad to have had the indulgence of the House. Having dealt with that question, I come back now to the Defence Bill as one branch only of the subject. From my point of view the sea is the vital point of our danger and defence. I believe that on the sea the magnificent efficiency of the British Fleets guarantees us as far as any human prevision can, and it is no service to the Empire to duplicate defence at points where duplication is unnecessary. There is no economy and no efficiency in that. NowI come to the question of a military force. The Government of which the Prime Minister was a member in 1902-3 adopted a scheme, of course under professional adviceI do not hold them responsible in any .sense except in the ordinary one-unde r which it was thought that a war establishment of about 40,000 men and a peace establishment of about 25,000 would be sufficient. That was approved by the Government and has been practically approved by all the authorities since. Would not a force of that sort be equal to any land service necessary in connection with our defence for years to come? I am not speaking for 100 years hence but for, say, the next ten years. In a case of national necessity I say at once that the right to compel men fo train, serve, and fight is absolute. men to train, because service without training is the worse sort of policy. trained before the emergency arises. honourable member, but all I want to say is that within the next ten years no such trainemergency required it, I would have out ing, beyond the training' of our Militia and Volunteer Forces, is necessary. to train an officer in the British Navy? of the land forces. I look to the training of the British Navy as good enough for us for many years ahead. National defence may be a national emergency in years to -come. I do not think it can possibly come within the reach of serious provision yet. s Ihe emergency to arise ? matter of opinion. To-morrow, for aught I know, Great Britain might be involved in war with Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. member's policy is to delay till too late. British fleet, with its preponderance over practically all the fleets of the world-for I have shown tliat in cruisers it beats Japan, Italy, Germany, and France together-the present power of Great Britain for our defence is large enough for the next ten years, supplemented by our present forces enlarged and improved. In any reasonable emergency the sea power of Great Britain will keep any of her enemies away from our coasts, and will protect our commerce. eleventh vear. presently. Our present forces developed, expanded, and properly equipped, are good enough for the next ten years. Believing that, I am not going to drag all the young men who may be eighteen next year in Australia out of their industries into camps. That would be a criminal, cruel wrong to them. I may be mistaken, but that is my opinion. I do not think that this question will come up as a reasonable probability for many years to come, but let us say that it may arise in ten years' time. The men of ten years hence are children of eight or nine to-day in the public schools. Train the right young men of eighteen. Do not train the men of eighteen ten 3'ears before they are wanted. Those boys in our schools are the ones who may have to be trained, and I would begin with their training now. Both the Imperial Defence Committee and our local Committees agree on that. Cadet training is the basis of every system of national defence. If a national not only the men of eighteen, but the men of nineteen also. Why of eighteen, and why not of nineteen? That is a question that I put to any advocate of this scheme. If we have to train the men now, let us train the whole. We can train the whole by beginning in our public schools. They are places where compulsion prevails. While the. boys are at school, they are compelled to learn, and they would probably rather learn drill than many other things. Let us begin the training of our school boys of nine or ten to-day, for they will be our men of ten years hence.

L This would be a splendid system if we proposed to pay Australians such a small remuneration; but I hope that we shall not do so. We shall not treat Australians on that basis, but pay them as Australians should be paid. Switzerland is a little place, hemmed in by great nations, and where would it be without its mountains? If it were a little bit of flat country, it would hs.ve been annexed long ago. It has been kept intact by its mountains and its men. But with us, removed as we are thousands of miles from any possible base of attack, the position is absolutely different.

Why should men of from nineteen to fifty years of age be shut out? The proposal to limit it to young men of eighteen, shows that it is not designed to meet a real emergency. Lt is a mere speculative movement. I say frankly that I have no objection to compulsory military training, if it is absolutely necessary. Years ment were maintained, the bovs would come ago, when I had not read up this question, I had a strong opinion that we ought to have some form of compulsory service. I considered then that it should be applied to young fellows, from school up to eighteen years of age, remembering that the battle of life for'the young commences at that period. But, as the result of the . study I have given for some time to this question, I have come to the conclusion that there is no emergency that requires even that to be done. My views may be expressed in a few words. My first point is, that for the next ten years, the guarantee these young men, as I think, unnecessarily, of the Mother Country for our naval protection, is sufficient, without any naval dehonour to pay them. The men who are velopment on our own part. My second is, that so far as our duties of land and coast defence-are concerned, the Imperial Committee's recommendation, endorsed by [33]2 our Committee of military officers, is sufficient. The local Committee go further in regard to the question of ships; but so far as the land defences are concerned, the two Committees recommend a development of our existing system. Both the local Committee of military officers and the Imperial Defence Committee, concur that our present military system, properly developed, and with proper equipment, is good enough. May I say, incidentally, that the Prime Minister has publicly stated that the report of the Imperial Defence Committee has saved the Commonwealth £330,000, and that I think we are under an obligation of gratitude to that Committee for its report. The two Committees agree that our present Forces, if developed, are sufficient, and I think, on that authority, that that development is the better course to follow. We should more properly equip the Forces, and make an appeal, say to the rifle clubs. There are in the rifle clubs of the Commonwealth, 30,000 or 40,000 members, thousands of whom, I believe, would be prepared to join the existing forces. I would exhaust an effort first of all to develop the volunteer system, and if that failed, and danger threatened, I should be prepared to consider any method of compulsion that the national emergency required I have a strong feeling with regard to the training of our school boys. In 1.883, when I was Minister of Public Instruction in New South Wales, I gave a start to the school cadet movement, believing even then that the playground was the place to give our boys the first rudiments of military instruction, and that if a proper system of encouragewithout compulsion into the Cadet Forces, and afterwards into the national Volunteer and Citizen Forces. Do not let us forget that Great Britain, the Dominion of Canada, South Africa, ancl every other British Dominion, have been able, from time immemorial, to solve their difficulties in even darker hours than these, without resort to this foreign method of compulsory training. And, after all, it is compulsory service that is proposed. Anything that takes a man by force from his occupation is compulsory; and if we will call on to make this sacrifice, we are bound in over eighteen are bound to pay the men who are eighteen years of age for the sacrifice they make.

I think that, under the circumstances, I am justified in calling the attention of the House to the remarks which he made on the Naval Agreement Bill in the second session of the first Parliament, as reported on page 1969 of vol. xiv. of Hansard. Whatever may be said as to his dives into the past, his dives into the future have not been of late sufficiently successful to advance his reputation as a political seer. Evidently he did not know what was coming when he uttered these wordsThere was a time not so very long ago when so jealous was the feeling in the minds of the Imperial authorities as to their colonial possesnally lacking in the right honourable memsions, that the last thing in the world a British ber's speech. He would have us believe, Minister would have dreamt of proposing would have been any sort of partnership between the ; Imperial Government and the British dependencies, whether for military or naval purposes. The view in Downing-street then was, that the last thing which it would be prudent to do would be to encourage the development of either a military or a naval spirit in the various outlying parts of the Empire. A much happier phase has now come over the relations between the British Government and the other governing bodies in the Empire upon this and many other important questions, and we now find the Imperial authorities profoundly eager to draw us all into partnership, whilst on the part of the self-governing States of the Empire there is a profound disinclination to adopt that course. Imperial Federation, which I always opposed. honourable gentleman criticised the Government of the day in most overwhelming fashion because it declined to do what this Government proposes. member's words stand in Hansard. congratulated us upon the progressive spirit which now marks the British Government, pointing out that in times gone by it had viewed with distrust efforts by -the Colonies to launch out on their own; that the Mother Country was now only too desirous to see her children fast arriving at years of discretion take upon themselves the responsibilities of manhood. If any one can deduce from those remarks the opinion that the right honourable member is consistent in what he now says in respect to the naval proposals of the Government, he is welcome to do so. In so far as he criticised the military scheme at all, he declared that if conscription was necessary, he did not object to it. "" By all means compel every one to train,"" said he, but he went on to say that it was not necessary. In any case, he declared we should not commence at the age of eighteen, but should include every one at all ages. For his part, he would start at school-and , no doubt, stay there. In my opinion, we should regard the measure, not from the right honourable member's point of view, which is narrow, parochial, and short sighted, but as one which will effect a complete revolution more nearly touching the lives of the people than almost any other legislative project that could be introduced into this Parliament. We should, therefore, bring to it a broad minded but careful criticism, sigthat everything is well with the British Empire; that there is no fear of war; that we may securely fold our arms, and rest in peace under the aegis of the mightiest fleet that the world has ever seen. But we should look the facts in the face, and see what reflection lightens or darkens the heavens therefrom. At the present time the British fleets are being drawn closer and ever closer to Great Britain. But three years ago, when the Naval Agreement Bill was being discussed, they were policing the most distant seas. There was then a respectable squadron in the China seas, and a fleet in the Pacific. To-day, except for the Mediterranean squadron, all the British warships are within a stone's throw of Great Britain, encircling with a triple Avail of steel, the island's which are the heart of the Empire. _ The right honourable gentleman believes that' everything is well, although circumstances tell a very different tale. Similar action on the part of a priHe vate person would be regarded as significant of his apprehension of danger.. When a man takes the precaution to be always within a stone's throw of his house, all men accept it as conclusive evidence that he believes himself to be in imminent danger of attack. A few years ago, Great Britain had but a handful of ships outside the Channel Squadron, in home waters, and her fleets were sailing unchallenged and unchallengeable in every ocean. It was felt then that the heart of the Empire was safe. But of late there has been a profound change in the naval policy of the Empire. Germany has gone on steadily building a navy,",35,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

That is a complete admission of the power of the nation which has successfully challenged our supremacy in the mercantile marine of the world, and is daily putting us to greater straits to hold our own. That power now challenges us boldly. It does not come as a suppliant, or as a beggar asking for the crumbs from a rich man's table; it is our rival for the sea borne commerce of the world and almost our equal. Germany is a great nation, ruled by a man of insatiable ambition, determined that it is the destiny of the Empire over which he rules to be a world power. It was stated the other evening that in a few years Great Britain will have to make great efforts if she is to maintain the naval two-power standard. of our contribution of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 ? in which the equilibrium of naval power has been lately disturbed, Great Britain will, in a few years, be unable to keep her present position. I shall, in a moment, show how that statement is borne out by those who may be regarded, as authorities. There can be no earthly doubt that the present allocation of the British Navy is a complete admission of the fact that it now takes the might of that great fleet merely to conserve the heart of the Empire itself. It is a fact which cannot be denied that the German Empire to-day is infinitely superior to us as a military power, as I suppose she has been for the last thirty odd years; and while, as a naval power, she is not now equal to us, she is every day making efforts to become so. A number of my friends-and by my friends I mean those who hold political opinions similar to mv own-hav e views on this matter not at all unlike those expressed by the right honourable member for East Sydney.

I desire to deal with it in a broad and national spirit and to summon to my aid distinguished men of man, who holds a high place in the Socialist movement in Great Britain. In The Clarion of Friday, 31st July, 1908, he writes a remarkable article which no man could read without feeling that, whether it be true or not, the man who wrote it believed it right down to the last comma. He says, amongst other thingsThere is not the slightest doubt that Germany, under the leadership of Prussia, is steadily making ready, at heavy cost, which the German Empire can at present ill afford, for a crucial naval engagement in the North Sea, followed by an invasion of this country. This is perfectly well known to all our leading politicians, and conclusive evidence of the truth of this statement is on record in the War Office and at the Admiralty. Everything is being got ready with that scrupulous care and minute attention to detail for which the Germans have been famous in military matters for nearly half a century. ber's friend, Mr Lloyd George, does not believe that. Lloyd George in a minute. Mr HyndmanI n view of the manner then deals with the optimists. He must have had in his mind the right honourable member for East Sydney, who is surely the most genial and complete optimist of them all. Those were persons who said : "" Oh, this would never be permitted. The Germans are our very good friends, and would never allow their Government to commit such an outrage on a peaceful power. The Social Democrats of Germany would man says, in replyIt is just as well to get this rubbish out of the way at once. Our Comrade Bebel, expressing the opinions of our Social-Democrat comrades, said plainly more than once in the Reichstag that the German Navy is being built in order to attack England, and opposed the voting of the money for the ship-building programme now being carried out on that ground, and because the carrying out of such a programme must inevitably lead to war. Yet German Social-Democrats cannot hinder the completion of the programme for the moment. . . . But the German people most assuredly have no control over their Government. Moreover, we here have very short memories. Most of us have already forgotten how Germany threatened France with war but yesterday unless the Republic dismissed M . Delcasse immediately on account of Morocco, a country in which M . von Bulow declared just before Germany had no interest whatever. _ M. Delcasse was ejected and peace was maintained. . . .

I come now to an opinion expressed by Mr compared with France, we have the enormousBlatchford, editor of The Clarion. am quoting these men on one side. The Labour Party of Great Britain put forward a manifesto of which, although phrased in other language, the remarks of the right honourable member for East Sydney are an echo. They are perfectly satisfied, as he is, that there is no danger of war. heads in the sand, or hens whose senses have been dulled by their own clucking. Of them Mr Blatchford says. the Labour Party resolution is based upon a misconception of the political situation. I do not believe that any person can accuse Great Britain of provocative action. If tliere is any menace it comes wholly from Germany. All the threats are German threats. No British politician wants war with Germany. Those are the words of a man who to the last degree is opposed to war, and who represents, if any man does, that feeling of Internationalism which aims at throwing down all the barriers that stand between the races of mankindGermany is or is not increasing her Navy and preparing for the emSarkation of an invading army. Which is it? If Keir Hardie or the Daily News or the Daily Chronicle can produce any theory to account for their strong condemnation of our warning as a scare ' let them 15 : speak, and we will listen. He goes on to quote the New Age, a Fabian newspaper, which saysThe international"" situation is f u l l of disquietening possibilities, due to German ambition is trampledunder foot to-day.

Against such a Power we should be impotent with our present armaments, because we should be incapable of offensive warfare. That article speaks of the .possibility ot the very disturbance in the Balkans that arose only the day before yesterdayThe choice, then, lies before us. Either we must create a compulsory and efficient territorial force that would set our regular army free for foreign service in case of need, or else we must be content to accept with all its humiliating consequences the ignoble policy of alliance and intrigue for whicli Sir Edward Grey stands. If we refuse the burden of organizing a citizen army we renounce thereby the honourable position which no other nation is able to fill. Fortunrhas marked out this country as the champion of liberty in Europe. With the exception of France Mr Hughes. we are undoubtedly, our incorrigible conservatism notwithstanding, the most freedom-loving and the freest of the great Powers, and, as I advantage of our insular position. If , then, we withhold our support from the popular partiesabroad for diplomatic reasons there is no one towhom they can look. Our weakness is their weakness, and our entanglements are tlieir doom. Those are the opinions of men who are certainly not jingoists, certainly not men desirous of creating a scare, but men They are like ostriches with their who have everything to lose amongst their supporters in Great Britain by preaching such doctrines. The Labour Party in Great Britain, as a whole, are bitterly opposed to war, and therefore men who speak in that way sregoing directly against their own interestsso far as those interests are identified with popularity amongst the men who support them. I come now to authorities of a quite different kind. The military-, correspondent of the Times, an authority which even the right honourable member for East Sydney may recognise, in a letter to the editor of The Call, in May, 1908, saidIn considering external dangers, it is the part of statesmanship to regard all Powers as potential enemies, no matter what their present attitude. History shows that international alliances and friendships only endure for so long as the interest of allies and friends coincide. There never was a statement made which more accurately defines our position. Berlin, which has just been broken. Australia has hitherto relied, and she reliesstill, upon the protection of the British Navy. But the pressure of foreign naval competition has compelled usto concentrate OUT armoured fleets at Home. We no longer maintain quasipermanently an armoured fleet in the Pacific, and it is uncertain whether we shall be able to do so again. Our main battle-fleets-exclusiv e of the Mediterranean Fleet, which, if it be removed, must be replaced-ar e 11,2.57 miles from Sydney by the Suez route, 12,500 miles by the Cape route, and 12,250 miles by Panama when the canal is opened. Allowing an average and"" continuous sea-speed of J2 knots for a battle fleet traversing such distances-a n average which would scarcely be maintained in practice-ou r battle-fleets, provided all preparations for coaling and supply were made beforehand, would take thirty-nine days to steam to Sydney from Plymouth by the quickest route, and forty-seven days by the two other routes. But Sydney is",37,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be
306,Mr Watson,Instanc e the treaty of,38,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be
307,Mr Hughes,"The treaty of Berlintwenty-two days' steaming at the same speed from San Francisco, fifteen days from Yokohama, and sixteen days from Shanghai. Suppose an attack from one of these ports upon Sydney; and allow that onr fleets and those of the enemy start simultaneously, Sydney woufd have the enemy at its doors and on its hands for 17, 24, and 23 days respectively before the British Navy came in. The time might be much longer. Jt could scarcely be less. Australian trade on the high seas and round the coasts would, equally with Australian interests ashore, be in peril for that time, provided, of course, that the enemy's force is superior to that of our Eastern Fleet at the time. The enforced -concentration of British battle-fleets in Home -waters has radically altered the situation of Australia in war, and has seriously altered it for the worse. When, therefore, Australians are asked, as I judge from a speech by Mr Reid that they are asked, to be confident that their greatest danger is a raiding attack by a few -unarmoured cruisers and a landing by 1,000 men, I think that the enemy is credited with a degree of forbearance, and a capacity for sauntering, on which you cannot count. Committee agree with the Imperial Defence Committee. these words has been engaged in actual war; and his opinion may, therefore, be accepted. He goes on to sayThere is only one means by which Australia -can remain secure, and that is by making herself so strong that the temptation to attack her may be removed. The best defence of nations is attack, ancl an insular State cannot attack without naval force. Consequently, it is the duty, as it appears to be the wish, of Australia to create this force, if the naval power of the Mother Country does not, or may not in the future, completely cover Australia as with a shield. The idea that in an Empire of 400 millions of people, occupying 11,000,000 square miles of territory, the cradle of sea poweT rests exclusively in certain islands containing 44,000,000 people and measuring 122,000 square miles, is not a proposition that cnn easily be demonstrated. years hence the predominance of the British flag in distant seas is not conceivable unless the self governing Colonies begin at once to lay the foundations of their future navies. Then Captain Mahan, of the United States Navv, in the August number of The Call saysI t is very different for those who are severed from their like by sea, and, therefore, must stand on their own bottom. All the naval power of the British Empire cannot suffice ultimately to save a remote community which neither breeds men in plenty nor freely imports them. The opinion of Admiral Dewey is that it i& not sufficient for the United States to have a navy in the Atlantic, but that there must also be an efficient navy in the Pacific-that the mere fact that America is supreme in the Atlantic offers no guarantee of its prestige in the Pacific. Viscount Esher, in the May number of the National Review, writesTwenty years ago, in the eighties, France appeared lo be the only rival to Great Britain at sea, and the centre of gravity of maritime power in Europe was still sought for in the Mediterranean. To-day it has shifted to the North Sea, while in the Pacific the Naval Power of England has yielded to the United States on the western littoral, and fo Japan in the Far East. Lieutenant A. C. Dewar, R.N., uses the following words in the United ServiceM agasineThe Australian may somewhat angrily ask, where our boasted control of the sea is to be found. The answer is that it does not exist, so far as the Pacific is_concerned, unless one of the great European or Pacific Powers (i.e., Japan and TJnited States of America), is allied with us. Admiral Fremantle writes. . . . the National Service League is justified in its demand for a strong home arm; to relieve the Navy from being tethered to out shores to insure us against a sudden blow at the heart. I should like to clear the ground further by saying that, while I acknowledge myself to be a whole-hearted advocate of what is somewhat loosely spoken of as "" the blue water school,"" I am also ""a member of the National Service League It was pointed out the other night by the Minister of Defence that there are some fifty Admirals in the National Service League. The right honourable member for East Sydney relies on the British Navy, and holds the opinion that there is no necessity to resort to compulsion, the present means of defence being ample to protect us. To that I reply that there is every reason to believe that, at least, one Power has the deliberate intention of invading, or striking a blow at, Great BriI should ratheT say that f if ty tain, in which event, of course, we must suffer in common with other parts of the Empire. It is clear that by the readjustment of the British Fleet there is in the whole of the Pacific only the Australian Squadron, which consists of one first class protected cruiser, two second-class, five third-class, and two small ships unclassified. Of these vessels there is only one which, if in England, would not be on the scrap-heapthat is the Powerful. When in England last year, I passed down a line of war vessels in company with Lord Brassey, who pointed out quite twenty of them only one remove from' the scrap-heap; and yet each one was better than any on the Australian station, except the Powerful. Lord Brassey further said at the time that he",38,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be
308,Mr Reid,Our own Naval Officers,39,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be
309,Mr Hughes,"The man who wrotehad no doubt the Admiralty would willingly lend the Australian Government any of the ships we had seen. There is nothing between us and invasion, or even a raid, except the Powerful, which, on the face of it, is quite unable to police, much less to defend, 8,000 miles of coast line. The right honourable member for East Sydney spoke of there being no danger of invasion, and in this connection I should like to quote from Colonel Gaedke, a German military authority, who, speaking on the position of France and Germany in the , case of war, saysIn this train of thought it is suggested that on the first outbreak with England the choice should be offered France of alliance."" position would be altered; the English fleet would no longer concentrate; Egypt and the Suez Canal, Cyprus, Gibraltar, would be threatened; the road to India in danger.' A landing in England not impossible. people consider it brutal, immoral, to take from a people its right of choice and deny it the freedom of neutrality. Brutal? Perhaps! But for a people there is only one law, only one morality-to make themselves, at any price, victorious; to secure their national position, at posal ; and I venture to say that, in any price, even if others should be ruined thereby. We find that, as a matter of fact, that policy was pursued a century ago by Great Britain in regard to Denmark, who, because she declined neutrality, was bombarded by the British Fleet, and reduced to terms. Before dealing with the Bill itself, I desire to refer to one or two other remarks by the right honourable member for East Sydney, who takes the view, apparently, that there is no danger of trouble here for the next ten years. That may, of course, be true; but it has been the uniform experience of all nations that precisely at the moment when the national horizon was absolutely clear of the slightest cloud or indication of disturbance, calamity has come. Prussia, just before her overwhelming defeat at Jena, was congratufating herself on her position, and chanting the glories of peace; France, immediately before the FrancoPrussian war, declared her complete readiness ro meet and deferft all comers, though she was in a few months reduced to confusion and despair. Such has been the fate of nations who have persuaded themselves that no danger existed; to them has applied the Scriptural quotation, "" Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."" In dealing with the Bill, we have to ask ourselves whether, in view of the very great danger there is in this country Mr Hughes. from invasion or raid, we should not do that which every nation which has ever lived to tell the tale, has been compelled to do. The right honourable member for East Sydney said there is danger only from a raid'of a few thousand men; but he has not supported that statement by any evidence or authority. Major-General Hutton, who may, at least, be regarded as an authority, declared that our present system was entirely unsatisfactory, and that he approved completely of compulsory training. Lord Roberts, who, of all men, must most nearly approach the ideal of the right honourable member for East Sydney-havin g spent half a century "" War or in active warfare-declare s that the posiI f she decided for us the entire tion of Great Britain to-day is one which approaches the desperate, and that nothing but the adoption of a most radical policy can save her. His proposal is comMany pulsory universal service. There is growing up in Great Britain a volume of public opinion, slowly surmounting that wall of conservatism which ever marks a Britisher in such matters, in favour of our proa. very few years, compulsory service for Home defence will be adopted there. If such a system is necessary in Great Britain, it is ten times more necessary in Australia. Great Britain is protected by the greatest fleet the world has ever seen, lying a few miles from her doors every moment of the day and night; and there is no time when any of these vessels is out of communication with the shore by wireless telegraphy or other means. Yet, under such circumstances, the Minister of War, Mr Haldane, declared it to be absolutely necessary, in order that the Fleet might be effective, and the regular army free to defend the Empire abroad, that there should be a territorial army for Home defence. It is true that Mr Haldane's scheme does not involve the principle of compulsion; but it is a clear recognition that in the Fleet itself, there is not that absolute immuniy from invasion claimed by the honourable member for East Sydney; and which, indeed, there can never be with merely human protection. In the very nature of things, there must always, be a weak spot through which the enemy can pierce; and hemmed in, as Great Britain is, by potential enemies, and by one, at least, that is something more than potential, every wise Englishman has long ago come to the conclusion that England must depend on something more than her Navy; and the beg leave to accept as correct the opinion territorial army is the result. Based upon of the military correspondent of the Times the voluntary system, it has admittedly that the right honourable member in this failed. Mr Haldane spoke hopefully matter does not know what he is speaking of a force of some 800,000 men, and about-that he is ignoring the most patent it was expected to be, at any rate, facts-that he is overlooking the with320,000; but, on ist June of this year, drawal of the British Fleets from the the total strength was only 144,620. outermost posts of the Empire to the That shows conclusively that the volunnarrow waters around Great Britain herteer system in England has utterly failed. self. When soldiers, sailors, and civilians inrecognition that Great Britain hertrusted with the management of affairs in self is in danger, that consequently Great Britain assert that it is necessary every portion of the Empire is, and* to supplement her present line of defence that we can best perform our duty by a strong territorial army, is it not neto the Empire by defending ourselves, cessary that we should do something in and thus enabling the British Fleet to rethe same direction?

312,Mr Hughes,"The Minister said thathonorable member for his failure to turn the Department inside out during the few months that he was in office, because I know that he had a great deal to think about at that time. I am concerned only with the facts, and I remind the House that the facts are that the system itself, while it may be susceptible of very great improvement, will not be capable of doing that which is asked of it. Another point is that the volunteer system is wrong in principle. We were asked this afternoon why this burden should be cast only on the men of 18, 19, and 20 years of age *andi it was urged that it should be z equally distributed over men of all ages. If that argument is applicable to universal training it applies with twenty times more force to the volunteer system. Why should only one man out of every forty be asked to bear upon his shoulders Hie responsibility and burden of defending his country? It is true that under the present syssuming the absence of the British Fleets. tem that burden is voluntarily undertaken and whilst that is much in the volunteer's favour, it is very much against those who decline to do their part in the defence of the Commonwealth. It appears to me and to all who support the principle embodied in 'the Bill, that since defence concerns every one, every one has a right to take part a man of twenty rather than one of in it. The right honourable member for Swan, when Minister of Defence, provided in the Defence Act for a levy, en masse, applicable to all males between 18 and 60 years of age, in time of national danger. The leader of the Opposition said that no doubt in the hour of danger every one ought to be called out, but what would they do when .they came out? If there is anything in the right honourable member's argument let us apply it to the educational system. said that that was the result of the two measures read together. certain time when men are summoned to defend their country, they may say, "" We are willing to fight, but we do not know how to fight."" We might just as well say that every one, while willing to be educated declined to go to school, as to say that every one was willing to defend his country but declined to submit himself to the necessary training. A man who says that he is willing to defend his country, whilst at the same time he refuses to submit to training, stands convicted of something more than mere inconsistency. ' There is no patent way of becoming a soldier; a soldier is not made in a day, and although the leader of the Opposition said there might not be a war for ten or twenty years hence, we should not forget that when it does come we shall require a force to cope with the emergency, and that that force cannot be created in an hour, a day, or a year. Eveni f we start next year with this scheme three years must elapse before we can reap the full benefit of the services of those within the ages of 18, 19, and 20. It will take some time to get the new system in working order, and an enemy is not going to wait until we are ready. The leader of the Opposition seems to imagine that our enemies-and we do not know who they may be-wil l notify us when they propose to attack us, and that if we are not ready they will put off their attack until we are prepared to defend ourselves. tures of the scheme before us to which on their face exception may be taken. The right honourable member for East Sydney mentioned one. He said that it would mean a great interference with industry* and that employers would prefer to employ eighteen who was liable to devote a certainnumber of days to military training. There has been a great deal of talk in this country about loyalty and patriotism, and I think that employers will be afforded an admirable opportunity under this Bill to exhibit their loyalty and patriotism by permitting their employees tb leave their establishments for the necessary period of training. That will be the crowning act of patriotism to which the employing class will, be able to' point with some degree of pride. That this is not Utopian or unusual will be demonstrated by a quotation from a speech made by Sir J. Wolfe Barry, a London merchant. one of the directors of the Eastern Telegraph Company? On the occasion in question he saidI happen to be connected with a very largecompany in the city, and we have agreed to pay half the wages of all those who undergo military training; many firms have done the samebanks, warehouses, manufacturing firms-all"" from a sense of public duty. But is it not grossly unfair that their competitors should be allowed to go free?

318,Mr Hughes,"I think that he is.where the number of days spent on recruit training is, respectively, sixty-five and forty-eight. In Norway, the percentage of employees absent on military service from the Roros copper mines, Trondhjem, was 3.1 in 1906, and 2.1 in 1907, the number of hands employed in those years being 665 and 685 respecticely. Out of these, in 1906, twenty-one men were away at recruit courses, ancl twenty-four at repetition courses, which have to be attended by men who have passed the recruit stage. 1907, fifteen recruits ancl sixty-five others were away. In the saw and planing mills belonging to a Mr Anders Sveaas, only two recruits were absent in 1906 and one in 1907. Mr Sveaas says, speaking as to the employment of substitutesI t is always necessary to have the f u l l numher of men to work at my mills, and, consequently, the vacancies have to be filled in one way_ or other. they are replaced in their former posts. Of eighty-two men employed by a goldsmith in Christiania in 1906, only one was absent training as a recruit, and another in attendance at a repetition course; while in 1907, of eightv-eight men employed, one was absent as a recruit, and four at repetition courses. absences was 6, and in 1907 10. The interference with business was, therefore, slight. A Committee appointed by the House of Commons to inquire into the working ot the Swiss system presented a report last year stating' that the interference with business in Switzerland was also comparatively slight, while the general effect was good. In an appendix to a work entitled The Territorial Army, a practical study of the Swiss militia, by Lieut -Colonel C. Delme-Radcliffe, the writer says on this pointA most careful calculation made by an employer of labour . . . shows that during the main period of training . . . . would be deprived of not more than 2.58 per cent, of the nation's available labour. . . . An entirely independent investigation by a volunteer officer . . . shows that the average number of youths of eighteen liable for the three or four months' recruit training in all these works, amounts to 3.48 per cent. The actual average percentage of employees absent from eight very large Swiss firms in 1906 was 2.32, and in 1907 2.17. British Committee's report of the Swiss system, which was signed by all but five labour members, who, because of their official positions, did not feel able to join in a common report, saysThe system is extremely popular in Switzerland, and has produced results of which the Swiss nation may well be proud. It forms an integral part of the national education, and conduces to the moral and physical welfare of the Swiss people; it brings together all classes of the community in friendly comradeship and co-operation in a common cause; and it appears to entail but slight interference with the industrial life of the people. Furthermore, I would point out that In whereas, before 1907, the period of training in Switzerland was forty-eight days per annum for the recruit course, it has since, by a new law, been extended to sixty-five days. TJnder the former system, the training for infantry amounted in all to 135 days-forty-fiv e days for recruit training, and five repetition courses of sixteen days each in the Auszug or Line, and two courses of five days each in the Land wehr, or ist Of course, when the men come back Reserve. Now there is a recruit course of sixty-five days and seven repetition courses of eleven days in the Line, and one of eleven clays in the Reserve, a total of 153 days. In Norway, where, in the first year, forty-eight days are given to training, the age at which training is finished is twenty-five years. There are three courses of twenty-four days, or in all, seventy-two In 1906, the percentage of days' training in the line, and one course of twenty-four days in the Landvarn. But before any person is exempt, he must serve in all 144 days. A man goes first into the line, then into the Landvarn, and lastly. into the Landstorm. It is important to note that the effect of this system has been, not to check, but to stimulate volunteering, there being more volunteers in Switzerland now than there were before. Quite a number volunteer to serve after the completion of their compulsory training, the volunteer gymnastic club is always well attended, and various corps on a volunteer basis are well recruited. In considering this measure, we ought to pay regard to the employers fact that it completely revolutionizes our military methods. Compulsion, in itself, can never be desirable; it is justified 'only where it is impossible to do without it ; and anv scheme adopted must be effective. I believe so strongly in compulsory training, that I yield to none in my advocacy of it , Buti n this measure there is in some particulars not sufficient recognition of the vital nature of the changes proposed. The The right honourable member for East Sydney said that it would impose, perhaps, a greater burden on the community than the Commonwealth finances could stand. But if military training is necessary to provide for our defence, we must find the money to pay for it, whatever it may cost. It is useless for a person to complain that it costs him a lot to live. If he desires to live, he must somehow find the means to live. pulsory training to be necessary, as those who believe with me do, we must ask ourselves what will it cost, and how are we best to give effect to it? My objections to the Bill are, first, that the period of training is insufficient; and, secondly, that there has not been an adequate financial statement of the ways and means by which a satisfactory defence system can be carried out. naked a proposition. skeleton for an admirable measure, and I should, under any circumstances, support it; because it goes along the road which I desire to travel. But we should not be asked to support a measure which will revolutionize the habits of the people, ancl involve the disturbance of long-settled methods, unless it provides a scheme likely to be successful. One need not have had military upbringing to know that a soldier cannot be trained in eighteen days. I do not deny that in 1901 or 1902 I myself proposed that there should be fourteen days' camp and fourteen days' detached drills, but I was then like one crying in the wilderness, and my action may be excusable. I said then that what had converted me was the effect of drill upon the militia. The militia in England go into camp annually for six weeks, and I think it may be said, subject, of course, to the criticism of those who understand these matters from personal experience much better than I do, that you cannot make a man efficient, in less than forty days. At any rate, I feel sure that if only eighteen days per year are to be given for three years, it would be better to give thirtv-six days in the first or recruit year, and nine days in each of the two following vears. I admit that if to the eighteen days' continuous training there are to be added a number of detached drills, in which a man may learn those rudiments which will enable him to take some active part in camp life, then perhaps eighteen days per year will do very well. But eighteen days is a .oeriod quite inadequate in which to impart to a raw man, who knows absolutely nothing about military matters, the simplest forms of drill, and to inculcate him with Mr ""Hughes. ideas of discipline and field training. I shall therefore move that the period be extended. If it be urged, as it may very properly be, that we ought not to take men away from their work for a longer period in later years, then it would be better to take the Assuming comlonger period in the first year when they, would not be earning so much. This would be better than to spread the training over a longer space of time with no one period of instruction long enough to make men effective, especially as in the later yea.rs they would be taken from their industrial occupations at a time when they were more efficient, earning more, and consequently bearing greater responsibilities. In some respects, it is too I desire to urge upon the Government the It provides the point that in this country men mature very mucli earlier than they do in Europe. This is recognised in the Bill. In Switzerland, a man does not go up for service until he is in his twentieth year. It would be better to give a recruit drill in his seventeenth year if a period of thirtv-six days could then be more conveniently arranged for. This would insure a sufficiency of training, and would certainly secure more efficient results than those likely to flow from the Bill as it now stands. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. have said, after some years of experience in Switzerland, that forty-five days' training was insufficient, and the period was lengthened to"" sixty-five days. I ask the Minister to consider the advisableness of adopting one of three alternatives. The first is to lengthen the period in the first year from eighteen days to thirty-six, and allow nine days in each of ""the two succeeding years. That would be very much better, so far as the young man himself was concerned, as it would interfere less with him industrially, while enabling him to get a better training in drill and discipline, particularly in discipline, while the nine days in the later years would enable him to do all the militia do now. Few of the present militia get eight days in camp. Under my proposal the National Guard would get nine, and with thirty-six days' preliminary training in the first year, they would turn out reasonably efficient. Another alternative is that there should be a number of detached evening or Saturday afternoon drills, sufficient to teach the rudiments of the business, in addition to the eighteen days' con-",42,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be
319,Mr Hughes,"It was found, as Itinuous camp training. the last alternative. It is proposed in this BilJ to continue the cadet system. right honourable member for East Sydney said a great deal about it , regarding it as very proper to teach boys drill while at school, and familiarize them with military evolutions. He said they would like that better than learning geography or history. I have been a teacher as well as a boy, and I quite agree with the right honourable member that anything would be preferable to learning either geography or history, and I have no doubt that the training would do the boys a lot of good. But I wish to state most emphatically that the cadet system in itself as a serious contribution towards the Defence Forces of the country is a house of cards. It may satisfy some people who are easily satisfied and who want to have some excuse for not doing what is obviously necessary. I do not speak of the usefulness of the system as a means of physical training for boys. So far it is an admirable idea. Nor do I say anything about it as a stepping-stone towards further achievements, but in itself it is almost, if not quite, worthless. After all if , as the B ill provides, it is not to be made compulsory from the ages of fourteen to eighteen, I do not hesitate to say .that public money spent at the rate of 30s. per cadet will be money thrown away, because physical training for boys could be obtained at a very much cheaper rate by means of physical exercise or drill without any accoutrements or arms. That would cost little, if anything, more than the ordi : nary public school education does now. Buti f the system is made compulsory between the ages of fourteen and eighteen f t can be made a most valuable means towards the end we desire to achieve. Suppose we stop training the boys at fourteen. How many things does the right honourable member for East Sydney remember today that he learnt at school? Any one who is familiar with schools knows that a boy in the fifth standard remembers little or nothing that he knew perfectly when in the fourth standard. He has forgotten it in a year. So a boy who learns drill when he is fourteen and does nothing more until he is eighteen has practically forgotten it by then. If , however, he is kept in training each year and enabled to improve his knowledge and familiarize (himself more intimately with the art, that training becomes very useful. SoI would suggest to the Minister, as another means by which efficiency And now for can be achieved and the training kept down, to eighteen days per year-a n object The most desirable in itself, because we do not wish to take people away from their industrial occupations more than is necessary that he should make the cadet system compulsory from the ages of, say, thirteen to eighteen. My experience of children is that all that they really learn before they reach twelve or thirteen-excep t reading, and, perhaps, a little figuring-could be taught to them in six or eight months. They learn all that they are going to learn in a year or two after that. If the cadet system is made compulsory from the age of thirteen, you will gain by the age of fourteen just as much as if you had started at twelve, and it will not cost so much money. If , after the age of fourteen, the boys are called senior cadets, and offered the inducement that every one who is efficient, according to a standard laid down by the Department, will be required to put in only eighteen days in his first or recruiting year after he reaches eighteen, while those who are not efficient will have to put in thirty-six days, every parent will impress upon his child the necessity of becoming efficient, in order to avoid handicapping himself in competition with his fellows-if handicapping or hardship was involved. The young man who had been a cadet from thirteen to eighteen years of age would then be more fit, and a better soldier, after the eighteen clays recruit drill than if he had not been a cadet, ancl were given thirtv-six days in his recruiting year. Mir. CROUCH -Most of the lads leave the State schools at thirteen. stacle, and perhaps the only one, to my suggestion, in that we would not be able to start with the lads at school. The honourable member will admit, however, that the value of teaching a boy between the ages of twelve and thirteen cadet drill is in it self almost infinitesimal. What we really require is cadet drill between the ages of fourteen ancl eighteen; ancl then we shall get something definite for our money. It would be a real inducement, involving no hardship, and in its essence voluntary; and, at the same time, there would be that gentle compulsion sufficient to induce lads to submit themselves to a course of training which the right honourable member for East Sydney, in common with every one else,, declares to be nothing more than a pleasant and healthful exercise. I quite agree with the Minister",44,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be
320,Mr Hughes,"That offers one obthat, in itself, the cadet system, as now carried on, while affording satisfaction at the youthful enthusiasm and patriotic spirit exhibited, is of very little use. It costs, I understand, close on £50,000 per annum, and the result, if there were war, would be practically nil-that is, if we are to leave off the training when the boys reach the age of fourteen. The only justification for the system which it is proposed to introduce, arid which is to effect such a revolution in our methods, is its complete efficiency; and to take a man of eighteen years of age, who has had absolutely no training beforehand, and put him into training for eighteen days, will not familiarize him with the drill required of a soldier, nor, what is most important of all, will it discipline him. He will have little or no opportunity to acquire skill in rifle shooting, which, in these days, is secondary only to that discipline which distinguishes a mob from an army. Honourable members will notice that the Bill is to come into operation on a day to be fixed by proclamation. That is very uncertain; and I submit that the Bill should commence to operate on a certain day. quire is something not contingent, butimmediate and necessary, so necessary that it is generally admitted here to be a non-party question. The right honourable member for East Sydney, speaking presumably for those of his followers who agree with him in this matter, says that the Bill can be justified only by its necessity; and if the House agrees to the measure, it is on that ground; and being necessary and imperative, therefore, it ought to come into force on a date set forth. In sub-clause 58A it is provided tliat all the male inhabitants of Australia shall be liable to be trained. But it is not liability to training that is in question, because that was always supported by the right honourable member for East Sydney. What is in question is that all the male inhabitants of Australia shall be trained. I conceive we are here for the purpose of inaugurating at a very early elate a system of training our youth according to the provisions of the Bill. M,r. JOSEPH COOK -It looks as-though the Government had baulked at the difficulties ! that. This provision, it appears to me, is the result of copying the section in the principal Act, which has reference to the liability of a man to be called out to defend his country in the hour of need ; and in such connection the phraseology is proper. In this Bill, however, the phraseology is not proper, because it is not liability to training that we axe discussing, but training with liability to be called out for service. So far as I can see, this provision is not at all consistent with the meaning and purpose of the Minister; and, therefore, I think it should be struck out. According to sub-clause 58B the prescribed training shall, in time of peace, not exceed in each year in the Defence Force, for the first three years, eighteen working days, '-'or their equivalent as prescribed."" In the first place, I conceive eighteen working days to be insufficient, and, therefore, the clause should provide for not less than eighteen days; and I shall move that the period be longer, or that one of the three alternatives I put forward be accepted. I also take exception to the words "" or their equivalent as prescribed."" besides, nothing in my mind can be equiWhat we revalent to eighteen days' training. There might be forty detached drills on forty Saturday afternoons, and, although in the aggregate those drills would be greater in number, they could not have the same effect as eighteen days' continual training under actual war conditions. Therefore, I say that these words ought to be deleted, and also paragraphs a and b of subclause 58B. In regard to the Naval and Military Forces, the artillery and the engineers, it is provided that the training shall not exceed annually in the first five years, twenty-eight working days. Whatever may be said of the infantry, it is idle to expect even moderate efficiency in the artillery or engineers in anything like that period. In Switzerland sixty-five days are allotted to the infantry, and in ""the case of the engineers it is extended to seventy days; and a similar step should be taken here. Sub-clause 58F provides that no employer shall prevent or attempt to prevent any employ^ from rendering the service required by the Bill, or in any way penalize or attempt to penalize any employ^ for rendering such service by reducing wages, dismissing him, or in any other manner. Since there will be no way of proving the charge, except by the admission of the employer, I take it that the onus of proof should be thrown on the employer, as. under section 35 of",45,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be
321,Mr Hughes,I am not going to say,46,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

323,Mr Hughes,"They are indefinite;the old Conciliation and Arbitration Act of New South VVales, and section 9 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. called upon to prove that he dismissed the employ^ for some other reason than that he was a unionist; and a similar course should be taken under this Bill. I may sav that under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act only one conviction has been secured in the local Court, and that was in the case of an extremely foolish employer who went into the box, and admitted the offence. While I think that this provision ought to be altered, we must rely on that public spirit, and sensitive national conscience which will be aroused by the introduction of such a system as this. greatest benefits that will flow from this Bill will be a vigorous growth of the national conscience-that people will begin to realize that they live in a country to which they owe much, and which, for the first time, they propose to pay, and, paying for that which they have hitherto taken freely as water, will value it all the more. In sub-clause 581 it is provided that the prescribed training shall be carried out with respect to persons residing within such portions of Australia as are prescribed; and to that I object most emphatically. If a Government were in power who were opposed to this system they might, by proclamation, exempt practically the whole of Australia that was populated; indeed, there is nothing to prevent them exempting the whole. We, as a Parliament, ought not to legislate in the dark. If we are to have compulsory service, do not let us go about it in fear and trembling; but let us say that the compulsory service which we propose shall operate over Australia for the one purpose, namely, the defence of all Australia. I can quite conceive that, perhaps, in sparsely populated districts, it would be inadvisable, the Public Service those who declined to or almost impossible, to carry out some of the provisions of the B ill ; but I submit that we can meet such circumstances by exempting individuals and not districts. Sub-clause 58H says that the burden of proving exemption shall rest on the person claiming exemption. By an extension of this clause we can do what is required in this connection, and it would be a more proper and straightforward course not to exempt districts. I now come to a very important part of the Bill, which deals with the penalties to be imposed on persons who fail to comply with the requirements of this part of the Bill. Sub-clause 58G Under these Acts the employer is provides that such persons shall be and remain ineligible for employment of any kind in the service of the Commonwealth, disqualified from being an elector, and from receiving an invalid's or old-age pension. It appears to me that, to a youth of eighteen years of age, the fact that in forty-seven or forty-eight years he will not be eligible for an old-age pension, is not likely to prove an effective deterrent. Nothing is so certain as death, and nothing is more certain than that disease follows vicious practices; but I have rarely heard of either proving sufficient to deter youth from folly, vice, or sin. of eighteen in the whole of Australia who would stop to think that he might be in poverty in his old age? was a youth ever born, who would be moved by the consideration of consequences at the age of sixty-five. To youth, age is an impossibility, and death only a remote contingency; and to say that in forty-seven years, a person may not get an old-age or an invalid pension, will not be any deterrent. Who expects to be an invalid? Every man goes forth into the world believing, that though death, disease and accident, attack other men, he will be immune. I do not think that a young man would be inclined to serve his country merely because of a fear that failure to do so would render it impossible for him to secure an invalid pension. On the contrary, he might think that if he did serve his country he would require such a pension sooner than would otherwise be the case. He would be disposed to chance the contingency for the certainty. I quite agree that it'would be very proper to debar from employment in take up this duty. only take a small section. barred from employment in the Commonwealth and State services. It is right that we should employ only those who are keenly alert in respect of, and ready to perform, those duties which are the mark of a: good citizen. I question very much whether those who declined this service-excep t in those rare cases where they might decline",46,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

As to the proposal that they should be deprived of the franchise, I agree with the leader of the Opposition, and others, who say that that would not deter some persons from declining to perform this, the first duty of citizenship; but, while it would not do so, it would certainly remove them beyond the pale. They would not be even pawns in the game of politics. At present many people regard the privilege of voting as hardly worthy of consideration. But when voting is a privilege belonging only to some, and not to all, it will be regarded as being of some little importance. It was thought at one time to be worth fighting for, to be worth suffering imprisonment for, and to be worth dying for. That is the position in Russia to-day. But here, where adult suffrage prevails, it is thought by some not to be worth anything. If we say to our young men, "" If you do not serve your country you shall not be allowed to have a voice in its government,"" some may not at first regard the matter very seriously; over eighteen years of age from compulsory the deprivation of the right to vote will be felt by those who refuse to serve when other men propose to alter the law, and they realize that it will be impossible for them either to hinder or help in that alteration. Those who refused to serve would be thus, to all intents and purposes, pariahs and political outcasts. Defence Act, the penalty for not complying with the provision as to compulsory service is six months' imprisonment. service in time of war. I do not think that this Bill goes far enough in another direction. sition asked this afternoon why persons between eighteen and twenty-one years of age, under circumstances such as will exist at the coming into operation of ( this measure, should alone be called upon to bear the whole sacrifice. I do not think that they should. There is very good reason why they should not. Before this scheme can be carried into effect, we shall require to expend more than the Minister of Defence imagines. If it is going to be starved because of insufficient financial backing, it is better not to have it. It must either be made effective or let alone. It, therefore, appears to me that we have first of all to consider what is done in other countries, and how far their experience may help us here. In Switzerland, every person who, for any reason, is exempt from service, pays a tax. Under this Bill all persons will be exempt save those who arrive at the age of eighteen after it becomes law. That is to say, all persons from a little over eighteen years of age to the end of the fighting age of fifty-five or sixty-or , in other words, the effective part of the nation-wil l be exempt from service. If we pass such a scheme as this, it will be because we realize the necessity for taking a new departure. I emphasize the point that this will be a revolution in British methods, and I most emphatically believe that we have good cause for making it. That cause in itself should be quite enough to demand that every one shall contribute in one way or another -The sacrifice should not be borne only by those who reach eighteen years of age after the passing of this B ill ; it ought to be borne, so far as it can be borne, equally by all sorts and conditions of men of all ages. I would, therefore, while exempting all those service, give them the option of becoming efficient or paying a tax. There are two reasons why this should be done. First of all, we require much money to carry out this scheme. It may be that the funds at the disposal of the Treasurer are capable of greater elasticity than now appears possible. I understand, howthe present ever, that that is unlikely, and, therefore, I say plainly that there ought to be imposed, for the purposes of defence, an income tax upon all persons who are not engaged in training or in complying with the requirements of this measure, so far as training is concerned. My suggestion would apply to all persons within the The leader of the Oppofighting ages, and it will be for us to determine what those shall be. In Switzerland the liability to pay the tax to which I have referred expires at forty. Under our Defence Act the liability to service expires at the age of sixty. There ought then to be imposed a graduated tax upon income for the purposes of defraying the cost of this scheme, and it should be imposed upon all persons without respect to position. It is idle to put forward a scheme of this sort accompanied by a declaration that it will not cost more than, say, £100,000 per annum, in addition to the cost of the present system. I think that it will, and I propose to give one good",47,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

329,Mr Hughes,"That is compulsoryreason for that belief. In saying that we shall impose a system which in its very nature isI shall not say repugnant to the genius of the British people, for we have to remember that before our lifetime it was a common practice to recruit for the British Navy by press gangs-bu t something we have not experienced. scheme proposed in this B ill is a proper legal system of compelling training for a definite and well-considered purpose. a legalized press gang. sort. Just as we educate a boy that he may be able when the time comes to give an intelligent vote, so we propose to educate a man physically and in the art of war, in order that he may be able to give a good account of himself in a time of emergency. Recruiting for the British Army is carried on at present with the most cruel compulsion ever known. It is the lash of starvation that drives into the British Army half its recruits. In support of this statement. I have only to remind honourable members of the accounts published as to the degenerating physique of the recruits for the British Army. those who have to do with the measurement of recruits. Year after year'the minimum chest and height measurements have been reduced until now a man of 5 f t . 4 in . in height with a chest measurement of 33 or 34 inches will be admitted into the infantry. percentage of those who present themselves pass even the reduced standard. senting themselves in Manchester in one year only some 33 per cent, passed the test. It cannot be said that the system is voluntary when a man has to choose between what is practically starvation or service. We are introducing a new system in a country where the youth has never been taught to reverence authority or compelled to do anything save to go to school; we are calling upon our young men to go into camp and undergo eighteen, twenty, thirty, or thirty-six days of training, as the case may be, without receiving any reward. That, in my opinion, is undesirable. I freely admit that when I first spoke on this subject. I saicl that these men should not be paid; ' but I have come to the conclusion that since I have, and could have, no other object in view than that the scheme should be successful, it would conduce marvellously to its success if some sort of remuneration were paid to those compelled temporarily to leave their business for the purpose of undergoing military training. In Switzerland a recruit is paid 7 Jd. per day, and in Norway, I understand, 2^d. per day. TheI should say that 7|d . per day in Switzerland would be equal to about double that amount here. Taking all circumstances into consideration, the very least we could It is a scheme for give recruits during their eighteenth yearancl we should give them more in sucI t is nothing of the ceeding years-woul d be 10s. per week, in addition to their board and lodging. The average young man of eighteen working on a farm in this country receives from 10s. to £ 1 per week; if working in a factory he gets anything from £ 1 to £ 1 ios. per week. These amounts are not regarded in any country as wages; they are a sort of set-off against the sacrifices required to be made. In Switzerland, in addition to this payment to the recruit, under the November law of 1907, an allowance is paid to all families embarrassed by the withdrawal of a male member for training purposes. Read the reports of That has remedied the one hardship previously created by the military system of that country. If we are to make this Bill operative, we can do so only by obtaining for its provisions the cheerful acquiescence of the people at large. In England and Wales we have seen an Education Act, which was passed by an overwhelming majority, opposed by large numbers of usually law-abiding persons. Passive resistance has become a fine art, many preO f the number preferring rather to suffer the penalties of the law than comply with its provisions. I am persuaded, thereforeand I hardly need say that in this statement. I speak only for myself, and do not commit the party to which I belong-that we must put our system on a firm footing financially, by providing at least sustenance for those families which would be seriously embarrassed, if not reduced to extremities, by the withdrawal of their bread-winners. to make a distinction between poor and rich, by giving a charitable allowance of that kind. should be equality of sacrifice.

By compelling a poor widow to send her child to school, the State may put her to endless inconvenience and much loss. But where inequalities can be remedied, provision should be made with that object. This cannot be done without the imposition of a special tax. As I am, above all things, desirous that our military system shall be effective, I am of opinion that a tax should be imposed upon all, remission, wholly or in part, being obtained only by the acquirement of efficiency. The volunteer who has become efficient, has made himself so by personal sacrifice, and the man who is not efficient should, as a set-off, be taxed. There is one other matter to which I wish to refer. The Minister proposes to maintain, for some time, at any rate, the present militia and volunteers. Their ultimate fate is not clear; but I gather that they are to be used as an instructional staff. have been laid upon the table. Just as our educational system would be useless without a properly equipped and sufficient staff of trained teachers, so our military system will be useless, no matter what numbers of recruits attend the camp, without a sufficient and competent staff of instructors. In the British Army, recruits are first instructed to march, and learn the preliminaries of drill, and then distributed throughout their respective regicourse, be regulations; but there is at prements, whose efficiency is not impaired by their inclusion', while the recruits rapidly improve by their association with trained men. I have read lhat in the American Civil War, it was a practice of the State of Wisconsin to make good casualties in its regiments with recruits, while other States formed entirely new regiments out of recruits, with the result that one Wisconsin regiment was said to be equal to five regiments of other States. The present Volunteer and Militia Forces should be the nuclei of the new regiments, the trained men that we have now being used to stiffen, the recruits. Good results will not be obtained by keeping trained and untrained men apart. It: has been found difficult in Switzerland, and Norway to obtain sufficient officers. Officers cannot be trained in eighteen or even forty-eight or sixty-five days. In Switzerland, an officer must have had' at least a' year's training, and may have had more. Men of particular aptitude should be encouraged on the completion of their period of ordinary training to follow a special course to gain the knowledge required of instructional officers. Until we have created new officers, we must rely upon the trained men in the existing forces., who will, for some time, be sufficient; but every effort must be taken to keep up the supply of commissioned and non-commissipned officers for the huge body of men which will be formed. I do not think that the greatness of the proposed change is quite realized by those who are responsible for the B ill ; and I have mentioned these matters because they are not plainlyprovided for in it. Too much is left to regulation, as was the case in connection with the famous measure dealing with local government introduced into the New South Wales Legislative Assembly by the right honourable member for East Sydney. Whenasked for the explanation of any of its clauses, he referred the House to the regulations ; and while the Bill was ananasmic leaflet, the regulations could hardly regulations governing the Department of Defence. bound, red-covered volume, which containsthem. The Bill, when it becomes law, should legislate plainly in regard to every matter of principle.

I should like to see a statement in the measure of what it is intended to do with the militia and volunteers. At any rate, we ought to have some scheme laid on the table, so that we may understand what is to become of them, and how they are to be utilized.

That method could, with advantage, be followed here. Any other scheme is likely to be followed by disaster. whole-hearted advocate of compulsory service. I advocated it when it had few friends, and I have lived to see quite a number of its then opponents befriend it now. I am certain that we are destined to see the conversion of those gentlemen who still oppose it, and that conversion, although belated, will be none the less welcome. This is a matter which is essentially non-party. The members of the National Defence League of Australia are recruited from all sorts and conditions of men, and from every political party. Those of us who believe in this measure realize thoroughly the importance of compulsory service, which we conceive to be not only absolutely imperative with regard to national defence, but also the finest possible thing for the nation as a whole in other respects. I know of no better methodI know of none half as goodof toning up physically and morally, and even industrially, the people of this nation. Its effect upon the Swiss people is that they emerge from their period of training physically and mentally braced up, and more efficient in every way. They realize, perhaps for the first time, and very much to their own advantage, the value of the privileges of citizenship through the performance of this its first duty. The Swiss, when his period of training comes round, goes to it with feelings of joyous elation, ancl is depressed to the last degree if for any reason he is told that he is unfit to present himself. Men speak of war and peace as though war were' the greatest curse that afflicted humanity, and peace a thing that could be had for the asking. Men who cry peace when there is no peace are enemies of peace. There is but one way by which any man or nation can get peace, and. that is by being ready for war. securing, peace now by an expenditure which, as the right honourable member for East Sydney said, has trebled itself in the last few years. The British nation to-day is spending on naval defence three times what it spent twenty years ago. strength, and doubled its expenditure. more than doubled its expense. The naval and military expenditure of Great Britain ancl other countries has been piled up at an enormous rate, and with what object? No one can say that Great Britain wants I am a war. She wants peace, but peace can be obtained only by eternal vigilance, by ceaseless preparation for war, and by the expenditure of her last available farthing. How much longer can the noble British taxpayer, for whom my right honourable friend was so sorry, and whom we assist to the extent of £200,000 a year a contribution that cannot amount to more than £d. or i d . per year per head of our population-g o on bearing this ever increasing burden? Peace can be obtained by the Britisher, by the Australian, only by being ready for war. There are men who talk about the brotherhood of man, and urge that no one will attack an inoffensive nation. If we are inoffensive, it is because we have no means of offence. Is Great Britain inoffensive? Is there a nation upon which she has not declared war upon occasion? What is our right here, we who prate about peace? By what virtue are we here to-day, except by brute force? We came here and displaced those who were placed in possession, if any were, by the hand of Providence. Where are they now? In Tasmania, there is not one to be found, while here there may be perhaps one in every 100 miles. And we talk about peace ! We have arrogantly declared to the world that this is to be a white man's country. There are 4,200,000 of us, of whom 21,000 bear arms, and perhaps 5,000 or 6,000 could bear them efficiently. We debar the coloured nations from entry To the 400,000,000 of Chinese, to the 44,000,000 of Japanese, flushed with their triumph over a nation that humbled every other country in Europe in its turn, we have said, ""You must not come in . "" And the weapon with which we propose to keep them out is a parchment Act of Parliament with a red seal on it ! Beyond that, and Providence, and a noble opinion of ourselves, we have no means of Great Britain has secured, and is making good our boast. Tf the White Australia policy is to be a permanence in this country, there must be behind it a sufficient force of white Australians ready, if necessary, to make good their claim. There is no other way of doing it. Men speak of war as though it were the greatest curse on earth; but what is war, after all, but.",50,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

342,Mr Hughes,"It has certainlythe Nemesis which overtakes. nations, just as disease, and casualties, and death, overtake the individual. why? Is there anything that we do contrary to nature's laws for which nature does not avenge herself? When a man is diseased, it is in consequence of a violation of nature's laws. When a nation is sick it is not without acause; when she becomes an easy prey to a conqueror she meets a doom she has invited and deserved. War is not a vindication of brute force, but is the operation of natural laws. The commission .of a national crime brings about a national calamity. Look at the great nations of the world that have disappeared. 'Greece went down, and why? In the Nemesis of Nations, by Mr W. R. Paterson, there are some words most appropriate in this connexionNever, indeed, have internal and external causes combined so suddenly for the destruction of a State. The Athenians had become the parasites of their slaves, but it was still more ominous that they had become the parasites of their allies. Aristotle tells us that more than 20,000 citizens-in other words, almost the entire free adult male community-were supported by the tribute of the allies. In this way, he says, they earned their living. Thus the causes which were wrecking Athens from within were really the same causes which were threatening to wreck her from without; and she was like a human being who, although suffering from inward disease, is placed in the least favorable environment. A mass of discontent had developed within her own walls and was now developing within the communities which recognised her sovereignty duals, appear to suffer from a kind of haemorrhage, and Greece opened her own veins. The moment of her exhaustion was the opportunity of the northern invader. Every Greek State had reached, for the same reason, the same stage of decay. Thus when the leadership had passed from Athens it was held only for a"" short time by Sparta and by Thebes. . It was when Philip of Macedon saw that Greeks had ceased to fight for Greeks that he began that series of aggressions which ended in the subjugation of the entire Hellenic race. What was true of Greece was true also of RomeWe may notice the growing hazards of a State in the creation of an opulent society in which military ardour gradually declines. Whereas in early Rome the burghers formed the battalions, during the Empire the army was reorganised on a mercenary basis, and was separated from the people. When it became no longer the practice for Roman citizens to defend Roman liberties, Rome, although she Teached her topmost pinnacle of greatness long after that time, the canker of decay deeply planted in her bosom. She had bought world-wide power, but had sold her honour; she ruled Mr Hughes. the nations of the earth, but was herself a slave to the worse vices. In the end A man is ill, and she tottered to her inevitable doom and fell supine under the virile blows of the virtuous barbarians. And we-wha t are we doing? If ever there were men who utterly Tailed to realize their responsibilities, it is the Britishers of to-day, the Australians of to-day. What are we doing to defend our liberties and privileges? Absolutely nothing. We do not even realize that we have privileges. We prate about peace, and about the glorious might of the British Navy, we invent any excuse, we put forward any plausible lie, rather than do our plain duty. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [8.53]. 1 do not propose, after the great speech made by the leader of the Opposition today, and the extremely interesting address to which we have listened from the honourable member for West Sydney, to occupy the attention of the House long. I believe that the House will be more ready to hear those honourable members who have a greater technical knowledge of the subject than I can pretend to have; but I thought it desirable to speak at this early stage, because there is one broad aspect of the question that ought to be brought before, and pressed upon the House, at the very initiation of the debate. That is the aspect which I have endeavoured to embody in the amendment that stands in my name. States, like indiviThat amendment declares a view which not only cannot help being accepted by members on all sides of the House, but has in itself been eloquently stated by the Minister in introducing the Bill-that when we are dealing with the defence of Australia, we are dealing with a great problem, of which only one thing may be said to be absolutely certain, and that is that the defence of Australia rests primarily upon the control of the sea. I listened with the greatest pleasure to the peroration of the honourable member for West Sydney. I agree with the general sentiment which was so eloquently expressed in it. The whole course of history teaches us that nations which have allowed their manly sense of independence, and the duty of' defending themselves, to sink into abeyance, have lost, by failing to realize the duties that lay upon them as nations, the privileges which they had acquired. While we admit the principle, there are certain differences of a most important character in its application to Switzerland, to ancient Athens and Rome, and to Australia. The circumstances are so entirely different, that we here cannot necessarily accept the principle as applied to those other countries. The Bill has been put by the Minister as a measure to test the opinion of the House on the question of compulsory military training; I think I fairly state what the honourable gentleman asks the House to determine. I feel that, as a layman, I am as well entitled as any other honourable member to speak on the general principle; that is, the question does not necessarily involve any considerable knowledge of technical or military details, but is one on which every man is'entitled to fully and freely express his views. I cordially accept the invitation which the Minister put forward that members should treat this question as one free from all party considerations ; and it is in that light that I have submitted the amendment which stands in my name. I say at once that if we were able to view the question of compulsory universal military training apart from all other considerations-if we had unlimited financial capacity, and there were not other claims on our limited financial means-compulsor y military training would present very great attractions to my mind. As a means of strengthening the character of our young men, and of possibly evoking in them latent feelings in regard to the defence of their country, I think it would have a very good educational effect. But this is not the solution of the problem of the defence of Australia. If we could, as the Prime Minister said in his speech in December last, adopt such a system for our young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one for an expenditure of £200,000 in addition to our present expenditure, I , for one, should say that, notwithstanding the extreme difficulty of our financial posiown part, I never heard a word of explanation, the-experiment might be worth trying. The Minister of Defence, in his statement the other day, for some reason reduced the additional expenditure by £100,000. have not been able to discover the grounds on which the honourable member did so. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Then the same figures which resulted, according to the Prime Minister, in an increase of expenditure by £200,000 result according to the Minister of Defence, in an increase of only £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . the honourable member will find that he is adding capital expenditure. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Her e is a most remarkable fact, to which I invite the attention of both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence. In his statement of the financial position made by the Prime Minister in December, 1907 is no doubt. Mr W. H . IRVINE -There were two errors-tw o huge errors-the result of which has been to place the whole of this question of the adoption of this system before the House and the country on a thoroughly false basis. Let me point out how that is so. Here is what the Prime Minister said, giving the figures which are reported in the published pamphlet of his speech, page 20 Mr W. H . IRVINE -And revised. Here is the net result. That being so, this scheme, which covers both the naval and the military proposals of the Government, including the building of fifteen vessels, the cost of their maintenance, an immense increase in the land forces, an increase in the field artillery, and the expenditure upon fortifications, means, in the"" third year, according to the best estimates that we can frame, an increase of only ^200,000 on our present annual expenditure. Now, when I tell honourable members that, owing to two purely arithmetical blundersvery scon. Mr VV. H . IRVINE -They were not pointed out at the time. diately after the pamphlet -was printed. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The figures have been allowed to go, and have been adopted by the Minister of Defence, and, for my tion. The result of the two arithmetical blunders-for which I am sure the Prime Minister personally is not responsible, but I somebody who placed thefiguresbefore him -is that the £200,000 ought to be £636,000. I ask the attention of honourable members to a proof of that statement. Honourable members will remember that the figures were placed before them in four columns, giving the proposed expenditure for the first ) ear, the second year, and the r third year, and the present expenditure respectively. The comparison on which the Prime Minister rested, and on which he",51,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

IRVINE -Of course, I do not for one moment suggest that the Prime Minister is responsible for the figures, but, as I have said, I have never heard any explanation, and they have been copied into Mr Knibbs' book, and remain there to this day as the official figures of the Government. circulated. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is so. With whom the fault really lies is not the point; J am endeavouring to show the facts, and, so far, as I have shown there is an expenditure of £200,000 in addition to the £200,000 mentioned by the Prime Minister. there is another mistake, almost as simple and almost as absurd, in regard to the present expenditure. first column, the total present military expenditure is given at £^1,033,000, on the Naval Agreement £200,000, and on the local Naval Forces £60,000, or a total appropriation of £1,293,000 for 1907-8. Then we have shown, as presumed unexpended balance, £125,000, and, as the Prime Minister immediately afterwards pointed out, that ought to have been deducted from the estimate. Minister saidI t will be seen that for this year the actual appropriation proposed is £1,300,000, although ,£125,000 has been deducted from the f u l l cost, from this responsible officer, whoever he because it is not expected to be expended within the year. In that column the £125,000 has not been deducted, but added. If we correct these two errors we have the somewhat remarkable result that, instead of tiie first column, nnmelv, the present expenditure being £1,419,000, it should be £1,168,000, or £250,000 less. I am taking the figures, and simply correcting a couple of mistakes that the merest schoolboy would be ashamed to make; and, correcting them, I find that question before us to do with the Treathe present expenditure is £1,168,000 surer ? under the heads I have mentioned, and that the proposed expenditure, at the end of the third year, will be £1,805,000, or a difference of £636,000 on the Minister's own figures. cause the original column contained an error. When it was sent back altered, the totals of the former column, by some mischance, remained added; but the items are all there, and they correct the totals. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Hut the inference that the Prime Minister asked the House and the country to draw from thefiguresis wrong by £436,000 a year. The error is not merely stated in the speech, but is repeated with exaggeration six months later by the Minister of Defence in introducing this Bill. those figures last week. If there is any mistake in the figures. I am responsible. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That will hardly "" hold water,"" because, a few moments ago, when I called the attention of the Minister of Defence to the fact that he had reduced the £200,000 to £ j 00,000, he immediately replied by inBut terjection, that his calculation was based on the "" same figures."" In the accurate. We are dealing with the land forces figures, which are just the same as they have been from the beginning. Mr W. H . IRVINE -We have here an important statement from the most responsible auarter in the Commonwealth to this Parliament and to the whole of Australia, in which figures, presumably prepared by some responsible official, are actually allowed to come before us, showing The Prime the additional cost to be £200,000 when, in fact, assuming the figures I have referred to to be right, it should be £636,000. That such a statement should have, filtered was, through the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, and never have been detected, even ' by the Treasurer, whose duty it was to look through these figures, and that we should have the blunder repeated seven or eight 'months later, shows that of which we have already had sufficient evidence in many regards, namely, a lack of sufficient care in statements regarding thefinancesof the country.",53,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

I do not desire to harp-as , apparently, I , with other honourable members, are always forced to do-upo n the irresponsible attitude taken up by the Government in regard to the finances. I have dealt with that matter almost ad nauseam; but I venture to say again that before we are asked to pledge ourselves to the adoption of a scheme which will cost an indefinite amount, we ought to have some general statement as to the future financial prospects of the Commonwealth. Now, what are the facts? We are asked to adopt a system of compulsory service. we adopted compulsory service in the Defence Act. Mr W. H . IRVINE I prefer lo call it compulsory service, because any satisfactory solution of the defence question must involve service. I think the honourable member, is wrong in adopting a kind of argument which is open to a logical fallacy. We have accepted compulsory service in one sense-w e have adopted the principle that the Government have a right, to call on every citizen in time of danger to take his part, and I do not think that a single honourable member on either side would venture to dispute the principle. It is the law of nature and of every community. But the principle that, in case of necessity, every citizen may be called upon to serve is totally different from the adoption of a universal system of compulsory service by all youths between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. I IhinkI am entitled to ask the Prime Minister, or the Minister of Defence, to admit, before we proceed further, that it is fair to discuss this Bill on the basis of the figures I have given, -showing that the additional expenditure, which the scheme will involve, will be not Nothing could be more explicit, and I £200,000, but over £600,000. point on which the«honourable member was of this scheme will be £200,000 or speaking.

I am only that this measure is applicable. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is not what is put. I do not want to "" rub in"" the series of slips that has been made, but we are entitled to get at the true facts as a basis for our discussion. The Prime Minister, after giving these figures, saidThis table includes expenditure on cadets, rifle clubs, & c , and capital spent upon fixed defences, factories, and works.

During the present year the total expenditure will be ^1,300,000. The first year under the new system of National Training w i ll include a capital expenditure on the rifle factory and the ammunition factory, but the total expenditure for that year is not expected to much exceed ;£i,700,000. That is an increase of about ^300,000 on what is provided for this year, or ,£400,000 on what is proposed to be spent during this year. Next year the total will drop a little below ,£1,700,000, and in the third vear it is expected to f a l l to ;£i,600,000, any further capital expenditure not being included. out of ordinary revenue? against the present year's proposed expenditure of ,£1,400,000, it means in the third year aa increase of ^'200,000, or, allowing for the proportion of the amount on this year's Estimates that we do not expect to expend, it will mean an increase of ^325,000. That being so, this scheme which covers both the naval and the military proposals of the Government, including the building of fifteen vessels, the cost of their maintenance, an immense increase in the land forces, an increase in the field artillery, and the expenditure upon fortifications, means, in the third year, according to the best estimates that we can frame, an increase of only ,£200,000 on our present annual expenditure. If this scheme can be accomplished for that cost as according to our professional advisers we have reason to believe it will be, I do not think the country, having regard to the transformation to be effected on sea and Iand, will consider it unduly expensive. think that fhe House is entitled to know from the Minister of Defence, before we Mr W.

I have read this statement very carefully. All that the Minister gave, as shown by the Hansard report of his speech, was a repetition of the figures given by the Prime Minister immediately before the summary that I have read. Those figures relate only to the military branch of the scheme. the Bill is dealing with. Mr W. H . IRVINE I was endeavouring to deal with the summary which the Prime Minister gave of the additional cost of all the military and naval expenditure, and surely I am entitled to do that?

We were referred by the Minister of Defence, in his speech the other day, to the figures given by the Prime Minister as stating the general cost, and we are told to take those figures as correct. I find that they are at fault by £400,000 or £500,000, and we are entitled to have that fact stated. We are not like children on the pavement, playing some foolish .game. We are not playing a game of chuck-farthing. We are charged with the responsibility of doing the work of the Commonwealth. We have presented to us a huge problem relating Those figures to the defence of Australia, and the Government say to us, "" In the first place, shut your eyes to naval defence; put that question aside, and take up the question of millitary defence. Deal with this Bill. We want you first of all to adopt additional expenditure of only a revolutionary change providing for a system of universal compulsory training.'-' WhatI say, in reply to that, is that we ought to know how much the whole policy is going to cost. Assuming that the additional cost is, not We are asked suddenly to £200,000, but nearly £700,000, I would direct the attention of the Minister to one or two further points. In the first place, I ask him if he seriously contends that the estimate of the cost of the compulsory system here put down will cover the actual expenditure? Mr W. H . IRVINE -I s it, then, not proposed to train and employ additional instructional and other officers for the new regiments? Has financial provision been made for that work? As he does not appear to be prepared to answer that question, I should like to ask him another. the honourable and learned member is, will he, uncler any circumstances, vote for the scheme ? ' Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is hardly a fair question, seeing that I have not the material which would enable a reasonable man to reply to it. I am not prepared to sign a blank cheque; before signing, I must know the amount for which I am making myself responsible.

It has convinced me that the honourable gentleman is an adept in the controversial art of putting arguments into the mouths of opponents simply to refute them. He also showed himself possessed of a very fine sense of humour; but I failed to get from his speech an answer to this and other questions upon which we should be informed. If the answer is in his speech, the Minister can tell ine by interjection. Mr Speaker would call me to order were I to attempt to reply to the honourable and learned member now. Minister to reply by interjection. When he rises to speak, his reply will close the debate. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Then, I ' shall content myself with suggesting a. few questions, to which I think we are entitled to a reply, before proceeding to consider the B ill . First, is it intended-ye s or no-that the militia shall be absorbed in the proposed new organization? that additional payments shall not be made to the omcers who will be called upon to undertake the enormous burden of training these forces? Is it intended to pay the men themselves anything, and. if so, approximately how much? additional expenditure will be incurred In all these directions, and we have not the means to estimate how much. We should have this information before we are asked to pledge ourselves to the new proposal. In conclusion, I ask the attention of honourable members, even at this hour of the evening, to one or two general observations on the scheme. my remarks, that the idea of giving our young men instruction in military exercises is very attractive to me, provided that we can afford to do it. But when we have So,000 men who, at some period of their career haye been engaged in the pleasant occupation of camping out for a few dayb, each year, and have received a little instruction in the use of the rifle, and know the simpler military formations and words of command-whe n we have these men, scattered about through the length and breadth of Australia, on our runs and farms, how much nearer shall we be to the military defence of the continent? answer that question, we must consider what form the danger for which we wish to preI have read it ; pare is likely to take. Suppose that the control of the sea-ou r main shield-were lost, the defence of the eastern seaboard might be comparatively simple; but were an Oriental nation to attempt to land a force in the Northern Territory, of what service would the 80,000 men I speak of be in repelling it ? Suppose that they could be brought together in various centres, and properly officered and organized, has either the Prime Minister or the Minister of Defence ever seriously considered the It is in the speech; but enormous difficulties and the huge expenditure connected with even the simplest system of mobilizing such a force? Even in those countries where military know ledge I shall not permit the has grown up for generations, and has been reduced to a great and perfect science, where all the means of communication are easy, and where the whole organization and staff are complete, the movement of troops for purposes of war over comparatively short distances is a huge and costly operation. Suppose we could get some of these troops together, and carry them to a point hundreds of miles distant, often through Then, is it intended unknown country, to meet a possible attack, could it be said that that is any step towards the effective defence of the Continent of Australia? In my opinion, member suggesting that the smaller the force the better? Mr W. H . IRVINE W h a t I intend to suggest is that the defence of the Continent of Australia is not a military but a naval problem. The idea of a military occupation of a continent of this great extent, with 8,000 miles of coastline, and a population about the size of that of the city of NewI said, at the opening of York, is to any one who has studied even the rudiments of military science, or the outlines of military history, absolutely inconceivable. There is no use in blinking the fact. We might, and could, easily maintain and defend against all comers our possession of the more thickly populated districts on the eastern seaboard of Australia. If that were all that we desired to defend, I am prepared to admit that we could do it ; but the problem before us now is the defence, not of Victoria, New South Wales, and Southern Queensland alone, but of the whole continent. The first and cardinal principle that we must recognise, because it To is based on absolute truth, is that the defence of Australia as a continent rests on naval control, and naval control only.",58,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

395,Dr. Carty Salmon,"I s the honorablethe scheme, then? Mr W. H . IRVINE -Abandon the military forces? No. With any naval force we must have a considerable land force working in co-ordination, and complementary to it. which the people of this country must realize before we shall ever arrive at anythink like a solution of this great problem, is that the defence of this place as a continent, our right to hold it, our right, so eloquently put by the honourable member for West Sydney, to assert the principle of a White Australia, placed as our territory is so near vast hordes of oriental races, is not a military problem at all, but a naval problem. tion. Mr W. H . .IRVINE -That is rather another question. Every one mult admit that our right as well as our power to hold this huge continent ultimately depends on our effectively occupying it. But, taking it even as' it is, or with' any increase of population that we are likely to see in the next three or four generations, the only real problem of Australian defence is: In what way we can maintain such a naval control over the oceans that surround us as will effectively protect the whole of the conmaintain an army of 100,000, or even tinent. I may perhaps be permitted to indulge in a little flight of imagination. After penditure for equipment, mobilization, listening to a speech by the Prime Minister on the subject of defence, I ""dream dreams of a nation, in arms, and of a powerful navy capable ultimately of not merely guarding the shores of Australia but of policing the whole of the neighbouring seas. These are glorious dreams, but I am rapidly dashed to earth when I look into the facts and figures, and examine the means at our disposal. Let me, too for a moment ± exercise my imagination. I will suppose that the naval.force of the Empire, which has hitherto been our one protection in the enjoyment of our rights, is either destroyed, or so effectually weakened that we can no longer rely upon its support. Let us imagine, if we can, that terrible catastrophe to have happened. direction would the danger to us arise ? That there would be danger, and great danger, is absolutely incontrovertible. But I do not anticipate that even in those circumstances the danger to be immediately apprehended would be the armed incursion of a large aggressive 'force, even in remote parts of the continent. I should not regard that as the immediate danger. If the naval power of the Empire were seriously weakened, what we should have to fear would be that powerful and aggressive nations both in the west and the east-it would perhaps But the main point,, be unwise and imprudent to mention names -woul d gradually ..set up claims to rights of one kind and another against us. They would first of all object strongly to any steps that we might take for preventing the ingress and egress of their citizens, and would probably lay claims to concessions, in the Northern Territory ancl other parts of Australia, which they would back up by demonstrations in force if need be. In that way they would gradually acquire rights which, whilst probably notinvolving the direct invasion of our territory, would gradually deprive us of a great deal of the real control and sovereignty of Australia. That is the kind of aggression that I should apprehend if the naval control which has hitherto been our guard were seriously impaired. In that case, just_ as in the case where we might anticipate actual invasion in some remote part of Australia, the possibility of our holding. the continent against such aggression is not conceivable. With a population, perhaps, of 40,000,000, instead of 4,000,000, we might possibly 200,000, men, ancl sustain the enormous exorganization, transport, military raihvays, ancl everything else necessary to utilize such a force. But, with our present resources, such a defence would be quite impossible. I do not want to weary the House with a. long speech on the subject, upon which, with most other people who have thought at a.ll on public affairs, I have pondered as deeply as my limited knowledge of it would permit me. I have read a good deal on the general subject of defence, especially naval defence, and the conclusion that is absolutely forced upon me is that the real problem before us is this: in what direction ought we to proceed in order to do our part in the maintenance of that huge burden of Imperial naval supremacy In what which gives to us, and to every part of the Empire, the only security that we possess? Whether we ought to inaugurate a navy of our own, with all its difficulties, or subscribe, either directly or indirectly, in much greater degree than we do at present, towards the maintenance of the Imperial Navv-wit h all its difficulties and the",59,Thomson About Pudiate Any Suggestion That It Should Be

397,Mr Fairbairn,"A problem of immigraalmost impossible position of contributing money without representation-in whatever direction we should go, the one problem for us is : what is Australia's part in maintaining the supremacy, not only in these seas, but on all the oceans of the globe, of that naval control and domination upon which our liberties rest? We are asked by the Government to shut our eyes to the whole question of naval control. No matter what policy we adopt, whether we expend much or little money, whether we intend to have a mosquito fleet with a few torpedo boats or destroyers, whether we attempt in earnest-a t something like appropriate, although enormous, expense-to create a naval force wholly or partly under our own control, or whether we propose to enlarge and amplify under some altered conditions the character of the Naval Agreement which we have hitherto had-whicheve r of those directions we may take, in that question and that question alone lies the solution of the problem of the defence of Australia. Without having the opportunity of expressing an opinion upon any aspect of that question, we are asked here and now by the Government, on the kind of information given to us and which I have been putting before the House tonight, to shut our eyes, and open our mouths, and swallow a general universal compulsory training system for military service. Was anything more absurd ever placed before a responsible Parliament ? We are told, "" Do not consider whether you will £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, or £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , or even more, upon our share in maintaining the naval supremacy of the Empire; that is not before you yet. Do not consider the question of your finances at the present time. We are going to tell you all about that a little later on, but we are not quite ready to tell you now. Shut your eyes to all that, and say whether or not you will commit this country, at this moment, to the adoption of a huge system of universal compulsory military training."" The thing, with all respect to the Government, is absurd. I realize that the Prime Minister-and his speeches have shown it-ha s undoubtedly grasped the necessity that exists for Australia to tackle the problem of Australian Defence. The honourable gentleman has made this a prominent question, and for that he deserves the highest credit. But he asks us to take the minor and auxiliary proposition first, although it must absolutely depend on what course we adopt in regard to the primary policy of naval defence. That seems not only to place the House in a false position, but to commit us, the taxpayers, and the people generally, to a scheme which may render it impossible for us to adopt that policy of naval defence which we may think proper. If we adopt a course now, which I have shown may cost, together with the existing naval arrangements, small and trifling as they are, an additional £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 , but which I think will cost a great deal more, and we are in addition asked to provide for old-age pensions and other proposals, desirable though they may be, how can we afterwards properly consider the real question, namely, the Naval Defence of the Continent ? I regret that I have occupied a great deal more time than I intended, but I thought it right to accept the invitation of the Prime Minister to honourable members on all sides to deal with this as a non-party question, and I hope that we shall bring our united intelligence and effort to bear in an endeavour to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. For the reasons I have given I believe I shall meet the views of a large number of honourable members if I move, as I now do, the f o l lowing amendmentThat all the words after the word "" T h a t "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" in the opinion of this House, the defence of Australia depending primarily upon control of the sea, it would be unwise to commit the country to any scheme of compulsory universal military service until Parliament is in a position to determine the naval policy of the have to spend £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , or Commonwealth."" journed.

The other error, I understood, had been corrected, and I regret to find that it has not.
