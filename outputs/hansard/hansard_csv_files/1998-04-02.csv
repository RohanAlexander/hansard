As members would be aware, under the Howard government since 1996 the cutbacks that have occurred in labour market programs have had devastating impacts on job clubs throughout Australia and, indeed, on skillshares and other labour market organisations. The Marrickville Job Club has been doing a fine job of assisting unemployed people from all over Sydney to attain skills and access job seeking resources for a period of over 10 years. Marrickville Job Club learnt some three weeks ago that its funding would be cut as a result of the government's new job network initiative. As a result of that, the Marrickville Job Club, which runs out of the May Murray Neighbourhood Centre, was forced to announce its closure. The President of the May Murray Neighbourhood Centre, Mr Michaei Christodoulou, stated: It is the saddest day in the history of our neighbourhood centre. After helping the unemployed for more than 14 years we are now forced to deny our unemployed access to the very tools they need to find a job. This was indeed a very successful organisation. In fact, during the last federal election campaign the then Treasurer Ralph Willis paid a visit to the Marrickville Job Club with me to see first-hand the facilities that these people offered. Fortunately, just as the Marrickville Job Club planned a last supper to mark the death of the job club, two people from the private sector, when hearing of the plight of Marrickville Job Club, stepped in and provided some personal funding. They are the owners of the 2MM Greek radio station and the Hellenic Vema newspaper, Mr Greg Gav and Mr Bill Gertos. It is to their great credit that they are prepared to step in and offer funding to this organisation. It has to be said, however, that it is a tragedy that it takes this sort of individual community spirit to replace the government funding which should never have been cut. I congratulate Marrickville Job Club on their survival. call them my friends. I thank them on behalf of the community in Grayndler for their assistance. School Chaplaincies people in my electorate of Canning who so strongly support and contribute financially towards the chaplaincies programs in high schools in Western Australia. On 21 August 1997, the West Australian featured an article titled 'Discipline chaos in state schools'.

Such actions not only create social problems in our neighbourhoods, but also add an additional financial strain on individuals and communities. It has been estimated that it costs approximately $45,000 a year to retain a full-time high school chaplain, yet to keep a person in prison costs around $68,000 per year. Simple arithmetic tells one where the social benefits will be. In a recent letter from the Gosnells District Churches Commission on Education, I was advised that the state government's annual grant for chaplaincy support has remained at $90,000 per year for the past six years. I have met several of the non-denominational chaplains who work together with the counsellors and the teachers in high schools. Stuart and Margaret, to mention just two of the young chaplains that I have met, have created a very non-threatening environment which encourages students to discuss their problems. These chaplains have impressed me with their positive approach toward problem solving and their attitude to bridge the emotional gulf that exists between some of the students and their families, friends and the wider community. The chaplains' non-judgmental guidance has helped to bring many students back from the brink of contemplating suicide, homelessness and drug addiction. Yet, because financial support for the important work that the chaplains do comes mainly from personal contributions from the community and local businesses, Stuart and Margaret can only work part time throughout their week. This means that some of the students may reach crisis point without help when they most need it, leading to possible consequences which will be far more costly for governments in a socioeconomic sense. I conclude as I started, by praising the efforts of the people involved in the chaplaincy program. I believe that their guidance and friendship towards the young people whom they support is very necessary in our schools today. This government has already released policies that will tackle youth homelessness, drugs in our community and the unacceptable high level of youth suicide. I urge the government, in further developing such policies, to recognise the valuable work that chaplains can do in our schools. Secondary Education Wales Minister for Education and Training, John Aquilina, entitled 'Widening horizons: a strategy for expanding educational opportunities in Sydney's west'. I have spoken about the campaign in my own electorate to have a senior high school, which resulted in the first public senior high school in St Marys some 10 years ago. I am pleased to say that in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Greenway( Mr Mossfield) we now have a second, different model of senior high school, one with junior feeder schools. The most exciting feature of this new approach is that students will actually be able to take TAPE subjects at school. They will also be able to take university subjects at school. Nirimba has these facilities at the educational precinct by way of the TAFE and the university campus there. I know many of my constituents are going to be disappointed that there was not an announcement made about the Mount Druitt college system. I want to assure them that my colleagues, state member Jim Anderson and minister Richard Amery, and I are continuing to have a dialogue with the department of education. I am pleased to see that what we are developing will be put out into the public arena this month for consultation and it will be possible in the 1999 school year to have the Mount Druitt super-high up and operating.",118,Representatives Main Committee

Electricity Industry House a fate awaiting the electricity industry in the Hunter. The Bob Carr state Labor government and Energy Australia are walking away from a contract signed two years ago with National Power to build a power station, employ some 1,200 people during construction and, ""ence completed, offer 200 full-time and contract positions in this $315 million project. The anniversary of the signing of that contract two years ago occurred last Saturday. But now Energy Australia and Bob Carr want to break that contract, claiming as the reason that there is not enough financial viability in the company. Yet this company is backed up by the likes of companies such as ABB, National Power, our own AIDC and LG&E. This project would inject some $10 million annually into the Hunter's economy and, in the initial stages, reduce the unemployment in the Hunter by some five per cent. This is not a project to be sneezed at or walked away from. To show that the federal government was absolutely committed to this project, last September we provided $30 million in infrastructure borrowings tax rebates. At the time, the National Power Australia director, Mr Roy Alper, said: We are delighted by the Commonwealth Government's decision to assure the project support under a new infrastructure investment program. It means we can proceed to close our financing and start construction. It also means we will be able to proceed with Redbank No.2, a project of very similar dimensions in the same area. What we have seen as a result of this action, the step taken by this"" spineless Carr Labor government and the absolute silence of the members from the Hunter in this House-because they have been stifled in their approach and stymied by the right wing of the Labor Partysilent at all because we want those jobs in the Hunter. We see lots of screaming by the Carr Labor government about jobs. But what seems to happen is the federal government takes one step forward on the investment front and on the job opportunity front in the Hunter but the Carr state Labor government and all its silent cohorts in this House drag us back two steps. If they are serious about addressing the unemployment problem, if they are serious about addressing investment confidence in the Hunter, then they will not ask but demand that Bob Carr develop some intestinal fortitude and spine and take on Energy Australia and deliver on this contract, which was signed two years ago and which, as I said, will reduce unemployment in the Hunter by some five per cent by the sheer magnitude of it.

The document read as followsProblems/Anomalies/Issues re the Superannuation Surcharge (Tax) Legislation Hidden Cost/ Has the Government appreciated the hidden cost of implementing the surcharge legislation, effectively penalising every member of every superannuation fund? ie., the superannuation provider will have to send details of every member each year to the ATO by 31 October? Golden Handshakes If a golden handshake is paid to a taxpayer, then, the taxpayer is liable for the surcharge if his or her adjusted taxable income is greater than the thresho)d. It is said that an assessment for the surcharge will be issued to the member at the time the income tax assessment is issued.' Apart from the funding issues, has the Government considered timing 'anomalies that may arise if the income tax returns are lodged through a tax agent and the lodgement does not take place until the following year and the member is not aware that he or she would be liable for the surcharge? Who is responsible for advising the member? Inequity in Administering Death Benefits Has the Government considered the inequity in relation to the timing and payment of death benefits and the levying of the surcharge? For e.g., where the payment of the contributed amounts or the commencement of a pension is made to a person other than the member (e.g., death benefits paid to a relative) then no surcharge is payable. If, on the death of a member, contributed amounts have not b,een paid before an assessment is issu,ed, then the superannuation provider holding the contributed amounts must pay the surcharge. All in all, this seems some what inequitable. Dividend Imputation Has the Government realised that there is a partial erosion of the benefit flowing from the dividend imputation rules by including the 'gross-up factor' in calculating the taxable income, but not making provision for the franking rebates which are available to reduce income tax otherwise payable? Averaging Provisions-Fluctuating Income Why hasn't the Government made any allowance for those taxpayers who have high income in a certain year because of fluctuating income patterns? Why aren't there any averaging provisions available in the context of the superannuation surcharge? Different Rules Depending on Whether the Amounts are Rolled-Over to a Superannuation Fund or Retainecl Why is the calculation of the surcharge different between ETPs rolled-over and ETPs retained? ie., as the legislation presently stands, where an employee retains such an ETP, it will only be the post20 August 1996 portion of the ETP on which the surcharge will be paid, not the whole post-June 1983 component as is the case where the ETP ""is rolled-over. 2444 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 What's more, the position changes after 20 August 2001, from which time the whole preand post-June 1983 components (subject to a limited exception) are subject to tax if retained by the employee but only the post-June 1983 component is taxed if rolled-over to a superannuation provider. Late Payment Penalty Whilst the fund is said to be initially liable for any late payment penalty of 20%, has the Government made allowance for tax advisers who may be preparing accounts and tax returns for hundreds of smaller superannuation funds and therefore only have limited time available to comply with the reporting obligations and have genuinely not been able to meet the deadline? Does. the Government intend to surreptitiously shift that burden on to the tax advisers and accountants and also create ill-feeling between advisers and clients? De-minimus Rules Why hasn't the Government incorporated de minimus rules regarding late payment penalties? i.e., interestingly, the legislation does not contain any de minimus rule providing for assessments not to issue where less than some nominal amount (e.g. $20) is payable? Partial Roll-Overs In relation to partial roll-overs, the legislation is silent on the issue of whether a member will have a choice as to which parts of a partial roll-over the surcharge will come from? Variation of Advance Instalment Why is there no provision for variation of advance instalments? No Interest on Refunds Whilst the legislation makes provision for a late payment penalty, why isn't there a corresponding provision for interest on refunds of surcharge, where an advance instalment was paid, but in factÂ· no surcharge liability arose in respect of that member in the following year? Anti-avoidance Legislation Will the Government undertake not to introduce anti-avoidance legislation at a later date and make it retrospective from the date of the commencement of the surcharge legislation? Public Sector Superannuation Funds (Unfunded) Has the Government considered fully the number of anomalies in relation to public sector superannuation schemes? Telecommunications current mobile phone discussions. As we well know, the 1992 agreement which we were locked into by the previous government did create some inconvenience. But the government and the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) have worked very hard over the last couple of years to make sure that all that could be done is being done to provide services-and this may come as a surprise to many Australians-to those are-s which do not have mobile phone services. We hear that 94 per cent of the population of Australia has access to mobile phones, but that in fact means to only 10 per cent of the land mass, so 90 per cent of the land mass has no coverage whatsoever. With the negotiations that the minister has undertaken over the last 12 months with Telstra, Optus and Vodaphone, there have been significant steps forward. The advent of the new technology out of the US, I understand, like CDMA technology which gives equivalent coverage to analog, provides us with significant hope that the advantages of digital can be brought into the bush, particularly to those areas which are seen to be too sparse for the carriers now. With digital technology or the GSM technology and with the CDMA",120,Representatives Main Committee

For the more remote areas of Australia, probably the low earth orbiting satellite option is . the best option that is going to be there and available in September this year. I must compliment the governmentgovernment. The government has worked diligently to provide the most up-to-date technology and to provide competition within the carriers of telecommunications around Australia. There is no doubt in my mind that as the years go by we will be seen to have had a government which had the foresight to make the investment particularly through the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to allow regional Australia to have the best possible communications available to us. Gold Mining Industry morning-and I assume some people do-will see a letter to the editor from Senator Bob Brown, which is thoroughly dishonest and misleading. Bob Brown says that the government and the Labor Party have sold Aboriginal people out. He says that in fact all that is at stake in native title is the right to negotiate over mining. The senator knows this is simply not true. Should you be seeking a road or a tourist development or a pipeline easement, you are stuck with the right to negotiate. As the former Governor General Bill Hayden said,the right to negotiate in its present form is nothing more than extortion. I think it is about time these green fairies got off the magic mushroom and looked at what actually is happening to Australia. In my own town of Kalgoorlie, things are grinding to a halt as the mines close. These are opportunity mines and usually have a fairly short life. They rely on drilling around them to maintain their ore bodies. That has not happened. When this came in, I warned the Labor Party that the upsurge in drilling that they saw-exploration was on brownfield sites-was in fact being concentrated on there for the very reason of native title. What has happened is that that ground has now been largely explored. They have got the details, development has taken place on that and those mines are running out. In the last three months 15 or 16 mines have closed-none have opened-because there has simply been no exploration on these greenfield areas. The reason there has been no exploration is because of native title-entirely because of native title. People say, 'Oh, there is a downturn in the price.' Yes, there has been a downturn in the price of gold. But in terms of Australian dollars, it is not all that significant. In any case, had we not been held up by native title, these sites would have gone ahead and they would have been developed. They would have been so far down the road that the price of gold would not have stopped them. They would have forward sold their production and they would be in production. In the life of those mines, I would confidently expect the price of gold will turn around and will go up again.

362,Mr Campbell (Kalgoorlie) (9.55 A.m.),"Anyone reading the Australian newspaper this2446 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 That the bill be now read a second time. Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 which contains a number of measures to reform the child support scheme. While these changes will go along way to assist both custodial and noncustodial parents, they only touch the surface of the problems faced by the people involved in the child support scheme. I would like to talk on a couple of these changes that will be implemented by this bill but before I do, I want to relay to the House a situation that occurred recently to one of my constituents, a custodial parent. AlthoughI am often on my feet referring to the inequality or the inequity in the system on behalf of the non-custodial parent, I am just as concerned about the unfairness of the system on custodial parents as well. The matter I wish to raise concerns Mrs CC of Moranbah who had two children by her husband before the marriage broke up. The husband moved away from their home and set up his own. He did not pay child support maintenance because he was an unemployed motor mechanic but he was provided with full access to both children, which is fair enough. After a couple of years on struggle street, the wife approached the husband and asked if he would be prepared to look after the male child while she continued to look after the female child. He agreed. . Shortly after this agreement was reached, the husband decided to move interstate to New South Wales with his son, and nothing was heard of them for five years. Let us be clear: the couple had been living in Moranbah but they split up, and he moved away and has not been paying any child support or any maintenance at all to the custodial parent. She has had to look after both of the children. What has now happened is that, because of the financial burdenand because, I guess, the son may even wish to live with the father-the son has moved away and is now living with the dad. The mum has the daughter, and the dad has the son. Suddenly, out of the blue, the husband applied to the Family Court in New South Wales for access to his daughter, even though he originally had access provided by the Family Court: he had had access but now he wanted greater access. As a result of this, the wife was required to attend the New South Wales Family Court but could not afford to do so because, obviously, she did not have enough finances to be able to travel from central Queensland to New South Wales. However, a family friend kindly provided the necessary funds to allow her to meet the obligations and to take her daughter with her. In the hearing, the father claimed he wanted to see his daughter during summer and winter holidays but that he had no money to travel to Queensland to see her and he requested that the court order the wife to pay half the costs to fly the daughter to New South Wales to visit the father. The judge granted the request, and now the wife has to pay the airfares to send the daughter twice a year to see her father so that he may meet his new access requirements. This is absolutely outrageous. He has never paid maintenance, and now the custodial parent has to actually fly the child to him. It is absolutely crazy. The father has never contributed towards the upkeep of the family since he departed seven years ago and now he expects the mother to pick up half the tab so that he can gain access to the daughter during the school holidays. This is -he problem with the child support system and the Family Court-the whole thing. It is nothing but a shambles. From what we see here, there are basically two ways of looking at child support and the Family Court. There are two fundamental factors. The most",123,Representatives Main Committee
363,Mr Marek (Capricornia) (9.58 A.m.),"I rise today to talk about the Child SupportThursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2447 disadvantaged person gets all the help, and the system works on the capacity to pay. If you have any capacity, you will pay. The thing is that becauseMr Tony Smith-Even if they have no capacity. is to try to be fair and to even this thing out so that everybody gets a fair deal. It is heavily swung one way or the other, and it needs to be smoothed out to give everybody a fair run. The cost to the mother is thousands of dollars that she does not have, in this particular situation. She has a small income from part-time work and from the family allowance payment for the daughter. Now she is expected to pay-and with great difficulty, I can tell you-this impost so that the father can meet his obligations. The father is required to pay the return airfare for the daughter, but, as experience has shown in this family, the father is unlikely to have any money, and there is a real possibility that the daughter will be left stranded in New South Wales unless the mother can find the money for the return fare. AlthoughI appreciate that the judge may have had a difficult situation to resolve-because neither party has any money-I cannot support the judge's decision that imposes a large debt on the custodial parent, when it is the non-custodial parent's responsibility to meet the costs associated with this particular circumstance in relation to access. As I said before, the noncustodial parent has never paid any maintenance towards the upkeep of his children. The Commonwealth has, to date, paid for the upkeep of his two children. As we all know, it is difficult enough for people in this situation to manage, and it will be even harder in the future for this mother to manage with the additional costs now imposed on her by the New South Wales Family Court judge. The only way we can get this changed is for the mother to legally challenge the judge's findings, but this costs money, a commodity the mother does not have, and so she has had to grudgingly accept the decision and meet her obligations. She is but one of many people who have obviously been unfairly dealt with through the Family Court child support system. I appreciate that it is important for the father to have access to his children, but I now wonder how the custodial parent will be able to manage on an income of $3,000 a year because of the non-custodial parent's predicament. As I said, he never pays. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill is a small step in the right direction for custodial and non-custodial parents. We can do better, we must do better, and I am quietly confident that we will do better. In this regard I am pleased to say that the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) has agreed to establish a government child support working group or task force to bring some of these issues to the fore. government has looked previously at amendments via a subcommittee, but we need to really focus strongly on the problems and this task force will have a great opportunity to address a lot of these issues. I would like to see this working group provide some definitive recommendations to the relevant ministers that will clear up the problem once and for all. People can rest assured that my view will be that there be no fudged, grey areas. People can rest assured that any points that are made will be addressed, that we have an agenda and that the agenda will be to fix the problem. That is where I am coming from. Unless we bite the",124,Representatives Main Committee

365,Mr Slipper,Are you on it?,125,Representatives Main Committee
366,Mr Marek,"Yes. As I said, we have only touched the edges of this problem. The2448 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 bullet our electorate offices will continue to be inundated with complaints from both sides about the scheme's inequity. Raising the non-custodial parent's self-support component by 10 per cent is a nominal gesture but it does not address the inequity that continues to exist. The self-support component for a non-custodial parent is currently $9,006 and it will increase to $9,947. Someone on $42,000 a year would pay about $370 a year in child support. Big deal! The self-support component may be appropriate for someone on basic wages but a lot of my constituents earn higher wages and this amount would not pay their food bill, let alone a mortgage. The self-support component must reflect the non-custodial parent's income and must be increased accordingly. When a family lives together, everyone in that family shares the tax burden imposed on the breadwinner. Yet, when a family breaks up the breadwinner has to meet all the tax burden. This is unfair and I would like to see the self-support component reflect the taxation burden in such a way that it helps reduce the maintenance that some of these high income earners are paying. Additionally, we should look at the custodial parent who reaps the rewards of the noncustodial parent who does overtime or improves his employment status. Many years after the family has broken up, surely any improvements in the status of the non-custodial parent must not result in those benefits going to the custodial parent who is no longer part of the noncustodial parent's family. Basically, the situation is that a person has been in a relationship and the relationship has failed. It is a sad thing but it has happened. We are talking about emotions, we are talking about people's lives. These things do happen. People must have the opportunity to be able to better themselves and move on. If you cannot move on, what is the good of it all? That is the problem we are having with a lot of people out there. I am so passionate about this issue. People are looking at suicide. It is absolutely imperative that we do something about this. That is why if the non-custodial 'parent has the ability to better his life later on, after the family has broken up, then that new income, that new amount of money that he is on whether it is through overtime or a better job, a better salary, should now not reflect on the lifestyle of the previous relationship. Certainly, I hope that can be taken on board. At the same time, I would like to see the self-support component for the custodial parent reduced even more than is proposed by the legislation. At the moment the self-support component for a custodial parent is $39,295 which is based on full-time average weekly earnings, plus an amount for child-care costs for each child under 12 years of age. Removal of the child-care component will reduce the disregarded amount of income for the custodial parent to $30,347. While this is a move in the right direction, it still provides the custodial parent with a disregarded income of over $20,000, which is more than the non-custodial parent self-support. Why is this? The reason given is that the custodial parent must be paid for raising the child or the children. Now, $20,000 equates to about $400 a week so no matter how many children a custodial parent has, they are entitled to an allowance of $400 to raise them, even it equates to one child. For $400, one could leave a child in a child-care centre all week and still have plenty left over. The $400 is still the gross amount above and beyond the actual cost of raising a child. This government has to review further this part of the legislation and bring it into line with . the more acceptable amounts similar to that afforded to the non-custodial parent. For example, Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2449 $25,000 is an adequate disregarded amount for a custodial parent to raise a child before they then make some form of contribution themselves. That still provides the custodial parent with $14,000 more in disregarded income than the non-custodial parent, which should be more than sufficient to raise a child. I have heard that the opposition is planning to move some amendments to the government's legislation, which is somewhat hypocritical of them, frankly. The Labor Party had 13 years to do something about the Child Support Agency and the system that it operates under but they ended up doing absolutely nothing. They passed it off to a committee and the committee buried it. The former government's Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues headed by the member for Chifley( Mr Price) started to investigate the problems with the child support scheme. The committee was inundated with 6,800 submissions from all around the country, the most submissions made to any joint select committee, or a standing committee, on any issue investigated by this parliament. That in itself indicated the enormity of the problem. Yet, what did the Labor Party do between the report's findings in 1994 and when they were turfed out of office in 1996? Absolutely nothing. They had the evidence before them; they had the answers before them and they did absolutely nothing. office and they want to get back on the bandwagon. The Labor Party wants to dictate to this government what they want, yet they never had the guts to fix the thing themselves. It is absolutely pathetic. To emphasise the Labor Party's failure, we have the member for Werriwa the legislation that only reflect on this government's actions and not on the child support scheme. The member for Werriwa, 'Where are we'his correct title. failure of the Howard government, after 12 months in office, to respond to the recommendations of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The member for Werriwa also moved an amendment to note with concern the failure of this government to implement some of the report's recommendations, and that this has caused parents and their children to suffer needless hardship. He was not much concerned about the inordinate lack of action by his own party which, two years after the report had been handed down, had done nothing to alleviate the concerns of the non-custodial and custodial parents who had made submissions to the committee. found out what the problems were and did absolutely nothing about them. Yet, here they are trying to take the agenda off us and basically trying to run the agenda. It is absolutely hypocritical. As far as I am concerned, his thoughts and his amendments can go where they want; the government will run the agenda on this legislation. The government has done more in two years than the previous government did in 13 and this government will continue to ensure that the child support system becomes a more equitable and more accountable system.",125,Representatives Main Committee

They are representatives of a group of people who have been picked up by a system-the child support system-that does not really care. The Family Court runs its agenda and, from what we hear and see of the problems people are having in their lives, things just do not seem to be working out very well at all. I believe that the new task force which the Prime Minister has announced and which several of us are on will have a great opportunity to address a lot of the problems. valid point that we are picking up a problem that the Labor Party introduced. Yet that party is trying to imply that it is this government that instigated the problem. That is an absolute farce; it is not true. The Labor Party has no clothes and no credibility on this issue.

Marek) that the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 is a small step in the right direction. That is certainly not understating the implications of this bill. The one thing that surprised me when I first came uninitiated into politics as the member for Calare was the overwhelming number of constituents who came to me with family law and child support related problems. It started out as about a quarter of my workload and has not got much below that fraction ever since. Such is the anguish of many people cbping with the child support regime that I was concerned enough to set up a loose network of support in my electorate, where at least people could talk to others in similar circumstances, so emotionally drained were they by not only their family break-up but the frustrations associated with the child support system. By far the major concern has been expressed by non-custodial parents, who find the 18 per cent, 27 per cent, 32, 34 and 36 per cent formulae crippling. The money is determined on gross salary but paid out of net. In one case, I had a former senior education executive with just $25 left-after renting a modest little home-to start a new life, while his former partner not only received the child support but enjoyed the benefits of a very generous property settlement and also the trappings of a very comfortable new relationship. There were five kids aged between 14 and two. I have custodial parents come to me time and time again unable to get anything out of their non-custodial former partners. They know he or she is earning good money but it does not show upiri any declarations or tax returns. Members would no doubt be aware of these sorts of situations. The common thread through it all is the inevitable, clinical way in which these cases are dealt with by the Child Support Agency. I know these people cannot get personally involved in individual cases-quite frankly, theirs must be one of the most depressing, frustrating vocations on offer-but th.ere certainly seems to be a lack of resources to deal with individual cases face to face.",127,Representatives Main Committee

377,Mr Andren (Cal Are) (10.16 A.m.),"I note the words of the member for Capricornia ( MrThursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 2451 Child support is not social security, it is not about pensions or Austudy, it is not about unemployment-as emotional as those issues can be. The victims are vulnerable, angry, bitter, confused and exasperated. For the non-custodial parent the imposition of the payment formulae on overtime makes no sense at all when he or she is trying to build up a small hank outside their child support commitments to get on with their life or to organise a few treats for those kids when they see them. In this regard I commend the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith) for his positive contributions to this debate in the course of this parliament. He has come up with a suggestion, as a barrister experienced in some aspects of family law, for a child support tribunal. I have sought some expert opinion on his suggestion from family law practitioners, and, while there appear to be many areas needing clarification and perhaps modification, he must be congratulated for trying to find a means to overcome the inherent unfairness in the child support system which these government amendments address in some ways, though only very marginally, but certainly do not solve. As we know, the' amendments contained in this bill stem from the 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which made something like 164 recommendations for reform of the child support system. The complexity of the changes needed is evidenced by the fact it has taken so long for any meaningful changes to find their way to the parliament by way of these amendments. I welcome the adjusted formula income amounts contained in this bill, but they do not go far enough. . The administrative formula will be modified by increasing the liable parent's exempted income, including an allowance for a shared child, and reducing a carer's disregarded income. However, while welcome, the increase in the paying parent's exempted income by 10 per cent really does not address the problem at all. For a non-custodial parent earning $42,000 a year, the exempted income is increased by about $940 and the child support drops by about $360. That is less than $7 a week, according to my arithmetic. The constituent I mentioned, with the five kids under the age of 14 for whom he is paying a small fortune in child support, has an extra $7 to add to that $25 he now has, after board and reasonable living expenses, to start a new life. The Lone Fathers Association called for at least a 20 per cent increase in the paying parent's exempted income. I understand there are amendments 'coming from the opposition that speak about 15 per cent, out I have not seen them yet. I will look forward to seeing them, as I guess this bill will be referred back to the other place. The 20 per cent that the Lone Fathers Association is suggesting is, to my mind, a very reasonable and meaningful amount. We will have to come back here after several more years, if we do not adjust it now, and adjust this figure to a more sensible one. The problem is that the Institute of Family Studies has determined that it costs $243 a week to keep a teenage child-I think from age 12 or above. That sort of mathematics lies at the heart of the problem with the child support formulae, problems these amendments do not address. There are also concerns that the superficially sensible extension of child support until a child finishes school could lead to manipulation of children on the basis of financial gain and further discriminates against the paying parent who has no say in the current or future dispersal of child support provisions. In fact, figures compiled by the Lone Fathers Association show that the extra payment for children completing school could increase from $1 15,000 to $122,000 over the school life of three children, irrespective of, and despite, these reforms we are speaking about here. 2452 MAIN COMMITtEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 What we really need is to determine the rates of child support on after-tax income to be set at levels that do not wipe out the incentive for non-custodial parents to work. After we take 49 per cent of an income for tax and Medicare levy, 32 per cent for child support for three kids, six percent for compulsory super and 10 per cent costs in earning our income, we are left with three per cent disposable income-hardly fair and not addressed in these amendments. The Lone Fathers Association quite correctly points to another aspect of the bill that seems to address only half the problem. It is proposed that payers with second families will now be able to claim 50 per cent of any child support paid as a deduction for the household used for determining the family's entitlement to family payment and child-care assistance. The association rightly asks: why will payers with second families only be able to claim half of such child support? Surely they should be allowed to claim it all. You are basically making the kids of that next relationship, or the ones that are inherited into that next relationship, pay for the fact that there are kids of another relationship for which child support is due. They should not be punished, and this certainly does not address their concerns. It amounts to a compulsory further payment out of gross income for non-custodial parents in addition to their tax, their child support and their other commitments. The figure does not take into account things like medical or insurance payments and other school or education payments. Really, the non-custodial parent is left high and dry. I notice the cost to the budget of this 50 per cent concession will be about $10 million by the year 2000. It should be $20 million, the whole tab, with the Commonwealth assuming all the costs, because it was unfair as it stood and it is still unfair by a factor of 50 per cent. This bill also makes amendments in the area of parents' rights and responsibilities. There are some useful reforms in this area, particular in enabling parents to move from child support collection to private collection and the limit on the information shown on assessment notices in relation to children of a liable parent. The introduction of child support minimum liability sends the right message to those who would choose to avoid their responsibilities but the minimum of $260 a year is hardly attacking the major problem, which is that many non-custodial parents will continue to take the dole option because of the punitive effects of the formula applied to wages, notwithstanding the changes to the exempted income contained in the bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would have liked to have added more to this debate, but time constraints on my research capabilities prevented my doing so. I urge the government to take on board the recommendations from the Lone Fathers Association, particularly in relation to upper limits on child support percentages and the gross versus net income arguments. I agree the child support rate should not exceed 50 per cent of net income after allowing for reasonable deductions to allow the non-custodial parent to get on with a new life. The bill does not address those -issues. It is a great disappointment to me and a source of continued anger and frustration to hundreds of people in my electorate that we are not yet close enough to a fair and equitable child support system. The amendments moved by the member for Dickson are certainly worthy of serious consideration. I have sought some expert opinion on them and I do have difficulty with a tribunal that excludes lawyers, As much as lawyers are not entirely objective, when it comes to talk of excluding them from court or quasi court proceedings such as a tribunal, I accept the advice that I have received that there could be very grave difficulties with the tribunal as envisaged by the member for Dickson's proposal. Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2453 I cannot see the two antagonists in a child support dispute sitting down unrepresented in such a tribunal and achieving very much at all. Someone described it to me as the fox chasing the chicken in the pen. The illiterate and those unable to cope with the tribunal atmosphere would also seem to be in a position which would work against any positive outcome. Unfortunately or fortunately, legal representation needs to be available to make the system work fairly but I agree totally with the member for Dickson that we need to consider the particular circumstances of such couples. I have managed to get the Child Support Agency to visit my electorate-as they do now visit most electorates after a lot of pressure from members all across the political spectrum in this area as we came into this parliament. The Child Support Agency did react to the concerns of members. Once about every six months, they talk with the most pressing cases but this only helps about five or six of the 50 or 60 cases I have got on my files at anyone time. While the suggestion of the member for Dickson of a tribunal is a welcome endeavour to quarantine the child support area from the other complexities of the separation and divorce process, I am not convinced it would work and I am not prepared to support his amendments at this point. However, his very thoughtful addressing of this critical issue is to be commended. He shows the need for more compassion and face-to-face treatment of the parties to child support proceedings. There needs to be a far more user-friendly way of handling the appeals process and there needs to be a far more sensible application of the formulae. The member for Capricornia mentioned the government task force. I would suggest, if the government is dead serious about this, that this task force should be non-partisan, non-political and should be extended to include members from all sides of the House. It is a non-political issue; it cannot be politicised. It is a problem that we have all got to address out there. I know every member-I can see it in their eyes here in this place-is confronted with the same number of complaints and concerns that I am in my electorate. We should make it a non-partisan thing if we are serious about what this parliament is all about. I appeal to those members on the government side to take that suggestion to the minister and expand this. I have got enough on my plate but I would certainly like to contribute to whatever deliberations are occurring in this area. I support these government amendments not because they are ideal but because they move reform of child support in the right direction. But it is a glacial movement and these amendments have not been received with any great enthusiasm by either child support parties or the family law specialists whom I have consulted. for cooperating and agreeing to allow me to continue in the debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998. I do apologise: I was interrupted yesterday by a division in the House of Representatives, and I was tied up with delivering a report in the main chamber as the chair of the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. I have one comment on the suggestion of the honourable member for Calare( Mr Andren) for bipartisan support. I certainly agree that I can see some merit there but I suppose that with some cynicism I have to say that the Price report, from where a lot of these recommendations have come, is not something that has suddenly appeared. It had been around for a long time before we came into government and, prior to our coming into government, much of that report",128,Representatives Main Committee
378,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (10.30 A.m.),"First of all I would like to thank the opposition2454 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 had actually been either left on the table or rejected or not accepted by the previous government. I am not suggesting that members on the other side now have not got commitment; I am sure they have and I would certainly appreciate their bipartisan support In dealing with this very emotional and difficult problem. But we need,. as a government, to go through and identify areas that we feel that we can address immediately. With support from members of the other side and from the Independents, I am confident that we can eventually find a solution. We certainly have the will to do that. Going on from yesterday, the governmentÂ· must address ongoing reforms in the following areas. The formula is one of the problems that most of my constituents agree about: some type of formula is needed to arrive at a reasonable amount payable for child support. However, we all believe more flexibility must be introduced into the assessment process by having a fonnula that not only will enable paying parents to meet their liability but will also firmly establish the role they are playing in the upbringing of their children. The formula as it now stands is based on a certain percentage' of the paying parent's gross or taxable income. This percentage varies, depending on the number of children. Whether the paying parent has one, two or three jobs makes absolutely no difference: they still pay the same percentage of that income. Flexibility must be introduced to allow child support to be calculated on the net income of the principal job only. Capping is another area,' and fixing child support at particular rates is another measure that many payers support. The capped rate would be expected to accurately reflect the genuine cost of maintaining a child or children from the age of one through to 18. Accountability is another problem: a mechanism must be established to ensure that child support payments are actually used for the children and not for maintaining the custodial parent's lifestyle. We must never forget that this scheme is all about child support. Another area is taxation: I feel that rebates on child support payments should be made available to the paying parents. These people pay a high rate of tax, a single rate, while custodial parents are able to claim dependant rebates. There are a lot of other hidden costs, of course, and a mechanism must be established to identify the value of extra expenses that the non-custodial parent incurs in having to provide a suitable home for access visits. Relief could be provided by way of tax relief for mortgage payments or rent. Many parents also incur considerable expense in the provision of air fares for access visits and in the provision of clothing and personal items. These must be identified as legitimate expenses by child support agencies, and relief granted for the paying parent. One of the other problems we have is in regard to self-employed payers. The collection of payments from self-employed payers is a matter of increasing concern in the child support area. One particularly sad case brought to the attention of my office involved a lady who is selfemployed and whose ex-husband manipulated his real income and seriously distorted his capacity to earn a proper income, in order to avoid paying his fair share towards the upbringing of his three children. This resulted in her having to repay almost the total amount of child support he had paid to her over a five-year period. The woman's mother had to sell her own home and purchase a larger house to accommodate her daughter and the three children. If it had not been for that mother, the woman and her children would have been literally living on the streets, whilst her ex-husband received cash Thursday; 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2455 in hand from two companies: he was a silent partner in another company while all the time operating a company of his own and paying almost nothing to his family. I am pleased that we have the child support scheme in place in this country. I sincerely believe that we need it. However, what is of enormous concern to me and many of my constituents is the apparent inconsistencies and inequities in the current system and these must be addressed as a matter of urgency. We need a better scheme, a scheme which focuses on the best interests of the child. Reform of the child support scheme must also include family law and the Family Court. A mechanism must be established to separate family law from child support matters. It must provide fairer access to legal aid; it must address the issue of abuse of access agreements; and it must also address the abuse of domestic violence orders which are being used by lawyers as an interim measure to strengthen the negotiating position of custodial parents. HoweverI will deal with these issues in another place and at another time. I commend this bill to the House. Legislation Amendment Bill 1998. The 148 federal electorates are very different in many respects and the problems and issues put to local members vary immensely, but there is one issue that is prominent in each and every electorate in Australia. That issue is the anger, frustration and disillusionment caused by the child support legislation and, in many cases, the Child Support Agency. At the outset I want to pay tribute to the Child Support Agency office in Wollongong. My office has a very good working relationship with the Wollongong office and because of this relationship we work together to calm some situations and try to resolve the problems that are raised. I note that the honourable member for Gilmore( Mrs Gash) has expressed similar views on the relationship her office has with the Wollongong CSA. In many respects the Child Support Agency offices, spread around Australia, are as much victims of the legislation as are local members, and certainly as much as most of our constituents. The whole area of child support, while so necessary, is for so many people an absolute nightmare. I heard some of what the government members said yesterday. It is all very well to make cheap jibes at the opposition but even government members cannot deny that the original legislation is an example of legislation introduced with the best of intentions to remedy a serious problem but that it has become legislation that has gone horribly wrong. Few people are satisfied with child support legislation. Most people are angry, bitter and very disillusioned. It is a very dangerous cocktail of emotions. Like many members, I can remember the days when women were left partnerless and without financial support to raise children. The unfair burden this placed on these women, because their male partners would not recognise their responsibility for their children, was the primary motive for introducing the child support legislation. I never want to see a return to those days when the custodial parent was left in the financial lurch. But there must be a better way to address the issue of continued support for children from broken relationships. The legislation as it stands today clearly discriminates against the non-custodial parent, be it man or woman, although it just so happens that most non-custodial parents are men.",131,Representatives Main Committee
379,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (10.36 A.m.),"I wish to speak in this debate on the Child Support2456 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 I say this because of the many cases I have dealt with in my electorate. Just as it should be the responsibility of each parent to support his or her children, both emotionally and financially, it should also be the right of each parent to begin and establish, where appropriate, a new relationship. I have dealt with too many cases where the potential to establish a new relationship is flawed because of child support burdens. I have seen the custodial parent, usually a woman, establish a new relationship. Let me be clear, none of us begrudge them this, but in the same circumstances the non-custodial parent, usually the man, because of the financial burden of his child support obligation, is left with not enough to get by on from week to week let alone try to establish a new relationship. Unless you experience this; unless you can see the frustration of non-custodial parents, you cannot appreciate the built up anger they have against this legislation. It is very rare for me to hear any non-custodial parent tell me that they do not recognise or accept their responsibility to support their children. The vast majority of non-custodial parents are responsible and supportive of the children, but they are being treated unfairly by the legislation. I like to pride myself on being a good local member, as we all do, dealing with the problems of my constituents and hopefully having some success. Yet, on child support issues, the dominant feeling in my office, and I suspect the offices of each of us, is utter hopelessness. I know that each of us can present various cases and I want to outline a couple now. Take for example the case I have seen recently of a woman with two children. She is not yet divorced but has had the property settlement. She had to pay the husband $75,000 to get the house. She took out a mortgage on the understanding that the husband would pay child support. She is on a single parent pension, and this is a little like the example given by the member for Leichhardt ( Mr Entsch). The husband left his job and purchased a business as a silent partner. He has had all his assets transferred out of his name and he has said that he will never pay child support. The woman has had to seek financial assistance from her parents but her husband is getting away with it because the CSA enforcement team is taking such a long time to investigate the matter. Another case involves a man who must pay $850 per fortnight for three children. He sold some shares and received $28,000. He used the money to pay off the mortgage, which benefited his former wife because she has the home. The CSA have added the proceeds to his annual income. Instead of bdng assessed at $50,000 a year, they added the $28,000 that he got for selling the shares and he has now been assessed at $78,000. This man's average fortnightly net pay is $1,197, less child support, superannuation and private medical insurance and he is left to live on only $167 per fortnight. This man cannot afford to rent, to live or to pay for his car. He lives with his parents. I ask: what chance does he have of establishing a new relationship? I would like to talk about how some of these cases are assessed. A man came to see me once as he was having difficulty with the payment. He had two children and he was paying child support for them. As so often happens, he was quite bitter about the relationship. On an occasion that the children came to visit him, he thought that, considering the amount he money he was paying each fortnight, their clothes were not appropriate-they were torn and so forthso he formally complained about that. The agency then said that as he had complained about it he obviously was not paying enough for the woman to adequately clothe the children so they hit him with a bill for a 'couple of hundred bucks and added $20 a fortnight to what he was paying. Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2457 I know that I could go to every member of parliament and they could all tell me of these sorts of examples. The cases are just unbelievable. I know that many men feel that it is discriminatory against males. When I said I was going to put that in my speech one of my staffers said that I should not because, as they said, the system discriminates against the noncustodial parent rather than the male; it just so happens that many of the cases we see in our offices are men. The tragedy of relationship breakdown is the raw intensity of the bitterness involved. We always think that we are mature enough to handle the emotional aspect of a breakdown in a sophisticated manner but, more likely than not, this never happens. I have enormous sympathy for the innocent parties in a relationship breakdown-the children and the other family members. Grandparents are one such group of innocent people. They are in an impossible position because it is either their son or their daughter that is involved. They are caught in the middle of a raw emotional battle. This has happened in my own family. I know of cases where grandparents are not permitted to see their grandchildren-they are lost in the hostile bitterness between son and daughter-in-law or daughter and son-in-law in the ending of the relationship. Often the grandparents are quite friendly or quite sympathetic to the two warring parties but then they become victims when they are denied access to the grandchildren. There have been cases recently where, in a way, that is now being remedied. But they can get caught up in a legal situation-in an incredible, immensely emotional battle. I do not profess to have all the answers but there are some issues the legislation must recognise, including the formula used to assess contributions. We all say that the amount under the formula is too high, but it has never been addressed. Child support assesses a person's gross income, not their net. Nobody receives a gross income and it should not be used in any assessment. Most non-custodial parents are forced to work overtime to make up the shortfall in their pay at the end of each fortnight. But this increases their assessable income and for so many people it is a catch-22 situation. What is the point of working overtime when your payments are going up all the time? People come and say to me all the time, 'I would be better off just going away somewhere on the dole'. That is happening time and time again. In my view, direct payments made by non-custodial parents to assist in raising their children, such as payments of boarding fees, health fund fees and tuition fees, should all be assessed as part of the child support payment, not in addition to it. Nobody can get blood out of a stone, nor should non-custodial parents be relentlessly squeezed. While the opposition does not oppose this legislation, we do believe a number of amendmentneed to be made. I support what the government is doing. At least it is a move, but it is a very tiny move. This legislation is not going to solve the problems. It is not going to stop the anger, the frustration and the disillusionment out there. It is a move but a very slow move. I agree with what the honourable member for Calare( Mr Andren) said. WhatI would really like to see-I know it is impossible but I would really like to see it-is the removal of party politics from this debate. I would like to see a solution based on some consensus which is fair to both of the parents of the children and, most importantly, to the children themselves. I believe honestly that each of us should be allowed a free vote on this issue. In this way and only this way will we begin to address this problem. It is a problem that we all have in our electorates and we must do something about it. I believe that, for once, on this issue-as 2458 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 on the abortion issue, as on the euthanasia issue, where we found on both sides of politics that we took different points of view; I do not think that on this issue we would, and the divide will not be so great-we should be permitted a free vote. It is not so much about a vote on this legislation. What we have got to do is just to get together sensibly and cut out the party politics, because we are dealing with human lives, we are dealing with kids' lives, we are dealing with emotions. What we have got to do is to sit down as mature adults, come up with some workable solution to what is a problem out there in the community and then cut the party politics out of it, bring it in to this place and pass it on a bipartisan basis. That may be unrealistic or an idealistic dream, but it is the sort of thing we are going to have to do. What really frightens me is that out there in the community there is so much frustration. There is so much bitterness in the people who are coming to my office that I just think, 'What can I do?' When I have not been able to solve their problem they go out of the office with this bitterness built up inside them. UnlessÂ· we address the problem urgently we will have created a generation of bitter, frustrated parents at each others' throats, using their children as pawns in an emotional game. More important, we will have created a generation of bewildered children continually tom between conflicting loyalties. For God's sake let us all get together and do something about this monstrous problem out there in the community. Throsby( Mr Hollis) are very wise words. I believe that in many respects party politics have to be taken out of this. Goodwill, I believe, does exist on both sides of the House. I believe that there needs to be a thorough discussion in the House and a free vote in relation to the matter. We certainly need to get together on it. The issue of child support has received considerable airing in this parliament since I have been here. In fact, I think that it is probably the most talked about issue next to tax. The fact is that the child support system has been under considerable criticism for all of that time. Much of the criticism is, in my view, quite justified because of the division that the activities of the Child Support Agency cause, and the surrounding circumstances involving family law. These things lead to division. These things tear people apart. These things tear people's lives apart. I will make some brief preliminary comments on what has been said already. The member for Chifley( Mr Price) made some comments about the need for a fresh approach. I thoroughly respect the member for Chifley. He Was involved in the previous government's committee on the matter and said some wise words. I am concerned about his comments in relation to the bill-I have not been able to check these comments out-which suggest that the effect of the bill is that there is going to be somewhere between $47 million and $26 million more going into consolidated revenue. I do not know whether that is correct, but I would be concerned if it were. The member for Calare( Mr Andren) made some comments in relation to the tribunal question. I am going to go into that shortly, but let me just tum now to briefly enunciate on a couple of matters that I think have to be addressed by way of preamble. When a marriage has broken down, one thing is absolutely certain: nothing can ever be the same again. The lifestyle that the couple once had together as a couple has henceforth ceased. It does not lie in the mouth of any party to that relationship to say that the lifestyle has to be maintained.",133,Representatives Main Committee
380,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (10.49 A.m.),"The words of the honourable member forThursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2459 It cannot be. It can never be. There is a philosophy, in my view, that has insinuated its way into the child support act, such that it is a lifestyle thing. What people are saying in this debate, and what people are saying about child support, is that it is unfair. If it is not child support, it is unfair. It is about child support and not lifestyle. But there is no doubt at all that this particular act is about lifestyle. Unfortunately, these amendments do not address the key element, and that is whether we are able to make child support really child support. I believe that the golden principle of maintenance of children is that it is the responsibility of parents capable of supporting the needs of the child, or the children. That principle of maintenance, as I say, has been abrogated. That is not to say that the Child Support Agency has not effected some good work in relation to gathering in its net people who did not adhere to orders. But prior to 1989, orders for maintenance were made by the Family Court and the Magistrate's Court and the system worked reasonably well. The problem was in the collection. With the advent of the sole parent pension introduced in the 1970s, unscrupulous use was made of the Australian taxpayer to fund children's maintenance, and parents avoided their obligations to their children. This situation had to be addressed-there is no doubt about that. But, really, instead of rejigging the enforcement structure that already existed in the Magistrate's Court and the Family Court, we have gone to this overarching and overreaching monolith called the Child Support Agency. There is no area of the public service that is growing at a faster rate than the area of the Child Support Agency. It has produced more heartache, more conflict, severed more families, driven more people to suicide, provoked more people to despair, alienated more children from their parents, and provoked more anguish amongst grandparents, than any other area of public service. There are some little-known statistics. I am not one who blindly accepts statistics, but in the course of thinking about this particular matter, I said to one of my staff who had been married for more than 20 years to the one person-and neither of them had been married before-'I believe that you are in a significant minority amongst Australian people. Let us look into it and find out what the statistics are.' I found out that there are fewer than 10 percent of Australian families regarded as traditional. That means that the child support system touches a great mass of people across the country, but this is not realised by the government. It is not sufficiently realised by us all that it touches this great mass of people-grandparents, great-grandparents in some cases. All these people are caught up in this terrible net and the terrible anguish. The statement that we have to look after Australian families does not wash too well with the people who are caught up in this system, which is the vast, overwhelming majority of people. We have to realise that for a start. In devising policies, we have to realise that and to appreciate that that is the case. The bill before the House, while providing some relief, does not go to the heart of the problem. As I said, that is unfairness. Of the many hundreds, if not thousands, of people I have spok-n to about this issue since becoming the member for Dickson, let me tell you about one of the most moving cases I had just recently. A deputy principal of a high school came to see me. He had 20 years experience as a counsellor, a relatively lengthy marriage and three teenage children. You could not find a more loving and caring father. Now he is living in a small flat. The property settlement gave him $15,000 but gave his wife $125,000. He had put $18,000 from his father's estate into their 2460 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 home three years before, and he got $15,000 back-less than what was put in from the estate. He did not even get that back. Apart from the incredible depression of having lost his position as a father and mentor to his children-and nothing is ever the same once you lose that bond-he has to contend with the ravages of the agency. Out of approximately $58,000 a year, he is left with about $250 a week on which to live and to provide entertainment and some sort of lifestyle for the three teenage children. He told me his story and a portion of the conversation was almost indescribable. When I asked him, 'What are you going to do?' he stopped and he could not talk. He physically could not talk-he tried to but he could not move. He was trying to speak, and before my very own eyes he aged 10 years. It was incredible. There were tears in my eyes when I saw it, and afterwards I needed half an hour before the next appointment to get over what this man had gone through. I said, 'I want the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Security to be here to see you, because they do not understand what is happening.' This is what is happening and we are seeing it. We are saying this but we are not getting listened to, I am afraid. office of the member for Throsby probably gets more than some-do not get it as much as others, but we all get some of it. Finally, the man said to me, 'AllI can do is give up being a principal and go back to supply teaching,' because he could not stand it any more. What a loss that is. Let me tell you about one other case. This fellow had worked for the Victorian transport commission for seven years before he was married. He had a seven-year marriage, and there were three children. At the end of that marriage, his wife left and went to Queensland. He tried to see his children. He had had a property settlement, and he had lost his house and his car-it was a house he had before he was married, by the way. He had all of these things taken away, and he finally had to say to his employer, 'I will have to take a redundancy. I cannot afford going backwards and forwards from Victoria to Queensland to see my children.' He came to Queensland, where he has a $2,000 bomb car and is living in a very modest rented home in Keperra in my electorate. The Child Support Agency said, 'Hey, you got a redundancy and it was X amount of dollars. We are going to hit you for 30 per cent of all of the redundancy' -the redundancy from before he was even married. I said to a senior member of the Child Support Agency, 'This is absolute theft. This money belonged to him from before he was married.' Unfortunately, that is an anomaly in the system. How can we possibly stand here in this HQuse and say, 'We have made a few adjustments to it,' when that situation is not addressed. In that particular case, his wife is living in a lovely home, she has a $30,000 car and, he added, 'For good measure, she's had her boobs done.' That is the sort of situation, funny as it sounds, that is absolutely tragic. It is lifestyle and we need to do something about it. I intend to move some amendments to this bill and I want to outline some of these things. But, first of all, I want to talk briefly about why we need amendments. We need amendments to make it fairer and we need to end the farcical review process. I will quote a wonderful passage from a decision of the House of Lords in Scott and Scott in 1913. Lord Shaw said: It is needless to quote authority on this topic from legal, philosophical, or historical writers. It moves Bentham over and over again. 'In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have",136,Representatives Main Committee

Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate. Where there is not publicity, there is no justice.' 'Publicity is the very soul of justice.... It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial.' 'The security of securities is publicity.' But amongst historians the grave and enlightened verdict of Hallam, in which he ranks the publicity of judicial proceedings even higher than the rights of Parliament as a guarantee of public security, is not likely to be forgotten. 'Civil liberty in this kingdom has two direct guarantees; the open administration of justice according to known laws truly interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament, without lot or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. Of these, the firstthat is, having the courts open and having processes affecting people's rights openis by far the most indispensable; nor can the subjects of any State be reckoned to enjoy a real freedom where this condition is not found both in its judicial institutions and in their constant exercise.' of it. The review officers need to have this principle. That is why we do not need reviews. These people are being kept locked up out of the glare of publicity, where some of them, I am told by many constituents, have had terrible things said to them by the review officers. For example, when one fellow said, 'I will have to give up and just go on the dole-I can't stand this,' the response by the review officer was, 'You would do something like that.' This is in the privacy of a little room with a glass partition between the two. You would not be game to say that out in the open, yet those people affect the rights of the people who come before them. Yes, they can go on appeal-yeah, like fun! Pigs might fly. Their rights are affected there and that is the end of it. No-one can afford to go to the Family Court and appeal. support tribunal, which will be established at the magistrates courts all over the country. The tribunal will be cheap and inexpensive. No lawyers will be allowed, save in exceptional circumstances-for example, if a person is illiterate or under a disability or has some language problems-but there is a discretion there. The member for Cal are ( Mr Andren) said something to the effect that we could not have a situation work properly in fox and hounds stuff. But it is amazing what happens when people get together confronting an issue. Frankly, I believe that a lot of that emotion is dissolved in the argument that takes place. The argument and frustration is because you cannot sit down and get it made justiciable. That is the problem. The right to be heard, and the right to be heard in an open forum, is a key to all of this. The tribunal will exercise a discretion. The criteria to depart from such orders will be on the simple basis of the needs of the child and the capacity to pay of both parents. I expect that in most cases this will reflect a much more accurate assessment of child support, rather than the random high-level assessment as at present. No-one at any time that I have ever spoken to about this issue has said, 'I do not want to pay any child support.' Noone has ever said, 'I do not want to pay it. I do not think I should pay it.' They all accept it but they want fairness and equity and they do not want to pay for their ex-partner's lifestyle. They want to get on, as the member for Throsby said, with their own life. They do not want to be paying for the boyfriend or the girlfriend of the ex-partner; they want to get on with their own life and that is what this is all about. We have got to let these people get on with their lives and get away from this lifestyle thing.",138,Representatives Main Committee

And this is an important point. Where it is shown that the applicant has deliberately denied access, the tribunal will have discretion to dispense altogether with administrative assessment. That will, in my belief, get people to adhere to orders of the Family Court properly, instead of the current system where people disobey orders of the court and the poor old person who is the subject of it spends $5,000 to drag them before the Family Court only to have a judge say, 'Well, what do you want me to do? WillI put them in gaol or will I fine them? I probably will not do anything.' A judge actually said that in a case that I am aware of. That is another thing: the Family Court does not have the respect of the community, as the member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) said, because it will not enforce its own orders. This is a subtle way of using the tribunal to do that. . Evidence will be given on oath but the tribunal will have teeth. This applies to the people that the member for Throsby was talking about who through business arrangements are avoiding paying child support. Under my idea, these people will be summoned to appear. Where it is shown by the Child Support Agency that these people are deliberately withholding payment and deliberately avoiding their obligations, they will be summoned to appear, orally examined on oath and they will have to bring forward documents about any company or trust structure. They will be subpoenaed and, if they do not appear, they will be arrested. It will be as simple as that: get them there and make them pay. This is the thing that we have got to do. This will give it teeth. There are people who are avoiding their obligations now. In some circumstances, deliberately wilful failure to pay without lawful excuse will be a contempt of the tribunal with consequences to follow. That may be criticised, but let me say this: we have in our criminal laws now a duty provision. Certainly in Queensland, and I believe at common law, you have a duty as a parent to maintain necessities for the children. It is in the Queensland criminal code and a breach of that duty is a criminal offence. I am not devising anything new whatsoever. I am putting something in here that gives teeth to a duty' which is at common law and at statute law. There are many documented cases of this system going wrong, but let me conclude with an example that was given to me by a chap who lived not quite in my electorate. He wrote to me last year and I telephoned him. He is a prison officer. Six years ago he was in an unfortunate break-up of his marriage; His present wife cannot work; she has children. The father of her child disappeared and pays no child support. Prior to the marriage, she was in receipt of a pension and various benefits. Since the marriage, the pension and benefits have disappeared, his stepdaughter needs urgent orthodontic attention and treatment for scoliosis and he cannot afford private health cover, et cetera. Any costs come out of his pocket. He is a prison officer. He is good at his job; he says he takes pride in his work and is incorruptible. I cannot mention his name or even the prison because of the problems that could arise security-wise. Despite his financial plight, he cannot make his position public because of the security factor. He has got a very stressful job; he works in a prison where there are very hardened criminals. He says he is working 60 to 72 hours a week. He is exhausted, running on empty, having to pay child support for his previous relationship, having to pay for the present child and trying to make ends meet. He is now getting a bill for outstanding arrears. Because he is working harder-working more overtime-he is paying more. He has got a penalty of $3,000 and is working 90 to 95 hours a week. Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2463 On it goes, on it goes-he is at the end of his tether and he has got a heart condition to boot. We need to do something with this to fix it up. (Time expired) Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998. The bill implements the package announced by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) in September last year. It is the second stage of the government's reforms and it builds on the changes made last year to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. The 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues made 163 recommendations, and the chairman of that committee is with us in the Main Committee today. The interim response of the government to that report canvassed 53 of those recommendations and, last year, amendments addressed a further 11. The legislation before us brings the total addressed to 111. This package is based on the principle of parental responsibility, with a preference for private arrangements and with the government acting as a safety net for those unable to access such arrangements. The details of the bill are basically to do with enhancing the parents' capacity to provide financial support. Payers of child support will have more of their income exempted from the CSS formula, and the disregarded income level for carers will be reduced. To tackle the apparent evasion of child support, rental property losses and previously exempt foreign income will be included in the assessable income of non-custodial parents. Furthermore, the registrar of the CSA will be given powers to better assess the declared financial circumstances of par<?nts, in order to ensure calculation in as fair a way as possible. In order to make payments more flexible and to ensure fair and reasonable calculations, certain care arrangements will be taken into account in the calculation process. In terms of parents' rights and responsibilities, the bill provides a number of additional rights and responsibilities for parents, both custodial and non-custodial. Some of these changes include allowing either parent to apply for administrative assessment of child support; and allowing the registrar to suspend payments of child support where the Family Court has been asked to make a decision. Private collection will be encouraged. Child support may continue until the end of the school year or until a child who is still a full-time student turns 18. The bill also includes measures placing a greater onus on parents to notify changes in their circumstances to the CSA. There has been great criticism of the CSA and CSS, criticism which I am sure every member and every senator would be aware of, as there is an unwieldy bureaucracy involved in its operation. This bill will remove retrospectivity in relation to the commencement of a liability; it will enhance payment options for liable parents; and it will allow the registrar to offset debts between parents. That is the basis of the legislation, as we all know. I will now make a few personal observations for five or six minutes and I look forward to enjoying the contribution from my colleague from Western Australia, the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Eoin Cameron). The Child Support Agency is an offshoot of the Australian Taxation Office, as we know. It has about 2,500 employees, public servants, costing the taxpayer in excess of $125 million per year, I understand. It has been attempting, over the past decade, to deal with a very deeprooted community change to do with the changing stability, if you like, of life contracts in marriage or in relationships. Parents are changing their circumstances and therefore the support arrangements for the children of those relationships are becoming increasingly complex in some cases. At the time, some 10 years ago now, the legislation was seen as being to offset,",139,Representatives Main Committee
387,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (11.09 A.m.),"We all understand the background to the Child2464 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 as I understand it, the increasing social welfare bill: parents who had conceived children would accept the maximum possible responsibility for their care, according to their means. But, as ever when the government gets involved in matters of human activity, it is less than perfect. From my experience in my electorate office, I do not think there is an issue which evokes more emotion, difficulty and frustration than this one does. It is a blight on our society that we have not been able to be more successful. I do not blame anyone for that: the previous government made some genuine attempts, and this government has made some genuine attempts, but we have not addressed the issue at anywhere the level that we need to in order to bring about a reasonable acceptance of parental responsibility and the proper balance of the law. I will give you a couple of examples and as I talk about them. I will think of another 10 and so maybe I will pick out another one. This particular example will stay with me forever. I had a chap come into the office, a man in full-time employment, and he told me his story. His daughter had brought a child support scheme action against him, her own father, for the care of her younger sister, his younger daughter. I checked with the minister's office. I could not believe it; I did not think that would be possible. However, after checking with the minister's office, I found that it was true. He told me his story with great dignity and great strength. He told me of his comment to his 19-year-old son when his son endeavoured to understand this: 'We're not worth as much, mate, because you're over the age of 18.' That explained to me the complex nature and the difficult nature of the legislation that we have got ourselves involved in. I have found the issue of the Australian Taxation Office to be less than satisfactory. In these matters where people are in the most difficult circumstances they will ever confront in their lives, a relationship breakdown, we need an organisation with a little more care and a little more compassion. I do not believe the Australian Taxation Office is where this organisation should be. In the two or three minutes I have remaining I want to raise three matters where I think the cause may be advanced, because I do not want to see these amendments as the final chapter in this thing. I do not think they can be. I think we have at least two more stages to go over the next year or two to bring it to some reasonable conclusion. Like all speakers on both sides of this debate, I want to enable people to have some kind of a new life once a relationship breaks down, and the focus of all that is reasonable care for the children. I will offer three points. Firstly, I believe the parliament must look at proper incentives for private arrangements. If we bring children into the world then we have a responsibility to care for them. I guess we have that responsibility to the day we die, but certainly until the child's legal age of 18. Whatever our personal relationships might be with the other parent, we must always respect that. That is the principle we have to bring from the parliament to the people on this issue. We have to bring it home to people who have children that they have that responsibility to make sure they care for their child to the best of their ability. The government has to offer the proper balance and incentives to make sure that they can do that. The government has to ensure that there are incentives for private arrangements for payments to be made for the care of a child when a relationship breaks down. I mention again the 2,500 public servants, the $150 million of taxpayers' money, just to say that parent A should pay parent B. Surely it is better for parent A and parent B, as difficult as that might be, to come to their own arrangements. Hundreds of thousands of Australians Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2465 do that. Therefore, we want incentives for those other hundreds of thousands of Australians who cannot do that to be brought into that net as much as possible. The second point I wish to stress is the imbalance in the equity between the custodial and the non-custodial parent. Many speakers have spoken of that. We cannot have this imbalance between the custodial and the non-custodial parent. We must move to complete fairness. It has to be gender neutral. It is not a matter of female or male. It is a matter of the overall responsibility and fairness. We have to ensure that people can begin their lives and give maximum care to their children. The last point I will make is that it must come back to a reasonable philosophical base. It must come back to what I talked about earlier, about respecting the fact that parents do have that fundamental responsibility. In regard to the responsibility of MPs, I guess that will be never ending and I believe it is totally unsatisfactory -nder our current structure. One particular issue that I would wish to bring to the public mind is that, in regional Australia, it is significantly difficult because the Child Support Agency does not have offices readily available around Australia and, therefore, access to the offices of that organisation is somewhat more difficult. That is just another issue that regional Australia has to contend with. There are a couple of other smaller points. I believe we have the technological ability now to reflect the fortnightly wage, and if we must stick with this gross wage formula we do have the ability not to go on some historical 12-month basis. With computers these days, there should be no trouble reflecting the actual wage of that fortnight. It should not be difficult to do that. These historical arrangements are just so unfair. They only further provoke people and lose greater credibility for our system. I do not wish to go any further. I am sure many other speakers have canvassed the range of issues on this matter. It is terribly difficult, but we have to keep trying. We are a number of years away from the proper answer on this matter. The overwhelming thing that I would like to leave with the Main Committee is that we must allow people to get on with a new life and to give those children the best chance. Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998. I do not think I would be an orphan in this place if I said that child support problems were amongst the most complaints that my office received, and certainly they cause the most headaches. Prior to my election in 1993, I had never before in my life seen so many men breaking down-emotional, nervous and physical wrecks. I think everyone has their particular horror stories to tell. I have too many horror stories to mention in the time that we have this morning. One particular case saddened me greatly and this legislation will go a long way towards sorting it out. Obviously, names cannot be mentioned. A gentleman's marriage broke down. He had two young children. His wife moved with the young children to be closer to her immediate family in the eastern states. Because of work situations, he had to remain in Western Australia where he had a job. As a result of some of the treatment meted out to him, he was working extraordinary hours to the stage that he was a mental and physical wreck. The only times he got to see his two young children were when he would fly them to Western Australia twice a year to spend a week with him each time. Because of his financial circumstances, he would try to get the best air fare imaginable. By booking with the airlines well ahead, he would manage to get a cheap deal. For three consecutive years-that is, six consecutive trips-the day before the children",141,Representatives Main Committee
388,Mr Eoin Cameron (Stirling) (11.21 A.m.),"I welcome the introduction of this Child2466 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 were due to board the plane in the eastern states to fly to Perth, his wife would call and say, 'So and so has got a cold and cannot fly.' This would mean that he had to rebook. The child, of course, would have a miraculous recovery the next day. He would have to rebook and pay the full fair. It was j!lst sheer spite. Stories like that are legend. I think so many of my colleagues can tell stories like that. The fact that the wife had remarried and was a millionaire was beside the point. She was just meting out all kinds of vicious treatment when she could. When Benjamin Franklin said the two certain things in life were death and taxes, he obviously did not foresee the Child Support Agency and the associated problems there. Unfortunately, we will never have adequate legislation in the eyes of those affected by the child support act. Either way, one party will always be in dispute with the other and I do not have enough feet and hands to count the number of allegations that have come into my office of former partners evading tax, hiding income, ripping off Social Security and t-e like. Nevertheless, while this act will never be amended to the satisfaction of everyone, it can be improved, and I am confident that the changes proposed to this legislation do go some of the way towards fixing the child support act. The important principle highlighted by this bill is that the parents hold primary responsibility for the financial support of their children, and it is high time all parents adhered to this principle. Children come into this world, more often than not, from a loving partnership. Too often, that partnership dissolves and too many parents do their utmost to avoid contributing to the upbringing of their children. In the House the other day I spoke about domestic violence and mentioned that children learned from their parents. It is such a shame that many children learn these days that it is easy to divorce, that it is worthwhile fighting over evading responsibility for the upkeep of dependants. One aspect of this legislation I particularly support is that the minimum child support liability for all payers should be $5 per week, including for those receiving income support. I wholeheartedly agree with that particular policy for it is a sign to parents that they cannot evade their responsibilities altogether. It reinforces the principle that parents should share in the cost of supporting their children, and there is nothing wrong with the notion that parents accept responsibility for their children. I do get extremely cheesed off when people threaten to quit their job and go. on the dole so that they do not have to carry out the responsibility of providing for the upkeep of their offspring. By taking a token sum from the social security payments of parents, it reinforces the principle that both parents are responsible for the upkeep of their children, irrespective of their source of income. A further pleasing aspect of this legislation is that it allows parents to move, by agreement, from Child Support Agency collection to private collection. I have had parents come and see me seeking this option. If parents can take on that responsibility, they should be allowed to do so. Furthermore, the registrar can also require parents to move to private collection if it is considered that regular payments will continue-and that, indeed, is a welcome sign. The less government intrusion into the lives of Australians the better. The Child Support Agency will still provide parents with a service to determine the amount payable and to register parents' agreements and court orders. The bill also recognises the difficulties for some paying parents in maintaining their own life, notwithstanding the responsibility to their children. Paying parents still have a right to a reasonably normal life, and to have another relationship and family if they so choose. This legislation makes amendments to better recognise the capacity of parents to pay, which is, of Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2467 course, a source of numerous complaints to my office and, I am sure, the offices of my colleagues. I am pleased to support the legislation. It meets with the satisfaction of a number of my constituents who have contacted me since the changes were announced-in fact, they were delighted with the proposals. I must say this is not the end of the government's changes to child support. I welcome the fact that a task force of government members will be established to examine further proposed changes to the child support scheme. I commend the bill to the House and look forward to fewer complaints about the child support scheme. on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 for two reasons. One is that there has been some confusion arising from the speakers list, as you would be aware from your position on the speakers list. The other is the opportunity, particularly after the address to the House by the member for Throsby( Mr Hollis), which I thought was extremely well balanced, to speak on this issue that confronts us. He suggested, and I had discussed this previously with the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith), that we have here an issue, about which there is a legion of evidence, of how the system, as it was originally proposed, is not working. The member for Throsby made the point that there should be a bipartisan approach to address all the problems in a fair and equitable way. In my view, that is a matter that we should deal with very seriously. I think it is something that the parliament should try to do more frequently. In Western Australia, the people there found themselves confronted with an unacceptable law on abortion. There has been quite magnificent debate on it. I am not nominating where I might stand in that debate. All the feedback I have from state members of parliament is that a huge social issue is being addressed by a conscience, as we call it, and that the level of debate has been excellent. Nobody has been saying, 'It was all your fault.' Nobody has been trying to score points. They recognise it as a great social issue. Huge courage has been demonstrated by a large number of people who, under substantial pressure, are taking their responsibility as a member of parliament and setting out to address the issues. This is another one of those sorts of circumstances. I think it would be better the sooner we and our leaders got together and said, 'Let's treat this in a bipartisan fashion, if not a conscience fashion, and let's get a common position to address the difficulties.' You cannot put percentages of somebody's salary down as a means of addressing the amount of money needed to look after children. That is just plainly silly. It will not work and it should stop. That, to me, is a fundamental. It is going to be extremely difficult legislation simply because, when a marriage breaks down, people want to tum to the law to punish the other member of the family, and both sides try to do it. That is a tragedy. I have been close enough in a family situation-not personally; I celebrated my 40th wedding anniversary the other dayin their extended family, they have to confront as a family the issue of marriage breakdown. You have one partner telling you, 'Never talk to that so-and-so again,' and the reverse discussion in another family. We will never legislate that sort of emotion out. It is just another reason why we need sensible legislation that recognises these facts and does its best to find solutions. I can tell you that, while formulas might be fine in science, they are certainly not suitable for social issues. Unfortunately, we handed it to, of all people, the Australian Taxation",143,Representatives Main Committee

390,Mr Wakelin,Congratulations.,145,Representatives Main Commitiee
391,Mr Tuckey,"Thank you very much. The realities are that in everybody's family, and2468 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 Office, who are all about formulas, tables and a very impersonal and penalising approach to life-'If you don't do it, I'll tax you; I'll apply a penalty.' A constituent of mine the other day sent a letter he got on to me. The letter points out that this person got into arrears with obligations under the Child Support Agency and was immediately taxed 17 per cent. That was not as a charge against the amount but as a continuing amount. That same person is under a garnishee order and his employer sent me the garnishee order. It is the most insulting document that anybody could ever receive. The employer is not in dispute with the employee's spouse. The employer just happened to give a job to someone who has this problem. If you read the letter you would think the employer was a crook. He is threatened with 12 months gaol if he does not comply with the order, when it would strike me that a letter asking him to assist the government would have been a nicer \yay to put it. Again, it is all this confrontationist type of approach to a very sensitive issue. It is silly. I think that, of all the people we could have given the job to, in terms of sensitivity the tax office was probably the last one that should have been chosen. Personally, I think they need to be further down the chain. We have a thing called the Family Court. We are appointing judges to that court who, hopefully, understand the difficulties of these things. Quite frequently, I am not sure that people involved in the system have that view. It is an amazing thing-and this might be attacked by some-but we are told each day there is equality between the sexes. I wbuld like to contribute to that view. We cannot suddenly go to a point in time and say that it does not exist when it comes to looking after children; that no man has any special qualifications to do that when, of course, there is ample evidence they do. In our extended family, I can identify a family with a wife who is a highly paid professional and her husband, from day one, has stayed home and looked after the kids. He does an excellent job of it and that is their choice. Why is it that, when people go before the Family Court, there is an immediate decision that the supporting parent wiIl, in nearly all cases, be the wife and that the male will therefore be subject to having money taken from their wages by government to support that situation? The logical argument would have been for the court to say, 'Okay; you are both here'-although I know that in some cases they are not both there: someone has bolted and that creates other difficulties. It is not all simplistic. In these circumstances why cannot the court first ask, 'Who has the financial resources to look after these children?' and custody be granted accordingly? If that is not satisfactory to the person who has the financial resources, or there is evidence that that would be inappropriate, you go to step two. But in so many cases I think it would be appropriate. That is why we have courts, to determine when it is appropriate-but at the moment that is not considered. They are all issues, from my point of view, that we as a parliament have an obligation to resolve. As is typical in so many of these cases, once we get into the parliamentary scene we are confronted with party politics and we always get a second-best solution. The member for Throsby is the person who stood up in here, to his great credit, and said, 'Isn't this an issue on which we should all get together?' We might be astounded at the outcome that collectively we could achieve. We have got the evidence, as members of parliament, because the people have come to our offices. We know it is not as simple as to say that the blokes have had all the problems. We know it is not as simple as that. But the reality is that collectively we have gained a great deal of experience. Surely, then, we could Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2469 get together, go back to the Family Law Act and write something that is proper, fair, and above all, addresses the needs of the children-not the supporting dad or the supporting mum, but the children. Let us be a little bit broader in our approach and find out why it is that the people more likely to escape the measures of the child support legislation are those who do not admit who the parents are. It is pretty easy to establish who the mother is, but it is not so easy to establish who the father is. I will give another example: the young daughter of an employer of mine had twins. I asked, 'What are you going to do about the father?' The reply was, 'We don't want to know about him.' Why? Not only because that person might have some access to the children but because it complicated their access to welfare. What is the difference? It almost raises the question, 'Are you so silly as to sign a contract called marriage?' because it makes you so easily identifiable. But it is just another issue. Clearly, on the grounds of equity, if you have got some rules relating to the protection of children and their upkeep, all parties that father children should have a similar responsibility. It should not relate simply to those who have made the process for the Child Support Agency relatively simple by having got married. All these issues are before us. I think we understand them. I would hope that we, in our party room, can convince our leaders that it is time to sit down. We do not want a committee such as was formed just the other day in our party room of Liberals and coalition people, to address this issue. We want a committee of the parliament. That need not be select or standing, and I do not know that we want to go into all the formalities of taking evidence. We know what the problem is. What we want is a group of people to sit down with goodwill and sort out a piece of legislation that works. I repeat that that must start with the Family Law Act. The means by which we pursue those who refuse to meet their financial contribution is the secondary issue. That is easy; it is probably a role for the tax office, collecting the money as determined by others, but certainly not by a formula. I was in the hotel business for all of my younger life under the old rules relating to maintenance, as we knew it. The further north you went in Western Australia-and I suppose on the east coast-the more maintenance dodgers you had on your staff. I would like a small contribution to my campaign funds for every time that I found myself going up to the court as the employer, paying money on behalf of, and in advance, for a staff member to keep that person out of jail. That is where such people used to go, and the maintenance used to tick up while they were there. We set out to address that gross inequity-a very stupid way to address the matter-and we rewrote the Family Law Act. And what did we say in it? We said that welfare should fill the gap. Of course it should not. Of course people have a responsibility. But having got the changes, we then went about setting up a collection process which is just patently wrong and unfair, and everybody knows it. I now see that there are many people on the speakers list who are wishing to continue with the debate. Probably, I should have spoken for fewer minutes, but having joined the debate, I wanted to demonstrate that I understand the problems. I make that appeal and I hope that the member representing the opposition here in this chamber today, the member for Bruce( Mr Griffin) will be joining with Mr Hollis and going off and saying to his leader, 'Let us get together on this thing. Nobody needs to win the next election on this issue. We should get 2470 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 together and come out of it with a fair and equitable arrangement for all Australians, but most particularly for the children involved.'. sincere thanks to the member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey). It was a difficult time there for the Chair and Mr Tuckey stepped into the breach very well. I do not think that he spoke for too long at all and the points that he made were very well received and pertinent to the difficulties that we face with the Child Support Agency and the legislation. I rise today to speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 and I would like to deal with some background on how this legislation came about. The foundations of the child support scheme are found in four separate statutes: the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Family Law Act 1975. So there are four statutes, and the fact that there is this level of complexity within the legislation certainly does contribute to some of the difficulties encountered. Let me say at the outset that this is one of the most contentious matters that comes into my electorate office. And every member who has spoken here today, and previously, has highlighted the fact that this is one of the most difficult constituent problems that comes into an office. I would like to thank the Child Support Agency in Townsville. We do not have a Child Support Agency in Mackay, but we certainly have one in Townsville and the officers there lend support to my electorate officers to a great extent. I do want to make it clear that criticisms of the inherent difficulties in the acts, and so on, do not apply to the staff of the Child Support Agency. Many of them work long hours under difficult conditions with what is a highly emotionally charged issue. I would also like to register the work that our electorate staff do. In my office the staff encounter many heart-rending situations. They offer assistance above and beyond the call of duty of an electorate officer, I think. I would like to move on now to some of the changes that are contained in this bill. The reforms are based on the principle that children are the financial responsibility of their parents and that government should not seek to intrude unnecessarily into people's lives. Government involvement should, however, provide a safety net to ensure that children of separated parents are adequately supported and that the general community is not asked to carry an undue burden. We are all aware that non-custodial parents, by and large, want to maintain a relationship with their children. They want to assist in supporting those children. Goodwill can and should prevail. This is a very difficult issue because we have brought into it, I believe, legislation that is unnecessarily harsh in many instances. In a situation where we should be working towards goodwill between both parents for the sake of children, the harsh regime in the legislation which does not take account of many facets of the custodial or non-custodial parents' lives adds rancour to the whole debate and to the situation that separated parents face. I will go through some of the measures in the package proposed in this bill. There is a change to the calculation of the child support liability payments, recognising that some payers do not have sufficient means to support themselves and their second families. There is additional assistance to man}' thousands of children by introducing a minimum payment of child support and by including a wider range of income when assessing child support liability.",145,Representatives Main Commitiee
392,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson) (11.42 A.m.),"I would like to commence by giving myThursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2471 One of the difficulties that we face is that while some non-custodial parents are left in a very difficult financial situation after taxation and the payment of child support, there is another group of custodial parents who receive no child support payment whatever. They make up, I understand, about 40 per cent of custodial parents. So there are difficulties for both a particular group of non-custodial parents and a particular group of custodial parents. The measures in this bill are directed to both custodial parents-I prefer the term 'residential for that the Attorney-General has wisely brought in the term 'non-residential parents'. Custodial implies an ownership of the children, which is certainly not the case. Nobody owns children, but everyone loves their children, and I think the terms residential and non-residential are far more applicable to the real feelings of the parents in these cases. For the residential parent, and particularly that 40 per cent who receive no payment, the bill introduces a minimum payment of $260 a year. This translates to about $5 a week. I have to say that at the meetings where I have spoken this minimum payment has been well received. Unfortunately, there is a group who have opted either to become permanent students or to go on unemployment benefits to avoid their obligations. The recognition must be there that each parent has an obligation and a responsibility to their children. No matter how modest that financial support might be, the obligation is there and the community expects that both parents will make a contribution, no matter how modest. This $260 payment has been welcomed. The other thing that we have done in the bill for residential parents is to broaden the income base. Net rental property losses and exempt foreign income will be added back to the parent's taxable income used to determine the child support liability. This, again, is a move that has been long overdue. Regrettably, there are some non-custodial parents who do avoid their responsibilities. It is far easier for those perhaps self-employed to be able to use, as I have seen, some imaginative schemes to lessen their taxable income and hence avoid child support payments. We all respect the parent who makes a contribution and we agree that there need to be changes to the formula. But it is wrong, and I am sure every right thinking person would agree, that somebody is able to totally escape responsibility for their children. So broadening the income base, I believe, is aÂ· sound measure. For residential parents, there is another measure as well, addressing family violence and the issues concerned with that. The Child Support Agency will introduce case management to assist parents at risk of family violence to commence or continue child support collection wherever possible and will amend the legislation to allow for parents to end assessment or collection where family violence is proved. I will move on now to non-residential parents. What we are doing with non-residential parents and their concerns is to increase the exempt income-the self-support component of payer income. This is the amount that is allowed to be deducted from the income to allow for living expenses. That is going to be increased by 10 per cent such that the self-support component for a single non-residential parent will increase from $9,006 to $9,907 a year. As well as that, there are other measures for non-residential parents: there is a lower payee's disregard and an allowance for child-care costs as well. The residentirj parent who is in the work force could previously earn up to $37,424, also taking into account child-care add-on costs, and not have that taken into account when the child support payment was calculated for the non-residential parent.",148,Representatives Main Committee
393,Parents' Used By Attorney,"General( Mr Williams)-and also to non-custodial parents-and2472 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 This, as we have seen from various cases mentioned today, has been most unjust. It can well be that the residential parent goes on to a career where there is an excellent income or, as the case may be, takes on part-time work, again, where there is an excellent income. The non-residential parent who may have a modest income is left in a very difficult financial situation. There is a difference in the quality of living for those two groups-the residential and non-residential parent. It is very important that the financial situation of the residential parent be taken into account as it is in here. That disregarded income threshold is going to drop, as I said, from $37,424 to $29,598 with no fixed child-care add-ons but there is an ability for re-assessment where there are high child-care costs. This is a much fairer reflection, I think, of the circumstances of both the non-residential and residential parent. There are a number of other changes which I will not go into at this point in time. WhatI will do is give an overview of the number of families that are going to be affected by these changes. For the residential parent, with the change to a minimum payment of $260 and broadening of the income base, it seems likely there will be 175,000 families who will receive more child support. There will also be 9,000 families who will receive less family payment. For the changes relating to non-residential parents-the increase in the exempt income and the lower disregarded income amount-we are looking at 300,000 non-residential parents paying less child support and 15,000 families getting more family payment. These substantial changes are going to be reflected in a great number of families across the nation. I would like to speak about some of the cases that come before my office. We have all heard today of the tragic situations at both ends of the spectrum for residential and non-residential. I do not wish to dwell on it unduly because I know the same situation is coming to every electorate office but I feel I would be lacking in my duty to my constituents if I did not mention some of the more difficult cases that have come to our office and some cases where I believe the Child Support Agency has been overly zealous. One, in particular, concerns a father-a non-residential parent-who took a job after the Family Court removed most of his property, regrettably. He took a job with his mother and father on a farm. He had not worked on the farm for many years-he had been employed in another capacity-but, following an injury, he was unable to continue working in that capacity so he went back to farm work, which he had not been doing for many years. As a result of the changed circumstances, his older brother had far more experience with farm machinery and was undertaking a far more responsible role on the farm with regard to machinery, but he himself was working largely as a labourer. Naturally enough, there was a difference in the amount the parents were financially able to pay both of them. It was quite a difficulty for them to take the second son in on the farm, but they did so because he needed somewhere to live. However, the Child Support Agency did not accept that two brothers working on the farm could have different incomes, and they rang up to interview the older brother with the higher income. They interviewed his wife-and I consider this most inappropriate-and said that they would ascertain that both brothers were going to earn the same income. Whether the brothers did or did not in fact do so, the CSA were going to take it that both brothers earned the same income, regardless of the type of work they were doing on the farm; and this was in fact how they did assess the child support payments. I consider that most unjust. I also believe that it Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2473 is inappropriate for the Child Support Agency to interview other parties in trying to determine what the level of income is. I could mention another case, again dealing with a non-residential parent. We have a lot of seasonal work in our area and, during the sugar cane crush, wages are high. That means of course that for non-residential parents the child support payments are at an equally high level, reflecting that higher income. However, when the crush finishes, the seasonal work ceases, and many of the non-residential parents fall down to a very low income during the maintenance period in the mills. I had a non-residential parent who literally could not live come into my office. He could not get his review through quickly enough to take account of his changed income and was destitute. He was living with a friend in a flat underneath the house. He was borrowing to pay bills and buy food and was in a very difficult situation. We were able, with the help of the Townsville office, to rush through another review of that case, but it certainly left him in a very difficult situation. Moving on to the case of a residential parent, as I have said, 40 per cent of residential parents receive no payment. I do know of a case where a residential parent who was regrettably in very poor health received no payment at all, despite the fact that the non-residential parent was a well-to-do businessman with three successful businesses. The family was living in a condemned house. Because a re-assessment was made, the residential parent, the mother, had to repay some money to the Child Support Agency. For that and a variety of other reasons that I will not go into but that were associated with her illness, she was in the situation at one stage where, again, there was no money for food for the children. She rang our office in desperation, and we were able to get her some assistance from one of the charities with regard to food. I visited her home, and there was no doubt that that little family was in a very difficult situation. There are sad and tragic circumstances on both sides of this very vexing question. I would like to recommend to the House the changes we see before us in the bill. There is no doubt that they need to go further, and the government is looking at an additional group of measures to address some of these very sad situations that come into our offices, right across Australia. I would welcome a third tranche of changes. I do believe that we need to address the question of the exempt income amount and see that raised. I certainly believe there needs to be more accountability for the way in which child support payments are spent, so as to ensure that in fact they are spent on the immediate needs of the children and their long-term welfare. There are a number of amendments that have been foreshadowed as coming before the House and some of those are worthy of consideration. The proposed amendments of the honourable member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith) contain a great number of good measures in them. I have looked at those that are proposed by the opposition. I think that the one involving the assessment of fringe benefits for a non-residential parent would impose a great burden on small businesses. They already find the burden of paperwork quite a task and that proposal would add a considerable burden to small business. Certainly, some of the others have merit. I am aware that the backbench task force on child support will be looking very closely at the proposals put forward that have merit. One of those proposals is the one to have more accountability in the way in which additional measures such as the payment of school fees is taken into account in child support payments. Some of the 2474 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 amendments have merit and should be looked at further. Others, unfortunately, will just be too cumbersome to implement. The bill is a significant step along the way towards achieving fairness and some reconCiliation between parents caught in the difficulties of family breakdown. I certainly hope that it will assist in focusing attention on the most important aspect of family breakdown, the welfare of the children. I commend the bill to the House. Legislation Amendment Bill 1998, and I would like to say that it is with great pleasure I do so. However, the unfortunate thing about lifestyle is that g0vernment has to get involved in making regulations. In the early days it interfered, perhaps wrongly, perhaps rightly, and took steps to correct the effects of the breakdown in a marriage, the support provided to ex-spouses and the support provided to their children. One thing that life should be about, and particularly where children are involved in marriage failure, is a thing called equity and fairness. On a regular basis my office seems to become a war office as parents, both custodial and non-custodial, come in and put forward their case in pain, and sometimes with children in tow. The way that this affects my staff and myself, after listening to some of the horror stories that go on from both sides of the argument, is unsettling. I understand that agencies have trained people in these areas, but unfortunately neither I nor my staff are trained in dealing with these matters; all we can do is listen and offer a soft heart. From the outset I would like to say thank you to people such as Barry Williams from the Lone Fathers Association and the former president of the Lone Fathers Association of Newcastle, Richard Filewood, for the work that they have done in briefing me, in assisting me, and in providing support for some of the non-custodial parents. There is a misnomer in their name of Lone Fathers Association; it should be 'Lone Parents Association' as quite regularly I am visited in my office by women who are also non-custodial parents and who are facing exactly the same trials and tribulations and emotional breakdowns as lone fathers do because of the way that acts are administered. This legislation is the second tranche of what should be a never ending effort to bring about an easier legislative framework, an easier structure, that removes some of the spitefulness and vindictiveness of partners in addressing the situation. One thing that I have always be-ieved in is that children should be supported by both parents. I do not think that any parent should be able to avoid contributing towards the care of their child or children. For that reason I see the $260 minimum payment as something about ownership of children. One of the things that we do not seem to take into consideration when parents get divorced is the fact that it is the parents who are getting divorced, not the children from their parentll. The children still have an emotional involvement, an attachment to both parents. But very often we see an attempt by the custodial parent to have their children divorce the non-custodial parent. By having a minimum contribution of $5 a week it puts a sense of balance and ownership in it, albeit that $5 a week does not buy much these days. Also importantly, I see that, with the broadening of the income base, for people who were in a position where they were able to reduce their income through investing in net property losses or foreign exempt income, this figure will be added back for the assessment basis. As I said, it is all about equality. On their many visits to talk to me, one of the things that Barry Williams and Richard Filewood pointed out was that they were not interested in supporting",149,Representatives Main Committee
394,Mr Bob Baldwin (Paterson) (12.02 P.m.),"I rise to speak to the Child SupportThursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2475 anyone who was not prepared to support their own children. That is a very simple message. This is not an organisation that wants to pay nothing, that wants to have no responsibility. It is an organisation, first and foremost, committed to the care and upbringing of their own children. They are not interested in walking away from their children or their responsibilities. For that, they are to be commended. There are other aspects of the bill that address family violence. I want to come to those later. For the payers of child support, there are some very well received and welcomed changes in there, albeit they are considered not to go far enough. One is the increase in the exempt income. Whilst it is only by 10 per cent at this point, from $9,006 to $9,907 for the 1997-98 self-support year, at least it is a'step somewhere. We have to start somewhere. To make sudden change perhaps would not bring about fairness and equity. But we have got to get the train moving in the correct direction so that we can pick up all of the passengers on the way through and take them along with us in bringing about some equity. The other thing that is critically important in here is the deduction of 50 per cent child support paid from family payment incomes, where payers with second families will now be able to claim 50 per cent of any child support paid as a deduction from household income used for determining a family's entitlement to family payment and child-care assistance. One thing that really concerned me was the difference between the Department of Social Security and the Child Support Agency. What we would see there is that the Child Support Agency would deem a child to be dependent and then get into an opposing mode to that with Centrelink, as it is now called. I think that needed to be addressed. To show that I have an understanding on how detailed some of these cases are that come to us, I would like to refer to a couple of the situations that have been brought to my attention. One chap from Motto Farm and others from Thornton-and I do not wish to use their names-talked about the child support for a child by a previous marriage. When it is reviewed, when another child is born in the second marriage, the equation rate for that second child is 20 per cent. If we talk about equity and fairness-and yes, we have responsibility-why should there be a different value placed upon a child in a second marriage as opposed to the children from the first marriage? What we are doing is carrying through legislation-which is not contained here, but is existing-that actually discriminates between children. It costs no less to raise a child in one household or another. I think that should be addressed. I do not think the situation stands up to much credit when you are trying to instil some faith and hope in children, when you have to say no to one child and yes to the other child because the child is from the former relationship and is able to access income to carry out what they want to do. Another interesting case brought to me by a few families in my electorate is where same-sex partners, lesbians or gays, are not assessed as having a combined income where the custodial parent is living and partnering in a same-sex situation. Only the income of that parent is taken into consideration. The child support paying parent is therefore placed at a greater disadvantage. If we talk about equity through the whole of our society, it should carry through. We do recognise the rights of all people in Australia, and the rights of the paying non-custodial parent should also be fairly recognised. Another example was where the children who belonged to the second partner were not taken into consideration for review as being dependent on the paying parent. Centrelink will. 2476 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 However, even with a court order clearly announcing that the stepfather is the custodial parent, the Child Support Agency cannot accept this as evidence that the child is dependent. The inequity between the definitions of a child's support value by the Child Support Agency and Centrelink is something that concerns us very much. The paying parent will be paying three to four times more child support than that paid by Centrelink when the paying parent goes on newstart allowance. ' Perhaps someone can explain to me where fairness, equity and incentive go when we have non-custodial parents who have had good jobs and good incomes driven tp a point where they are no longer financially able to support themselves or to provide any semblance of Ii lifestyle. Even when they take their children back with them for a holiday or a visitation, they can do absolutely nothing with them, and so it becomes a game of dollars. The custodial parents who are getting the relief have the money to be able to provide the niceties of life, but unfortunately. the non-custodial parents who have got into this position by themselves-let us be honest about it: nobody other than someone' who.is in the relationship causes it to breakdown-are left.being unable to support themselves. Along collie the children for the weekend, for a week's holiday or for the whole school period, and the non-custodial parents are not able to provide the support for themÂ· because they get no reliefat all from the payment during that period. We often see people giving up. The greatest sadness I see in the Australian lifestyle is when people give up, when they lose the will. They give up in a variety of ways. They throw the job in because they say, 'I cannot afford to live on the $30, $40 or $60 a week that is left, and I am better off going on the dole.' So all of a sudden we have taken ,one person out of the work force, and we have put them on unemployment benefits. What is even sadder-and it has happened on many occasions in my electorate-'-is where people commit suicide. They are driven to that point not just on the economic basis but also on the basis of the mental torture. Whilst it is very hard to prove at times, the scenario and the threats seem to go like this: 'If you don't keep up the payment or if you don't do as I say, I am going to get an apprehended violence order against you because I feel under threat from you. I feel that you have been stalking me.' This goes on and on. The second situation is where there are allegations of sexual abuse having been committed against the children. All of a sudden this is the way of stopping the non-custodial parent from having access to the child. This is not the Australian society that I would like to continue to live in, where we can playoff through the courts the emotions of parents for selfish benefit. But by the same token, I am not taking a one-sided view on this. Quite often examples are brought to the attention of my office where these supporting custodial parents, whether they be male or female, are struggling to support the children whilst the non-custodial parents claim they have a very low level of income, yet still manage to drive around in the flash car and to have the flash life and a lot of money to spend, whether it is obtained through the black market economy, through black cash or from ways of minimising income. That is why I said that the part of the bill which addresses the net losses on real estate or foreign exempt income goes a way towards that. ' Equity needs to prevail in the10ng term. We need to make sure that people do support their children and that they support them properly. Legislation needs to be evolving and to continue along in that direction. It also needs the support and input from community groups like the Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2477 Lone Fathers Association, to mention just one. The reason I mention them is that they have been the most progressive in coming to me with information and support. I understand there are also amendments about to be tabled before the House by the opposition. On the surface, one could perhaps believe that this was the right direction in which to go. But I sit and think back to those colourful days of 1994 and the report into the child support scheme, otherwise known as the Price report. The print had barely had time to go dry in the book before the report was rejected in total and out of hand by the former government. They did not want to know about it, they did not want to debate it, they did not want to discuss it and, more importantly, they did not want to implement it. There are some things in that report which go well and truly over the top, but there is some very strong core stuff in there that needs to be implemented. A lot of that has been introduced in the first tranche legislation, now the second tranche, and will continue to be worked on. The report is too valuable to be put down. I understand that some 180,000 calls were received on a hotline from people wanting to express their concerns. That is a large percentage of people in Australia. It is not something that can be ignored. Let us say we have a pie chart that shows the people affected by this legislation. In other situations, we would normally find that 90 per cent of the people represented by the chart are happy to go along with whatever, that three or four per cent will be a bit concerned and that one or two per cent will make a lot of noise. However, in this situation with this legislationand this is must be considered-we have large numbers of non-custodial parents and custodial parents demanding that there be change, change that was ignored by the opposition. The opposition walked away from it, despite the immense cost of the committee's inquiry. Some of the amendments that the opposition is looking at putting down have not been thought out. They have not eVICn been properly drafted or prepared. The one on fringe benefits, as we understand it, will have an imposition on small business that is unconscionable and unfair. But then again the opposition has walked away from impositions on small business, to such an extent that when this government came to power we had to work through ways of cutting the red tape to make things fair and equitable. I do not believe there can ever be a perfect solution, and at least I am honest enough to say that. When I go to the meetings for the Lone Fathers Association in the Hunter and see the hundreds and hundreds of people in the hall, and lined up outside, because there is not enough room inside, it sends a very clear message to me that this is a serious problem. This is a problem that takes away self-esteem. It is a problem that takes away the pride of people. It is a problem that takes away lives. When you have that situation occurring a responsible government reacts and does something, and this government has done that. We have introduced legislation which will work and will go a long way towards helping. This legislation is fair and equitable because this government has a plan. It has a plan to fully explore all of the options in the Price report. Indeed, a task force specifically focused on looking at further amendments has been set up to make sure that we listen and that we act on those things that people demand us to in the interests of fairness and equity. I have said enough on this occasion but I intend to speak again and again as this legislation evolves and develops into bringing about what is right for all Australians. Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 I do not wish to indulge in generalities and macro concepts, which seem to be the hallmark of Canberra. The reason that Canberra so often uses",152,Representatives Main Committee
395,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (12.18 P.m.),"On rising to speak in the debate on the Child2478 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 acronyms-little series of letters to describe everything-and so often speaks in generalities is because Canberra is cut off from specific realities. People talk about a general principle but they do not talk about the individual and what is happening out there. I wish to refer specifically to two cases, which I have referred to beforein this House, because I think they are very illustrative of what the problem is that should be addressed. The point I make is that, whilst the changes that are being made here are quite good, they fall far short of coming to grips with this problem. . When the committee chaired by the member for Chifley( Mr Price) brought down its report in this place, I did not think that the recommendations of that report came to grips at all with the problem. I was bitterly disappointed that not only did the report itself not come to grips with the problem but, worse still, the legislation fell far short of the report. There was virtually no movement at all. When this matter was debated last time, one of the members from Queensland, the member for Fisher( Mr Slipper), compared the number of complaints made about the Child Support Agency with the number of complaints made about Telstra. I think there was a 10 to one ratio in favour of the Child Support Agency, which was bad enough in itself, but when one considered that Telstra had some 20 million subscribers and the Child Support Agency had only 200,000 clients, the number became quite horrific. Most of the members that spoke then on the bIll said something like 30 per cent to 40 per cent of all of their time was taken up with Child Support Agency problems. I doubt whether there would be too many members in here that deserve their pay who would not have had some very heart breaking cases flow through their office. Let me give you two cases from my electorate. I will be very specific about them. I am quoting from when I presented these the last time in the House. The pay slip is dated the fortnight ended 4 September 1994. The employer is Mount Isa Mines Limited and Mount Isa Mines Operations. I have whited out the name and pay number of the employee. His classification is diesel fitter. His income tax payable for the fortnight to which his pay slip refers is $301. His child support payment is $267. His phone calls are $4, his superannuation is $37, his 'guardset'-whatever that is-is 50c, his National Mutual deductions are $32, his union fees are $8, his ambulance payment is $2.60. The rest of his pay, which is $240, goes into a savings account with the Queensland Country Credit Union. His income for that fortnight was a gross of $1,266, which was quite a reasonable income. His total deductions were $893. That left him with a disposable income of $613 for the fortnight, which is $307 a week. He has health fund payments for medical benefits of $17 and that covers his kids as well as himself. He has tried to keep them going because he wants to look after his kids and see that they have medical benefits available. His wife left Mount Isa and went to live on the coast at a place in the region of Maryborough-Hervey Bay, which is about 1,600 road kilometres from Mount Isa. If he sees his kids twice a year, he has to save $54 a week in order to go down there, stay there and come back. I am not including there his loss of pay for the time he is away. Presumably he does that in his holidays. This is a pretty reasonable figure. Like most people who have come into my office, and I suspect everybody's office, he, has legal debts hanging over from his divorce. He is paying $44 on a weekly basis because he borrowed money to pay the legal debts. Those three deductions-travelling to see his children, repayments of his legal debts for the divorce and Thursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMIITEE 2479 his health fund payments-total $115 a week. This leaves him with $182 a week to live off in Mount Isa. That is an average case coming in from Mount Isa. To try to stay alive in Mount Isa on $182 a week most certainly is a challenge. Let me just point out two small factors with respect to Mount Isa. The ground temperatures during summer are over 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The houses are alway built now around air conditioning. You have to keep an airconditioner going to live in those houses. If you do not, the temperatures inside can soar over 200 degrees Fahrenheit, because the heat is locked in and there are very few windows because the house is built for air conditioning and not for the flow of air. He has an expense there that other people in Australia really do not have to meet. Everything has to be taken to Mount Isa, so there is a cost of living difference. It was estimated at about 25 per cent in the mid-west region and I think it would be much the same for Mount Isa. If he gets $200 a week, you can take a further $50 off that for cost of living differences between Mount Isa and a city like Brisbane or Sydney. That, of course, would take him down to $150 a week. Mount Isa is a very spread-out city and to get anywhere can be difficult. There is no commuter transportation system; we do not have a big, subsidised commuter system such as Sydney has. The big cities have $4,000 million of taxpayers' funds to pay for their commuter systems. We do not have any commuter systems. So to get to a supermarket, he has to walkwhen the ground temperature is 200 degrees Fahrenheit-or he has to have a car. The cost of keeping a car on the road would take a very large proportion of that $150 he has left. That is an average case. What is far worse in regard to the Child Support Agency is the non-average case, the hard case which is so common. I very much doubt whether there are people in this place that have not met the same sort of situation. This is the second case from Mount Isa: an employee of Queensland Railways. Every fortnight the person pays $235 in income tax; $28 for his quarters-we have included that in his income so I am not including that in deductions here$200 to his bank, the Queensland Credit Union, which of course we do not include as a deduction; $74 to his medical benefits fund; $45 to his Queensland government superannuation, which is compulsory at his workplace; $1.50 for the QRI, which I do not know; $488 in child support payments; $6 to the ARU, the Australian Railways Union; and $43 to National Mutual Life. That is also part of his income, and we include it as part of his income, not as a deduction. This creates for him an income of $1,127 gross a fortnight. After those deductions, we find him left with $116 a week. This is where the problem sets in. If there is any extraneous matter that intrudes upon his income, then he is in desperate straits indeed. In this case, he has to repay a legal debt for the divorce, at $54 a week. That leaves him with $62 a week to stay alive on. It really would be a challenge to stay alive on $62 a week in Mount Isa. This gentleman, whom I know well, is very thin because he cannot afford to eat very much. At the point of time. I am referring to, he was not in a very good way at all. We wrote to the then head of the department, Moira Scollay, and then I saw her personally and put these two cases before her. I must say in fairness to her that, like a lot of other senior public servants, she probably just signs letters without taking much note of them. Whether that is the case or not, we got back a letter signed by that head of the department, saying, 'We see nothing in these two cases that would lead us to believe that there should be any changes 2480 MAIN COMMITTEE ThursJay, 2 April 1998 in the administration of the Child Support Agency arrangements or any change in the legislation which governs Child Support Agency.' She refused point-blank to make any changes in the administration or to recommend to her minister any changes in the legislation. This woman, the head of this department, who I presume would be on a salary package of about $100,000 a year, thinks it is quite acceptable for this fellow to try to stay alive on $62 a week in Mount Isa. Clearly the man must starve to death. Whilst there are things that occur in our society that lead people to starve to death, this is a situation created by the laws of this country. This is the government forcing a human being to starve to death. For an exercise in callousness I must give this the all-time prize, in my 23 years as a member of parliament, by a fair stroke. For an exercise in stupidity, to sign your name to a letter which says that it is quite all right for a bloke to have an income of $62 a week to try to live on in Mount Isa is a most extraordinary and, I would think, foolish thing to do. But let me be kind and say that she just signed 100 letters that day and did not really pay a lot of attention to any of the letters. But I give the two cases. . question: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Employment Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (12.30 p.m.)-I want to raise a matter today relating to jobs in regional areas, in particular, the siting of the east coast armaments complex. Jobs are hard to come by in regional areas such as the one I represent in this parliament, especially in view of the assault that has been made on Geelong jobs by the Howard government since it has come to power. At the stroke of a pen the Howard government destroyed 450 highly skilled jobs at ASTAS in Avalon. It has also engineered some significant reductions in employment at Deakin University, and we have lost jobs in the Australian Taxation Office. We have lost the immigration department office and the customs office, and we have lost jobs in Telstra. These all add up to around 1,000 public sector jobs lost since the Howard government came to power. If you take the Barwon south-western region, of which Geelong is a part, in the last two years we have lost in the region of 20,000 jobs. So it is with dismay that I observed, when the Howard governmenrcame to power, its proposals to scale down the east coast armaments complex which was scheduled to be built at Point Wilson in my electorate. The particular facility was going to be some form of compensation, if you like, to the Geelong community for the destruction and the havoc that had been wrought on it by this particular government. It was with dismay that I saw that the government scaled down this particular project from $260 million, which was going to deliver us 600 jobs in the construction phase and provide over 200 jobs in the operational phase, to $70 million. And what Geelong is to get out of this is 60 jobs. Destroy 1,000 jobs in Geelong-the Howard government has done that-and in return we were to get a scaled down east coast armaments complex proposal that was to deliver 60. It is with some degree of concern that I have come across a release from the member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Nairn) who has called on the Joint Statutory",155,Representatives Main Committee

It being 12.30 p.m., I propose theThursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 2481 Committee on Public Works to visit Eden on this particular proposal-and I note his presence in the chamber here today .. What an extraordinary situation that we have the public works committee going to Eden to look at situating the proposed east coast armaments complex there, when we have had a committee of inquiry conducted by the government, costing a lot of money, which has indicated that the most appropriate site for the east coast armaments complex is Point Wilson in my electorate. I find it an absolutely extraordinary situation that the chairman of that particular committee could trot his members down to the electorate of Eden-Monaro in the face of a: report, done over two years and involving all the defence forces, which came to the conclusion that the most appropriate site for this particular facility was at Point Wilson in Geelong. The Geelong community has been rolled over and trodden on by the Howard government. We have lost 1,000 jobs since this government came to power. We have one of the highest regional unempioyment rates in this country and since the Howard government came to power we have lost 20,000 jobs in the Barwon south-western region. I would have thought that any government that had an ear or an eye for regional development would have grasped the opportunity to support a local community and situate the full east coast armaments complex in the Geelong region. We do not want a scaled-down $70 million facsimile of the project. We want the full monty; we want the $260 million project that is ,going to deliver us 600 jobs, not the paltry 60 being doled out now by the Howard govÂ«rnment. It is an absolute disgrace how this government has driven the boot into rural and regional communities around this nation. And it has done it without putting any sorts qf adjustment packages in place to support those communities. I am demanding that this particular proposal,' this idiotic proposal, be taken off the table and that that complex be located in my electorate.

I could also talk about the hundreds and hundreds of jobs lost in the timber industry in the south-east of my electorate under the government that he was part of over anumber of years 'whiCh just devastated an industry to keep some people in city areas happy. But that is not the reason I wanted to speak in this adjournment debate. I want to say something in relation to the ongoing and almost desperate situation that is occurring in' many parts of my electorate due to the ongoing drought. On the Monaro in the February just gone I'was able to announce exceptional.circumstance assistance to a number of the farmers who are really going through an unbelievably bad time. This drought, not only in my electorate but in many parts of New South Wales, is probably one of the worse on record and the ramifications are starting to flow in areas that people just would not have believed. The federal government was able to announce exceptional circumstance assistance'to quite a number of people in that drought area. It gives some short-term help. It is over initially a 12-month period, then an additional 12-month period. It gives some interest rate subsidy. It allows people to access a health card and Austudy; where theyÂ· normally would not be able to because of asset tests, and, in some circumstances, gives them an exceptional circumstance relief payment. That is good news; What they really' need is rain and rain and rain, but that does help a little bit to get them over a: number of difficult situations.",158,Representatives Main Committee
397,Mrnairn (Eden,"Monaro) (12.36 p.m.):-I might respond to the member for Corio( Mr2482 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursuay, 2 April 1998 I hope the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy( Mr Anderson) will be receiving next week a further report from the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, RASAC, about an extended area which is, I believe, even worse than the area that has been declared to be in exceptional circumstances. I am getting phone calls constantly in my office as the drought is basically expanding. One of the worse things that happened in the last couple of months was that the New South Wales government withdrew their drought freight subsidy to farmers who were sending stock away on agistment and those sorts of things. The timing of withdrawing that subsidy was just unbelievably bad. I cannot believe that they wo-ld do such a thing. I understand the long-term reasons for making these changes. There have been agreements between the New South Wales government and the federal governmentongoing situation with drought assistance, there have to be structural changes. We agree with that. But to pull off the subsidies in the middle of what is now being recognised as probably the worse drought on record in this area is just unbelievably heartless. I call on the New South Wales government to put those subsidies back in. I just could not believe the timing. The minister said at the time, 'It is all because of structural adjustments for drought and agreements from 1992,' but he did it when his own department were supporting very strongly the assistance that we are giving through exceptional circumstances. Members of that department have been very helpful in that regard. The extent of the drought I think is now really starting to hit home. It is not only the Monaro. Down on the coastal area as well, the dairying industry is now starting to see some difficulties and, if they do not get some rain that can give a little growth before winter comes on, they also will be in trouble. On top of that you can see it extending right up around the Canberra area and I am sure if visitors and members who come from elsewhere in Australia to Canberra to parliament go a little bit beyond the precincts of parliament, they will also see what is happening. On some of the hills you will see even native trees dying. When you start to see native trees dying because of a lack of water you really know that there is a problem. I note the honourable member for Moore commenting that it is similar in Western Australia. I was talking with some people from New Zealand earlier today, and they said the same. (Time expired) Cyprus to the potential crisis emerging over the issue of Cyprus .. As the parliament would be aware, Cyprus has applied for admission into the European Union and European Union negotiations are occurring at the moment. The Turkish government is attempting to derail the Cypriot entry into the European Union and I hope that the EU negotiators judge the application on its merits. I think that, if that occurs, there is no doubt that Cyprus will be accepted as a full member of the EU. Turkey has responded to this by threatening to annex northern Cyprus into the TUI:kish state if the EU agrees to Cypriot membership. I think that that, whilst it should not be all that",159,Representatives Main Commitiee

402,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (12.41 P.m.),"I rise today to draw the parliament's attentionThursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2483 surprising, is an extremely dangerous and volatile move. In the northern part of Cyprus 37 per cent of the island is occupied by some 35,000 Turkish troops. The northern part of the island only survives on the basis of being propped up financially by the Ankara regime. They already share telecommunications facilities and currency with Turkey. The response of Rauf Denktash, the leader of the bogus regime in northern Cyprus, to reject the Cyprus government's offer to allow for Turkish Cypriot representation in the EU negotiations highlights the fact that they are not serious about a peaceful resolution to the Cypriot question. This will be the 24th year since the invasion by the Turkish army. Once again we have a situation whereby Turkey is saying that they will annex, formally and illegally, the northern part of Cyprus. That will then undoubtedly lead to the potential for war in the Mediterranean. That would be a disaster, most importantly, for the Cypriot people whether they be of Turkish or Greek origin. I visited Cyprus on a delegation with the member for Watson( Mr Leo McLeay) and the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) some 18 months ago. What is clear is that the Cypriot people, regardless of their origin, do want a peaceful resolution to this crisis. If it is the case that in my electorate of Grayndler and in other parts of Australia---'-I note that the member for Moore( Mr Filing) is here today and he is a great friend of the Cypriot people-we see Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots living next to each other in harmony as part of our multicultural society, it should surely be possible for a bi-communal solution to the Cypriot question. But what we have is intransigence on the part of the Denktash regime and their masters in Ankara; bUllying and threats of coercion against the European Union; and a situation wherein the ethnic cl-ansing that occurred after the 1974 invasion of Cyprus continues to be the fundamental basis of that regime. That is something that all Australians who support multiculturalism should find unacceptable. It is certainly something that the international community-which, with the exception of Turkey, refuses to recognise the Denktash regime, as it is a renegade regime-should be acting on to ensure that there is a peaceful solution to the Cyprus question, and it should be rejecting the bullying by Turkey over Cyprus's entry into the European Union. Telecommunications Member for Werriwa Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (12.46 p.m.)-Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as you and other members would know, under the former government, telecommunications infrastructure was virtually a question of open slather, and we had mobile phone towers popping up like loathsome toadstools all over the cities of Australia. We had overhead cable being strung like spaghetti in the garden suburbs of our great cities. I am pleased to say that last year the current government changed the law. As of 1 July 1997, major items of telecommunications infrastructure, such as mobile phone towers and overhead cabling, could go ahead only with the consent of local governments or state governments. Of the changes brought in by the government, it is one of which I am most personally proud. In addition, last year, the government announced the spending of more than $4 million to study the possible health effects of this type of electromagnetic radiation on nearby residents. There is, however, an ongoing problem in my electorate. Next week, Telstra will be turning on a mobileÂ· phone base station at Dalwood in Seaforth. No work substantially commenced",160,Representatives Main Committee
403,Mr Abbott (Warringah,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment,2484 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 2 April 1998 before 1 July last year. There has been no agreement from Manly council. When Telstra indicated that they were going ahead, Manly council took them to court. Unfortunately, in the first instance, Manly council lost in the New South Wales Land and Environment Courtwhich I am afraid has taken a very liberal and, one may even say, idiosyncratic view as to what counts as commencement. My understanding is that the current position of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court is that mere design work constitutes the commencement of these stations. I want to make three points. The first point is that Manly council is considering an appeal, as I understand theÂ· situation, and it would be most unwise of Telstra to go ahead with the switching on of the base station before that appeal has been decided. The second point is that Telstra is a fine Australian company-it is obviously our telecommunications flagship-but, in that position, it does have very special corporate responsibilities. It is still in two-thirds public ownership and even after it passes into private ownership, because of its semimonopolistic nature, it will operate under special conditions. Telstra, of all companies, cannot afford to act like a corporate bully. I believe that Telstra should sit down with Manly council and enter into further negotiations, in the spirit of the law introduced by this government. The third point I would like to make is that, plainly, some telecommunications companiesperhaps in anticipation of the government's law last year-have been pulling swifties with their local communities. They have put up a sign here, they have turned a sod there and they have begun design work somewhere else. Quite frankly, this should not be enough for work on these installations to go ahead without proper local or state approval. I will be asking Senator Alston to consider changing this legislation, in order to prohibit the erection of these facilities without council consent, unless they were substantially commenced before 1 July 1997. I notice that I have one minute left and so I would like to draw the attention of the committee to some statements made by the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) in his new book which was, as we know, a long instruction manual for his colleagues, particularly the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley). I am sure members opposite will be delighted to know that the member for Werriwa says on page 104 of his new book: The quest for full employment has actually been achievedin this country, which is an interesting position for a member of the Labor Party to adopt. He also says: ... high unemployment is not a problem across the macro economy. This is an extremely interesting position for any member of parliament in this place to have, given that unemployment is still over eight per cent. The truth is the Leader of the Opposition has a big problem with the member for Werriwa. The member for Werriwa thinks he is running policy; he thinks he is running the opposition. He needs to be disciplined. He needs to decide what political party he wants to join because, quite frankly, he is too right wing for the Labor Party. Health Care premiers, most of whom come from the coalition parties, walking out at the Premiers Conference following their obvious belief that they were getting nowhere with the Prime",161,Representatives Main Committee
404,Mr Filing (Moore) (12.51 P.m.),"We saw recently the extraordinary spectacle of the stateThursday, 2 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2485 Minister( Mr Howard) in negotiating what they consider to be a satisfactory regime for the provision of health care facilities in the state infrastructures. I might add that I have issued an enormous number of press releases in relation to health problems in my own electorate, particularly concerning the northern suburbs, the new developing areas. I have often come across the situation where I have had the state minister blaming Canberra-he says that Canberra is not giving him an adequate amount of moneyand when I ask the Prime Minister he will say, 'There is no problem. In fact, Western Australia is doing very well out of its arrangements with the Commonwealth.' It is an interesting situation because whenever I have tried to raise these issues on behalf of my constituents, as I am obliged to do as their representative, I have found that there is duck shoving between the two levels of government. That is very unfortunate, given the problems we have. My electorate is in a key location in the city of Perth. It spans a coastal development corridor for expansion of the city northwards and it is experiencing a growth rate of around 24 per cent per annum in some places. People are drawn to the area by the opportunity to build or buy new homes, and raise families, and they can look forward to a relatively high standard of living. However, their dreams are beginning to unravel as the state government finds it increasingly difficult to provide from its own revenue sources the necessary range of services to foster and support this growth. This is something I have spoken on a number of occasions-the vertical fiscal imbalance in the Commonwealth-state fiscal arrangements-and it is something that the incoming coalition government promised to address. Certainly, when I was a member of the Liberal PartyI was told it was going to be addressed when we got into government. Now that I am an Independent member I have found that no change has been made and that it is not even mooted to be discussed by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) as part of taxation reform measures. Health care, in particular, is an area which cannot be ignored. Let me make a list of some of the problems. There is a lack of out of hours health care. Emergencies are being transferred to the city, which adds an extra 20 minutes travel and puts people at greater risk There is a lack of beds for care, and people are being sent home in an inappropriate state of health to make way for other patients. I had a particular case of a frail, elderly patient who was sent back to one of my local retirement estates with tubes still attached to her. This is an extraordinary situation. No out of hours medical care was available at that particular facility. When I went to the state minister and complained about that I was told by him there was nothing he could do and he suggested I negotiate with local medical practitioners to see if any of them would provide the service. There are ambulance problems faced by seriously ill people. There is a lack of locum services, and inadequate support for or access to mental health services in my area. The state promised to improve the situation based on the planned hospital at Joondalup, but that has been dogged by problems, especially revenue shortages. The most recent problem, as recently as last week, was the announcement by the hospital chief executive at Joondalup, Ian MacDonald, that all elective surgery was cancelled from 6 April to 1 May because of underfunding by the state government.",162,Representatives Main Committee
405,Mr Nairn,"Yes, it is.",163,Representatives Main Committee
406,Mr Filing,"No, it is not. Essential services in this region are reaching a crisis point.2486 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday2 April 1998 I cannot express enough disgust at this particular decision. We, always know that elective surgery is one of those definitions which is very nebulous,. It makes it extraordinarily difficult for my constituents, in particular, considering that this hospital is a privatised hospital One of the things that I tried to 'achieve,. when theI1}atter was originally being planned-and as a consequence of some of the shortfalls in its op-rations-was to have a local board of management appointed with'true provision for accountability. Unfortunately, they chose instead to have an 'advisory board, which means not trtuchat all, and the situation is that 'th-re is no direct accountability for the local comnlUnity other than via their local state members, who presumably toe: the party line and say nothing if they are put on the spot by their respective parties.' ' , In conclusion, we 'have a situation y.hich is unacceptable. The health care scenario in my ek,ctorate is substandard and needs to bradically addressed. It needs to be urgently sorted out. I might add that, when my constituents saw the state premiers walking out on the Prime Minister-taking their cricket bats and going home-at the Premiers Conference and they saw the Prime Minister stonewalling for his own particular reasons, I am sure they, like many other people in this country, wondered how and why our system of 'governance had got into this state, and they scratched their heads and thought, 'Well, if this is the way government is going under our, two-party system, there also need to. be changes to that'. (Time expired) Employment , government's work for thedqleprogram, but in my wildestdreams I did not expect such positive results within the first few weeks. 1 must adniit that I ani fortunate that the two organisations in my electorate to be awarded the work for the dole projects are run by remarkably dedicated and motivated people. One is run by Craig Belmanno of Norman Park. Craig was a finalist in the Young Australian of the Year in 1997. A dedicated environmentalist, he established the Moreton Bay Marine Association and galvanised local environmentalists to his excellent cause. He now has more than 120 young work for the dole volunteers who have discovered what it is like to work with community groups on environmental projects. The Moreton Bay Marine Association work for the dole project is revegetating and cleaning up the creeks and rivers which run into Moreton Bay, including Bulimba Creek in my electorate, an important catchment for the city of Brisbane. Craig Belmanno reported to me earlier this week that, since he started his work for the dole scheme in December, one in five of his volunteers have left to take up a full-time job. While this situation interrupts his work flow, he said, 'It is absolutely beautiful to see.' Craig reinforces the view of this government that, if you give a person a goal, a reason to get up every morning, their life is greatly enhanced. The second work for the dole project in my electorate is run by the South East Training Centre, formerly skillshare, at Coorparoo. Shane Cowan, the manager, has been involved in the training and job placement of long-term unemployed in my electorate for the past eight years. He knows his job and he has a good rapport with employers in the district. The suburbs that the South East Training Centre service, particularly within Griffith, are made up of a broad mix of people from many different parts of the world. As English is not the first language of many of the residents, employment options have been limited. Shane has reported to me this week that his work for the dole participants have responded to his programs with enthusiasm, and all the participants in my electorate on both programs , ,",163,Representatives Main Committee

One of Shane Cowan's work for the dole projects has been the restoration of the Cannon Hill School of Arts building. Of his team, already 11 young people have found full-time jobs. Others have been offered traineeships and a handful have been motivated into developing business plans to set up their own small business. When I visited Cannon Hill School of Arts recently, I met with the team of eight working with Shane and their supervisor. They were restoring the original timber windows, painting walls, repairing the roof and the floor and generally giving this wonderful old community hall a much needed new lease of life. On the way, they have been learning to work as a team and, more importantly, discovering that their services are needed and appreciated by the community. All the young people working on that day said that they were enjoying being part of the work for the dole project. The tradespeople of Cannon Hill and surrounding suburbs have also responded to this work for the dole with vigour and support. They have assisted with tools, equipment, advice and encouragement. Both organisations tell me that their work for the dole project has given everyone involved a new focus. Employers are attracted to the fact that the program reveals the determination of some of the young participants to get a job. The Labor Party has bagged this program from the day it was announced, not because they thought it would not work, but because they simply did not want it to work. They do not want to see any reforms introduced by this government to improve the lives of the unemployed. The opposition are not interested in reform; they are only interested in power at any price. Work for the dole is working and I have proof of it in my electorate, in these projects alone.
