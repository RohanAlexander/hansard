I have been considering the matter, and I think now that it will be better not to commence the discussion next Wednesday.

It is a most remarkable thing for the Treasurer to tell honourable members that the consideration of the Budget is postponed indefinitely. There should be a day fixed for the commencement of the discussion. that I have taken an irregular course. Obviously honourable members think that the discussion should not be commenced next Wednesday. That is shown by the question which I have been asked.

I shall not fix a date now, though I anticipate that the discussion will be commenced about Tuesday week. I shall give honourable members plenty of notice. to fix Wednesday than Tuesday week.

They cannot do it in addition to their ordinary parliamentary business, while the House is sitting, and I do not think therefore I ask if the Treasurer will be willing to consent to an adjournment from, say, Thursday next until the following Wednesday, in order to give honourable members an opportunity to try to digest the information which has been made available to them? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I shall not make a definite promise at the present moment, because something may happen which will prevent such an adjournment; but personally, I shall not offer any objection if honourable members generally desire an adjournment from Thursday next until Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week.

How can a master obtain definite knowledge that disease actually exists on board his vessel ? I would further point out that the clause provides that he is liable for not reporting the matter if he believes or suspects, or has reason to believe or suspect, that a quarantinable disease exists on board. Then how is the Minister to determine whether the master believes or suspects the presence of a quarantinable disease on his ship ?

I fancy that the measure contains a provision to prevent that. quarantine vessel or quarantine grounds has to be authorized by a quarantine officer. tended that wholesale liberty to leave such places shall be granted, but of course I apprehend that there may be circumstances in which the granting of such permission would be perfectly justifiable. Clause agreed to. Clauses 30 to 33 agreed to. Clause 34.1. Where a vessel has arrived at any port from a proclaimed place, or is subject to quarantine, and the quarantine officer is satisfied that no person on board is actually suffering from a quarantinable disease, but is not satisfied that the vessel is free from infection, he may, subject to this section(a)'refrain from giving a certificate of pradisease, but he has reason to suspect that tique j (i) permit the vessel to proceed on her voyage without performing quarantine at a quarantine station; (e) permit any passengers for that port and their effects to be landed; (d) permitany cargo on the vessel for that port to be landed. 2.

Penalty : One hundred pounds. 4. AH cargo and passengers' effects landed under this section shall be subject to treatment and disinfection as prescribed. With the general provisions of this clause I am in perfect agreement, but I wish to ask the Attorney-General whether it has been copied from the States Quarantine Acts, and whether it is a provision which is to be enforced save under the most exceptional circumstances ?

It is a power which will be exercised with caution. would point out that this provision vests in. quarantine officers, in cases in which quarantinable diseases are not actually found onboard vessels, the power of detaining them in quarantine upon the mere chance that such diseases may develop.

The objection which I entertain to this clause is the very opposite of that urged by the honourable member for Wentworth. Apparently, he wishes to make it more lax, whereas I think it is already too lax. Under present conditions, if a medical officer is not satisfied that a vessel is free from infection, it is his duty to order her into quarantine.* This clause will give the quarantine officer a discretion which I hope will not be too widely exercised. The object of this provision is very clear. have a more or less extended course of incubation ; and it is proposed that in certain circumstances a vessel from an infected port should be allowed to proceed on hei way along the coast to a certain extent under observation.

I hope that in the regulations we shall have a recognition of the liability of the Commonwealth to be very seriously affected by a lax interpretation of this provision. should not have risen again to speak to this clause but for the extraordinary complexion which the honourable member for Laanecoorie has put upon my remarks. I cast the responsibility upon the Minister, but suggested that the clause might be redrafted so that it would be more in accorddance with the view to which he had given expression. The honourable gentleman said that the power would be exercised onlj where the quarantine officer was not satisfied that a vessel was free from infection. ' I quite agree that such a power is necessary. I entirely fail to understand why the honourable member for Laanecoorie Certain diseases should have attributed to me the view that the quarantine officer should not be permitted to exercise such a power as is proposed to be given him under this clause.

It might not be necessary to require vessels regularly trading between, say, New Zealand and Australia to perform the same conditions as vessels coming from eastern ports.

I am convinced that so intelligent-so brilliant-a : Ministry as the present one would not contemplate such extreme action* I only ask the Minister to give a general idea now as to what are likely to be the "" declared ports."" I presume each capital of Australia, at any rate, will be "" declared."" ney-General) [11.26] -It is impossible to sav what may or may not be the specified ports, but I should think that all the existing ports which have been found necessary will be declared, unless for some very strong reason. it may even be necessary to appoint special ports for a time. For instance, as I said yesterday, valuable stock might be consigned to a northern port of Western Australia, or to the Northern Territory, and, instead of requiring them to be brought to one of the ordinary ports of entry, special arrangements might be made for their being landed direct, always providing that they were quarantined and safeguarded. However, these are matters which must be left fo administration. I can promise that every facility will be given for the declaration of necessary ports. absolutely necessary that at the ports of entry every facility in the shape of hospitals, water supply, servants, and so forth should be provided for the treatment of disease. A ship which sails under a charter party must proceed to the port mentioned in the charter, and, further, the policy of insurance makes a similar stipulation. ber not think that a man, before placing goods on board, will ascertain the destination of the ship? in the charter party were Newcastle, and that was a declared port, but was not furnished properly with quarantine requisites, it would be necessary for the quarantine officer there to direct the vessel with its crew and passengers to be taken to Sydney. It would be impossiblefor a vessel, if Newcastle were mentioned in the charter party, to make the first port of call any other port, without violating the terms of the charter, and of the insurance policy. To insure the proper carrying out of the Bill it will be necessary to establish fully equipped administrative offices and hospitals at the -various ports of call. Clause agreed to. Clauses 51 and 52 agreed to. Clause 53(1) A quarantine officer shall make a careful inspection of all imported animals before they are delivered to the importer. (2) If the imported animals are accompanied by a certificate of an approved veterinary surgeon at the port of shipment, certifying that he had examined the animals prior to their shipment, and that they then were in good health and free from disease, and the quarantine officer is satisfied that during the voyage they have not suffered from any disease or been exposed to infection, and were free from disease at the time of landing, and that there is no danger of their introducing any disease, he may, subject to the regulations^ give to the, importer a certificate to I can conceive that that effect, and may allow them to be delivered to the importer without being required to perform quarantine. (3) In all other cases the quarantine officer shall order the animals into quarantine. v Now that the principal clauses have been passed, I join in congratulating the Attorney-General on the manner in which the Bill has run the gauntlet of searching criticism, and on the fact that it has emerged in almost the same form as that in which it was introduced. tion. amendment has been accepted by the Government, but it is more a method of procedure than a real alteration in principle. The question of appointing properly-qualified officers has already been discussed and decided; but I desire to again emphasize the necessity for insuring that at the principal ports of entry, and also in the case of internal areas, the principal officers shall be duly qualified veterinary surgeons. A qualified medical officer has to make the inspection in connection with human beings, and there will be a qualified If the port mentioned entomologist to investigate the diseases of plants; and I hope the same principle wilt be applied in connection with the examination of stock. nev-General) [11.32] I am sure that the Minister ini making any appointments will bear in mind the necessity of selecting thoroughly competent officers. There is no doubt that in Australia generally the position of veterinary surgeons has considerably improved; and in Melbourne there is a proper institution for their training.

That disease has always been a menace to stock-owners, and no regulation can be too stringent to protect the stock industry of Australia from its importation. wish to point out a very serious inconsistency in this clause. It expressly provides that all imported stock must be accompanied by-.the certificate of a thoroughly qualified veterinary surgeon that they were free from disease at the port of shipment, whereas at the port of entry the power to determine whether they shall be ordered into quarantine is vested in an officer who has: no special qualifications.

General) [11.48] I fear that honourable members imagine that this clause confers far wider powers than it is intended to I believe that confer. It was inserted for this reason: New Zealand, to our own knowledge, is absolutely free from a great many of the diseases which affect stock. The same remark is applicable to England, from which country stock are imported. The clause is intended to provide that if stock are imported from those clean areas, and are accompanied by the certificates of a veterinary surgeon at the port of shipment, that they are free from disease, they may be admitted into the Commonwealth without being required to undergo a period of quarantine. But I recognise the force of the contention of the honourable member As instances of such disease I might for Capricornia.

Under the circumstances, there would be no necessity for a veterinary surgeon who had qualified under the Veterinary Surgeon Act of any State, and who would, as I have said, not be qualified to act in any other State.

My sympathy is with those who desire to protect importers of blood stock; but, at the same time, I see no necessity for the' amendment; the clause as it stands is quite ample for our purposes. It seems to be implied that Queensland is chiefly affected by the clause. But it is well known that imported stock for Queensland is always taken round by the south. So far as I have any knowledge, no stock has been imported by the northern route for many years. Torres Straits service started? might make a difference. U p to the present, however, since the Torres Straits service has been kbandoned, there has been no importation by the northern route; and even when that service was available, there was very little importation of stock, beyond a few Timor ponies.

Her owner would part with her for that price if she could be brought back again. I think that the regulation which I refer to is too strict, seeing that animals which .have been to India can be afterwards taken to England, or to any other part of the world except Australia.

There are many practical men who are competent to test the existence of diseases in connection with plants, but who are not trained entomologists. The Government entomologists to whom the honourable member referred are employed to study the life history of pests, and the conditions under which they flourish and succumb, with a view to discovering means for their eradication, and giving instructions to orchardists as to the methods to be pursued! to. keep their trees healthy. The Government entomologist of Queensland, an exceedingly competent man, spends his time in studying the development of diseases affecting vegetation, and .has published several* papers on the subject.

It is a great hardship for people abouc to enter a country to be compelled to undergo a period of quarantine.

This clause provides that the owners or agents shall supply such wholesome and suitable provisions and medicines as are required by the quarantining officer at the quarantine station, and if they do not provide them it empowers the Minister to supply them and to charge the owners or agents of the vessel for the amount expended. But, to my mind, the provision does not go far enough to protect the passengers and crew. Therefore, I move That after the'word ""prescribed,"" line 6, the following words be inserted"" And the cost infection. thereof shall not be charged by the owners or Ocean, and the Western Pacific Ocean, agents against any passenger or member of the against which we chiefly have to guard. crew of any vessel.""

I come from a State where more liberty is allowed than is given in Victoria, and bear no vaccination brand on' my arm. So long as Australia is kept as free from disease as it has been up to the present time, the risk of contagion will be so small as. to make vaccination practically unnecessary. Under the clause, any contact might be required by a medical officer to submit to vaccination; but, had small-pox been discovered on the Eastern .when we were coming from the north, and bad a provision of this kind been in force, I should have soon been at loggerheads with the medical officers on the point. I protest against this back-door method of providing for compulsory vaccination, and shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Hunter. -With all due deference to medical opinion, I hold the view that vaccination is a barbarous method of dealing with disease, and that it might well be allowed to become obsolete. I consider that cases become severe because of the antiquated methods of treating them which are employed, and that sickness can often be cured more expeditiously and made milder than is the rule. not a Christian Scientist? Christian Science, but the application of scientific methods co the treatment of disease. Quarantine will effect all that is resuch persons should be considered. quired to be done in the way of preventing the introduction of disease. If contacts refuse to be vaccinated, and fall ill at the quarantine station, medical skill will be available for their treatment. The most that the doctors can say for vaccination is that, if persons who have been vaccinated get small-pox, they will have the disease only in a mild form. ber myself amongst those antiquated persons who believe that there is great virtue in vaccination as a precaution against small-pox.

I think that the Commonwealth authorities should have this power. ' But the clause should be redrafted, because it does not distinguish between small-pox and other diseases. Apparently, in India, they are now successfully performing an operation similar to vaccination, to stay the plague. The recent conference of health officers recommended that vaccination should be made compulsory throughout Australia, but, as there is not uniformity on this point among the laws of the States, it would be a serious thing for the Commonwealth to adopt that recommendation. In my opinion, the medical officer at a port of entry should be empowered to ask every person on board a ouarantined ship to submit himself to vaccination, and those who would not do so should be compelled to undergo a longer term of separation than their fellows. Many friends of my own hold that vaccination has been responsible for setting up a bad state of the blood and causing illness, and, although the medical testimony as to the value of vaccination is overwhelming, the objections of It would be too much to require every person on a ship to be vaccinated, whatever his opinions as to the value of vaccination. who would not submit to the operation shpuld not get off with the payment of a fine; they should undergo a longer term of separation, to prevent them from becoming the means of introducing disease. opposition to the clause is based on grounds which differ somewhat from those hitherto advanced.

I have a vivid recollection of an occasion when there was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Australia. I was a passenger by a German mail steamer proceeding from Adelaide to Fremantle. Several Inter-State steamers had been allowed to enter Fremantle without being quarantined, as had also the Engthat he will insist upon a division, so that lish mail steamer. But on the voyage to Adelaide, a fireman on the German liner developed a trifling skin disease, and, as it was suspected that he was suffering from bubonic plague, he was put on shore at that port. The vessel resumed her voyage, and on her arrival at Fremantle, a juvenile, about twenty-four or twenty-five years of age, enveloped in an over-ail, boarded the ship and ordered all the Inter-State passengers into quarantine, without subjecting them to anything in the nature of an examination. As a matter of fact, he did not even see the passengers whom he ordered into quarantine. The man who was supposed to.be suffering from the disease was put ashore at Adelaide, and it subsequently transpired, was not suffering' from bubonic plague. The youth to whom I have referred, probably fresh from some university, ordered all the passengers to be put ashore in the ship's boats. The result was that we were landed in the middle of the night upon what was practically an uninhabited headland, where we had to find accommodation as best we could. For ten days some fifty or sixty persons were thus kept in quarantine, without rhyme or reason, until news was received from Adelaide that the fireman, upon whose account we had been quarantined, had been discharged. The doctor who ordered us into quarantine would have kept us there longer, had not the passengers held a meeting, at which they resolved to leave ' the quarantine grounds and walk into Fremantle. I happened to be chairman of the meeting, and it was resolved that all the male passengers should walk into Fremantle .and surrender themselves at the police-station. When the doctor learned of our decision, he released us from quarantine. I may say that at the quarantine station there was just a piece of of vaccination is one upon which there is galvanized iron between myself and a Chinese who was suffering from leprosy. The quarantine was an absolute farce. The authorities talk about the isolation of the patients, when, as a matter of fact, the to come into the grounds daily, and we were allowed to freely mingle with the drivers. It was nothing short of compulsory imprisonment to which we we're subjected, at the whim of a bumptious juvenile, who did not know his business. I am satisfied that we shall be doing a great wrong if we allow this clause to be incorporated in the Bill. I am glad the honourable member for Hunter has called attention to it, and I hope it may be eliminated. that this clause is very roughly drawn, although I do not agree with all the criticisms which have been levelled against it. To my mind, its weakness, lies in the fact that it does not differentiate between the different diseases against which vaccination or inoculation is intended to be used. I think that vaccination as a preventive against small-pox-and I speak only on the authority of the balance of medical testimony -is extremely valuable, and I would be prepared to agree to the clause in its present form if it merely conferred powers of vaccination in the case of an outbreak of small-pox. But I find that the power of vaccination or inoculation is directed against any "" quarantinable disease "" and ' ' quarantinable disease"" means "" small-pox, plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus fever, or leprosy."" Accordingly, if a medical officer were to exceed his powers in the way that has been described by the honourable member for Coolgardie, he could compel any passenger to undergo inoculation against leprosy, typhus fever, yellow fever, or cholera. WhilstI would cheerfully submit to vaccination as a precautionary measure against small-pox every time that I was going to an Eastern country, I should be very sorry to be vaccinated against typhus fever or leprosy. The clause is so loosely drafted that, in the interests of the measure itself, the Attornev-General would be well advised if he agreed to its postponement. intend to discuss the merits or demerits of vaccination, but, to my mind, it is a great pity that this clause has been introduced into the Bill. The question of the utility a great difference of opinion. In Victoria, compulsory vaccination exists so far-as infants are concerned, but even in this State we have not gone so far as the proposal in this Bill. We do not compel people who",36,Quaranti Ne Bill

351,Mr Wise (Gippsland) [3.7],"I do notare ordered into quarantine to be vaccinated. They can either be vaccinatedin which case they are detained for a shorter term-o r they may refuse to be vaccinated-in which case they are obliged to remain in detention for a longer term. It appears to me that that is the remedy we ought to apply here. We should then permit those who have no objection to vaccination to be inoculated, while we should respect the scruples of others. that this clause should either be mandatory or else excised from the BUI. Already different laws relating to vaccination are in operation in the various States. If a ship were quarantined in New South Wales, the probability is that the quarantine officer would not compel her passengers to be vaccinated. In Victoria,' however, he might adopt a different course. I fail to see very much use in the provision. If it is held that because a person has been on a ship with persons suffering from a disease he might contract the disease after getting out of quarantine, and ought, therefore, to be vaccinated, by the same process of reasoning, vaccination should be made compulsory in the case of every one entering -the country. I have not heard that proposal suggested, and I am inclined to think it would meet with very strong opposition. If those who have been on a ship on which there has been disease, contract the disease after leaving the vessel, we have ample provision in the States and Commonwealth laws to deal with them, and to safeguard the health of the people generally. The preponderance of medical opinion is in favour of vaccination, but there is a great difference of opinion on the question, and it is generally admitted that vaccination is not a preventative of disease. It mayinsure a mild attack, but it is also admitted that to be effective, it is necessary that a person should be vaccinated every few years. think it would be better to strike the clause out. L33]-I d° P T n o e t r i a t t n e ^ a t e clause will be decided on its merits or demerits, not by honourable members generally, but by those who have a professional acquaintance with the subject. I do not suppose there are more than two or three members of the Committee who can speak with authority as to the effects of inoculation. As the question is one in which I am not well versed, I am prepared to let it be decided by members of the medical profession. I hope that there will toe no unnecessary delay in .dealing with the Bill, because we should get to work on more important business. I assume that in the preparation of this measure the Minister had the advice of medical men well versed in these questions. We have men in Australia who know something about them, and my vote will be cast in favour of the clause, in the belief that it is submitted on the advice of medical men. If that course is not generally adopted, it would be better to postpone the consideration of the clause until we have evidence as to the efficiency of inoculation in the prevention of the spread of disease. I am one of those who believe that the time will arrive when diseases of almost every kind will, by various means, be prevented; and it seems to me that that is likely to be brought about by a'system of inoculation. order to give effect to the idea I put before the Committee, I suggest the amendment of the clause by the insertion after the word ""may,"" of the words ""but only with the consent of the person concerned."" The question whether vaccination is or is not a good thing, does not enter into the discussion. The question here is whether we should make it compulsory for men to be .vaccinated who do not desire to be. No one will say that we could not obtain what we wish to accomplish by quarantine and separation of the persons concerned. If a man does not desire to be vaccinated he could be detained for such time as would make it certain that he would be under no risk of contracting the disease himself, and, therefore, of communicating it to others. That is all we need to secure under a quarantine Bill. Our object is to insure the safety of the people, and if it might be insured in that In all the circumstances I way, I do not see why we should enforce compulsory vaccination. ber believe in the compulsory cleaning of °f t n e backyards ? . more clean backyards there would be less danger of the spread of smallpox, and -other diseases.

That is my position. I do not see why I or any other man should be vaccinated against his will. -Whilst I think that the clause might be improved, I do not agree with the amendment suggested by the .honourable member for Nepean. If that were accepted, we might just as well strike out the clause. I can understand Australians objecting to vaccination, because they have not been witnesses of the ravages of the small-pox scourge. If they had lived, as I did in my younger days, in a big manufacturing city, and saw persons dying of small-pox by hundreds, and those who recovered disfiffured in a dreadful manner, it is possible they would have a different opinion on the question of vaccination. I find no fault with a conscientious objection in regard to anything so long as the observance of such scruples, does not involve danger to the community. The power required under the B i ll is not to, vaccinate all and sundry when there is no danger. It is when danger to the community is at hand that the power asked for is required for public protection. It ought not to be forgotten that in these days we have leviathans carrying a population equivalent to that of a village or small town. In these circumstances the danger of the spread of an infectious disease is a very serious matter. While the honourable member for Nepean was referring to vaccination for small-pox in New South Wales, I heard an Jionorable member ask whether the authorities compelled people to have a bath. A good many people have conscientious objections to taking a bath, but no honourable I s the honourable member member would say that it would not be good for them to have one. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Nepean would not like to live in the same room in summer -They were not vaccitime with a man who had conscientious objections to taking a bath. ^ He might not object in the colder weather, but as soon as the proximity of the person become obnoxiI do not care wheous the honourable member would insist upon the bath being taken.

I had communicated with the Health Department by telephone, and was informed that that was. so. But since then I have seen Dr. Norris, the Chairman of the Board of Health, who has drawn my attention to section 210 of the Victorian Health Act. The section is not inserted in the part of the Act dealing with quarantine, and therefore I missed it. It providesShould any vessel arrive in Victoria on boaTd of which any case of small-pox shall exist at the time of the arrival of such vessel, or on board of which any case of small-pox shall have occurred within forty days previously to the arrival of such vessel in Victoria, it shall be lawful for the health officer or acting health officer to vaccinate or re-vaccinate every person who shall be on board such vessel, or who may be landed from such vessel in Victoria; and any person arriving in Victoria in such vessel who shall refuse to submit to be vaccinated or re-vaccihated, or who shall refuse to permit any child in his custody to be vaccinated or revaccinated by such health officer or acting health officer, shall be liable to a penalty of not more than Ten or less than Five shillings for every day after such refusal during which such person 'shall remain without being, vaccinated or Tevaccinated as aforesaid, and for eveTy day after such refusal during which any child in the custody of such person remains without being vaccinated or re-vaccinated as aforesaid.

General) [3.23] I quite realize that the feeling of the Committee is that the operation of the clause, if possible, should be confined to cases of small-pox. In practice it would, I think, be so confined, because I cannot conceive of vaccination for other diseases being required under present circumstances. But medical science does prescribe inoculatipn for other diseases, some of which may be more serious than small-pox. Inoculation, for. instance, is recommended for the prevention of plague. That is the reason why, later on, I propose to move an amendment in regard not only to inoculation but similar preventive measures against quarantinable diseases. The object in view is not to use the power in an arbitrary manner. It must be realized that when a case of small-pox is found on board a steamer, if the passengers were not vaccinated it would mean that every one connected with the ship would have to be detained very much longer than would otherwise be the -case. One of the objects of the clause is to enable persons to be liberated as soon as possible. There is no danger of any officer exercising these powers unless thoroughly satisfied of an outbreak of small-pox. The honourable member for Coolgardie has mentioned what appears to be an arbitrary instance. It is all very well to criticise the health officer in the case mentioned, but suppose there had been some disease. I' can quite understand an officer who had at heart the welfare of the community determining to take the safest course under the circumstances. It is just as well to be cautious in cases which may involve the lives of thousands of persons. The question of compulsbrjy Vaccination throughout the Commonwealth is not before the Committee in any way. The clause relates to a specific instance. If a ship is coming in, and there is small-pox on board, we want to give the officer power to say, if he considers it necessary to prevent the spread of disease, that what the clause requires shall be done. What would be the alternative ? It would mean that every per,son who had not' been vaccinated would be detained in quarantine very much longer. that? one person might be able to block the whole tined can do no harm to the health of the 'of the passengers on the ship frombeing general public, and it should be for them liberated when they ought to be.

Does the honourable member think that vaccination against leprosy would be efficacious? bers will recognise, however, that when power is given to apply a certain remedy for a certain disease, the medical officer would not attempt to apply that remedy to something to which it was not applicable?

I believe that the consensus of medical opinion to-day is that it would be well if the whole community were vaccinated. , I do not dispute that opinion, but I object to any medical officer being empowered to board a ship and to order that the passengers, whether suffering from small-pox or anything else, shall be vacFor that reason, I intend to vote against this",39,Quaranti Ne Bill

He must be aware, however, that there is a period of incubation during which the disease is lying latent in the body of the patient, and no one can say whether or not he has taken it. vaccination of a person in whom the disease of small-pox is latent would not prevent the development of that disease. I doubt very much whether the vaccination of a person who had already contracted the disease would cause the attack to be less serious than it would otherwise be.

406,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [4.3],"! quiteVie is showing a certain amount of political innocence with, which I should not have credited him. I find that the Minister is in rather a tight corner. He is very anxious to have a lengthy discussion on the Tariff; but 'he is not anxious to have other matters of policy discussed. He and his small party are supported here by a large party, whose main interest at the present time is the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions The Acting Prime Minister has told us that he is not going to give them what they want. to say oh that by-and-by. that the Minister is determined to have the Tariff and the Budget discussed at the same time, in order to take away from honourable members who are supporting him so loyally, the only opportunity which they will have in this session of discussing that which on every platform they say they firmly believe in. to ask the Acting Prime Minister, whether the Tariff Bill will contain a provision which will secure to the employees in the protected industries some form of protection? That was promised by the Prime Minister before the recent elections, and it is approved by a number of honourable members? given at the meeting of the House to-day. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume Treasurer) [4.7] -Thf? honourable member for Kooyong has asked a question regarding the return of money collected, if any increases of duties are not approved. In such cases the money was not returned on the last occasion, and the same procedure will be followed in the present instance. The Bill will contain a provision to that effect. It would be almost impossible to carry out the honourable member's view. It could only be done in the case of unbroken packages, because, as he will see, it would be quite impossible to trace any goods .which had been sold by the importers. reason, it is not intended to return any money which has been collected. In reply to the honourable member for Herbert, I desire to say that I have received from the managing director of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, a letter stating that they have imported 341 men under their permits, but do not intend to use any more, of the permits. Therefore, the permits will be cancelled. I think that the deputy leader of the Opposition must have had his tongue in his cheek when he was speaking just now. with him. for wanting to postpone the consideration of the Tariff for a few days longer than he mentioned last night. sideration of the Budget. tirely with honourable members to say whether the general discussion on the Tariff and the Budget shall be taken together or I think it is very obvious separately. It-is.not likely, in fact, it is hardly possible that they can discuss the Budget without discussing the Tariff. I think it will save time to have one general discussion, because otherwise we should have a discussion on the Budget, and then a repetition of it on the Tariff. not avoid two discussions. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I believe that if there is a good general discussion oii both the Budget and the Tariff, in' the first instance,' it will save a great deal of discussion on the Tariff alone. member must not forget that I laid on the information was table to-day all the reports of the Tariff Commission.

If all the information required is not complete and available when we come toFor that discuss the Budget and Tariff, honorable members will blame me. But before that discussion takes place, I wish to get rid of several measures now on the business paper.

In reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Corio, I may say that this morning I stated that what is known as the new protection-protectio n for the employees-wil l be provided for in the Bill. It may not be quite the same as that in the Acts which we passed last year, but provision will be made for protecting employees as well as manufacturers. industrial legislation must be under the control of the Commonwealth. that would be a very good thing. In one of this morning's journals is a statement which leads me to suppose that some of my remarks on the Budget last night may be misunderstood. I am supposed to have said that, when at the Conference in London, the Prime Minister and myself made offers equivalent to a bribe, promising that if Great Britain would give a preference to Australia, we, on our return, would do what we could to bring about the granting of preference by Australia to Great Britain. I did not make any statement of the kind. WhatI said was that in LondonI had stated-and I think the Prime Minister did so, too-that if we did not get all that we wanted, we should not resent our. treatment, but should propose a preferential Tariff for the advantage of Great Britain, leaving it open to the British Government, if it liked, hereafter to give consideration to Australia. proposes to help Great Britain by increasing the duties on the leading lines imported here from that country.
