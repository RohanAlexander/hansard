The following notice was given: That this House: (1) notes that 28 May 2001 was the 40th anniversary of the formation of Amnesty International; (2) notes the large membership and total crossparty support for the Australian Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International; (3) congratulates Amnesty International on its continuing vital work on behalf of political prisoners around the world; and",119,Health Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2001
257,Mr Baird,"to move:Thursday, 24 May 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27079 Thursday, 24 May 2001 ----Racing Industry racing industry, as we are at the height of the winter racing carnival in Brisbane, and the racing industry is concentrated particularly in the area of Brisbane that I represent-around the racing tracks at Eagle Farm, Doomben, Albion Park and the training track at Deagon. The racing industry is going through a rough trot at the moment, caused by some changes in habits and by the impact of the GST. The GST has had a significant impact on racing and breeding, and that is bad news for the industry. The Queensland Principal Club has undertaken an extensive study to examine the impact of the GST on the racing industry in Queensland. In terms of racing and breeding, it is estimated that the total cost impact of the GST in Queensland is about $13 million per annum. The GST has added about $4 million annually to the cost of purchasing yearlingsGovernment members interjectingowners who are not GST registered. This is a very significant point. Professional breeders are required to add GST to the sale price of yearlings to protect their margins. This additional cost is lost to the industry for non-registered buyers who are unable to claim back their input credits. Therefore, the GST has added between $1,300 and $1,400 to the annual cost of racing a horse for those 70 per cent of owners who are not GST registered, excluding indirect costs such as insurance, personal transport and communication expenses. This additional cost means that about $9 million a year is leaking out of the industry. So the GST impact on the Queensland racing industry comes on top of the unwelcome impact of the high cost of fuel and other cost increases. The racing industry is one of the biggest direct and indirect employers in the Lilley electorate. I am deeply concerned that jobs are being lost. When I met with the racing industry last week, they indicated to me that they had probably lost around one-third of their business, and this was largely due to the impact of the GST generally on small business people who were racing horses, and then their subsequent inability to claim back their input credits. We as a community, particularly in the northern suburbs, need a plan for racing. We need all tiers of government, including both federal and state, the local community, the clubs, the Queensland Principal Club, the clubs at Eagle Farm and Doomben, the trainers, the owners and the workers to come together, because this is a very important employer of labour. It also adds a significant dimension to the cultural outlook of the community. If the racing industry keeps going the way it is going, that will be lost forever. The jobs will go with it, and our community will be changed forever. In the northern suburbs of Brisbane, we need a coordinated approach to the future of the racing industry so that we can protect those jobs and protect the future of this vital industry, including all of those who depend on it, not just in the northern suburbs but in country Queensland and country Australia. (Time expired) Herbert Electorate: Infrastructure Projects Beattie Labor government in Queensland. In relation to the electorate of Herbert, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want you to know, and I want the people of Herbert to know, what the Beattie government is simply not doing and could be doing. Look at the Douglas arterial road project. Here we have the Commonwealth government standing ready to deliver something like $33",120,Notices

261,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.43 A.m.),"I am totally fed up with the ‘can’t do’ attitude of the27080 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 24 May 2001 million for that project, and the Beattie Labor government will not get on with getting the road built. It needs to be built; it is vital for our community. Yet we have the state government saying, ‘No, we’re not going to do it.’ The Commonwealth money is there; we are ready to go; but with respect to the state government it is a case of ‘no go’. It is the same with the new port access road, the eastern port corridor for the city. It is really important to keep the traffic out of Railway Estate and South Townsville. It is really important to attract new industry and new jobs to the Stuart area. But what is the attitude of the Beattie Labor government? They will not even ask the federal government to declare it as a road of national importance. If that was declared as a road of national importance, I guarantee that tomorrow the federal government would come up with the money and deliver the money for that project. The Beattie Labor government is putting the project on hold for another three years, even though the city really needs that project. It is a project of major significance. What about the tourist industry? The state minister came to Townsville and declared that Townsville is a wonderful tourist industry-which it is. But when you look at the state government’s track record, again it is a case of ‘can’t do’. What about the Cromaty wetlands-the Kakadu of North Queensland? In fact, it is better than Kakadu, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know that we all support and applaud the government for delivering another $1 billion by way of a five-year rolling program under the Natural Heritage Trust. We stand ready to deliver $1.7 million to allow the Cromaty wetlands project to be developed. What do we need from the state government? A one-third share, $800,000. And do you know what the answer is? ‘No, can’t do.’ ‘Can’t do, can’t do, can’t do in Townsville-Thuringowa.’ It is not acceptable. We can look at the provision of a new baseload power station in Townsville. It is the most important industry development that we could have, to make sure that our industry gets cheap, affordable power. Again, what does this Beattie Labor government do? Can you guess? Nothing. They have put it off for another several years. I am very disappointed. I want the people of Townsville-Thuringowa, in the electorate of Herbert, to know that the frustration that I feel as a federal member is that the state government simply says ‘no’ to TownsvilleThuringowa all the time. Reynolds, Mr Tom Ms HOARE (Charlton) (9.46 a.m.)-On4 May this year, I mourned the death and celebrated the life of Tom Reynolds. Tom died on 30 April, in his 97th year. Tom Reynolds was a long-time member of the West Wallsend branch of the Australian Labor Party and he was a good friend to my family and me. Tom was born at Holmesville on 10 October 1904. He spent his school days at Barnsley public school. In his early 20s, he commenced duties as a lampman at Seaham No. 2 colliery, working alongside his father and uncle. Over the next 60 years he worked in finance, insurance and real estate. Tom married Quen Keen in 1927 at Scots Kirk in Hamilton. Their only child, Lisle, was born at West Wallsend. Tom and Quen lived for most of their lives in the Holmesville-West Wallsend area. When Quen died in 1983, Tom lived alone. His last five months were spent as a resident of the Carey Bay Nursing Home, where he expressed to Lisle that he was being very well cared for but that he did miss ‘Westy’. Tom had been an energetic worker for the community. He helped establish the Mount Sugarloaf Recreational Trust, of which he was the foundation secretary, holding office for 16 years from 1971. Tom was an all-time and long-time advocate for Mount Sugarloaf. Although at the age of 70 he was required to retire as a trust member, Tom remained secretary. When he was 83 he decided to relinquish the active secretary’s role. Up until 1995 Tom rarely missed a meeting of the trust as an observer. Tom Reynolds was also a local historian. When he was 85 years old he published a book entitled Early West Wallsend (Westy): its people and places. Thursday, 24 May 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27081 I had the honour of presenting Tom Reynolds with his life membership certificate of the Australian Labor Party, which he was awarded in 1995. For anyone to retain continuity of membership of any organisation for at least 40 years reflects great credit on their personal loyalty and commitment. When that commitment is to the social aspirations of the Labor Party and the labour movement that credit is greater. Tom had always earned the respect and affection of people throughout our region. His vision for the development of the area was reflected in his strong attachment to it. I have no doubt many of his ideas will ultimately be achieved. Tom’s contribution to the historic record of our area has been of outstanding value. I wish to knowledge Tom’s son Lisle for contributing much of the information on Tom’s early life. Vale, Tom Reynolds. Foot-and-Mouth Disease: Funding Package Mr St CLAIR (New England) (9.49 a.m.)-I rise today to discuss something very important to the people of New England and Australia generally-that is, foot-and-mouth disease and the fact that we must do all that we can to prevent this disease coming across our borders. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Howard-Anderson government on making Australia a fortress against such diseases as foot-and-mouth. The $596 million package to strengthen Australia’s border agencies in their work to counter threats from exotic pests and diseases is certainly welcome in my electorate of New England and is certainly something we now look forward to seeing put in place to keep out these sorts of diseases. I raise specifically some of the initiatives in the package, particularly for those in my electorate who contact me regularly and ask what we are doing. I want to put on the record that there is $5.7 million for AQIS until 30 June 2001 to fund extra measures that we introduced back in February due to the UK and European FMD outbreaks; there is $281.4 million from 2001-02 to 2004-05 for AQIS border operations; there is $238.8 million from 2001-02 to 2004-05 for the Australian Customs Service to support AQIS quarantine service-and it is certainly good to see the two agencies working very closely together-and there is $68.8 million for new infrastructure at international airports and international mail centres, and ongoing costs for Australia Post, to allow greater scrutiny of incoming mail, passengers and goods. I have been contacted by people in my electorate who have flown into Australia and have been held up as they have come through customs. I must say it was positive for them. They felt it was important that people coming into this country via the airways and their baggage be given appropriate inspection. There is also $1.2 million over four years to strengthen risk management and preparedness arrangements for FMD-that is absolutely vital in this country-as well as for BSE, being coordinated by a high-level industry and government management group. There is $500,000 for the purchase of reagents to allow the rapid testing of suspected FMD cases as part of Australia’s program. It is a great program. I commend the government for it and I commend the minister Warren Truss, my National Party colleague for Wide Bay. (Time expired) Diversional Therapy Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (9.52 a.m.)-I rise today to record my congratulations for a valuable group of professionals in our community-diversional therapists. I was fortunate to be able to attend the Diversional Therapy Association’s national conference in Launceston last weekend and I want to congratulate all of the organisers, especially Sue and Lee. This was the 23rd conference and it was from all accounts a great success. Diversional therapists contribute greatly to our society. They are focused on providing recreational opportunities for people who face barriers in recreation. Although only recognised comparatively recently as an occupation, it is in fact a profession with a very long tradition. One of the most well-known historical proponents of diversional therapy practised during the Crimean War. Florence Nightingale was dubbed the mother of recreation for her efforts to 27082 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 24 May 2001 provide recreation to war casualties. Today we know that diversional therapy is much broader than a hospital program. Diversional therapists recognise that leisure and recreational experiences are the right of every individual in our community and make an important contribution to our quality of life. There are many people in our community who for a variety of reasons do not get to contribute to society in a way that they would truly like to. They may be people with disabilities, aged people, people in hospitals or people in residential care, and they may be of any age. The one factor that these extremely diverse groups have in common is that they are for a variety of reasons disadvantaged. Some of these people may be physically, intellectually or socially disadvantaged or they may be disadvantaged by their age or their living situation. I believe that many of the reasons for this disadvantage are structural-that is, the way that our society is structured marginalises certain groups of people. We all know what an impact leisure can have on a person’s self-esteem and sense of well-being. I know the wonderful feeling I get when I get to spend time doing an activity that I enjoy. Having access to this kind of leisure is something that the wider community takes for granted as an everyday part of life. Many people would not be aware of the barriers faced when participating. It is an exciting time to see such a high demand for experts in the area of health and leisure. This demand sees diversional therapists working in a wide variety of health care and community settings, implementing and evaluating client centred programs. It is important to recognise how far beyond leisure this field goes. We see therapists working in all areas of aged care services, special schools, public and private hospitals and even community centres in rural settings. The Diversional Therapy Association of Tasmania provides a wonderful service for practitioners in Tasmania. The value of support and networking with colleagues cannot be overstated. A body that provides information on the latest national and international developments is an extremely useful resource. The conference had an interesting and varied program, and I believe it was of great professional benefit to those who attended. The session I remained for was on dementia diagnosis and care and was of particular interest to the attendants. I congratulate Dr George Razay on his presentation. I want to record my thanks to Australia’s diversional therapists, particularly those in Tasmania who are doing an amazing job. In the few seconds left I would like to pass on my condolences to Jo Hopwood, a life member of the ALP who lost another life member of the ALP, Mr Lance ‘Punter’ Hopwood, earlier this year. He was called Punter not because of any great betting fever but because of his great love of football. (Time expired) Retirees: Budget Initiatives before the parliament following on from the excellent budget on Tuesday night. They were the Compensation (Japanese Internment) Bill 2001 and those relating to the one-off payment to the aged and assistance to self-funded retirees. I spoke about aspects of those four bills and the benefit they gave to older Australians, to whom we are able to give assistance now that, as the federal government, we have been able to get the budget into a situation where we actually can reward those various groups. It is very proper that we can. In the time that I have this morning, I want to reinforce some of those points and make some observations on the assistance that they will provide for many of my constituents in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. I will start with the Japanese internment bill. My investigations since I spoke yesterday on that bill have shown that there are approximately 26 surviving POWs in Eden-Monaro who will benefit from the $25,000 one-off tax-free payment. As we all know, the payment is also for the widows and widowers. That will mean that about three times that number of people will come into that category. So, all up, we are talking about",121,Representatives Main Committee
262,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (9.55 a.m.)-Yesterday in the HouseI spoke on the four billsThursday, 24 May 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27083 close to 100 people just in my electorate who will benefit from that. It is such a good thing that we have been able to do this. It should be reinforced that we are able to do it. People have said, ‘Why haven’t previous governments done it?’ It is pretty obvious why it was not done in the previous Labor government years. Basically there was no way they would ever be able to afford it when they were running deficit budgets year after year after year. That is also the case with the assistance for self-funded retirees and pensioners. I certainly have a larger than average number of those in my region. People find the coast a very lovely place to retire. The people that have saved for their retirement and are living off their retirement income, right along the coast and in the various parts of Eden-Monaro, will benefit from it. I also have a very large number of pensioners and part pensioners who will also say thank you for that assistance that we are providing at this time. time for members’ statements has concluded. Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 29 March, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr O’CONNOR (Corio) (9.58 a.m.)-The purpose of the Dried Vine Fruits (Rate of Primary Industry (Customs) Charge) Validation Bill 2001 and the Dried Vine Fruits (Rate of Primary Industry (Excise) Levy) Validation Bill 2001 is to retrospectively validate regulations made on 29 August 2000 to reduce the rate of the levy and export charge on dried vine fruits from $10 to $7 per tonne as of 1 January 2000. This legislation has become necessary because the Attorney-General’s Department has advised the government that the regulation may be invalid. Subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that a regulation will have no effect if it takes effect before the date of notification and has had an adverse impact on a person other than the Commonwealth. In the second reading speech, the minister claimed that the Attorney-General’s Department had originally advised that the regulation would be valid and that new legislation would be unnecessary. But of course that advice has subsequently changed and that is the reason for this legislation being debated at this time in this House. It is a legitimate question to ask what is really going on in the government at this point in time. We know the Howard government is disintegrating and in a terminal state of decay. Despite that situation there is really no reason why we should be debating this sort of legislation today. If the advice and scrutiny had been provided by the government in the first place I suspect the tidying up legislation that we now have before us here would not be necessary. This is not the first time that this tardy government has come into this House to backtrack and cover its tardiness. Having said that, in the context of the House debate on these bills today I would like to make some comment on this industry, which has undergone significant changes in recent years. It is an industry of real importance to the economies of the Sunraysia and Riverland regions of Australia. The issues affecting the dried fruits industry are similar to those that affect all rural industries around Australia-both smaller and larger ones. Market access, the returns to growers, the way in which quality assessment and assurance procedures are instituted within the industry, the considerations of food safety and the structural relationships between industry bodies are all important issues facing the industry today.",124,Representatives Main Committee
263,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with standing order 275A the27084 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 24 May 2001 I do not think the Australian community really has an appreciation of the complexities of the production environment for many rural producers, and I want to take the opportunity in this debate today to comment on some of the skills that producers require to produce a quality product and get it into a demanding domestic and international marketplace. The management of a vineyard requires a range of quite sophisticated skills that are also mirrored in the dried fruits value adding chain. Producers in this industry grow a sensitive product in a variable climate that can play havoc with its production. For example, heavy rain storms in mid-February 1999 and in the year 2000 season caused significant damage to crops and losses in production. In the growing task in this industry, growing grapes with particular skin strength and quality is important in reducing damage in the storage, handling and processing stages of production. Producers also need considerable skill in the use of new mechanical and computer technologies. They need skill in the application of chemicals to the production process and in the control of contaminants. They need skills to understand grading systems and to ensure that quality products make it to ever demanding markets, and also in implementing best practice when it comes to the management of wastes and producing in a sustainable manner. There are other skills typically displayed by producers that I will not elucidate here, but I mention this whole skill issue because I do not believe the wider community really appreciates the sophisticated nature of rural production today. Dried fruit producers along with farmers in other industries are faced daily in their enterprises with challenges that require this impressive array of skills. The consumer in a typical Australian household today demands a quality food product, free from contamination, that is reasonably priced and can be accommodated within limited and constrained household budgets. With the GST putting significant strain on household budgets and the government failing to adequately compensate households for its impact, the above issues are even more important today than they have been before. Indeed, the commercial environment faced by producers in this industry puts demands upon them to reap greater cost savings, to improve fruit quality, to better target the research effort, to develop new products and processes, to put a continuing emphasis on the skilling of producers and, of course, on the more rapid adoption of new technologies. So even in a relatively small industry such as this one in the rural sector these demands on producers are quite significant. I pay tribute today to those producers in this industry for their persistence and their commitment to the further development of their industry. It is really only through their direct efforts at self-improvement that the industry has been able to survive in an increasingly difficult commercial environment. The dried fruits industry in Australia has quite an interesting history and has undergone significant adjustment over time as a result of many commercial pressures. The industry became established in Australia in the 1890s from vines that were grown in England and South Africa. The origins of the industry indeed can be traced back to Iran over 1,000 years ago. There were two areas in Australia, for climatic reasons, that became the focal point for plantings: the Sunraysia district around Mildura and the Riverland district in New South Wales. Output in this industry is dominated by dried sultanas but over the years we have seen important tonnages of raisins and currants produced as well. As I have mentioned, the industry has undergone significant change in recent years as a result of direct commercial pressures, new innovations in plant varieties and handling systems as well as important changes to the industry’s marketing environment. For example, in the 1990s producers switched their production to premium wine grape varieties as the market for Australian wine developed rapidly. Indeed, the growth of the wine industry has been quite spectacular. Australian wine exports, for example, edged into new records for both volumes and values in the year ended November 2000. The volume of wine exported in the last year grew 21 per cent over that of the previous year to reach 307 million litres, and the value grew 24 per cent to reach $1.46 billion. We have seen record amounts of red wines exported. With Thursday, 24 May 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27085 the development of this particular industry has come an increase in the supply of sultanas for wine production.With falling prices, the diversion of produce back to dried fruit production has accelerated slightly because of the oversupply in grape production which is occurring at the moment. Production in the early 1990s stood at around 95,000 tonnes. With the developments in the wine industry, production declined to around 22,000 tonnes in 1999. However, this year we have seen a slight recovery in production. It is estimated to be around 30,000 to 35,000 tonnes at the present time. Innovation in this industry has been an important source of increased returns to growers. It demonstrates in a very specific way the importance of research and development and innovation to the whole of agriculture, including this important regionally based industry. It is clear to me, as it is to producers in this industry, that the future of the whole rural sector will only be secured if we maintain our investment in research and development, in innovation and in skills training in this sector. In a recent speech to the National Farmers Federation in Canberra, I made specific reference to the necessity to create a knowledge agriculture; that is, advanced production and marketing systems that have innovation and sustainability at their core. It is a cause of some disappointment to me when I ponder the five wasted years of coalition governments in this country and the missed opportunity to sustain our position at the front of a pack of developed nations that are gathering pace in their quest to create knowledge based industries and societies. Government member interjecting Mr O’CONNOR-I see the honourable member opposite me queries the statement that I have made, but it is a fact that investment in private research and development and in innovation, education and training has substantially declined since the coalition came to power. Fran Bailey-That’s nonsense. Mr O’CONNOR-The honourable member for McEwen wants to dispute the statistics. She can ponder that on the beach in Queensland after the next election when we retire her from her seat. It is a statistical fact which you want to deny. We are quite happy on this side of the Main Committee to have you, in the language of the President of the Liberal Party, remain in a state of being out of touch with reality, because that is what you are on this issue. You deny the basic statistical facts of your own performance. That is why your Liberal president made the statement that he did. He said that you are members of a mean and tricky government-and I accept that-and, more importantly, he said that you are out of touch. Here the honourable members, disputing the points that I have made, demonstrate once again why the President of the Liberal Party, not the Labor Party, said you are out of touch. The statistical fact is that you have squandered five years in office in failing to position this nation, along with other industrialised nations, at the forefront of the research and development effort as well as education and training and innovation. Most belatedly, having ripped $5 billion out of that particular task, you want to put back $3 billion and you want us to now congratulate you. You want us to congratulate you for taking out $5 billion, putting Australia behind the eight ball and then putting $3 billion back in to save your political skins. I find this quite an extraordinary position for you to adopt. I would prefer some of the breathtaking honesty the President of the Liberal Party gave you when he wrote that very accurate memo saying that you are out of touch. Your statements here today indicate simply how out of touch you are. Even producers in this small industry-who live day to day with the task of producing a product in very difficult circumstances and getting it to the marketplace in a state of quality in order to extract a premium out of it-acknowledge the fact that their livelihoods depend on 27086 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 24 May 2001 research, development and innovation. These are things that you have squandered over the past five years. The benefits of R&D and the adoption of new technologies and innovative practices are not new to the dried fruits industry. For example, we have seen the development and planting of new grape varieties which have produced important gains for growers. New handling and storage systems have improved productivity in this industry. The adoption of trellis drying systems is progressively being adopted and local innovations, such as the Shaw designed swing arm trellis, have been introduced to reduce harvesting costs. The important point to note in this case is the role of local innovation in improving production systems within this industry. I have long held the view that Australian agriculture is a powerhouse of innovative practice. There is a very important role to be played by government, in cooperation with producers and industry, in unlocking that innovative potential to ensure that the benefits of homegrown innovation are realised in each individual industry within the rural sector. We have also seen dramatic changes to the marketing structures and institutional type frameworks that have been embraced by the industry over the past 10 to 15 years. I am proud of the role of previous Labor governments and ministers such as Kerin and Crean in opening up the industry and producers to market signals more directly. Of course, the process of institutional reform has been continued by the government. That has been a process that we in opposition have not obstructed at all. The legislation that we are debating here today-while not substantial in the sense of many other pieces of legislation that might be considered by the House; basically it is a technical bill-does give us all the opportunity to say a few words about some of the industries in Australian agriculture that do not perhaps get the credit that they deserve. This is an important regionally based industry. The people who grow in it are innovative. They are very skilful. They do produce in difficult climatic and marketing circumstances. It is important for the Australian community to appreciate the skills and effort that are put in by primary producers in these and other industries. The opposition will be supporting the passage of this legislation through this Committee and the House. FRAN BAILEY (McEwen) (10.19 a.m.)-Probably one of the few things that the member for Corio said that I would agree with related to the importance of some of our small agricultural industries like the dried vine fruits industry. One of the things that the member for Corio failed to do, in having a go at the government, was to face up to the legacy that his former government left many of these small rural based industries. When we came into government in 1996, we had a legacy of $80 billion worth of debt. These small rural based industries were lucky to hang on to the family farm when they were struggling with interest rates of 22 per cent. The member for Corio talked about innovation. There was no innovation in those years prior to 1996. I refer to one simple fact. With respect to these small rural industries getting their product to market, one of the most important things they needed was access to a decent road from the farm gate out onto a highway. It has only been since this federal government put all of this money into the Roads to Recovery package, more than $1 billion worth, that these small rural industries have had the opportunity to get their product from the farm gate to a highway without the product being ruined because the roads were in such a deplorable state. It is all very well for the member for Corio to stand up in this place and have a go at the government, but the facts are there. In 1996 many small rural industries like the dried vine fruits industry were struggling because of lack of attention by the federal government. I am pleased to say that that has been corrected, and I will talk a little later about some of those measures. The purpose of the Dried Vine Fruits (Rate of Primary Industry (Customs) Charge Validation Bill 2001 and the Dried Vine Fruits (Rate of Primary Industry (Excise) Levy Validation Thursday, 24 May 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27087 Bill 2001 is to validate previous changes to the excise levy and customs charges for dried vine fruits. In late 1999 the Australian dried fruits industry requested reductions in both the rate of excise levy and the customs charge from $10 to $7 per tonne in both cases to prevent the excessive accumulation of funds. The government agreed with the industry’s request. There is a point of difference that I must highlight. When small rural industries such as the dried vine fruits industry come to the government with a good idea, with good purpose and goodwill, this government listens. It does not impose the government’s will on small industries; it actually listens to what industry has to say. In agreeing with the industry’s request, it made the reductions retrospective to January 2001. Subsequent legal advice indicated that the retrospectivity of the regulation of the changes to the charges might be invalid. The bills that are being presented today are designed to correct this possible problem with retrospectivity and validate the excise levy and customs charge on dried vine fruit. As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry stated in his second reading speech, the monetary size of any refunds will be minimal. The bills do not create any new administrative burden for levy payers, and the only rights adversely affected are those of the Commonwealth. What a change that marks: there is a stark contrast between post-1996 and pre-1996. The dried vine fruits industry covers sultanas, currants and raisins. The Australian dried fruits industry started in the early 1900s in the Mildura region of Victoria and was made possible by the development of irrigation. There are also areas of production in the Riverland area of South Australia and there is a small presence in Western Australia. The focus of the production has been on sultanas, currants and raisins. Angas Park is probably recognised as the most successful dried fruit company in Australia. Angas markets 15,000 tonnes of dried fruit each year from the Barossa Valley and Riverland, Victoria’s Sunraysia and New South Wales’s Riverina. The sultanas, raisins and currants are mostly treated with drying oils, then dried in the sun. There are also grape varieties that are mechanically dehydrated without the use of drying oils. Scientific methods have played a large part in the previous success of the industry. Research has been undertaken into soil, irrigation practices, drainage, viticultural techniques and drying processes-in stark contrast, I have to say, to what the member for Corio was asserting here earlier in this chamber. This has resulted in reduced labour input and lower costs. What was once done by an army of fruit pickers who painstakingly picked the grapes and then laid them out to dry is now accomplished by just one person by utilising the Shaw harvesting system. The dried fruit industry has, unfortunately, been in decline. In 1992 growers produced more than 91,000 tonnes of sultanas; however, last year production dropped to around only 22,000 tonnes. Until recently, dried vine fruit was the highest value horticultural export, but it has been eclipsed now by wine. Export figures for dried vine fruits have been kept since 1925. Exports reached their peak in the seven-year period from 1960 to 1966, with total tonnage exported totalling 67,288 tonnes. Unfortunately, since the 1980s there has been a steady decline in dried vine fruit exports. Exports have dropped from a seven-year average of 41,000 tonnes in 1988 to 1994 to a low of approximately 4,960 tonnes in 1999. Exports of season 2000-01 fruit are expected to be low again due to the poor season associated with unfavourable weather conditions in late 1999. The marketing outlook for 2000-01 continues to be challenging, with the American, Turkish and Iranian industries harvesting near record crops and placing supply pressure on world markets, including our domestic market. It is unfortunate that Kelloggs recently gave Australian dried vine fruit producers an ultimatum to cut $300 to $400 a tonne off the price of sultanas or they would buy from overseas. It is disturbing to hear that Sultana Bran will soon contain fruit from Iran, not Australia. This 27088 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 24 May 2001 is purely an economic decision and is not indicative of the superior quality of Australia’s dried vine fruits. The federal government has acknowledged in the budget the importance of agricultural development and it will work to enhance and protect industries, such as the dried vine fruit industry that faces the ever present threat of disease and pest. A $596 million package has been announced to strengthen Australia’s border agencies in their work to counter threats from exotic pests and diseases. I repeat that this government is only able to put this level of funding into our agricultural industries because we have repaid $50 billion of the debt that we inherited in 1996 when we came into government. Further, $519 million will be provided in increased funding to support the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Customs Service, and $68.8 million will be provided for new infrastructure to assist international airports, seaports, mail centres and Australia Post achieve a target of 100 per cent screening of all mail and cargo entering Australia. These are very important measures. Yesterday I was speaking with delegates from the European Union, who are in Australia, about the threat of disease and pests in their agricultural environment. They had nothing but praise for what we in this country are doing in prevention, and the minister at the table is to be congratulated for his commitment to that. As the delegates were saying to me yesterday, Australia is free from many of the pests and diseases found in other countries. It must be kept that way, and this government is doing everything in its power to do so. Our clean and green reputation is largely responsible for $124 billion worth of agricultural exports every year. Major markets for Australian dried vine fruit exports include Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. It is important that these markets be protected for the sustainable future of our region. I have previously made mention of the fact that the industry was largely made possible in the Sunraysia area by irrigation, and to this day it draws heavily on the Murray. However, this has created a salinity problem. The National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality is part of a commitment from the Commonwealth of $700 million over seven years. In the 2001-02 budget the Commonwealth is committing $65 million to the initial stages of the national action plan. This plan represents the first concerted and targeted national strategy to address salinity and water quality problems-two of the most significant issues confronting Australia’s rural industries and regional communities and its total environment. The key objectives of the national action plan are to prevent, stabilise and reverse trends in salinity, particularly dryland salinity affecting agricultural production; conserve our unique environment and community assets; improve water quality; and secure reliable water supplies for human, agricultural and industrial uses with regard for our environment. The national action plan brings a combination of incentives, funding for on-ground action and access to technical assistance, information and policy settings to secure the long-term future of our land and water resources. The federal government is also acknowledging the need for partnership in agricultural development-$26.4 million will be provided over the next four years for a new program to support government-industry partnerships in key agricultural regions. The agricultural development plan program will help to revitalise agriculture in regions under stress. Diversification, innovation and improved natural resource management will be the key elements of the program. The dried vine fruit industry will, of course, have access to this program. None of this could have been presented to the Australian agricultural industry had this government not shown the will and the resolve to pay back $50 billion of the $80 billion debt that we inherited in 1996. None of it would have been possible. While this is a relatively small and technical piece of legislation, this small agricultural industry supports, importantly, regional Thursday, 24 May 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27089 communities, and this government is totally committed to ensuring that regional communities get the very best of assistance. I commend this legislation to the House. reply-I thank those members who have contributed to the debate on this legislation-other than the member for Corio, who did not really make much of a contribution to the debate. The member for McEwen gave a very comprehensive summary of the dried fruits industry and its importance, particularly in Victoria and South Australia. She obviously spoke from first-hand knowledge in that regard, and dealt comprehensively with some of the broader issues that are affecting this industry and others in the agricultural sector. The reference to the initiatives in the budget concerning quarantine and the importance of addressing salinity for water quality are certainly key issues for the dried fruit industry. Most of the dried fruit industry is dependent upon irrigation, and therefore water quality and salinity are key issues. In the areas where the industry has prospered over the years there has certainly been a keen focus on ensuring the skilful and careful use of available water supplies to preserve the industry for the future. As speakers have mentioned, it is not a large industry and unfortunately it is an industry that has been in decline. However, there has been some significant new investment in the industry. I note that in 1999 Angus Park, a fruit processing company, announced a $5 million project for the Sunraysia. They are therefore expressing a vote of confidence in the future of the industry. These sorts of significant developments help to provide a focus for the future of the industry. It is vital for all Australian industries to have access to the kind of environment that enables them to invest with confidence. The dried fruit industry benefits, as other industries do, from lower interest rates, lower inflation, and also from the additional effort that will be put into protecting its disease free status, and that of others in Australia. The Dried Vine Fruits (Rate of Primary Industry (Customs) Charge) Validation Bill 2001 and the Dried Vine Fruits (Rate of Primary Industry (Excise) Levy) Validation Bill 2001 are, as speakers have mentioned, relatively technical in nature and will not fundamentally change the future direction of the industry. However, the bills have provided the parliament with an opportunity to talk about an Australian industry which perhaps deserves more public attention than it actually receives. The bills seek to amend the Primary Industries Excise Levies Regulations 1999 and the Primary Industries Customs Charges Regulations 2000 to clarify the rate of excise levy on dried vine fruits that were processed between 1 January and 1 October 2000, and the rate of customs charge on dried vine fruits that were exported from 1 January 2000. The bills have the effect of retrospectively reducing the levy and charge paid by dried fruit processors for the purposes of marketing dried fruit both in Australia and internationally. Up until 30 June 1999 there was an excise levy and customs charge imposed on dried vine fruits under the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 and the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987. These old acts were repealed on 1 July 1999 at the commencement of the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 and the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999. The repeal of the earlier acts would normally mean that regulations made under them would cease to have effect. However, the regulations were kept in force by transitional arrangements under the new act. It was agreed to reduce the rate of levy and charge on dried vine fruits from $10 per tonne to $7 per tonne, and backdate it to 1 January 2000. The transitional regulations were repealed and the main regulations were amended to make the rate of levy and charge $7 per tonne. As the amendments were carried out after 1 January 2000 they were necessarily retrospective. The regulations imposing the reduced levy and charge rate were later deemed invalid because of subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which invalidates any regulation that is expressed to take effect at a time before it is gazetted and operates to the disadvantage of any person other than the Commonwealth. This anomaly was noted after the various repeals and amendments were effected, and subsequent advice recommended that the",125,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.33 a.m.)-in27090 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 24 May 2001 prudent course was to validate the reduction via the proposed bills. The bills do not create any new administrative or financial burden to levy payers. It is likely that a few small refunds will be payable to growers who paid the higher $10 per tonne rate, but the quantum is expected to be minimal. I thank the Committee for its consideration of this matter and commend the bill to the Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Motion (by Mr Truss) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Political Parties: Public Disclosure of Donations that $100,000 has been given by the failed insurance company HIH to the Free Enterprise Foundation. The general public will, of course, be outraged at the enormous salaries that HIH executives paid each other and the great waste involved in their moneys being paid over principally to one political party, the Liberal Party. I raise the matter of the Free Enterprise Foundation and the Greenfields Foundation because the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was to have held a public inquiry into these matters. Of course, this inquiry has been buried while the committee has chosen to pursue matters which probably are the most politically biased of any reference that has ever been made to a standing committee. Apart from the issue of the $100,000 donation to the Free Enterprise Foundation, we need to consider what the issue is that parliamentarians should be concerned about with the Free Enterprise and Greenfields foundations. The issue that this parliament has long decided should be the main issue of public policy in these areas is that there should be public disclosure of political donations-that there should be transparency. These two organisations have been established in order to cover up these kinds of things-to prevent transparency and to prevent public disclosure. That is why, when this committee eventually revisits that inquiry into the disclosure of electoral funding. I am sure the opposition, with forensic interest, will attempt to see that these matters are brought to the public’s attention and that matters of public disclosure regarding these two organisations are raised. A level playing field should exist in Australia on these kinds of issues. What has happened in the meantime while this inquiry is not being considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters? Is it concerned with matters of great principle raised, say, by the former Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam, in his memorable speech to the Labor Party centenary dinner-four-year terms and issues like that? Of course not. The committee has been involved, as I said, in one of the most biased references in an attempt to be useful to the government in attacking the opposition. What has been its record in the last few weeks and months while it has been conducting its current inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll? It has attempted to influence the Queensland elections at a time when there was a judicial inquiry-the Shepherdson inquiry into matters relating to the integrity of the electoral roll. It has run interference for the Minister for Sport and Tourism on a matter involving the Penrith City Council elections, so pithily explained by Senator Hutchins yesterday. The minister for sport, the Liberal campaign manager for the Penrith City Council elections, claimed that she did not know about front parties being run by people out of her office, she did not know about people living in her house at certain times; she did not know about them being registered in different telephone books at different addresses. She knows so little that she will eventually be known as the Sergeant Schultz of the Liberal Party.",131,Representatives Main Committee
265,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10.40 A.m.),"In the last few weeks it has been revealedThursday, 24 May 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27091 The Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, in complete defiance of what has normally happened under previous Liberal chairpersons who have been much fairer in their running of this committee, has repeatedly used his casting vote to prevent the minister for sport being called before the committee-in fact, to prevent any matter being considered in an even handed way. We have also had the disgraceful accusation raised by Mr Lynton Crosby, from the Liberal Party national office, that more than 130,000 innocent Queenslanders are guilty of electoral rorts because there were more than four people with different names registered at different houses. Of course, it would never have occurred to them that this could involve students, people with Asian surnames or people living in nursing homes. To accuse Queenslanders of this is an absolute disgrace. I conclude by making this point: I am concerned about the Liberal Party’s expressed interest and therefore this committee’s possible continued interest in stopping younger people from registering to vote during the five days after the electoral roll is closed. This would disenfranchise more than 70,000 young Australians and it is something that this parliament should definitely oppose. Caged Bears many people in my electorate-an issue that should be of concern to all Australians. I refer to the treatment of caged bears in countries such as Cambodia and China. I want to highlight a group that has been established which has collected petitions, hoping to change the plight of many of these bears which have spent their entire lives being treated in a cruel and inhumane fashion. I refer to Free the Bears Inc. The New South Wales representative of that group is Mrs Lorraine Van Epen of Umina in my electorate. She has written to me seeking to table 8,000 signatures on 4,100 petitions to the government of Cambodia and almost 2,000 petitions to the governments of Cambodia and China, appealing to the governments of those countries to end the cruel practice of having caged bears and using them for research, and even using them on menus and that sort of thing. It is quite disgusting. Unfortunately, the petitions that she offered to provide to me are petitions which are addressed to the governments of those countries. The wording, of course, would not suit the requirements of this House to be able to be tabled as an official petition. I wanted to talk today about the work that these people from all over Australia are doing in order to try to highlight the plight of some of these animals that are being caged for their entire lives. I have examples here of some of the issues. The petition which people have signed reads: We, the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully request that the Cambodian Government takes urgent steps to protect Cambodian Bear species from poaching, exploitation, suffering & cruelty. We urge you to take note that these bears are an endangered species and are at an extremely critical and vulnerable stage. As I have said, the organisation have collected some 4,000 signatures from Australian citizens. I commend them on the work they are doing in highlighting this terrible practice through a number of countries. I know that they are being successful in highlighting the issue. They are being successful in raising money to establish sanctuaries for some of the bears that have been released from cages. I also know that they have been successful in arranging for medical treatment for some of the bears that have been severely mistreated to the stage where many of them do not survive. With special medical and veterinary treatment, some have been able to survive. Most have been so badly mistreated that, even when they do survive, they cannot be returned to the wild and have to be cared for for the rest of their lives. I was given an article on this by the Free the Bears Inc. of New South Wales, and it shows a bear that has spent 10 years in a small cage without ever being allowed to roam free. It is a disgraceful practice. I will do anything I can to highlight this practice, my concerns, the concerns of some 8,000 people who have signed the petition and the concerns of the many people that have",132,Representatives Main Committee
266,Mr Lloyd (Robertson) (10.45 A.m.),"TodayI wish to raise an issue that is of concern to27092 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 24 May 2001 joined the Free the Bears Inc. Fund. I commend their efforts. I will continue to highlight their efforts, and the plight of these bears, throughout the world. Shipping: Oil Spills Ms JANN McFARLANE (Stirling) (10.59 a.m.)-I commend the member for Robertson for drawing attention to the petition. I too have tabled petitions in the House for Free the Bears Inc., a group based in the electorate of Stirling. I acknowledge the energy and work of the group to highlight the plight of the bears and I commend their convenor, Mary Hutton. I rise today to alert the House to the fact that this year commemorates the 10th anniversary of a major oil spill involving the Kirki. On 21 July 1991, the 97,000-tonne Greek tanker Kirki-owned by Kirki Shipping Corporation SA and managed by Mayamar Marine Enterprises of Liberia SA-lost its bow off the coast of Western Australia. During the incident and the subsequent tow of the tanker to a safe haven some 17,280 tonnes of light crude was lost. To commemorate the anniversary of this disaster, the Maritime Union of Australia is sponsoring a surfing carnival under the theme Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas. The event will be held on the weekend of 14 and 15 July 2001 at the Cottesloe beach for long-board surfers who will compete for the inaugural Kirki Cup. In addition to being a fun weekend of surfing, the event will also be an opportunity for the Maritime Union of Australia to campaign to raise public awareness about the silent invasion of the Australian coast by substandard foreign shipping. I congratulate the Maritime Union of Australia on their initiative and genuine concern for the safety of our maritime workers and marine environment. Sadly, this is a task that the government seems reluctant to do. Clearly, this government is asleep at the helm. The sad reality is that foreign ships with structural defects serious enough to endanger the lives of crew and voyage permits by this federal government to move cargo around the Australian coast. I wish the surfers well and I trust that, in addition to being a successful event, the union will be successful in raising awareness for maritime safety issues in the minds of the public. For those across Australia who would like to go, there is a very simple way of getting involved in this event and being a competitor. The event has a number of categories. People can register their intention to compete with Whale Bone Classic, PO Box 123, Cottesloe, Western Australia 6011. This is going to be a wonderful day, a wonderful event. The two surf clubs in my electorate, the Scarborough Surf Lifesaving Club and the Trigg Island Surf Lifesaving Club, are both helping to promote and send teams to this event. As well, Surfing WA, which is the peak body for surf lifesaving clubs in Western Australia, is supporting and publicising the event. The community loves events such as this because, as well as having an environmental aspect-a green aspect-to them, they also have a fun aspect. This event will also have wonderful prize money. That is not the main reason why people become involved, but it is very expensive, particularly if you travel, to participate in these events. The prize money is a way of compensating people who take the effort not just to participate but to publicise the issue of safe ships, cleaner seas. If we do not work on these issues and are not aware of them, the wonderful coastline of Australia-the marine life, the bird life, the seals, the mammals-will be devastated. It will be devastating if any of these ships carrying large loads of oil sink anywhere off our coastline. We are the largest island continent in the world. We have a very large coastline. Together, we can save it from the type of pollution that ships such as the Kirki have the potential to create. When that ship lost its tonnes of crude oil it did some damage to the environment, but the major potential threat was the heavier oil in some storage tanks. Had that ship gone down, the coastline along the beaches of Perth would have been devastated for many years. It would not have been easy to clean up. I am pleased to publicise this event. I Thursday, 24 May 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 27093 would invite everyone to go back to their electorates and encourage their surfers to book in, get involved and have fun, and also do something for our environment. Trade: Japan lia Japan Business Cooperation Committee held a conference. That committee is the most important non-governmental group bringing the two nations together. In the context of this conference-which is a regular event; and this time it took place in Australia-there was some academic and other commentary concerning the relationship between our two countries. Two academics in particular said very stridently that the relationship is very stale. They said that nothing is happening, it is a fairly old-fashioned relationship and that, therefore, ‘something needs to be done’. You often hear the phrase ‘something needs to be done’ in the corridors where public policy is made. In fact, we probably utter that phrase several times a week here in Canberra about a multitude of topics. In the case of the relationship between Australia and Japan, I suggest that there are a couple of areas where we could pursue something slightly different in terms of cooperation and policy than has been thought of before. I speak in particular of the most difficult issue between the two countries-trade protectionism. For years the political system within Japan has been based on the protection of very inefficient agricultural practices-that is, Japan’s farmers are operating on a scale that is far too small to compete. The notion has been brought into the argument that protecting Japanese agricultural production is buttressing a way of life-that it has some sort of social role in keeping Japan stable and so forth. It is very easy to say that, but the system of patronage and support within the dominant political group, the so-called Liberal Democratic Party in Japan-and it is less a party than a collection of various agricultural, industrial and, in some cases, bureaucratic interests-is built very strongly on protecting farmers. Likewise, there is quite a clear gerrymander in the weight given to votes in country versus urban electorates. That is astonishing in the modern world. However, the blunt reality is that this is not going to change soon, and so the interests of Australian agriculture and Japanese consumers are not going to be easily meshed in the future. Some things are happening on the border of this, outside the politics. For example, in the eighties and nineties, large supermarket chains, fed by very cheap capital, lost their heads and went about establishing as many new branches of supermarkets as they possibly could. They bought land in the new suburbs, threw in their brand, erected supermarkets, extended their existing inefficient distribution systems to these supermarkets, and just sat back and thought, ‘We’ll try and compete with each other for as much market share as possible.’ Now that there is a very severe credit squeeze in Japan-it has been on foot for years now-the supermarket chains are finally being forced to divest themselves of these hopeless new supermarkets on the edges of the cities, and so they are up for sale. The opportunity arises, therefore, for Australian investors-farmers or anyone else-to literally buy themselves a supermarket in Japan. Likewise, many other distressed assets-commercial buildings, golf courses, and so forthare for sale. Surprisingly, there are no barriers to foreign investors buying them. One thing that we should think about-and not necessarily as a government intervening to encourage it-is to see some purchases of shelf space, if you like, for Japanese consumers directly by Australian farmers, producers, intermediaries and so forth. Two large foreign retail chains have set up mega-stores in Japan-Carrefour, a French chain, and Costco, which I think is American-and they are revolutionising the distribution chain in terms of fresh food, often importing it, despite the difficulties at the border, and putting it on the shelves very attractively. In the past it was said that it was impossible for a foreigner to tempt the Japanese consumer, but that is being proved wrong. There is a lot of advantage there waiting for Australian farmers and food producers if capital can be mobilised and some decisions can be",133,Representatives Main Committee

(Time expired) Calwell Electorate: Aircraft Noise Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (10.59 a.m.)-I wish to raise a matter which is of critical importance in my electorate of Calwell. It concerns the increasing noise levels arising from the operations of Melbourne’s Tullamarine airport. The airport is in my electorate, and about 20 suburbs surrounding the airport are also in my electorate. In recent times, especially in the area of my electorate covered by the city of Brimbank, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of flights over homes. This has affected the living conditions of many people in the city of Brimbank and in my electorate. I have received many complaints about this matter. A meeting was held on 11 April at Keilor in my electorate to discuss this issue. I initiated that meeting and it was attended by more than 30 residents. They discussed the issue and the impact that the flights were having. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, Melbourne’s Tullamarine airport does not have a night curfew. I am not pressing for a night curfew, but I am saying that between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. every effort should be made for flights to be directed into paths which do not fly over people’s homes. That seems to me to be an eminently reasonable request, and it is possible at Melbourne airport because there are other routes that are over green fields not homes. When I raised this issue, more residents began contacting me and telling me about their circumstances and some of the things that were happening. I have had discussions with the Melbourne Airport Authority and Airservices Australia about what the actual situation is. Both of those organisations have confirmed that, in the last 18 months, there has been a very significant increase in the number of flights over the Keilor/Brimbank city area and over people’s homes. The explanations that were given for this varied from authority to authority. Part of the reason is that there has been an increase in traffic into Melbourne airport in general, and that increase is expected to continue quite dramatically in the next few years. In fact, the traffic is expected to more than double. If that is going to be the case, then the issue of the protection of people’s rights in terms of aircraft noise, especially between the hours of 11.00 p.m. and 6 a.m., is very important. I should point out that, in the middle of last year, the state government of Victoria declared certain rezoning. Well, they do not call it rezoning, they call it overlays, but effectively it is rezoning. It is a declaration of new areas which are now overlays which aeroplanes are going to fly over and where they will create noise. These new areas had been suggested earlier and there had been some public discussion, but the public discussions had not been concluded before the state government actually made a determination and decided to impose this strategy. I am going to need to do more research on this matter because some aspects of it are very disturbing and need to be discussed. I hope to raise them again in the parliament.

Ballarat City Council and its citizens thank him for his continued support of Ballarat, particularly in the areas of tourism, sport and lifestyle. Steve Moneghetti is undoubtedly one of our greatest ambassadors and we are deeply proud that he and his family call Ballarat home. That was signed by Councillor David Vendy, the Mayor. While I have spoken a lot about Steve in this House over the years, I actually want to pay tribute to someone who in my view is equally special, and that is his wife, Tanya. Tanya has been an absolutely fantastic support to Steve since they married. They are now raising a family and a lot of that responsibility has fallen on to Tanya’s shoulders. So in some respects, Steve’s successes have very much been Tanya’s successes as well, and I am sure the House will want me to acknowledge the fantastic role that she has played. A celebration dinner was held in Melbourne prior to the one in Ballarat on 2 May, but the Ballarat night was really Ballarat’s way of thanking Steve Moneghetti for his contribution. This will horrify some members, but Mona has calculated that he ran something like 150,000 kilometres over a 20-year sporting career. You and I, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick-I should not speak for you, I suppose-would be battling to do a couple of those 150,000 kilometres. So he has put an enormous amount of work into his life, which of course has been his running. We had a terrific group of people at the night in Ballarat. The Victorian Governor, John Landy, was there and he spoke at some lengths. Steve received messages from the Prime Minister and from Steve Bracks, the Victorian premier. This was the Prime Minister’s message to Steve: You’re a great sporting figure for our country and I know you’ve been a great son of Ballarat. Thanks Steve for what you’ve done for Australian sport. Steve Bracks said: You’re a fantastic ambassador for Australia and your promotion of Ballarat is unparalleled. What a fantastic career you’ve had. There were some terrific views from a large range of people, and I know that those opposite also support me in thanking Steve Moneghetti for his contribution. Cathy Freeman was there, and she said to Steve: Mona, thank you so much for all the memories. You have always been there for everybody and you will be greatly missed. Ron Clarke also said to Steve: You reach legend status when you make a difference. Steve’s made a huge difference. He’s a great sportsman and he’s a really great bloke. Also speaking about Steve were Chris Wardlaw; Lee Troop, another Olympic marathoner; Jim Murphy, a former sportswriter for the Courier; and Ian Cover, a media personality and fellow parliamentary colleague. I should also say that Garry Lyon-whose footy I have certainly admired-was in attendance. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will personally know the name Garry Lyon and will be aware of his fantastic contribution. Another fellow who was really close to Steve was Peter Howley, his physiotherapist, and he said: We know he’s a great athlete. He’s a good bloke and a man of the highest character. Thanks for the memories. Rex Hollioake was another one who spoke at the dinner. Everyone spoke very, very highly of Steve’s contribution. I have 32 seconds left and I will finish with Steve’s signature statement. I want to thank Steve Moneghetti and again thank the Ballarat Sportsmen’s Club for allowing 27096 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 24 May 2001 the Ballarat community to contribute.

(2) Can he provide details of anticipated future aircraft noise and traffic congestion at KSA for 2010. (3) Is it a fact that the KSA noise insulation project was supposed to have by now insulated residences against 2010 levels of noise to the AS 2021 standard; if not, at what standard is noise insulation supposed to be afforded to Sydney residents. (4) Did the November 1995 Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney recommend that a new authorised maximum capacity contour map for KSA be prepared to apply both to the acquisition and noise insulation scheme (p.264) and that the noise insulation scheme be extended to all residences within the 25 ANEF contour as included on the maximum capacity map (p265); if so, (a) has the new authorised maximum capacity contour map for KSA has been prepared and (b) will he provide (i) a copy of the map and accompanying working documents and (ii) details of how and when the noise insulation will be implemented. (5) Did the November 1995 Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney recommend that noise monitoring at Australian airports should be independently supervised by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency (p.274); if so, has the recommendation been, or will it be implemented; if not, why not. (6) How many residences in the Sydney metropolitan area are located within the Year 2000 25 ANEF contour. (7) How many residences in the Sydney metropolitan area have thus far been insulated within the noise insulation scheme. (8) Have all these residences been insulated in compliance with the Australian Standard for Aircraft Noise in Residences (AS 2021). (9) Will he guarantee that there will be no watering down of the existing AS 2021. (10) Will he never permit the entry into Australian airspace any of the American hush-kitted jets that the European Union is to ban from European airports in the near future; if not, why not. (1) It would be appreciated if the Honourable Member could clarify his question. (2) The Final Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek forecast that total aircraft movements into and out of the Sydney basin (excluding traffic at secondary airports such as Bankstown) was expected to grow to about 380,000 by 2009-10. These forecasts assumed continuation of prevailing industry trends, including aircraft size and loadings. Actual growth in aircraft movements at Sydney Airport in the period through to 2010 will be affected by the cap of 80 movements per hour established under the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997, by the proposed changes to the Slot Management Scheme published on 27 March 2001 and by the commercial response of the airlines, including decisions about fleet utilisation and scheduling. (3) No. The Sydney Airport Noise Amelioration Program was announced in November 1994 as a ten year program to insulate and voluntarily acquire residences and certain public buildings in areas of high aircraft noise exposure around Sydney Airport. In December 1994, the timeframe for completion of the program was set as three years. Boundaries for residential insulation at the time were set on the basis of an Australian Noise Exposure Forecast map for the year 2010. That map is not relevant to the operations of the Airport under the Long Term Operating Plan which was in-",136,Representatives Main Committee
269,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:troduced in 1997. Residential insulation boundaries have been varied on a number of occasions to reflect experience in implementation of the Plan. Because the insulation program involves the insulation of existing building stock of variable construction it is not possible to meet the internal design noise levels recommended in AS2021-2000 in all cases. (4) Yes. Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney did make these recommendations. The Government has no current proposal to extend the scope of the residential insulation program beyond the 30 ANEI contour. (5) The Government’s response to that recommendation was that responsibility for noise monitoring should remain with the Transport and Regional Services portfolio. Airservices Australia produces and widely disseminates detailed summary reports using information from the Airport’s noise and flight path monitoring system. These documents are open to full public scrutiny. The Government does not consider that an additional supervisory role by Environment Australia is necessary. (6) An Australian Noise Exposure Index for the Year 2000 is currently being finalised by Airservices Australia. I am advised that this will be provided to members of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, including the Honourable Member, in the near future and will contain information on the population within different noise exposure zones. (7) 3,384 (as at 20 February 2001) (8) No. Because the insulation program involves the insulation of existing building stock of variable construction it is not practicable to meet the internal design noise levels recommended in AS20212000 in all cases. (9) I am not in a position to give such a guarantee as the production of Australian Standards is the responsibility of Standards Australia which is a body independent of Government. (10) The Government’s policy position on hush kitted aircraft is still being developed. My Department issued a Discussion Paper last year about concerns relating to the potential influx of recertificated (hush kitted) jet aircraft into Australia. The issue is of concern to the Government. These concerns were the basis of the position Australia took at the recent International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) meeting held in Montreal in January this year. CAEP is tasked with establishing standards and practices to apply to international aviation. Australia’s proposal included an early ban on recertificated jet aircraft. While agreement was not reached within CAEP on this proposal, the matter is to be addressed further in the ICAO context during the year. It is proposed to await the outcome of the ICAO process after which my Department will be developing a proposal on the issue of recertificated jet aircraft for my consideration. In the meantime, the Discussion Paper issued by my Department and subsequent discussions held with industry and other interested parties have sent a clear message about the concerns held by the Government over these types of aircraft. Defence Integrated Distribution System (Question No. 2411) Dr Martin asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 1 March 2001: (1) Who are the companies that have submitted tenders for the Defence Integrated Distribution Scheme (DIDS). (2) How many of those companies are Australian or have Australian partners, and who are those partners. (3) What sum has each tenderer spent in support of their bids. (4) When will an announcement be made about the successful tenderer. (5) Which electoral divisions are affected by the DIDS program. (1) The companies that have submitted tenders for the Defence Integrated Distribution System (DIDS) are: NexGen Logistics Pty Ltd; Integrated Defence Logistics (IDL) Pty Ltd; Defence In House Option (IHO); ADI-Linfox; Force Logistics; and TenixToll Defence Logistics. (2) All of the joint venture consortia are Australian owned. The consortia and their partners are: NexGen Logistics Pty Ltd is a joint venture company between BAE Systems, Honeywell, and Caterpillar Logistic Services; Integrated Defence Logistics (IDL) Pty Ltd is a joint venture company between Transfield Pty Ltd and TNT Australia Pty Ltd; Defence In House Option (IHO) and ARN Logistics Pty Ltd; ADI-Linfox is a joint venture company between ADI Limited and Linfox Transport Pty Ltd; Force Logistics is a joint venture between Mayne Nickless Ltd (MPG Logistics) and Serco Australia Pty Ltd; and TenixToll Defence Logistics is a joint venture between Tenix Pty Ltd and Toll Holdings Ltd. (3) The Defence Department has neither requested nor been provided with details of the sum each tenderer has spent in support of their bids. (4) An announcement on the successful tenderer will be made when consideration by Government has been completed. (5) Effects on electoral divisions will not be known until the outcome of the tender process. Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Air 2000 Flight (Question No. 2417) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 1 March 2001: (1) Did the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) approve an international flight from Ayers Rock to Jakarta on 17 January 2001. (2) Was the flight operated by Air 2000 and was it a Boeing 757 aircraft carrying passengers; if so, how many passengers. (3) Was the flight approved by CASA with no recognised aviation fire and rescue services available; if so, is such an approval a breach of CASA’s policy and the international regulations set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. (4) What is the nature of the fire service vehicle available at Ayers Rock and do the local volunteer fire officers and firefighters have the aviation experience or recognised aviation ability in line with the standards and competencies required by the Australasian Fire Authorities Council and CASA. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised the following: (1) No. However, a flight from Ayers Rock to Jakarta was approved on 30 January 2001. (2) The flight was operated in a B757 by Air 2000. CASA is not aware of the number of passengers that were on board at the time of the flight. (3) The flight was approved by CASA. On a previous occasion Air 2000 had been advised that no suitable fire fighting facilities are available at Ayers Rock. On this particular occasion Air 2000 requested contact details to enable them to arrange both fire cover and customs and immigration facilities. This information was provided. The approval was issued in accordance with CASA policy for an international charter operation.",139,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
270,Mr Reith,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,141,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
271,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The international standards for the provision of aerodrome rescue and fire fighting services are found in Aerodromes, Annex 14 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chapter 9, dated 4 November 1999, as ‘International Standards and Recommended Practices’. The responsibility for arranging these services rests with the aerodrome operator and/or the operator of the flight. Australian Rescue and Fire Fighting Service regulations are currently being developed, to be administered by CASA. (4) There is a local fire fighting service at Ayers Rock, however, this does not have appropriate training or equipment to provide aviation fire fighting services. Second Sydney Airport: Sydney West (Question No. 2458) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 27 March 2001: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an item titled Singapore to bid for Sydney airport that appeared in the 14 March 2001 edition of the Sydney Morning Herald. (2) Has the proposal known as Badgerys Creek formally been withdrawn by him as proponent of that proposal. (3) Was Badgerys Creek ruled out earlier this year and was it expected that the sale would be handled quickly; if so, by what administrative process did this ruling take place. (4) Pursuant to the provisions of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, has the proposal known as Sydney West Airport at Badgerys Creek been formally withdrawn as a proposal under that Act. (5) Must the named proposed purchaser of the lease for Sydney Airport, namely either Changi Airport or its subsidiary Changi Airport Enterprises, under the provisions of section 18 of the Airports Act 1996, be the lessee or owner of Sydney West Airport. (6) Where will Sydney West Airport be located. (7) Is it a fact that, if the sale of Sydney Airport is to occur before a decision on the location of Sydney West Airport is made, the lease for Sydney Airport will be sold without having solved Sydneys aircraft noise problems nor having resolved the location of Sydney West Airport. (8) What clauses will need to be present in the lease between the Government and the lessee of Sydney Airport to ensure that the statutory integrity of the Airports Act is preserved, in particular section 18. (9) What clauses will need to be present in the lease between the Government and the lessee of Sydney Airport to accommodate the intention of the Airports Act, as explained by the then Minister for Transport in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives on the Airports Bill 1996 in which he declared that Sydney Airport would not be sold until Sydneys aircraft noise problems were solved. (10) Is he able to say what the sale price of Sydney Airport will be, which must, by law, include the sale of Sydney West Airport to the one-and-the-same lessee. (11) When will the sale of Sydney West Airport occur. (12) Is the Government aware that the intention to float the sale of Sydney Airport must therefore mean the float of Sydney West Airport to one-and-the-same lessee as prescribed in section 18 of the Airports Act. (13) How is section 18 of the Act to be read in light of its two scoping studies to investment bank Salomon Smith Barney, the first study on the sale of Sydney Airport and the second study into the future development of Bankstown Airport as an overflow airport. (14) Is Bankstown Airport Sydney West Airport; if not, what is Sydney West Airport. (15) If no airport may now be described as Sydney West Airport, when will Sydney West Airport be declared. (16) Has he instructed investment bank Salomon Smith Barney, when drafting the scoping study for the sale of Sydney Airport, to advise within that scoping study, the operation of section 18 in respect of legal rights in the hands of the proposed lessee of Sydney Airport, if that airport is sold prior to the announcement and construction of Sydney West Airport. (17) Will he be briefed on the legal impacts arising from the rights of the lessee of Sydney Airport on the Governments freedom to announce a site that may not be in the commercial interests of the lessee, but may be a prudent environmental decision for the people of Sydney. (18) Can he assure the public that the sale of a lease to the lessee of Sydney Airport will not constrain the Government contractually to a lease which may preclude the options for selecting a site for Sydney West Airport. (19) Can he give assurances that, in the event of a decision on a site for Sydney West Airport being made, the lessee of Sydney Airport may seek contractual compensation against the Government and hence a payout to be borne by the Australian taxpayer. (20) In light of the commercial and statutory difficulties that arise in the operation of the Airports Act in the proposed sale of Sydney Airport without the existence of Sydney West Airport, can he foreshadow any proposed amendments to the Airports Act that would be necessary to overcome these statutory obstacles. (21) Will he amend the Airports Act to prescribe that the purchaser of the lease for Sydney Airport must also acquire a lease to build and construct an airport known as Sydney West Airport within a prescribed time. (22) Was it the intention of the Airports Act that the purchaser of the lease for Sydney Airport would mandatorily require the lessee to build and construct Sydney West Airport. (1) Yes. (2) to (4) The Government’s position on the Second Sydney Airport Proposal at Badgerys Creek was made clear in its announcement of 13 December 2000 on Sydney’s future airport needs. (5) There is no preferred purchaser of Sydney Airport at this time. It is the intention of Section 18 of the Airports Act that the airport-lessee companies for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport must be wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same holding company. (6) The Government has announced that it will retain ownership of the Badgerys Creek site and will legislate to protect the site from incompatible development in surrounding areas. There is no other site under consideration for construction of Sydney’s second major airport. (7) The Government has introduced the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) to address Sydney Airport’s noise issues. The Plan has been very successful in sharing the noise generated by the Airport compared with the situation that existed immediately prior to March 1996. See also answer to (6). (8) The lease for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport was granted to the Sydney Airports Corporation Limited in 1998. It does not contain provisions relating to the development of the site for Sydney West Airport. It is proposed that the sale arrangements for Sydney Airport will provide for the new owner to be given a first right of refusal by the Commonwealth to build and operate any second major airport within 100 kilometres of the Sydney Central Business District. (9) The lease for Sydney Airport has already been granted to the Sydney Airports Corporation Limited. See also answer to (10) No. (11) The Government announced that it would be premature to build a second major airport in Sydney, and that it will further review Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. (12) While it is the intention of Section 18 of the Airports Act that the airport-lessee companies for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport must be wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same holding company, it is not a requirement that the two leases be granted at the same time.",141,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
272,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(13) There was only one Scoping Study report into the sale of the Sydney airports. Section 18 of the Airports Act does not affect the proposal to upgrade Bankstown Airport as an overflow airport for Sydney Airport. (14) Bankstown Airport is not Sydney West Airport. See also answer to (6). (15) See answer to (11). (16) The Government has announced that the sale arrangements for Sydney Airport will provide for the new owner to be given a first right of refusal by the Commonwealth to build and operate any second major airport within 100 kilometres of the Sydney Central Business District. (17) See answer to (16). (18) and (19) These matters will be taken into account in the preparation of the sale documentation. (20) There is no intention at this time to amend any sections of the Airports Act dealing with Sydney West Airport. (21) No. See also answer to (16). (22) The lease for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has been granted to the Sydney Airports Corporation Limited in 1998. It does not contain provisions relating to the development of the site for Sydney West Airport. Second Sydney Airport: Sydney West (Question No. 2486) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 29 March 2001: (1) Will the foreshadowed lease of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport contain clauses that (a) reserve in the hands of the Government a contractual right to decide (i) the location of Sydney West Airport and (ii) when Sydney West Airport is to be (A) built and (B) completed, (b) ensure that the lessee will be bound by the Long Term Operating Plan and (c) expressly waive any power of the lessee to hold rights that may prevent the Government declaring the commencement date and location of Sydney West Airport. (2) Will the lease for Sydney West Airport be released for tender contemporaneously with the release of Sydney Airport; if not, why not. (1) (a) (b) and (c) The lease for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport was granted to the Sydney Airports Corporation Limited in 1998. It does not contain provisions relating to the development of the site for Sydney West Airport, or provisions relating to the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP). It is proposed that a sale agreement for Sydney Airport will provide for the new owner to be given a first right of refusal by the Commonwealth to build and operate any second major airport within 100 kilometres of the Sydney Central Business District. The Commonwealth will retain ownership of the Badgerys Creek airport site. A future Federal Government will therefore be able to decide when or if airport development on the site should proceed. The implementation of LTOP is the responsibility of Airservices Australia and is not dependent on who the airport lessee might be. (2) There is neither a requirement nor an intention to issue a lease under the Airports Act 1996 for Sydney West Airport at this time. The Government announced that it would be premature to build a second major airport in Sydney, and that it will further review Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. It is therefore preferable to defer the leasing of Sydney West Airport until there is more certainty as to the need for a new airport. Contracts for Defence Integrated Distribution System (Question No. 2500) Mr Ripoll asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 3 April 2001:",143,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
273,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Has there been a delay in the awarding of contracts for the Defence Integrated Distribution Systems (DIDS): if so, (a) what are the reasons for the delay and (b) what is he doing to award the contract in line with the original timetable and in a fair and equitable manner. (2) What has been the effect of the delay on the DIDS project and RAAF Base Amberley. (3) What effect will the project have on the structure and personnel of RAAF Base Amberley. (1) Yes. (a) Due to the size, scope, and nature of the activity, the Government must carefully consider the impact this project may have on regional and rural Australia. Accordingly, the matter has been referred to the Government for consideration. (b) Defence has advised Tenderers and Defence personnel affected by this activity that the Government is currently reviewing a number of options regarding this matter. (2) There has been no significant impact on Defence’s ability to support the combat forces due to the slippage of the DIDS project. The delay in implementing DIDS has had no significant impact on RAAF Base Amberley. (3) The impact the project will have on RAAF Base Amberley will be minimal. It is expected that minor changes will take place administratively on the base but this will have little effect on the provision of warehousing support to the F111 fleet. Aviation: Slot Management Scheme (Question No. 2504) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 April 2001: (1) Will the proposed amendments to the Slots System foreshadowed in the amendments to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act result in amendments to the Airspace Management Plan; if so, will consequential amendments to the Airspace Management Plan (AMP) constitute an action as prescribed in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBA Act). (2) Does an amendment to the AMP trigger the provisions of subsection 160(2) of the EPBA Act; if so, must the proposed amendments to the Slots Management Scheme 1998 (SMS) be brought to the attention of the Minister for the Environment for environmental assessment. (3) Does the precautionary principle apply to the amendments of the SMS. (4) Will the act of amending the SMS constitute severe and irreversible environmetal harm to the residents of Sydney through increased aircraft noise and fundamental compromising of air movement safety. (5) In the act of amending the SMS, ought not the lack of full scientific certainty of irreversible environmental harm be used to postpone measures to mitigate against the harm, thus applying the precautionary principle. (1) It is not envisaged that the proposed amendments to the Slot Management Scheme will result in a change to airspace management at the airport. (2) Under subsection 160(2) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the adoption or implementation of a plan for aviation airspace management involving aircraft operations that have, will have or are likely to have significant impact on the environment must be considered by the Minister for the Environment.

274,Mr Reith,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,145,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
275,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) What sum did Australia spend on foreign aid in (a) 1996-97, (b) 1997-98, (c) 1998-99 and (d) 1999-2000. (2) What do the sums represent as a percentage of Gross National Product in each year. (3) What were the categories of aid. (4) What was the proportion of aid directed towards the provision of basic social services. (5) What level of assistance was channelled into Micro Credit programs in the recipient countries. (6) What level of assistance was given to countries who were prepared to support or fund Micro Credit initiatives. (7) What percentage of aid was used in retiring debt in the recipient countries. (1) Total Official Development Assistance was as follows ($m): 1996-97 1,432.0 1997-98 1,443.1 1998-99 1,528.6 1999-2000 1,748.7 (2) The percentage of Gross National Product was as follows (%): 1996-97 0.28 1997-98 0.27 1998-99 0.26 1999-2000 0.28 (3) Priority sectors for the aid program are governance, health, education , infrastructure and rural development. The aid program also focuses on gender equity and the environment, which cut across the development process. (4) Basic social services are generally defined as activities in the areas of basic health, basic education, water and sanitation, nutrition and reproductive health. The proportion of aid directed towards the provision of basic social services was as follows (%): 1996-97 6.35 1997-98 7.82 1998-99 9.75 1999-2000 11.23 In 2000-01, it is estimated around 12 per cent of aid program funding will be focused on basic social services. Basic social services is a category within the broader area of social infrastructure and services. Social infrastructure and services includes education and training, health and population programs, water supply and sanitation, government and civil society, and other social infrastructure and services. In 2000-01, expenditure on social infrastructure and services is estimated to be around 40 per cent of total aid program expenditure. (5) Amounts provided by Australia in support of microfinance for the period 1996-97 to 1999-2000, by recipient country and in total, are set out in Annex B. The Australian Government has committed to doubling microfinance expenditure through the overseas aid program within the life of the current Parliament, consistent with ensuring a high quality portfolio of activities. The Government remains committed to achieving this outcome. (6) See answer to question 5. (7) Australia has a very small proportion of bilateral debt owed by heavily indebted poor countries. The percentage of Official Development Assistance used for action relating to debt (including Australia’s contribution to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative) is shown below (%).
