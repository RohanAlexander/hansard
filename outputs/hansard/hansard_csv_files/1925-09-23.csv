The question submitted by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) conveyed the imputation that some members of this House had said something which was false. Such a statement is disorderly. The Treasurer whom some would expect to know better, though I do not, has replied that the statement of honourable members has no truth whatever in it. As I am one of those who made the statement and"" believed it to be true, I object to the Treasurer's reply, and 1 ask that it be withdrawn, especially as so many have made the statement which has been described as untrue. The Treasurer's words are a reflection upon honourable members. the honourable member for Gippsland, or . the reply of the honourable the Treasurer, implied untruthfulness on the part of members of this House, it was out of order. I did not hear that implication in the question of the honourable member for Gippsland, and I , therefore, did not notice it in the reply of the honourable the Treasurer. In the circumstances I rely upon the good faith of both honourable members. MT.

House early in this year referred to the Public Works Committee for report the construction of a wharf at Darwin. The committee has not been able to make a report, and I wish to make a short statement explaining why the report is not ready for presentation. On behalf of Ihe committee, I desire to inform the House that, owing to the inability of the committee to obtain all the evidence necessary, it has not been possible to present a report in regard to the proposed construction of a new wharf at Darwin. On the 16th March, 1925, the committee commenced its inquiry, and took a large amount of evidence in regard to the proposition submitted by the Government for the construction of a concrete wharf in accordance with designs prepared by J. F. Ramsbotham, M . Inst. C.E., M . AM . Soc. C.E., Director of Lighthouses. During the course of the investigation, the committee learned of the arrival of Sir George Buchanan in Australia, and decided to ask him to give evidence in the matter. On approaching him, however, it was ascertained that he, also, had been asked by the Government to submit, inter alia, a proposal for the provision of wharfage facilities at Darwin. He expressed his disinclination to give evidence on the proposal while at the same time formulating a scheme of. his own, and intimated that his ideas on the subject would not be available until embodied in a report which he intended to prepare on his return to England-whic h report might be expected to reach the Government towards the end of this year. Under these circumstances, the committee feel that it would not be fair, either to the House or to itself, to submit its report until the views of Sir George Buchanan could be obtained. The evidence already taken by this committee will, of course, as provided in the act, be available for use by any subsequent committee dealing with this matter. I drew the attention of the Minister for Defence to an anomaly in the Defence Department whereunder second-class warrant officers were receiving biennial increments, while all other grades were receiving them annually. Has the Minister yet done anything to rectify that anomaly and injustice? that that information is not to-day available to me in the House, but I believe that it was posted to the honourable member last night INVAL ID PENSION FOR TH E the attention of the House to the fact that the Commissioner of Pensions, Mr Collins, had by a minute directed that the invalid pension should not be paid to blind sellers of tobacco, cigarettes and matches in the streets.

EX-SOLDIERS. 20th August, 1925, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) asked me to ascertain the cause of the delay in issuing light metal artificial limbs tc exties regarding the issue of metal limbs soldiers. I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that every effort is being made by the Repatriation Commission to utilize light metals in the manufacture of artificial limbs for ex-soldiers. aluminium alloy possessing the f actors of strength and lightness, is the most suitable has also been installed, together with metal. By its introduction into artificial leg making it will be possible to reduce the fatigue of the wearer as a result of decreasing the weight below the knee. The Repatriation Commission aims at -issuing, in the first place, a duralumin limb with a wooden foot and socket (bucket) to men who have suffered an amputation above the knee, and this should be possible early iu 1926. Regarding the idea of using a wooden socket in the metal limb, the Minister stated that this practice has proved to be completely satisfactory, and, as far as the Repatriation Commission is aware, no country issues an all-duralumin leg as a general ruta However, should duralumin prove satisfactory, the commission proposes to try out the procedure of issuing at a later stage a limb made completely of this metaL with the exception of the foot. As duralumin was not used commercially in the Commonwealth, it was found necessary to gam adequate knowledge by tests in chemical laboratories and elsewhere. In 1924, the commission brought to Australia, from New Zealand, a representative of an English firm of limb makers, who is an arm amputee. It was hoped that he might be able to assist with suggestions that might lead to an early solution of the difficulties relating to the working of duralumin and the issue of light metal limbs. However, this hope was not realized, and, as a matter of fact, this gentleman was surprised to find that the experiments of .the commission's technical officers were so far advanced in the working of duralumin. According to the advices received from the Director of Administration, Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, Canada, dated the 24th July, 1925, that department had not then entered into ihe manufacture of metal limbs, but were still carrying oat experiments and collecting information which would assist in arriving at a future policy. It was further understood that the policy of the South African authoriwould be a very conservative one for some time. In the light of the experiments carried out by the Bepatriation Department, certain essential tools and dies were manufactured, and machines and furDuralumin, which is an naces installed for the successful handling of this difficult metal. A special press lathes and milling machines, and complete sets of the necessary tools-and dies are being manufactured for the commission at the Commonwealth Small-arms Factory at Lithgow, New South Wales, and at the Commonwealth Artificial Limb Factory in Melbourne. The Repatriation Commission is making every effort to expedite this work, and with this end in view has explored the possibility of facilitating the delivery of the tools by utilizing engineering firms. However, after inquiries, it was thought desirable that the tools and dies should be manufactured . at the Commonwealth Small-arms Factory and the Commission's Limb Factory. It may be pointed out that one tool is dependent upon others, and this demands a high degree of accuracy, which takes time. Until all the necessary plant and equipment are installed, it will not be possible to manufacture ihe components to complete in all detail the desired limb. Progress is therefore, necessarily slow, but there is no avoidable delay. 18th September the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) asked the following questions:1.

As honourable members are aware, it is the practice to collect duties immediately upon a proposed resolution being tabled. In view of the impending dissolution, time w ill not permit of the tariff proposals being debated in the usual way and finally embodied in an act of Parliament. It is, therefore, necessary to take this action to continue the collection of the duties specified in the resolution u n t i l the new Parliament can proceed with the discussion and or think dating act, the proposals would lapse at the dissolution, and any amounts of duty paid in excess of the rates of the Customs Tariff 1921-1924 -would have to be refunded to the importers. abolish the additional protection which the many industries concerned are receiving by reason of the proposals. Honourable members w ill clearly understand that the passing of this bill is intended to have no further effect than to continue the present position u n t i l the new House can proceed with the consideration. In vie.w of that object the duration of this measure is specifically limited to a period of twelve months. It w ill then cease to have effect unless action has been taken by Parliament in the meantime. action now proposed, is identical with that taken in similar circumstances in 1917 and 1919. In 1917, the present Attorney General( Sir Littleton Groom), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, asked the House to ratify acertain resolution regarding the collection of Customs duties, and the House did so. Again, in 1919, similar action was taken at the request of Senator Massy Greene, the then Ministerf o r Trade and Customs. I u view of the peculiar circumstances associted with the introduction of this bill, I trust that it will be passed without undue delay. In view of the impending dissolution of the interests of Australian industries Parliament, .this measure is necessary. It and the"" development of this country. is, therefore, not my intention to delay it. Unless the tariff proposals which were recently before us are validated, refunds of duty collected will have to be A t present Customs made in certain cases, as has been pointed out by the Minister. I want, however, to express my regret that the Government did not introduce its tariff proposals much earlier. For three years estimates have been presented to. this House of the amount of revenue expected from Customs duties, and on each occasion the amount received from that source has greatly exceeded the estimate. Treasurers have been made to looklike schoolboys. Both the right honourable the Prime Minister and the present Treasurer, in the capacity of Treasurer, have made estimates of the revenue expected from customs duties, but the amount actually enactment of the proposals, received shows that such a flood of imotherwise decide, as it may ports has entered the Commonwealth that fit.

Probably the influence, of the Country' party in the Composite Ministry has been the cause of the injury done to Australian industries in this connection. .Members on this side of the House believe that Australian industries should be protected against foreign competition, and that, so far as is possible, Australia should be made selfThe contained. I hope that the new parliament will see that adequate protection is given to Australian industries. There are some things which Australia cannot produce, and it is not right that heavy duties should be imposed on such articles; the effect would be merely to place an additional burden on the consumer. That aspect of the tariff, should be taken into consideration when next it comes before us. Where both Customs and Excise duties are imposed on certain articles, it would be better to reduce the Excise duty than to increase the Customs duty.

89,A Further Effect Would Be To Mr Charlton,"The present M i nnot propose to discuss this question at any length. I realize that at a time like this it is impossible for us to give the questions arising out of the tariff schedule or the Customs Department, may impose the attention and consideration which they deserve. It is essential that the tariff should be validated for the time being. When the next Parliament meets, I presume that the schedule now under consideration, or a new schedule, will be brought before us, and an opportunity will be afforded to discuss the merits of the duties proposed. The Leader of the Opposition, like a boa-constrictor, is apparently prepared to swallow everything, but, like the legendary boa-constrictor, he may find that he will have his tail in his own mouth, aud swallow his policy or himself. That is indicative of what is likely to happen to the industries of Australia if the honourable gentleman and the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr industrial combines in this country. We Pratten) have their own way, seeing that they are not satisfied with the enormous duties now imposed upon goods imported into this country. Are we to contend that only those who manufacture goods and those employed by them are to be considered? Are we not to consider at all the great primary producers of the country, and the difficulties placed in their way by these continued Customs exactions? ' In 1914, a Labour Government brought forward certain proposals for the protection of the industries of Australia. They gave rise to very little complaint, because it was felt that they did not propose undue protection for local industries, except in a few cases, such as those for the manufacture of hats and boots, which, by the way, have not progressed under the high protection duties imposed in their inaround and tell some manufacturer that terests. Moreover, there is a limit to the amount.which the producer can afford to pay for his requirements, and we have already nassed that limit. 1920, however, aGovernment proposed duties on iron and steel to the extent of over £1,500,000 annually, and, as a result, increased the cost of almost every article manufactured in Australia. The Minister for Trade and Customs was not satisfied with the enormous duties that were imposed on iron and steel. He will not allow, without imposing a dumping duty, any British iron or steel to be imported into Australia at a lower price than the Australian wholesale price. This Parliament fixes the duties to be collected under the tariff, and then the Minister for Trade and Customs, at the instigation of some private firm, the Tariff Board, further duties upon certain articles. The position has become almost intolerable. However, I have said that I do not propose at this juncture to discuss the matter at any great length. I hope that the people of this country, and especially the workers in Australian industries, will begin to realize what these enormous exactions mean. The breadwinners of Australia must suffer from the huge increased cost of living which must follow from these imposts. I hope that there will be an opportunity for some propaganda to enable the workers especially to realize that by supporting a high protective tariff they are only helping to create a few millionaires, and .to build up should try to assist the Australian manufacturer and the Australian worker to become efficient. They should be made to realize that the people of the United States of America, although paying wages from 30 to 100 per cent, higher than the wages paid in Australia, can produce the same class of goods at half the price. While we desire to build up industries in the Commonwealth, we also desire that they should be efficiently conducted. I ' see no reason why Australian manufacturers should not be able to compete with manufacturers in Great Britain and the United States of America, the countries from which we get most of our imports. I am not seeking favours from any person, and it is not my intention to hobble I have tried to do something for him by giving him protection, paid for out of the pockets of the people of Australia. InI shall not do that kind of thing, even to benefit the workmen engaged in a particular industry. I prefer to consider the interests of the people of Australia as a whole. I am prepared to give a moderate protection to the industries of the country, but we cannot afford the Customs duties which are at present being proposed. do not intend to say very much.

It is because the honorsented, not in the increased prosperity of able member for Perth( Mr Mann) has not the Australian outlook, and is more concerned with flooding this country with cheap importations from foreign countries than with building up the industrial life of Australia, that he talks as he does. This is but a half-baked apology for a protectionist tariff, and yet we have these protests from members of the Corner party, who pretend to be representing Australian interests in this Parliament. I wish we had an opportunity to discuss the tariff. Because of its inadequacy, quite a number of industries will be closed down before Parliament meets again. revision of the 'tariff for three years. Never was there a time in the history of this country when the industries of Australia were crying out more for protection than they have been in the last three years. member not think that this job should be finished before we go to the country? for the dying hours of this Parliament, and it should have been undertaken in its first session. That was the time when Australian industries were crying out for protection, when the flood of imports was greater than it had ever been before. I remember that, in 1922, the then leader of the honourable member for Swan was leading the Corner party, and told the Treasurer of the day ( Mr thing in the dying hours of the ParliaBruce), when that gentleman took credit for the increased Customs revenue, that instead of doing so he should go into sack-cloth, and put ashes on his head. ber for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), who is now Treasurer of the Commonwealth. He was tben criticizing the budget of his present leader. The revenue derived from Customs that year was £17,000,000, but the Customs revenue for the year just closed reached £26,000,000. What does this £26,000,000 represent? It does not represent flourishing Australian industries, but the flooding of this country with imports from other countries. In the last three years the' Treasurer has received in Customs revenue £21,000,000 more than was received by his predecessor during a similar period. This is repreAustralia, but inlanguishing industries, factories partly closed down, and the biggest army of unemployed that we have had here for twenty years. Those engaged in the strawboard industry in my electorate were induced by the Federal Government to install new imachinery when, owing to the war, tin plates could not be imported, and strawboard was extensively used for containers. The Minister for Trade and Customs told these people that if they put in additional plant the Government would guarantee them protection. They put in one machine which alone cost £60,000, We have been waiting for a and it has hardly turned a wheel, and is standing idle to-day because the straw board which should be manufactured in this country is being imported from Holland. The industry for the production of aluminium ware is also in a struggling condition. It submitted an unanswerable case for a high protective duty to the Tariff Board, but its application was turned down, and that industry, as well as the straw board industry will be closed before Parliament, is called together again, and numbers of people will be thrown out of work. I have given two illustrations of the conditions prevailing in Australia as a result of inadequate tariff protection. People who call themselves protectionists say now that we could not expect to do anyment. Why was this matter left to the dying hours of the Parliament ? In some instances the tariff schedule proposed will do some measure of good to the ipdustries of this country, but I condemn the Government for not having brought down the tariff two years ago, and for not including in the schedule duties for the assistance of deserving industries .that require protection.

I protest with the Leader of the Opposition that we have to close up this Parliament without the opportunity to frame a tariff that would give real protection to tbe industries of Australia. asked to pass this measure to validate the collection of Customs duties under the new schedule for twelve months to come. These duties will be collected without the House having an opportunity to discuss the items, or to express an opinion on the rates of duty which the schedule proposes. We are about to face an election on a question on which I am prepared to follow my leader through thick and thin, but next to that question, and to my mind second only to it in importance to the electors of this country, is the tariff issue which is largely involved in this measure. A t the coming election I intend to fight the present policy for the collection of Customs duties. I am prepared to discuss it with the electors, but I want here and now to protest against this schedule, its nature and its terms, against it being forced upon us in this way, and against the people being compelled, in the circumstances in which we are now placed, to pay these duties for the next twelve months. It is common knowledge that huge quantities of goods ordered months in advance, in accordance with the ordinary trade practice, to meet the forthcoming summer season iu Australia, are being heavily burdened with duties under this tariff-dutie s which, I venture to say, have actually staggered the people of this country. The prices of some articles will thus be increased by from 800 per cent. to.900 per cent. Some of the duties are not merely apparently, but confessedly, prohibitive. An immense burden will be laid on the people of this country by these new duties. I object to them, particularly at this juncture, for two reasons. I will fight second to none against the invasion of our body politic by socialism and communism, and I object to the policy embodied in the tariff, because it is socialistic. A tariff of this nature is pure socialism. The effect of these duties in increasing the cost of living to the people of Australia will be to cause hardships and to decrease still further the purchasing power of money. The reduced purchasing power of money is at the bottom of much of the discontent and unrest that we hear of to-day, and it is a seedbed for the poisonous weeds of socialism and communism. I wish to make it perfectly clear that at the forthcoming election the main conflict will be with those forces which disrupt and destroy law and order in this country, but at the same time. I purpose to fight this ruinous protective policy. I am sure that honourable members can hardly understand what some of these new duties mean, or they would not.support them. The more one studies them the more far-reaching they appear to be, and the more difficult of justification they become. I was pleased to hear the speech just made by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), because, if he thinks that the duties imposed are not high enough, the people of Australia will be able to gather from his remarks what he and his party will be likely to do if ever they get into power. The treatment that the people may then expect will be that threatened to Jeroboam and Israel by Rehoboam. Instead of chastising the people with whips, they will chastise them with scorpions. It is just as well that the people should know this. The burden of some of the items in this schedule will, fall with almost crushing force on the working people of this country. Honourable members opposite, while they talk of improving the condition of the workr ing people, lay upon them burdens which are grievous to be borne. What care they if the people are taxed, and taxed, and taxed, if by those taxes and the discontent which they create they can produce in the body politic a favorable harbourage for their social doctrines? Some of the duties in this schedule will increase to a staggering extent the prices of numberless articles of clothing purchased by the poorer classes of the community.",27,Second Reading

The price of many articles .of clothing will be increased to an enormous extent. Material which is not only not made in this country, but cannot possibly be made here under the most .favorable circumstances for many months to come, is subjected to increased taxation. from all parts of the world for making the cheaper classes of clothing; I refer particularly to cotton tweeds. Let honourable members opposite inquire to what extent ootton tweeds are used in the making of clothing for those whom they claim to represent. Australia are making cotton tweeds today? have not made them., are not making them, and cannot make them for months to come. The Minister has said that they are making them. They have made nothing more than some samples, which are inferior to the tweeds imported. On this subject. I know what I am talking about. The burden which these duties w ill place on the people of this country will be very heavy, and it w ill f a l l on the working classes that honourable members opposite claim to represent. Going farther afield, we find that additional special burdens aTe placed on the small producers in the country. There is a heavy, duty on small power plants, whereby the users of up-todate oil-driven and electric power plants are heavily burdened. Everv farmer who wants to install such a plant to carry on the operations of his f a rm will be charged an additional duty of from 40 per cent. criticism. I ask the honourable the to 60 per cent. Every windmill that a farmer uses will be taxed more heavily than before. Every attempt that is made in the country to generate and distribute electric energy will be handicapped by additional duties. The duties on spirits can have no other result than to increase I withdraw the expresto certain manufacturers profits which they are not justified in making, having regard to the estimation in which their I suggest that the goods are held by the public.

The speech of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) should show the electors where the Government stands. At the last elections the definite promise was given that the secondary industries of this country would receive more adequate protection, and we now know why that promise was not honoured. We have had the witness in the box, and he has shown that the Government would have lost the support of honorabie members in the corner if it had brought down a new tariff schedirle when it should have brought it down-eightee n months ago.

That right has been denied to honourable members because members of the Government could not agree among themselves. The Government, evidently, was afraid of displeasing its supporters in the corner. That has always been the trouble with this Government. Honourable members opposite will ask the people to return them again to Parliament ou the promise that they will care for the secondary industries. The Government has waited till the eve of a dissolution before even considering the adequate protection of the manufacturing industries, and if it is returned to power it will be, as it is now, dependent upon the support of those honourable memberc. on the ministerial cross benches who criticise the protectionist policy. Oil and water will not mix, and so long as ihere is in office a Government composed of two mutually antagonistic elements, so long will the secondary industries of the Commonwealth languish, with resultant unemployment. Mr W. M. HUGHES (North Sydney) [4.32] I agree with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) in deploring the fact that duties should have been imposed without this House having had an opportunity for the ample discussion of them. That may well be the feeling of all honourable members. But the Government has, for reasons that it considers sufficient, decided to appeal to the people, and in the circumstances it must either deny the secondary industries the benefit of those Irigher duties which after long and sober reflection the Tariff The tariff schedule was not Board has recommended or take immediate action, and the Minister has decided to ask the House to agree without debate to their imposition. The Government has, in the circumstances, I think, adopted the right course. An appeal to the country having been determined upon, it is essential that the tariff should be disposed of by a summary method, and only generalities can now be discussed. The schedule as a whole I accept, as we all must do, but I do not, and, I assume, bodying all that is necessary for the adequate protection of our secondary indusr tries. In some respects it might be amended with advantage. One glaring omission, I am told, is due entirely to the laxity of those engaged in the iron and steel industry. Whether or not that is so, it is most unfortunate that the fundamental industry upon which the whole modern industrial edifice is based, should not have received that ample measure of consideration which its importance demands. However, we are promised that that omission shall be attended to later. I should not have risen",29,Second Reading

112,Mr Watkins (Newcastle) [4.23],"had Swan( Mr Gregory) and Perth( Mr Mann) made an attack upon the national policy of protection. Their words sounded to me as the crie3 of those in the swirling waters of the flood must have sounded to Noah safe in the A r k . I understand and sympathise w it h ' the attitude of those honourable gentlemen in so f a r as it is not colored by their enmember knows, at once the most highly vironment, for it is a singular fact that all free traders in this House represent constituencies to which, from their very nature, no policy other than free trade is likely to be acceptable. I , too, have in days gone by spoken in a pathetic and reproachful way of what is now the national policy of Australia, but for me. as for Saul .of Tarsus, one revelation sufficed, and since then I have been amongst those who see things not ""through a glass darkly,"" but as they are. been the settled policy of thip country, and those who are tilting at it are like Don Quixote tilting at windm-lls. They resemble people who would abandon the Copernican system of astronomy and revert to the Ptolemaic theory. For the last twenty years no one has been . able to successfully challenge the protectionist policy of Australia. I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Perth say that protection is a socialistic policy; that it imposes intolerable burdens on the people, and that these evils will be intensified if honourable members opposite attain to office, because they w ill impose more protection and still more protection. The honourable member for Perth surely does not understand that he could not have given to the cause of his opponents a more effective fillip than he has given by that statement. Look about this great city of Melbourne! Consider the distribution of population throughout the Commonwealth! Do not honourable members on the ministerial cross benches frequently complain that our population is so disproportionately settled in the cities that country interests are neglected ? Yet the honourable member for Perth says that the policy of the Opposition will cater more effectively for the needs of that vast population which finds its needs and opportunities in the cities and industrial centres. The contention of the honourable member is without foundation. not the honourable members for The answer to the statement that protection is socialism was supplied by the honourable member for Swan, who said that in ' America, notwithstanding the payment of higher wages than are paid in Australia secondary production is less costly. According to the honourable member for Perth, America is a socialistic country; but it is, as every honourable protected and the most individualistic country in the. world. Every shop is an open shop, and no person in America, except, perhaps, La Follette, has dared to challenge its individualistic policy. It is nonsense to say that protection is socialism; it is the negation of socialism. The statement that protective duties impose hardships and burdens on the people is nonsense. Compare the conditions of the masses in free trade England with the conditions of the masses in Australia and America. On the one hand, the workers For many years protection has are thrust down by the absence of protective duties, and they starve and industries languish. On the other hand, in America, where the duties are higher than in any other country in the world, and in Australia, too, the proletariat live an incomparably better life than do the people of free trade England. When America first imposed protective duties, she passed through the same stages as Australia is passing through now, but when at length she 'was able to get her home markets for her own producers, she achieved those economies which are possible only by mass production. The national character of the American people and the protectionist policy have gone hand in hand, allowing the inventive' genius and boundless energy of the people free scope. America is what she is by the grace ofGod, the qualities she in herited from the Anglo-Saxon' race, and by her protectionist policy. In essence, Americans and Australians are children of the same mother. Where America has led, Australia can follow. I do not accept the schedule as wholly sufficient; even the duties which it does impose are not satisfactory. Much remains to be done. Amongst -the anomalies in the schedule is the item relating to crude o i l . But I am assuredthat arrangements will be made whereby crude oil for fuel purposes w ill be made available on land as well as for marine engines. The honourable member for Perth spoke of the protectionist policy as if it had nothing to its credit. But its record is one of amazing achievements. every five in Australia finds a good living as a result of the national protectionist policy. Over 320,000 males and 120,000 females are employed in the manufacturing industries, and they handled last year £34S,000,000 worth of material and, in the course of manufacture, added to it £141,000,000 in value. These figures will compare with the output of wheat aud wool. We are dealing with great national industries, and were it not for the protection policy Australia would be in a very bad way. Our feet are now set upon tbe national road, despite the existence in the tariff of a number of things that are far from satisfactory. We are following in the wake of the greatest of all modern nations,, which but yesterday was nothing and to-day fills the whole henvens with its material glory, inspiring us to further efforts; for what America is to-day Australia will be to-morrow. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [4.46] Every calling has its troubles and compensations, and although in my political career I have had many troub es, yet one T of my greatest compensations has been to listen to the speech just delivered by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) in favour of the effective protection of Australia. Strange to say, this honourable gentleman was at one time considered to be the holder of a blue ribbon among extreme free trade advocates. This is mother striking example of the growth of Australian feeling. which permits of a general discussion of the tariff, is a tempting one, but like other honourable members. I am prepared to let the people of Australia settle the big. issues that will be placed before them at the next election. To me the tariff schedule is a thing of shreds and patches. It contains many anomalies and is not framed at all in the interests of Australian industries. The Commonwealth Constitution provides .that this Parliament shall pass no legislation that has the effect of placing one State or any part of a State in a better position than another State. I was sorry to hear from the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr on imported timber, if that is so, its Pratten) to-day, that an injustice which is being suffered by some persons in Australia to-day cannot be remedied. CerOne person out of tain goods have been ordered from'overseas by Australian traders. After the vessel carrying those goods has called at, say, Fremantle, Adelaide and Mell.ourue, the amending tariff schedule is laid on the' table of-this House and the duty on the goods is increased,, say, 10 per '-eut. The vessel arrives at a Tasmanian port a few days later, and some of the goods are landed under the increased tariff. This gives a decided advantage to the traders on the mainland as compared with those in Tasmanian or in jther distant ports of Australia. ductions have been made in the duty,, the traders in the more distant ports would have an advantage. MrO ' KEEFE . ^ I ask the honourable member to what extent have reductions been made? In this instance tbe traders* in Tasmanian and oiher distant ports of Australia are placed at a serious disadvantage, with the result that the Melbourne traders are able to flood the. Tasmanian market with goods for which the traders there have to charge a 10 per cent, increase in order to obtain the same profit. The Minister to-day said in effect that the difficulties in the way made it impossible to remedy this anomaly. This matter should engage the most serious attention of the Minister and the Tariff Board, and they should try to devise some means to carry out the spirit as well as the letter of the Constitution, and to place the traders in every part of Australia on the same basis so far as the The subject before the House, imposition of duty upon certain classes of goods is concerned. I hope that the next government will bring in a really protectionist tariff. T asked in this House the other day a question concerning two very serious grievances which today exist in respect of Tasmania. I referred to the establishment of the paper pulp industry, which should be the key industry of Australia, and to the timber industry, which is being absolutely strangled by the absence of a proper protectionist policy. The Minister a few days ago, when tabling the Tariff Board's report on timber, stated that the board was against imposing any increased duty recommendation is entirely against the evidence of experts in Australia. I hope",30,Second Reading
113,Mr Pateesonv,"Conversely , where rethat the Minister -will do something to remedy the injustices that have been perpetrated because of the imposition of duties under the amending tariff schedule. ""[Quorum formed.] Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) blamed the Government for not introducing the amending tariff schedule earlier, but I blame the Government for bringing it in at all, except in respect of those items effecting reductions in the already overburdened tariff. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) seemed to think that honourable members representing Western Australia opposed the tariff schedule because of the particular wind that blew in that State. He said that in tilting at protection we were like Don Quixote tilting at windmills. The right honourable gentleman himself knows something about tilting at windmills. Formerly he was one of the greatest free traders in the Commonwealth. He must be influenced considerably by the political and fiscal winds that periodically blow about his ears. Western Australian representatives have very good reasons for their attitude towards the Tariff. The people of that State are always paying, while other States are always receiving. I have no doubt that the report of the royal commission on Western Australian disabilities, which was tabled to-day, will provide substantial evidence to that effect. The right honourable member for North Sydney was Prime Minister of Australia at a time when the price of the commodities we were selling was falling and the price of the commodities that we were buying was rising. In reply to a deputation that waited on him during that period he said we ought to pray in two ways-first , that the price of the things that we had to sell would rise; and, secondly, that the price of the things which we had to buy would fall. His attitude is quite inconsistent. A higher tariff, such as it is intended to impose, must necessarily increase the cost of liv""ing. That will mean that the arbitration courts will be obliged to award higher rates of pay to our working people. The whole trend of things is to make Australia more insular than ever. I do not want a full-dress tariff debate this afternoon, but I should certainly like to address myself at much greater length than I shall do to the matier. I should do so but for the reason that the Government has decided to go to the country. The heavy tariff burdens imposed upon our people cause harmful effects which are only second to those caused by bolshevism. I believe in law and order. A government like ours, elected upon an adult franchise, should certainly govern the country. It .should exercise all the power that the people thought they were conferring upon it. Neither the tariff, nor anything else, is of more consequence than that the Government should really maintain control of our affairs. The tariff, however, is very important. The right honourable member for North Sydney referred to the number of persons employed in our secondary industries. But has the other aspect of the matter ever been considered? I asked the. Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) this afternoon what effect this tariff schedule would have on imported electrical machinery. Western Australia has no chance of developing industrial power from flowing rivers or any other hydraulic source, but she has a coal deposit at Collie which the people in the south-western district hope to utilize for the development of electrical power. A capital of £200,000 is required to establish the scheme. The people have approached the Commonwealth Government and the State Government, and are now trying private sources to help them raise this money. The imposition of this tariff might mean that their machinery would cost an extra £80,000 or £90,000. If that should be the case they will probably have to abandon their scheme. needs a hydro-electrical scheme such as Tasmania has. in a much better position if fhe scheme had not been over-capitalized. Some honourable members in this chamber have a habit of talking about big Australians. Do they not believe that our own people should have preference over foreigners? I asked a member of the Ministry the other day whether he would sell me Australia's surplus of sugar at the price he is prepared to sell it overseas.

I next inquired whether he would sell wire netting made in Australia cheaper in New Zealand than in Australia. "" Yes."" This is very strange, when we remember how necessary wire netting is to our farmers to enable them to combat the rabbits and the dingoes. policy is not in the interests of our people. If we desire to provide work for our unemployed we must establish our industries on business like lines. other day I inquired from a boot manufacturer in Collingwood whether the boot making industry was in a good position here. It has been protected in this State for more than 40 years. spoon-fed. wearing a silver slipper, for it has had great assistance from the Government. The manufacturer replied, "" The industry is in a bad way."" I asked, ""Do you want more protection?"" He replied. ""No, we do about 96 per cent, of Australia's business now, and if we had twice as much protection we could not get the other 4 per cent."" I then asked, ""Why do you not sell outside of Australia?"" He replied, ""We cannot do so, for our cost of production is too great."" good illustration of the result of the protectionist policy. Our industries reach a certain stage, but can develop no further. They come to a dead end. The right honourable member for North Sydney quoted figures this afternoon to show the number of people employed in our secondary industries. I cannot help it if the right honourable member is not in the chamber; he comes in here when he has anything to say, catches Mr Speaker's eye, makes his speech, . and then disappears. In reply to his remarks this afternoon I wish to say that Australia depends upon her primary and not upon her secondary industries. wheat, butter, timber, fruit, meat, and a few other products create 95 per cent, of our wealth. It. is most unfortunate that our area under wheat crop was less last year than in any of the previous three years. Australia does not recognize who is her breadwinner. In our domestic life we are all aware that when a mother gives her child a pair of new shoes or stockingsthe child thinks they come from Mr Prowse. the mother, when, as a matter of fact, they are purchased out of the father's earnings. The family breadwinner, who has to maintain a wife and, say, six children, may earn from £6 to £8 per week. He said, Everything that comes into his household has to be paid for out of his earnings. Mary's new socks are paid for out of father's earnings, notwithstanding that Such a mother presents them to her; and* so is Johnny's top. The statistical record presented to honourable members by our Statistical Department contains a The table showing the relative values of our manufactured material. I wish to point out that in many cases the raw material used in those manufactures costs less in Australia than in any other country. It has been Our primary industries that produce that It has, so to speak, been raw material are really the backbone of the country, and not our secondary industries which use it. Our secondary industries do not bring a penny of new money here. In these circumstances, we should be doing everything possible to stabilize our primary industries. We are not doing that by paying bounties and building a high tariff wall. These simply keep up the price of goods. They also enable Australian wire netting manufacturers to sell their wire netting cheaper That is a in New Zealand than in Australia. We cannot develop our country by these means. I am extremely sorry that this tariff will be plastered on the country for twelve months without our having had a reasonable opportunity to discuss it. The fiscal policy of Australia should not be, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, unalterable. Contingencies which arise from time to time, false policies that are adopted, inefficiency that is apparent in our industries, and other factors, ought surely to be sufficient to cause us to reconsider our position. We .cannot develop our industries by this futile, hopeless,. and worthless policy of Our wool, protection, nor can we, by it, provide employment for our people. The increased duties will not provide more employment. Our imports are increasing, as is also the cost of living. Mention has been mado of the United States of America, but I point out that that country has set out to obtain efficiency in every sphere of activity. I have no objection to high wages so long as men are willing to work in order to produce wealth for the wages they receive. This tariff is an incentive to wealthy manufacturers to combine to fleece the people of Australia. It w ill further increase the cost of living, and hobble the bread-winner, the man who produces the real wealth of the country. In Melbourne there is a body called the New Settlers League; of which the Lord Mayor is a member. I have here a cartoon which, while not intended to be disrespectful, shows a man with a shovel in his hand, a dozen other men on his head, and some on his shoulders. with the shovel is told that he is a fine fellow, because he is about to go on the land to produce wealth so that the others may live. These people in Melbourne, in order to make it possible for Victorians to exist, support a high tariff, and are making it impossible for the man on the land in Western Australia to compete in the world's markets w it h his produce. The primary industries which produce the real wealth of Australia are declining, because of this hot-house treatment of our secondary industries. If the breadwinner of the house passes out, Johnny will have to do without his top. and Mary without her stockings. The primary producer has reached the breaking point. I warn the House against a continuance of this policy. As certainly as the sun wil l rise to-morrow, the present fiscal policy of Australia w ill not always be the accepted policy of the people of this country. I take exception to the t u r n that this debate has taken, and particularly to the remarks of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) that a high tariff makes for communism. It would appear that during the forthcoming campaign many things will be said to tend towards communism. No t only w ill every act of the Labour party be said to be communistic, but we shall hear the advocates of free.trade thundering out the cry that even the high tariff proposals of this law-and-order Government make for communism. If -that be so, I contend that not only the members of the Tariff Board, but also the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs, should immediately be deported. There is, however, a good deal in some of the remarks made' by honourable members from Western Australia, w it h regard to the effect of the t a r if f on that State. The right honourable member for said that high negation of socialism; he pointed to the United States of America as an example of a country which is extremely individua listic. Whilei n my opinion a high protective tariff has nothing to do w it h communism or socialism, I agree with the right honourable member that the present, fiscal policy of Australia has come to stay. Nevertheless, the representatives of Western Australia have a duty to perform in pointing out that not only does the high tariff not assist the secondary industries The man of the eastern State, but it is placing an unwarranted burden on the primary producers of Western Australia. in favour of one State is not permissible under the Constitution. MrA . GREEN I do not suggest that. The preponderance of members from the more thickly populated eastern States makes it difficult for the views of Western. Australian members to carry much weight in this chamber. In these matters we can only make a gesture, as on every occasion we are outvoted. Nevertheless, we should not be justified in keeping our lips closed, and failing to point out that under these proposals the gold-mining industry of Western Australia must inevitably succumb. The heavy imposts proposed in connection with mining machinery will practically sound the death knell of that industry. the Leader of your party ?. MrA . GREEN I ask the honourable member if it is his opinion, and I repeat the question to the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). On this question I speak for myself, and the honourable member should do the same. He would not assist me to obtain relief from these duties by crossing the chamber to support any amendment which I might move. I challenge him to follow me and the honourable members for Swan and Perthi n trying to get the duties removed from mining machinery. The present duties oh mining machinery are 27£ per cent. British, and 40 per cent, general. Under the proposals now before us those duties will be increased to 40 per cent, and 55 per cent, respectively, but they will not assist the Australian manufacturer. For the gold-mining industry particularly, many machines of a highly techN o r th Sydney( Mr Hughes) nical nature are built in the United protection is the States of America and GreatB r it a in.

119,Mr Cook,"I s that the opinion ofwhich have proved their worth over a number of years, will use no other. Yet under these proposals they will have to pay a much higher duty on any such machines which they import. on gold. royal commission on Western Australian disabilities indicates that the decision of the commissioners was not unanimous, and, therefore, it is doubtful whether the Government will provide for a bounty on gold. Seeing that these additional duties are to be imposed, it is the duty of the Prime Minister, before Parliament rises, to make some pronouncement of the Government's attitude towards a gold bounty. Without a bounty the imposition of these increased duties will sound the death knell of the goldmining industry. In 1922, and again in 1924, the Tariff Board visited Western Australia, and on each occasion voluminous evidence, showing the necessity for the duties being decreased, was submitted by representatives of ihe gold-mining industry. Nevertheless, an increase of the existing duties is now proposed. The members of the Tariff Board, recognizing the parlous condition of the gold-mining industry in Western Australia, stated that they would sympathetically consider the evidence placed before them: but the new tariff schedule does not indicate that they have done so. It is true that some sympathetic references to the industry are contained in the board's report. In explaining its inability to remove the duty on certain specified mining machinery and parts, because of the necessity for protecting the interests of Australian manufacturers, the Tariff Board expressed sympathy with the gold-mining industry of Western Australia, and stated that it realized the many difficulties confronting that industry. The board added that it was not within the scope of the powers conferred on it to suggest any alternative form of relief to a bounty on gold production. It would aopear that we are to have neither relief from heavier duties nor a bounty. The pold-mining industry did much to make Victoria a prosperous State. Because of these excessive duties, the great auriferous bodies in Western Australia, which have lain dormant for so long, will not now be exploited. ' It is made by those interested in the industry,, unscientific to place a duty on something which cannot be manufactured commercially in Australia. I repeat that, even if the duty is increased by 200 per cent., the gold-mining companies of Western Australia will still import certain types of machinery. I cannot see why any protectionist, whether in Victoria or elsewhere, should want to penalize the gold-mining industry of Western Australia. Mention has been made of the duty on steel wire winding ropes. This matter was placed before the Tariff Board, which decided to defer its consideration. The present proposal is practically the same as the old one, except that the words "" locked coil mining, ropes"" have been deleted, and the words "" as pre-, scribed by departmental by-laws"" inserted in lieu thereof. The lives of men depend on steel wire winding ropes, and mine managers cannot be expected to take risks with untried wire ropes. These ropes are not being manufactured in Australia, and yet the goldmining industry is being penalized by the excessively high duty imposed upon them. The same may be said with respect to dynamo electric machines. If I had time, I could quote voluminous evidence presented to the Tariff Board in connection with these machines. They are not manufactured in Australia, and there is no chance that they will be manufactured here. In spite of this, the board proposes a duty of 45 per cent, on these machines when of British manufacture, and a duty of 60 per cent, in the general tariff. There is no home market for these goods created in Western Australia by eastern manufacturers, and it is not to be wondered at that honourable members representing country constituencies in Western Australia should protest against the imposition of duties which do not benefit manufacturers in the eastern States, and merely impose an unreasonable burden upon primary"" production in Western Australia manufacturers must make a profit, no' matter wh.'it other industries suffer. two minor articles used in the mining, industry are admitted free of duty, but the decision to increase the duty on other 1 articles, in spite of the representations! can only cause great dissatisfaction in Western Australia, not only with the Government, but with federation itself. 1",35,Second Reading

In gold mining in Western Australia, a new process is about to be adopteda new treatment of refractory ores is being tried put at Wiluna, which is at present the greatest hope of Western Australia in eonnexion with mining. Ores found after reaching a certain depth when the miners get into the sulphides zone are found to be very refractory. Mining men have given their attention for some years past to the reduction of these ores, and many experiments have been made. Men who know a great deal about the mining industry claim that by the oil-flotation process it will be possible to open up a large field of operations at Wiluna that could not be attempted without it . If this is found to be practicable, it will give employment to 4,000 gold miners at the field. oil-flotation process will have to pay an increased duty, unless the Minister can see his way, as I hope he will, to assist me in this matter. I earnestly plead with the honourable gentleman to allow the crude oil required in treatment of ore in the mining industry to be admitted on the same terms as that used for ordinary power purposes. There is another article of import in which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews), along with other houorable members, is interested. These are not manufactured in Australia, and it is not proposed to manufacture them here. some time ago. might' recapitulate shortly the 'history of the matter. The duty originally imposed upon lugger chains was not paid because they came in under the heading of ""machinery aud appliances."" Auditor-General, contrary to the wishes of the Customs Department, held that they were not covered by the vague description of "" machinery and appliances."" He submitted the matter to the Solicitor General, who upheld his opinion. Since then the people engaged in the pearling industry who have been importing their lugger chains into Broome have had to pay duty upon them. I do not wish to suggest any breach of faith on the part of the Customs Department, but I had an understanding with it that these chains should not be dutiable, but should continue to be imported free as appliances. the item free, and the remission of duty retrospective. we can deal with later. Until the tariff is actually passed those engaged in the pearling industry will have to pay the duty on these lugger chains, and that is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. There .are many other items of the schedule with which I should like to deal, but I shall not do so now, because the tariff items cannot be altered in the consideration of this validating bill. I could not,, however, permit the opportunity to pass without pointing out to the .Minister, the House,. and the country The crude oil required for this certain anomalies arising out of the tariff schedule which should be remedied in order to assist the gold-mining industry. In view of the fact that the primary industries of Western Australia must give assistance to the manufacturing industries already established in Australia, or which can be successfully established here, I hope that an appeal for a gold bounty will not fall upon deaf ears when addressed to protectionists in this House. Before resuming my seat, I should like to direct the attention of the MinisterI refer to lugger chains. to the matter of mine screenings. The honourable gentleman wrote me a letter on the 25 th February last, following up representations I had made, and I mention the. matter to refresh his memory. In this letter he saidWith reference to your calls ih this office, and your personal representations in regard to the correspondence sent you by the South Kalgoorlie Consolidated Limited, asking that certain screenings may be put on the free list, TheI beg to inform you that full consideration has been given to this matter. Whilst agreeing withyour suggestion that screenings which cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia should be exempt from classification under Tariff Item 208, I regret to inform yon that recent advice by the Solicitor-General shows that these goods are not properly admissible under Tariff Item 174..

I regret that the Government has decided to go to the country without, completing the business of Parliament. This Parliament would not expire by effluxion of time until five months hence, and there are matters of vital importance affecting Tasmania which are not given due consideration. I refer, in particular, to the position of the timber industry. We have in this Parliament a Government with a solid following. There is concord and unity, and no discord amongst its followers. It has a majority in another place, and yet vital matters affecting Australia are not to receive attention. My warnings have been unheeded, and my country has been betrayed. In Tasmania we groan beneath Federal oppression, and stagger under numerous blows dealt by unsound administration, which brings dishonour on its Federal brow. The Prime Minister says, "" I want more power."" power does the Government want than it has at present ? Is it losing the substance for the shadow?

136,Mr Whitsitt,"I am addressingnot believe in being a mere automaton, or a cog in a wheel of the political machine, to be revolved by ministerial momentum. I never was, and never shall be; and I condemn the Government for treating me as such. Tasmania has been sacrificed, and the Government may, when the results of the elections are .known, learu the consequences to its sorrow. My attitude on the fiscal question has been consistent. I have never cast a vote in this House, and will never do so, to place a heavy duty on something that is not manufactured in reasonable quantities in this country. I protest against the extraordinarily heavy duty of 2s. a yard ou cotton tweed. I cannot be contradicted when I say that not twenty yards of it is made in Australia to-day. The. industry has only just been commenced. This duty will hit the working man particularly hard. The Minister said the other day that cotton tweeds were competing with cheap woollen goods. They are doing nothing of the sort. If the Minister will go to the back country any time during the summer and walk through a wheat field while wearing cheap woollens, he will know why cotton tweeds are in demand. They are necessary to tens of thousands of work ing men. I will vote for as high a duty as any member of this House would support on anything manufactured in this country in sufficient quantities to supply the home market; but in the matter of cotton tweeds, no attempt is made to supply the home market. The duty is imposed to favour a few people, but it will penalize the working mar. m the bush, and to a less extent the working man in the city. It is idle for the Minister to talk of tweeds competing with cheap woollen goods, because many working men cannot wear woollen goods. I am inclined to think that the view I am now .putting forward has not been considered. Some high protectionists may accuse me of advocating protection in one breath and free trade in the next, but I protest that I am not doing so. To impose a revenue tariff, particularly when it is imposed on the working man's clothes, is a most immoral way of raising revenue, and this duty will raise revenue at the expense of the working man. I also protest against the failure to protect the timber industry. The south coast district of New South Wales presents a spectacle like the decay of civilization. The timber mills there are all out of action, because the millers cannot compete with the importers of timber. The Minister places a duty of 2s. a yard on cotton tweeds, which are not manufactured in this country, but denies proper protection to the timber industry. A few weeks ago, I stated the case for increased protection to the coke industry, and the member for the State electorate of Wollondilly wrote to the Prime Minister on the same subject. Coke as good as any that can be produced elsewhere in the world is being made in Australia, but many meu in the industry are ,now out of employment, and the coke works are closing down. Figures have been quoted which, although correct, are misleading. We have been informed .that 97£ per cent, of the coke used in -thjs coimtr.y is manufactured here, and that only a very small quantity is imported. The person who compiled those figures took the output of huge works like those of the BrokenH ill Proprietary, and Hoskins Limited, which manufacture coke for use in their own furnaces. I asked for protection for coke sold for manufacturing purposes. If the quantity of coke manufactured by the large firms for their own use is omitted from the figures, it will be found that the thousands of tons imported are a comparatively large amount. If the quantity of coke imported were manufactured here it would find work for a large number of men who are now unemployed, which would benefit both manufacturer's and workers in the industry. Thousands of tons of coke are in stock to-day, and there is no market for it Although the Minister refuses to increase the duty *on coke, he places an absurd and stupid duty of 2s. a yard on cotton tweeds, which are extensively used by Australian workmen, and are not manufactured in this country. The quantity of cotton tweed manufactured in Australia would not supply a small country store. If we are to have duties on things we do not manufacture, there is no argument, for denying protection to a languishing industry. I was hoping that honourable members would have more opportunity to discuss this matter. I voice",38,Second Reading
137,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [5.48],"my protest, and assure the House that, when the tariff schedule comes before us, it will require something more than the bald statement that cotton tweeds are being manufactured in this country to secure my vote for the duty on them. I hope that the Tariff Board will consider the request for increased duties on coke and timber. Both those industries are languishing because of inaccurate protection. I rise to express my regret that the Minister has decided to push this bill through at this juncture. It is one of those bills which I thought could very well have waited for the new Parliament. The new tariff gives complete satisfaction, apparently, to -no one. It has many anomalies which several of us desire to discuss aud remedy. As we cannot deal with the schedule to-day, I shall not discuss its various items, but I point out that a number of people in my electorate are very dissatisfied with items, the duty on which will seriously affect their busiThis simple validating measure does not ness, without extending a benefit to any Australian industry,"" and have asked me to make representations to the Minister with the object of obtaining relief in certain directions. A number of the duties, even from a protectionist viewlections of Customs duties until the point, must surely be very unsatisfactory. There is not the remotest possible chance of manufacturing in this country some of the articles that are subjected to a very opportunity to say a few words in rehigh duty. I have brought under the notice of tlie Minister one or two matters regarding which representations have been made to me, and there are a number of other matters that I wanted to deal with when the schedule was in committee. Some of the articles on which duties are imposed are of a character which precludes their being manufactured here/ Their manufacture is the result, in some cases, of the handing down of secretSji n one family, from generation to generation. Although sometimes we are able to make colourable imitations of some of those articles, we cannot manufacture the real things. duties on such articles will increase their cost to a degree that must greatly hamper their sale, and in some cases prevent their are interested, give to the House the incontinued importation. From the point of view of revenue, as well as protection, it is bad, and from the point of view of the consumer it is something like imbecility. Ah unnecessary burden, is placed upon the poprer sections of the community by the high duties imposed upon some articles. I hope the Minister will carefully study the schedule with a view to eliminating, if possible, some of those items, pending further investigation of them. I regret that this bill has been brought before the House, instead of deferring the tariff until a new Parliament, fresh from the country, could have an opportunity to deal with it in detail. Trade and Customs) [6.1] -The debate upon this bill has produced a most interesting conflict of opinion, and divisions even within party ranks. By some honourable members we have been told that the tariff should have been introduced two years ago; by others, that it should not have been submitted until next year.

The crux of the protectionist argument is that prices do not increase if our manufacturers are given fair play and are assured of the local market.

The conditions governing the Northern Territory scholarship, which was offered last year by the Government, are not satisfactory. only to pupils of the Government schools. I understand that none of the candidates for it passed in the last examination that was held. The terms under which the scholarship is offered provide that students from China, who are not eligible to become citizens of Australia, may compete so long as they attend a State school, but Australian-born children who are not attending Government schools may not do so. A Chinese who could not become a citizen of Australia was allowed to compete in the examination. He was put to considerable trouble and expense in obtaining birth and other certificates from China. Ultimately he was informed that no one had passed the examination, and I am entitled to guess why. that, although this Chinese student was allowed to sit for the examination, Australian-born white children, who were not pupils of government schools, were not permitted to do so. No t more than 50 per cent, of the children who attend the convent schools are adherents of the church to which the schools belong. I know that the Minister will say that he does not favour subsidies being paid to schools other than government schools, but that issue is not before us. This is a question of some Australian-born children being denied privileges which are granted to others. It is not a question of subsidising the school, but of subsidising the child; and therefore no distinction of this nature should be made. Some time ago I wrote to the Minister on this subject, and received a reply which contained the following paragraph : An exact analogy cannot be said to exist between the education system of the Territory and those of tlie States. Tlie cost of the State systems is borne from tlie revenue of the States, but the cost of tlie Territory system is not borne from Territory revenue (i.e., revenue raised from sources within the Territory). As the whole of the revenue of the Commonwealth is derived from the that reply will not stand analysis. bring this matter up as evidence of the inconsistency of the Government Mr Nelson. administration of educational matters in the Northern Territory. When the great war was in progress, those who were then flag-flapping did not ask the individual soldier to what denomination he belonged, or what was his creed; but now, The scholarship is open when it is a question of educating Australian children, the sectarian issue is raised. 1 ask the Minister to arrange that the next examination shall be open to all the children of the Northern Territory, irrespective of whether they attend State or convent schools, or receive their education from private tutors. To do so would merely be an act of justice to the people of the Northern Territory. I desire now to refer to the need for road communication in the Northern Territory. All honourable members w ill agree that roads are necessary for the development of any country. In this connection I wish to place on record some particulars showing the cost of transportation in the Northern Territory. One of the biggest cattle staM y point is tions in the Northern Territory is at WaveH ill . It costs £ 2 9 9s. per ton to purchase and transport a ton of flour to Victoria River, and an additional £ 1 per ton to handle it at the river. The cartage costs for the remaining 180 miles to WavoH ill amount to £16, making a total of £ 4 6 9s. Od. for one ton of flour landed at the station. While these conditions exist it is unreasonable to expect the Northern Territory to develop. If the Government had the interests of the territory at heart it would see that roads suitable for motor transport were provided in order to reduce the cost of transportation. AlthoughI have travelled extensively in the Northern Territory, I have seen no evidence of any road policy in operation there. Some time ago I received a petition signed by 60 or 70 miners and pastoralists in Central Australia. That petition is not drawn up in the usual form, but nevertheless it rings true, and contains the matured opinion of men who are doing the spade work of developing the territory. The petition readsWe tlie undersigned, and residents of the Northern Territory, respectfully petition to the honourable the Minister for Home and Territories to provideStates, (1) A road suitable for motor traffic to be I constructed from Alice Springs through Arltunga District to Lake Nash Station, on the Queensland in its border. (2) To have a mail service from Alice Springs, through Arltunga District, to link up with the Queensland mail service. The benefits are namely:-Opening up first well-known mineral country and good pastoral country, and providing necessary communication with civilization for those on the spot and the settlers who will come out when better conditions are offering them than is the case at the present time. Further, another matter that requires urgent attention is by opening up Bitter Springs for the convenience of traffic. And a well that has fallen in between Bitter SpTings and Williams's Well, that old hands say had a fair supply of water, if done up again would bo a groat convenience to all travellers. from Arltunga to Lake Nash can be obtained from residents, and also as regards tlie surface water thereon. And we further .request Mr treaty with Belgium, and the historic reNelson, our member for the Northern Territory, to present this petition upon our behalf. Road-making in the Northern Territory is not a costly undertaking. It means blazing a track and providing water; macadamized roads are practically unknown. In various parts of the Northern Territory men have gone out in the search for gold, and in the Tanami district their efforts met with success. But on their way back, after having carried water for 400 miles on camels, one of the men perished of thirst These men make great sacrifices in order to develop the territory, yet the Government does nothing to assist them. could do would be to open up roads and provide water, with finger-posts indicating where it could be found. I know of instances of men having died of thirst in the Northern Territory although within a. mile or two of water. Such a state of affairs is scandalous. To provide direction posts would not cost more than £3,000 or £3,000, which is a small sum compared with the value of the work that these men are doing in the development of the Northern Territory. They are doing their part; the Government should also do its share. These men do not want spoon feeding; they ask only that they may be enabled to keep in touch with civilization with a minimum of risk. The establishment of a number of mining fields in the Northern Territory would do more to populate that country than all the talk of advisory councils or commissions. Men who are prepared to take such risks should be encouraged, because their work tends to settlement. On their behalf I appeal to ;the Government. Any one who has travelled extensively in the Northern Territory knows that its great mineral resources are only waiting to be exploited. It is not a question of discovering them. The lodes have been located, and their worth is known, but the cost of transportation over a waterless tract of country is beyond the resources of the ordinary prospector. If the Government did its duty, a geologist would be appointed for the Northern Territory. It is false economy not to make such an appointment. The failure to honour the agreement Information as to the direction with South Australiafor the construction of the north-south railway reminds one of the German attitude towards the mark that it was merely a "" scrap of paper!"" This is the second time the Government has dishonoured its agreement with the Government of South Australia, and incidentally with the people of Central Australia. It is useless for the Government to say that circumstances have made it impossible for it to honour this agreement, because, as the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Whitsitt) has pointed out, it has the numbers in both Houses of this Parliament, and could pass such legislation as it desires. Again, the Northern Territory is side-tracked and The least that it left as it was 100 years ago. It is cruel that the construction of this railway should be further delayed in view of thehardships which settlers in the Northern Territory have to undergo.

The adoption of this suggestion would have the twofold advantage of providing a school for the training of Australian aviators and reducing to some extent the isolation committee: of centres iu the Northern Territory. I master-General) [8.39] I should like to say a word or two in reply to the remarks of the honourable member for the No r t h ern Terri tory ( Mr Xelson). The Post and I understood that the Telegraph Department, in calling tenders for mail services for tbe wide areas of the Northern Territory and Western Australia, invites alternative tenders for the carriage of mails by camel teams, by motor cars, or by aerial service. We are hoping that many of these mail services will be. conducted with aeroplanes in the near future. On this point, will the Postmaster General( Mr Gibson) give me some information which I have been unable to obtain from the Ministerf o r Defence( Sir Neville Howse) ? W ill he promise the extension of the aerial mail service from Derby to Wyndham? The matter has been under discussion for several months, but finality in connection with it has not been reached.

Cheap postage was for the benefit, not of the ordinary man, but of the big. city institutions. If the Government can lose £1,100,000 of revenue in one year on behalf of big concerns, it ought to be able to. do something to increase the earnings of allowance postmasters. I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister a request for a telephone service along the new railway line from Wanbi to Moorook. The residents along that line are farmers, and there are applications for telephones for Caliph, Tuscan, Wunkar, and Myrla. As the Railway Department has erected poles, and has a telephone line, the Minister should agree to supply a telephone service before harvest time. I admit that in many directions I have received a fair deal from the Postal Department, but I am very dissatisfied with the treatment meted out to Blackwood. I have tried to obtain the delivery of telegrams and letters at that place. The postmaster had to go down to the plains to find a house to live in. The tendency of the department is to regard Blackwood as a country town, whereas, although it is in. the hills, it is practically a suburb of Adelaide. It is treated very differently from other suburbs. If it is big enough for an. official office, it is big enough to a man to take charge of an office. have letters and telegrams delivered. Men living there have told me that instead of haying letters addressed to Blackwood, they have them addressed to their offices in Adelaide. master-General) [8.54] I was glad to hear the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) say that he had had a faildeal from the Postal Department. This Government in the last three, years has spent more money on postal and telephone services than was spent in. the previous 22 years. All honourable members, if they are fair, will endorse the statement of the honourable member. has a wonderful record in this respect. The honourable member seems to think that country districts have not been treated as well as city districts, but, as a matter of fact, more telephone services have been connected in country than in city districts He referred to allowance postmasters receiving smaller remuneration as a result of the department charging for direct instead of route mileage; but an allowance has been made to those postmasters to compensate them for the loss of revenue in that ,way. their pay has increased in proportion to the increased business? not been penalized by the reduction of i d . in the postage rates, or by charging for direct mileage, for telephone calls. I admit that allowance postmasters present a difficult problem. Only last week the department offered all the revenue of a post office to an allowance postmaster for conducting the office. It is costing the department £100 to bring the mail to that office, so that we are losing not only £100 a year, but also the whole revenue of the office. Problems similar to that face us all over the country, and we are doing our best to solve thorn. similar offer to all allowance postmasters? They receive at least 40 per cent, of the telephone revenue, and i u some instances all the revenue of the office. It is impossible to pay on a definite scale. We have to make the best bargain we can. In some instances we are not able to find scale of rates. scale of rates. The scale referred to by the honourable member does not apply in every case. I think that, generally, honourable, members from country districts are satisfied with what the Government has done during the last three years. I have endeavoured to knock a little common sense into the head of the Prime Minister and the members of his Cabinet.

179,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [8.5?],"to vote against one of my motions relating to the unfortunate soldiers, their wives, and children, who, in my opinion, are being defrauded of their rights by the Repatriation Department. There are medical men under, the control of the Minister for Defence who are acting either the part of a prosecuting barrister, self and his dependants. As a Labour desirous of finding the unfortunate soldiers guilty, or of a mean, pettifogging detective, crawling along a trail to see if in this Parliament, to ensure that the soldier, who offered his life to fight for his country, had a diseased father, mother, grandfather, or grandmother. I was the only member of the recruiting committee of the State of Victoria who remained on that committee throughout its activities. Successive chairmen came and, after attending a few meetings and obtaining a little kudos, crawled away. The promises made on every platform to the brave fellows who offered their lives have not been kept as generously as the l>eople of Australia intended they should be. Would any man have dared to say on a recruiting platform that the promises that were being made would not be fulfilled if the Government could trace a disease to the father, mother, grandfather, or grandmother of a soldier? Nine clever men gave sworn evidence in the awful Gunner Perry case that the man was a malingerer. As a result he was placed in an observation ward, where he could be watched through a hole hidden behind a picture, and for six months he was kept there. Let honourable members ask one of. God's best men in the medical profession, Dr. Godfrey, who was then i u charge, if that man was a malingerer. He said that the man would not have been there for seven days if he had been a malingerer. Yet those nine wonderful men in the pay of the Defence Department swore that he was a malingerer. I shall not let this proposal die with this Parliament. I shall ask every soldier throughout Australia to censure this Government for not having done justice to the men who offered their services in the war. What do I care for the opinion of scientists who, ascertaining that a soldier's grandfather or grandmother had consumption or syphilis, urge that as a pre-war origin of post-war disability? If the Government were really humane it would declare that every soldier who offered his life for his country and submitted to examination by expert physicians aiid surgeons should be regarded as having, been at that time a healthy man, and if he returned from the war maimed or broken, he should be entitled to claim from his country maintenance for himman I promise that in the new Parliament I shall do my best, as I have done measure of justice to every Australian -who offered his life for his country, in accordance with the promises that were made from every recruiting platform throughout the' Commonwealth. Even little children are being robbed by a reduction of their pension. What was ihe end of Gunner Perry after his discbarge from the Defence Department ? . After being in the lunacy observation .ward for six months he became obsessed with the hallucination that he was a retired captain and with the phenomenal voice he had developed he was asking for recruits. Suddenly a suspicion regarding him arose in Brisbane and I was asked for information concerning him. God knows I was tired of the case, but I referred the inquirer to the Defence Department. Perry persuaded some poor foolish girl to marry him. Later she found in his pocket a letter from his first wife. She made a fuss and he gave her a hiding. She disappeared and has never since been heard of. He, too, has disappeared, and in the absence of proof that he is alive the department is mean enough to take away the pension from his wife and little children. So long as I have voice that accusation against the Government will ring throughout the Commonwealth. When I submitted my motion a few weeks ago I was not wedded to its verbiage; I would willingly have accepted any generous offer from the Government, but not the reply that came from my dear, big-hearted friend the Minister for Defence. It was all very, well for him with his greater learning to support the findings of the medical officers of the department, but I have mentioned an instance of the mistake made by ""nine of the highest men in the profession, including some of the greatest neurologists in Melbourne. When Perry gave his evidence in the court one could have heard a pin drop. Mr Joseph Woolf said to one medical witness"" Doctor, have I to congratulate you on taking money from both.sides?"" I wish honourable members could have seen the face of that doctor when he heard the question and the amusement shown on the faces of the students from the Melbourne Hospital. Later when I met him at the Government House ball doctor. tend functions at Government House. When that doctor came to me and referred to the-case I told him that when he looked into the face of God Almighty he would feel a mighty mean man on account of what he did to Gunner Perry. He admitted to me that perhaps his evidence was wrongly given in the court, and for that admission I honour him. I assure this Government that as soon as the new Parliament meets I shall restore to the business paper my motion regarding the injustice done to some soldiers on the ground that their ailments were of pre-war origin, and I shall endeavour to have a division taken upon it . For many months I have been endeavouring to induce the Government to establish a wireless station on Lord Howe Island, which is situated about 450 miles off the mainland. budget speech and in the report of the Postal Department credit is claimed for the policy of extending wireless communication along the Australian coast, but there is a peculiar omission of any reference to Lord Howe Island. lying possession of the Commonwealth is on the route of mail steamers running between Australia and New Zealand and America, and as it is in a very dangerous zone, many wrecks have occurred in the vicinity. inhabitants is the cultivation of the Kentia palm, and the export of its seed. A peculiar feature of that palm is that it is not prolific after it leaves Lord Howe Island. When a vessel was wrecked there, communication with the mainland was impossible, and rats overran the island and injured the crops. are almost entirely isolated from civilization, and they cannot afford to provide the amount of money that the Government requires them to contribute towards the cost of a wireless station. I have suggested that the Government should establish a station, and, for the sake of economy, should train a couple of. youths on the island to operate it continuously. I am assured by the officers of the Meteorological Bureau that the weather reports which such a station could furnish would be of great value, particularly to shipping. The Premier of New South Wales appealed to ' the Prime Minister to erect a. wireless station on the island. Norfolk Island, which is a further 450 miles off the mainland, is less isolated because it can maintain constant communication with the mainland by cable, I have endeavored also to get an improved mail service for Lord Howe Island, but I have not been able to overcome the selfish influence of the shipping combine. Burns, Philp and Co. have a monopoly of the shipping services between the Commonwealth and the islands of the Pacific. I endeavoured to get another company to provide an intermediate service, but the influence of Burns, Philp and Co. with the department was great enough to prevent that. Before the war two steamers maintained a service with the island, but now there is only one mail every five weeks, and the schedule in the mail contract is regularly ignored. Moreover, the company's vessel leaves perishable goods on the wharf whenever it suits the convenience of the capI n the Treasurer's tain not to l if t them. One traveller has stated that, if there is one hell-hole in the Southern Hemisphere it is Burns, Philp and Co.'s boat running between Sydney and Lord Howe Island. Eight persons are crowded into accommodation that That butshould hold only three, and four passengers are squeezed into a cabin that should hold only one. The department has informed me that for twelve months this company has promised to provide another steamer for the service, b u f it never ke»-ps The principal industry of the its word. It seems to wield a wonderful influence with the Commonwealth Government, and if the present Ministry remains in power, no improvement in the service can be expected. Lord Howe Island is .controlled by a New South Wales board, consisting of three members.

We know that in some cases it is better to give a payment in lieu of notice than to employ a servant for the time in question, and .we are permitting the Government to have this £8,000,000 with the consciousness that, by so doing, and getting an early election, we shall choose the lesser of two evils. I should like to say a few words before we go, because, after all, even the most optimistic of us sometimes suffer accidents, and I can foresee at least the possibility that after the elections I may have to pay for my own printing. I quite accept the Government's assurance that it' can no longer govern this country. That declaration appears fo me to be a very genuine and frank admission of what has-been obvious for some time to honourable members on this side. The Government has made a mistake in assuming that merely because it cannot govern this country in a for assistance. Storms constitutional manner, constitutional government is therefore impossible at present. That, I think, was an egregious installation mistake.

The honourable member for Darwin( Mr. Whitsitt) prophesied that a dreadful judgment would befall the Government at. the next election for failing to carry on the business of this country. It was an outburst of veracity on his part such as could be expected only from an honourable member who had decided not to submit himself again for election, and I understa^ d that that is the intention of the honourable member for Darwin. It was most painful. On this last day of the session, at the very moment when perfect unity is being prescribed by the press, when the issue is so clear and undoubted, there uprises in his corner the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) to declare that not only the policy of the Government, but also the great national policy of Australia for the protection of primary industries, will lead to the destruction of this country, and possibly to the undoing of the Government itself.

But in this case the Government has decided what it will be charged with at the forthcoming election. It may be, however, that we, as an Opposition,, standing, as we believe, for the great majority of the people, of this, country--ou r belief being based upon the tangible evidence afforded, us by the elections that have taken place in. the various. States since the last Federal electionwill consider it to be our not altogether unpleasant duty to formulate certain other charges against the Government. It may be, after all, that the issue will not be nearly so simple as honourable members on the ministerial side of the committee would wish that it might be, or would have it be. It may be that we shall rake over the dead ashes of history, and from the platforms of this country, and in the sections of the press that are not irrevocably committed to the simple issue, call to the mind of the people that this Government has been guilty of such acts as tbe spoliation! of the public utilities of this country for the purpose of buttressing up its own particular interests and those of its friends. If may be that we shall recall such things as scandals in wireless contracts, about which we have heard nothing heretofore. We may have occasion also to recall certain scandals in connection with taxation more money than would have sufficed to pay the extra 2s. 6d. a week in pensions which the Government has so long delayed to provide. It would have delayed much longer if the unanswerable logic of an immediate appeal to the people had not forced it to act. Some of these things may, in some way or other, yet be an issue at the forthcoming election. Tbe great press organs may have to revise their views as to what really are the essential and important matters in this contest. I had the distinguished honour last Sunday, on the principle of ""the better the day the better the deed,"" of being present at a gathering in Yarra Park, where some 30,000 or 35,000 strongly interested but quiet Australians displayed entirely sympathetic concern in the issues that were being discussed. The mast popular sentiment that one could utter at that gathering was that, in the contests in mendacity that are apparently popular among certain classes in this country at present, aud in which the Government is not easily beaten, it is still outdistanced by its press supjjorters. It was said in tbe press thai at one of those gatherings not long agto several hundreds of people were present. I , and other exj^ei'ienced observers of public meetings, estimated that there were between 6,000 and 10,000 present. At the meeting on Sunday last it was said in a section of the press that about SjOOO people were present. I , and other good judges of numbers, put the number down at between 30,000 and 35,000 people. It was a phenomenal and wonderful gathering of deeply interested Australians. It was said that there was uproar. There was none. On Sunday night another remarkable gathering assembled at the Bijou Theatre to hear an address by the Deputy Leader of the Labour party ( Mr Anstey). It was remarkable in that the doors of the theatre had to be. closed long before the meeting was timed to commence, and crowds of people were denied admission. The galleries, the amphi-theatre, the dress circle, the orchestra enclosure, and even the platform, were filled. one of the most brilliant expositions of from their envenomed maws ten times a the Labour party's cause that I have hundred thousand samples of unscrupuever heard by one of the party's most lous uuveracity.

I am not unduly optimistic, but I am satisfied that the policy of this Government will not delude intelligent people. They will recognize that between the communists and the makers of the communists, there is a middle party-a n Australian party-whic h is the Labour party, and they will return it to power. To them we shall make our appeal. If honourable members will look at last evening's newspaper they will find a copy there of a manifesto issued by the communist party. Those who study the question know that the communists have been publishing their propaganda for years past. , Ten years before the last electionthey published it so far as their means and influence permitted. In the past their propaganda was confined to a few thousand sheets but now their views are advertized free of cost in hundreds of thousands of copies of our highly respectable constitutional journals. How is it that they get this free advertisement? They want it ; they have asked for it ; they are anxious to have their views placed before the people. Why this publicity in our respectable journals? Why do our newspapers give to communist propaganda space which they would not give to the views of the great Labour party ? It is done because they hope that by an unholy alliance with Communism they will be able to destroy the great Australian Labour party. They need not suppose that we are entering this contest with gloves on, or that we are entering it fearing that the newspaper in the morning may say something unpleasant about us, or may give us one inch when we hope:! for two inches. Our message is that we will fight them, and they can go to hell. The calm and dispassionate address of able member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), 1 the honourable member for Batman who has devoted a great deal of industry, ( Mr Brennan) upon the subject of and, if I may say so without being presupply is indeed interesting. difficult to see what some of the speech degree of ability in this regard. But if was about, but I made a note of several there was one thing that fell flat as a of the subjects which he mentioned. In charge against the Government, it was the first place he threatened in the coming that charge, based on its administration election contest a campaign of scandal, of taxation matters. This matter was the and of sinister suggestion regarding the administration of the Government. Mr O'KEEFE -He gave straight-out statements of facts. duty, not only of every member of this House who is seeking re-election, but of every citizen of the country, to criticize the Government. Public administration must necessarily be open to criticism. The honourable member said something about wireless. SinceI have had the honour of being a member of this House, I have attended assiduously to my duties, but I have nob heard anything, so far as I can recollect, about wireless during the life of this Parliament, although in the previous Parliament a good deal was said on the subject. I think that I remember something about a committee which inquired into the matter, and I think that I remember something about a report which was said to have been signed by all the members of that committee. I think that that report bore the signature of the honourable member for Batman, but for some reason which it is difficult to -understand, he withdrew, or amended his signature. member my assurance that I never signed the document. My name was put to it by another person without my authority. able member's assurance. Since thattime there has been an election and during the life of this Parliament, as I have said, there has been no discussion on wireless. There has certainly been no scandal in connection with wireless so far as this Government is concerned. In this connection I am glad to say that the present Government is different from that which preceded it . I make no concealment of my opinion that the present Government is infinitely superior to that which preceded it . The honourable member for Batman also condescended to say something about taxation.

187,Mr Latham,"I accept the honorsubject of inquiry by a royal commission, whose report did not support the charges of the honourable member for Yarra. One thing which the report made clear was that what was done in relation to taxation and the arrears of certain taxation,' whether good or bad, was not done by the Government or by -any member of the Government, but by the Commissioner for Taxation. Accordingly, on the subject of taxation there is no charge against the Government, and no facts to support any charge if the position is truly placed before the people. The honourable member complained of the reports given by the press to the speeches of honourable members of the Labour party, including, possibly, those made by himself. Probably we all occasionally have reason to complain of the reports of our speeches; we think that the importance of what we hav,e said has not been sufficiently understood. I feel that I have suffered in this connection, but I take it as being all in the day's work. The honourable member, on the last da}' of the session, has sought to include in the records of the House some calculations of the attendances at meetings recently held on the Y a r r a bank. It was very interesting to hear him speak of a meeting attended by 35,000 people. I know where the meetings are held, as occasionally I attend them. The place must have been crowded if 35,000 people were present. The honourable member has said in advance that the supporters of the Government intend to rely upon calculated mendacity. It may be that that is parliamentary language, although I should think that it is not. I suppose that, as the remark was not directed against any particular member, but against Government supporters as a whole, it was allowed to pass. I can only say that at election meetings at which I address the electors I always invite questions upon any subject with which I have dealt, and, so far as I am concerned, I am prepared to give facts in support of every statement. I make. practice also of honourable members generally. able to hear one honourable member make a general accusation of intended mendacity-deliberat e lying-agains t all honourable members opposed to him . I refuse to believe that the honourable member in his less exalted moments would seriously make that charge against any of the persons whom he meets day by day in this House. The honourable member finished by saying something on the subject of communism The issue which the electors will soon have to decide has been stated clearly by the Prime Minister, and it is very important that no false issue shall be raised. BecauseI have suffered from the false impression which incorrect reports of my speeches have made, I refer to this question. One honourable member opposite has referred to a report of one of my speeches, which credited me with having said that communism in Australia was a negligible factor. I did not say that, and I am glad to have this opportunity of denying it . I repeat now what I said on that occasion, -and shall express my view of the issue which is soon to be determined by the people. A t Surrey Hills, on the occasion referred to. I said that I did not stand before the people to suggest that all the members of the Labour party were communists or anything of the kind. I do not believe that they are: to say so would be untrue. I know hundreds of members and supporters of the Labour party in different parts of Australia, and am certain that very few of them are themselves communists. The charge against the Labour party is not that they are communists. The position confronting Australia is that a very few men, with a deliberate wrecking policy, can do a great deal of harm to the country, and are doing it at the present time. How to deal w i th them is the real problema problem which the Labour party is not game to tackle. A t this time, when aii election is upon us, we hear, as we expect to hear, from Labour member's, a disavowal of extremists; but it required the imminence of an election to bring out even the mild declaration that "" We have no time for Mr Walsh."" Some time ago the Labour party passed a resolution excluding communists from its membership. I ask honourable members opposite how Probably that is the many communists were excluded from the party, and the names of those who were It is, therefore, rather remarkexcluded ? pelled more communists from its ranks than the party to which the honourable ; member belongs has expelled profiteers. been expelled ?

There has never heen a greater example of pitif u l and timid, camouflage than the resolution expelling communists from the Labour party. The communists are few. As I have said, in numbers they are negligible. his return to any parliament in Australia. But the Labour party has only mild condemnation of them at election time. It can point to no action following upon its words of condemnation. These people are doing a great deal of harm in Australia. We do not know how far the injury they are doing may extend. remedy; it is attempting to deal with the position. It seeks the support of the country for its policy. What is the policy of the Labour party for dealing with this social .menace and danger to the community? Isi t a danger, and is it a real problem? If it is not a real problem, why did the Labour party pass the resolution to which I have referred? If it is a danger and a real problem what are the members of the Labour party going to do about it? We can ask that question, but we -shall get no answer from Labour members. -The very able and excellent speech of Sydney( Mr Hughes) he said at several the honourable member for Batman( Mr public gatherings, "" I am going to stand Brennan) has drawn at least one badger, or fall with W. M . Hughes."" How did and has placed him on his defence the honourable member stand or fall with straight away. When a lawyer on the the right honourable member for North other side is drawn into his defence, it Sydney? can easily be imagined what ordinary members of the party opposite will be doing in a few weeks' time. The honora league with one of the bitterest politiable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) cal enemies of the right honourable gentlespoke very differently at the last election man, and took the first opportunity to when he was seeking the suffrages of the leave him in tlie lurch.

He smote That is the opinion expressed by the it, hip and thigh; but we now find him Reverend Farnham Maynard, a reputable cringing and crawling to the Nationalist party. During the last day or two I have examined the figures connected with the honourable member's election, and I find that of the 5,000 votes polled for Miss Jean Daly, the Labour candidate for Kooyong, the honourable member received nearly the whole as second preference votes, and they put him in for the No communist can secure electorate. At that time the honourable member knew how to bow and scrape to the Labour party in Kooyong, but now, when another election is iu sight, he is afraid that if he assumes too much independence the Nationalists will bring out Sir Robert Best, or some other candidate, against him. He knows tliat if this were done he would be dead, politically. On The Government has a this account the honourable member adopts all the tactics of the knowing lawyer to make, his political position safe. He talks of others levelling a general charge of mendacity, aud of running away from election pledges. I am going to fix the charge upon the leader whom the honourable member is so slavishly following to-day; I refer to the Prime Minister, Mr Stanley Melbourne Bruce. Honourable members opposite are following him only because he is a wealthy Flinderslane merchant. They are crawling to the biggest exploiters of the people that we have in Australia.

I have heard every one speak of this gentleman's citizenship in the highest possible terms. This is what he said on his return from the OldL a n d : His visit to England had made him more sympathetic with the masses. They had a groat deal of justification for their present world-wide attitude. While British seamen wore asked to give up £l a month, he knew of one shipbuilder wiho was to celebrate tlie construction of a new liner by taking the liner to Norway on a pleasure trip costing scores of thousands of pounds. Therefore, we should weigh well our attitude towards maintaining a reasonable adjustment of the things of life. granted only with reluctance. The fault today was not altogether with the men. He would urge employers to read the signs of the times, and give way before they were forced. If they wei-e more liberal in giving of tlie fruits of industry to labour before they wore demanded, the rehitionshiip between labour and previous Governments, it should be excapital would ibe much better. This gentleman spoke with the authority of a representative of one of the biggest commercial firms in Melbourne. I have quoted the opinions of men who are outside the political aTena and who do not view the signs of the times through political glasses. The honourable member for -Kooyong has been a member of this House for about three years only, and I suggest that he should not be too susceptible to the pin-pricks he may be subjected to here and to the knocks he is likely to get outside. Sof a r as I can see, the Prime Minister has set out on a campaign of mendacity and scurrility, and we may bet our bottom dollar that every Labour platform wili riug and resound with all those democratic views that have been stated by Labour men for many years. I believe that the public will respond magnificently, and w ill return ministerialists to that oblivion from which they never should have been dragged. that it is incumbent on me to reply to some of --the statements [made by the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson), but before doing that I wish to refer to a statement by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham). He said that honourable members of the Labour party denounced communism only on the eve of the election. Federal Labour party. of the Australian Labour party met in October of last year, when there were no signs of a general election. A t that conference a resolution was passed which makes it impossible for an avowed communist to become a member of the Australian Labour party. That is the answer I give to the accusation of the honourable member for Kooyong that we are merely denouncing the communists because we are on the eve of an election. The Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson) boasted about what this Government had done, during the last three years, in providing telephones. I have already In the past concessions had been given him credit for that, but I must go a little farther, and remind him and the House that this Government has had more loan money for such facilities than any other Government since federation. Asi t has had more loan money than pected to provide better facilities than they provided. The Postmaster-General said that I stated that because of the reduction of the postage the pay of allowance postmasters had been reduced. I did not say that. WhatI did say was that if the Government could give a cheaper rate of postage to the big city interestsa concession which, in the first year of its operation; cost £1,100,000 it could afford to give an increased allowance to many of the allowance postmasters and postmistresses who are being inadequately paid for the work they do. The issue is not between the Postmaster-General and me, but between him and the secretary of the Allowance Postmasters' Association of South Australia. Seeing that I cannot obtain from the department a printed list of the rates of payment, I have to take the word of each side. I have in my possession a letter similar to that sent to the Postmaster-Generali n June last, and not yet answered by the department. I shall quote extracts from it It is the opinion of members of the South Australian Allowance Postmasters' Association that they, hke others of their position in the various States, are in want of a long-sought revision of the scale rates by which the remuneration of their allowances is made.

197,Mr Gabb,"The Federal Conferencerecent years the discontinuance of road mail bags, reduced telephone charges, the non-payment for incoming trunk line calls, non-payment for the distribution of income tax returns, electoral roll claim cards, payments made to line parties, and other items of a small nature, all of which take up a postmaster's time. Later, the letter saysThe discontinuance of road mail bags, reduced telephone charges, &c, causing a reduction in personal allowance, also causes a reduction in the accommodation and lighting ' allowance. The writer also saysThrough the reduction of telephone charges the allowance postmaster loses forty per cent, of the reduction. No recompense is at present paid by the department. If the Postmaster-General can tell me that there has been an alteration since the letter was written in June last, I shall be pleased to hear of it . this further statementThe discontinuance of road mail bags has the same amount of work attached to it as previously, with the exception that the mailman supplies the bag, and not the department, and there is no bag to be sealed; but mails have to be attended to as previously. Here is something for the Postmaster General to reply toCutting out the road mail bag in 1920-21 brought my allowance down by £17 7s. That man is a returned soldier, who has lost an arm, and the cheese-paring policy of the Postal Department in discontinuing road mail bags and saving sealing has taken from this one-armed returned soldier, in one year, £17 7s. Notwithstanding that, the Government can give l£d. postage to the lawyers, banks, commission agents, newspapers, and big city interests. I repeat that in this matter, as in many others, the Government has proved itself to be a Government for big business men. The following quotation from the letter answers a statement by the Postmaster-General:I also notice that the Postmaster-General stated, according to Hansard, allowance postmasters will not suffer through reduced telephone charges. They must unless scale rate is altered. Surely the department should let the allowance postmasters and postmistresses know the basis on. which they are paid, for they have a right check the payments made to them. I have heard honourable members ask for particulars of these rates, and the reply of the Postmaster-General has been, "" The honourable member can see a list."" He ""has not offered to supply us with one. There must be some scale of rates in operation to-day. I have here a copy of the 1919 rates. The writer of the letter from which I have read informs me that allowance postmasters were paid on that scale up to the end of the last financial year. Here are some of the payments:1. Postal articles posted and received (parcels post and registered articles not included) -2,00 0 per annum or under, £3; over 2,000 and up to 3,000 per annum,' £4; each ljOOO or part over 3,000 per annum, 5s. 2. Registered articles registered locally or received in mails, one penny each. 3. Parcels post (same as registered). 4. Value payable parcels posted and received, threepence each. 5. Mails received and dispatched (including Then there is free bags, but not including private mail bags), per annum-31 2 or under, £4; over 312 up to 024, £C; each 312 or part over 624, £2. .6. Private mail bags-Fo r each service: not more than thrice weekly, £1; more than thrice weekly, but not exceeding six times a week, £2; more than six times a week, £4. 7. Night attendance for receipt and dispatch of mails-Fo r each weekly attendance: between the hours of 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. and (i a.m. to 9 a.m., £1 per annum; 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., £2 per annum. How would any honourable member like to be compelled to give attendance once a week for 52 weeks between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. for £2? W ill any honourable member say that that is a magnificent payment ? S. Sunday attendance for mail work onlyWhere regular Sunday work is necessary, for each attendance, £2 per annum. 9. Postal notes sold-Twopenc e per complete £1 worth sold. 10. Postal note3 paid (money order offices only)-Twopenc e per complete £1 worth paid. 11. Money orders-Threepenc e for each order issued; 2d. for each order paid. 12. Savings Bank-Fiv e shillings per cent, on amount of deposits and -withdrawals That is a very niggardly rate. It is well known that the average Savings Bank operation is not a very large one. 13. Telegrams (including service messages) -Twopenc e for each telegram dispatched; 3d. for each telegram received and enveloped. 14. Telegrams in transit-Twopenc e for each cross telegram transmitted. to 15.

When total revenue from all telephone sources readies £150 per annum, special payment for attendance between 0 and S p.m., £20 per annum. Iu spite of what the Postmaster-General has said, there must be some scale of rates on which payments are based. I would not have spoken at such length but for the fact that he said that there was not such a scale. I have placed one on record, and if it is wrong it rests with him to correct it . There are two classes of allowance postmasters. a business, such as a store. The other class-and it is for those who are in that class that I have repeatedly appealedhas in its ranks widows of ex-postmasters aud returned soldiers. They occupy buildings that, in the old clays, under the South Australian Government, were official offices. The Commonwealth has not been so liberal, and many of these are no longer official offices. For those persons and others keeping an office in private dwellings, the scale of payment should be greater than for those who are engaged in businesses of their own, and are able to increase their earnings from that source because of the additional trade that the post office brings to them. Until this Government, or a succeeding Government, differentiates between the man who keeps a business aud the one who is dependent solely on the post offioe, and increases the scale of rates for both, there will not be satisfaction amongst allowance postmasters. This afternoon the Postmaster-General replied to a question I had based on a statement by him that all employees in the postal department were receiving the basic wage. Immediately his statement diers, they informed me that it was not correct, and that employees who had an average of eight years' service were not receiving anything like the basic wage. In vulgar parlance, somebody is a liar, and I do not think the men concerned would deceive me by saying that the Postmaster-General has made an incor(3) Operating, rect statement. I hope that the honourable gentleman has not merely accepted a (4) Allowtelephone message or telegram from the departmental officers in South Australia without personally verifying it. If he does not ensure to the employees the payment which he admits they should receive he is causing discontent in the service, and a discontented employee cannot be thoroughly efficient. There is another complaint in regard to the child allowance. Some regulation operates whereby a temporary employee or a labourer does not leceive the child allowance that is paid to the higher, officers in the service. Every child must be fed and clothed, and so far as the necessaries of life are concerned there is no difference between the One class runs child of a labourer and the child of the highest official in the service. Some members of the service, however, are not receiving the child allowance, and the victims of such an anomaly cannot be expected to give their best to the department. They will always be discontented and seeking advice as to the best means of removing the injustices from which they suffer. I hope that the Postmaster General will personally investigate these complaints. I believe that when the basic wage was instituted by the Hughes Government the intention was that it should be paid to every employee of the Commonwealth. I ask the Postmaster-General to see that that is done.

To Mr Bamford wo are, unfortunately, obliged to say f arewell. He has had a very long and distinguished career as a member of this Parliament. He is leaving us at his own desire, for he does not propose to seek re-election. I am sure that I can say that he will take away with him the best wishes of all honourable members, irrespective of party. It is a matter for deep regret that when we reassemble he will not be with us. Some one else will then take the position of ""father of the House"" that he has so worthily filled. To the officers who sit at the table we all wish to express our appreciation.

I believe that throughout this Parliament we have managed to follow the best traditions of all British Parliaments.

They are running the risk of making tens of thousands of bolsheviks and communists by this campaign of wholesale misrepresentation and calumny. Retribution must fOIIOAV sooner or later, and if ever it comes, it will come in a form Avhich Avill shake the foundations of society. people of this country to ivitness that those Avhose responsibility it Avill be haA'e received ample warning. Peace, order, and good government will follow only from just laws applicable to every section of the community, and that is what the Australian Labour party stands for. As the Prime Minister said, Ave are ou the eve of a dissolution. I join Avith him, therefore in conveying to you, sir, the very great appreciation of honourable members on this side of the House, and I think that I can say also of the other side of the House of the very able manner in which you have discharged the onerous and very important duties of your office. I do not think that there has ever been a Parliament in which so much feeling has been engendered as in this. In spite of that, you have displayed firmness and tact, and have been able to preside over the sittings of the House with decorum. I understand that Ave shall be losing your services as Speaker at the close of this Parliament, but no doubt, Ave shall still have you among us on the floor of the House. Probably some of us would prefer that you continued in your present position. I feel that I am only stating Avhat is in the hearts of every honourable member AvhenI say that you, sir, have given entire satisfaction in the very important position that you occupy in this chamber. I regret very much the decision of the Chair-man of the Committees and my very old friend, Mr Bamford, to retire from politics I have learned to love him. We may hold different political opinions, but I always"" recognize a man when I meet one. I have a kind feeling for our veteran legislator. He has played a very prominent part in the politics of this country for many years, ' and I hope that the remainder of his life Avill be happy, and that he will enjoy the best of health and be long spared, although not Avith us, at least to take an active interest in the affairs of his country. I appreciate very much the kindness that the officials at the table haA'e extended to myself and also to other members of the Labour party. I believe that that feeling is general. They recognize the duties that devolve upon them, and their endeavours to discharge them. I call the impartially and to the best of their ability have met with the entire satisfaction of this House. Often when sitting in this chamber I have thought Avhat a difficult position they occupy. They have to be alert Avhile the House is sitting, and, like yourself, Mr Speaker, have to sit continuously in an atmosphere Avhich is not always conducive to good health. ""We ourselves may occasionally retire to obtain fresh air, but they' are compelled to remain at their post.

I think that every honourable member will admit that when he picks up his proof in the morning, perhaps having made a difficult speech the previous day, he is astonished at the finish that has been given to his remarks by the official reporters. For that we owe a great debt to them. I think that I can say, without any fear of contradiction, that it would be impossible to get a better staff in Australia. Its members are capable, and I hope that they may be long spared to this Parliament. The officials and attendants of the House are a fine body of men. I do not know who was responsible for their selection, whether it was yourself, Mr Speaker, or previous Speakers, but there is no doubt that they are ideal men for the positions they occupy. They carry out their duties in a satisfactory manner, being absolutely impartial in their treatment of honourable members. On behalf of this side of the House, I wish to say that I appreciate very much the kindness and consideration shown to us by yourself, Mr Speaker, by the officials of the Hansard staff, and by all those connected with the House. As the Prime Minister stated, some of Parliament. That is an obvious truth. I think that the next parliament will show a greater change of personnel than any other since the inception of federation.

Both the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr cies and disparities due, if not to the Charlton) have congratulated you, sir, on the manner in which you have carried out your duties as Speaker; but I think that oh an occasion like this something more than mere congratulation should be offered for the impartial manner in which the functions of your high and honourable office have been discharged.

Despite' our political differences, sir, Ave have been old associates and opponents in many a contest in the past. For a longperiod you have occupied your position as the presiding genius of this chamber, AvhileI have remained in the fighting forces. Therefore, I say to you, paraphrasing some lines from Byron's Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice:"" O my friend! Stir not forth, whatever the signs of strife.

Downs-Attorney-General) [11.32] -The leaders of the Government and the Opposition have adequately expressed the appreciation! of honourable members 'of the services that have been rendered by Mr Speaker and the officers of the House, but may I be permitted, as a colleague from Queensland of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford), to express my sincere regret that he is relinquishing his seat in this House and leaving publio life. Those who have worked with him. have found him most conscientious in the performance of his duties, and whole-hearted in his belief in the potentialites of his State, he can find no reasonable excuse for Wilwith, at the same time, a wide outlook on Australian affairs generally. The people of Queensland will sincerely regret that he has decided to retire from publio life, but he will carry with him their very best wishes for a peaceful retirement, and a life full of happiness to the end of his days. On the IStli September the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( MrH . G. Nelson) 'and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) brought under notice the case of a settler at Daly River, Northern Territory,named James Wilkinson, who was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for breaking and entering the Government Store at that place and stealing a bag of flour. It was suggested by the honourable members referred to that the punishment meted out to that settler was exceptionally harsh and should be mitigated. A report has now been obtained from the Administrator of tlie Northern Territory,"" which states that seventeen days before the ofSo fence was committed Protector O'Sullivan, of Daly River, supplied Wilkinson with 50 lb. of flour, 3 lb. of tea, and 10 lb. of sugar, and that at the time of the offence Wilkinson had on hand ample supplies of sweet potatoes, maize, pumpkins, water melons, cow peas, a. quantity of tea and sugar, and also had fowls, pigs, goats, and cows in milk. The report goes on to say that Wilkinson, with rifle in hand, demanded flour from the Protector, but was refused, as he was not entitled to ifc until the end of the month™ He then used violent .language and threatened to break into the store. The Protector warned him. and retired. Wilkinson then broke open the locked door of the store and took away a bag of flour. In summing up all the facts the Judge stated that the circumstances looked like a deliberate hold-up with a rifle, and that he regarded the case as very serious, having regard to fhe effect of the example on numerous aboriginals in the neighbourhood. He considered that the matter might have been much worse but for the commendable forbearance of the Protector. A previous conviction against Wilkinson ten years ago iii New South Wales for perjury was adduced iu evidence. The Administrator states that, having read all the evidence, kinson's action. Despite the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) this Government is not ashamed of the record it will place before the people of Australia. I can speak from a long experience, and I claim that the present Government, and the Parliament which is now coming to a close, have as useful a record of legislation as has. been placed on . the statute-book by any other Australian Parliament. We have worked quietly and definitely, with a distinct object in view. for instance? improved the Commotnwealth Bank and put it on a stronger footing than ever. Despite the allegations made, there is a very clear issue, on which we are not afraid to go to the country.

213,Sir Littleton Groom,"We havefectly clear. YetI believe that i u their hearts honourable members on either side 1 would not be sorry to see the new House constituted exactly as this is to-day. -iM y conscience, which is the only master I know, impels me to speak. As honourable members may recall, at your election to the position which you, Mr Speaker, have filled so splendidly, mine was the one discordant voice raised in this chamber. Some honourable members said that because my conscience impelled me to say what I did I would "" get it in the neck."" But I replied, "" No, the man who once gave me a pledge before ever there was a Federal Parliament and kept it. religiously will act as justly to me as to of health for the future, Of the memany other honourable member."" glad to testify that you have acted towards me, not only impartially, but also justly and generously, and for this I thank you heartily.

NowI come to one of the"" most beloved ford. To me he epitomises what a French poet has put in the fewest of wordsL'ami He c'est V amour sans ailes. Friendship is love without its wings. may have broken the link in the chain of comradeship, but his friendship has always remained. honourable member who has not a kindly word and a kindly thought for him whom we know as "" dear Freddy Bamford."" I recall to the memory of the Prime Minister the fact that a deputation consisting of Mr Bamford, Mr Chanter, Mr Mathews, Senator de Largie, and myself was once sent by your predecessor, and later by yourself to an officer who seems to be a jumpingjack, always coming out from England at eleotion time. I refer to Mr Percy Hunter. For mendacity I have never met his equal in public l if e , and I ask the Prime Minister to look into this matter, because in all my political career I have never seen a deputation so treated by a publio servant as this one was treated. I suppose Mr Hunter will be hopping back to England soon again, unless his tenure of office is terminated, which it will be if the people of Australia take a certain action within the next few months. As for the officers at the table, I have a special regard for at least one of them. He does not look formidable, but if honourable members had seen him bundle me out of the House on one occasion they would have thought he was a Samsoni n disguise. However, he did it in such a gentlemanly way that the incident did not in any way interfere w it h our friendly relations. For Mr Gale, who was the Agamemnon of our parliamentary party in SouthA f r i c a , I have the most kindly regard. We all deeply regretted that, for reasons of ill-health, he had to leave the party in SouthA f r i c a and return to Australia, and I am sure that we all hope that he w ill enjoy the best I am bers of the Hansard staff, who so often make our speeches better than they really are, I can only say that they are entitled to our highest esteem. I place great value upon stenography, and I suggest that this art be included in the curriculum of our schools, so as to reduce the drudgery attached to the learning of other subjects. A few days ago I asked the Minister representing the Ministerf o r Markets and Migration ( Mr Atkinson) a question appertaining to bread. I hope he will be good enough to furnis h a reply He through the columns of the press, so that the people of Australia may find out how they are being robbed at the present I do' not know any time. I also directed the attention of the M in ister for Health( Sir Neville Howse) to a question which cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as a party matter. I hope, also that he w ill supply an answer as soon as possible through the press. As a distinguished member of the medical profession he w ill , I am sure, recognize the importance of the issue which I have raised. We come now to the parting of the ways. I have fought many elections, and I enter the forthcoming contest wjith every confidence.

215,"Men I N This House, My Friend Mr Bam","as the schoolhouse of Europe, as well as by the greatest of English statesmen, including Gladstone, representing the pinnacle of Liberal thought, and Lord Salisbury, the recognized leader of the Conservative forces of his day. If Parliament adopts this lawI refer, of course, to the referendum, initiative and recall-it will be possible for the people to dominate Parliament and administer a corrective even to a powerful Ministry like the present, if it commits a wrong. I have in mind the appointment of certain men to a board that is at present conducting an inquiry in New South Wales. Each member of that tribunal is drawing a salary of over £9,000 a year, or, if we eliminate Sundays from the calculation, over £8,000 a year. No other person holding an official position in the Commonwealth, excepting tlie Governor General, is in receipt of a salary surpassing that amount. The people have to find this money. If they had the right of recall, no Government would dare to enter into such.an extravagant arrangement. This expenditure was also unnecessary. The established courts of the country were strong enough to deal with the offenders. I have no time for Walsh and Johannsen-o r Johnson, as he is called-wh o have referred to men belonging to my party as thieves and parasites, but I protest against the course adopied by this Government to deal with them. If I know anything of opinion in the Mother Country, I believe that if Walsh back to England, the British Government will intimate in no unmistakable termsthat, .since Walsh has been a citizen of the Commonwealth for 30 years, it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to deal with him in this country, or, if the Government is not iii a position to rule, its members should make room for others who will. Becent events recall a meeting of citizens of Melbourne, held very many years ago in the shadow of the walls of the Melbourne gaol, to protest against the landing of convicts in Australia. On that occasion a resolution was agreed to that if any more convicts were landed in Melbourne the citizens would hang the captain and all the officers of the ship that brought them here. As the result of that protest, a number of convicts waiting to be landed were sent back. shall not delay the House for more than a few minutes. I wish to take this opportunity to direct attention to the unscrupulous tactics of the Melbourne Age in its comments upon proceedings iu this Parliament. In an editorial yesterday it made certain comments upon honourable members of this chamber. I take strong exception to its references to me, and had it not beeu that we are on the eve of dissolution, I would have taken certain action to bring the Age to its bearings. After referring to other honourable members of my party in a most disparaging manner, the Age statedMr Mahony sang in a voice that harrowed his very soul-san g a song which said, ""Though"" Bruce protest, and diggers sneer, we'll keep tlie red flag flying here."" You, Mr Speaker, and other honourable members, know that there is not a particle of truth in that statement. The article is written in amost crafty manner. It is not directly stated, but it is cunningly insinuated, that I sang that song in this chamber. It is a low-down, scoundrelly, and filthy type of journalism that can descend to such depths as that, and its representatives should not be permitted in this chamber. The only way to deal with them is to exclude them. I hope that every decent-minded man and woman throughout Victoria will drop the Age. I warn that journal that the Labour movement is a very powerful organizaan attempt is made to send tion. If the Age persists in its lying, dirty, and filthy tactics, the Labour movement will put into operation some of its machinery to deal with it. Members of the various unions will consider seriously whether they will print that kind of filth in the future. I do not mind receiving hard knocks in politics; I give them, and am prepared to take them. Honourable members can hit me as hard as they like politically, and they will never hear me squeak, but when a newspaper prints filthy, lying insinuations such as I have mentioned, it is time for a vigorous protest to be made.

216,Mr Mahony (Dalley) [11.48],"IAs the only Queensland member of tbe Labour party in tbe chamber, I desire to 3ay a few words regarding the departure from active political life of the honford). Before entering this Parliament it was not my pleasure to know the honourable member very well personally, but since coming here I have had opportunities of meeting him and of knowing his sterling qualities. speaking for the honourable member for Queensland members, when I say that we all deeply regret that Mr Bamford has decided to retire from politics. The honourable members for Kennedy and Herbert for many years were associated as members of the same party. I feel sure that it is because of his personal popularity that Mr Bamford has beeu able to win the Herbert seat 30. many times as a member of different parties. Many of his old friends who knew liim in his early political days still vote for him, but I feel sure that at the forthcoming election their support will be given to the Labour candidate, and that' in tihe next Parliament the Herbert constituency will be represented by the Hon. E. G. Theodore. The honourable member for Herbert is one of those men who evidently has gone through life endeavouring to act kindly towards every one. Probably he has had in his mind the wordsI expect to pass through this world but once. Any good, therefore, that I can do, or anj' kindness that I can show to any fellowcreature, let me do it now. Let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way sigain. I feel free to say these things, because Mr Bamford will not be contesting the next election. A politician is most highly esteemed after he has left the political stage or is dead. While he is in the political arena very few of his political oppouents will admit that he has any virtues. The Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom) in the course of his remarks, said that, as a Queeuslander, he felt absolutely confident that the appeal to the country would result in a win for the Government. I , as a Queenslander also, feel certain that the Government will not be allowed to select the issue upon which it will appeal to the people. There are many issues which the Labour party will place before the electors for their decision. These hysterical efforts on the part of the Government and its supporters to build up this great communistic bogy, and to give publicity to communistic doctrines, will not find favour with the people of Queensland or of the other States. able member not keep his electioneering speeches for the Capricornia electorate? at the interjection of the honourable member, because he entered this Parliament, as did the Treasurer, stating that M3 only reason for doing so was to bring about the creation of new States. able member himself say at Armidale? States has now vanished, as far as the Country party is concerned. The Leader of the Country pai'ty after the election found himself occupying the position of Deputy Leader of the Government; in fact, he was Acting Prime Minister for several months. But although he had the power to do so, he did absolutely nothing to bring about the creation of new States. He could have submitted the question to a referendum of the people of Australia. I have absolutely no fear as to the result of this appeal to the people. I feel certain that the electors of Queensland will endorse the policy of the Labour party. They will judge honourable members opposite by the maladministration of the present Government during the last three years; it has been a disgrace to the federal legislature. There are many big questions on which tlie election will be decided. We shall not allow the pitch to be queered. The Labour party has right on its side, and it will win.

One of the first things that I did after Parliament assembled was to place on the business paper a motion dealing with this matter. Subsequently, I moved that motion, and in connection with it the honourable member for Oapricornia also spoke. Unfortunately, a vote was not' taken on it. This session also a similar motion was placed on the business-paper in my name, but together with many others, it failed to reach finality. It ill-becomes the honourable member to throw this gibe at me, considering that he also for a number of years has played a prominent paTt in the new States movement in Central Queensland, and has given the people there to understand that he will take every step possible to obtain a decision on this important question. honourable member has attended various new States functions, not only in Queensland, but also in New South ""Wales, and has informed the people of Eockhampton that whenever this question comes up he will be oue of its most stalwart champions. a supporter of a Government which has done nothing in this connection. question has not been brought to a head. the honourable member supports has failed, he should give the Labour party an opportunity to bring about his desire. bers opposite profess to believe in unificaare not taken to notify the people tion, but what have they done during the life of this Parliament to bring it about? movement, is mentioned, the honourable member for Capricornia and other honourable members opposite say that they have a better solution of the problem, find suggest unification as a means of attaining the same end. this Parliament not one word has been said about unification. member for Capricornia, who has sought the limelight on this question, now has the audacity to gibe at me, although I have honestly attempted to bring this It is a fact that one of the question before the people of Australia. Honourable members generally will bear me out when I say that not one honourable member has during the life of this Parliament attempted to bring the question of unification before the House. The honourable member has made several speeches concerning the attitude he has adopted, and his action this morning displays exceedingly bad taste. During the campaign I am prepared to justify my attitude before the people of northern New South Wales, but I am sure the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) will not be willing to appear before the electors at Eockhampton and repeat to them the statements that he has made on many occasions in the past. I wish to refer briefly to the subject of compulsory voting. A private bill under which voting for Federal elections is now compulsory was rushed through both Houses of the Parliament last sesThe sion at such a rate that many honourable members did not have an opportunity to discuss it. After it had passed, a number of honourable members on both sides of the chamber were somewhat dubious as to whether it was wise to pass such a measure. It has been stated that in consequence of its passage an 85 per cent, poll may be expected at the forthcoming election. I spent a good deal of time in the outlying portion of my electorate last week aud in conversation with electors-and I spoke to many-no t only in the towns, but also iu the outlying districts, I discovered that not a single person was aware that compulsory voting would be enforced at the forthcoming election. If drastic steps of the fact that voting is compulsory and that those who do not vote will Whenever the now States be fined, it will be found that the poll will be from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, lower than some anticipate. Honourable members on both sides of the House will agree that although it is rather late to move in the matter it would be wise to Yet during incur .some expenditure, in order to inform electors that all those who are The honourable able will be expected to vote on 14th November.

I shall now read the following letter I have received from the Commissioner of PensionsThe Sydney, recently forwarded to me a report of the deputation from the Association for the Advancement of the Blind, introduced by you, which waited upon him on 23rd June last in connection with tbe invalid pension claim of the above-named. On receipt of the papers I directed the Deputy Commissioner to make certain inquiries, and his report has now come to hand. 2. This claim has been considered by me on several occasions. Claimant is engaged in the sale of tobacco and cigarettes in the street and when his claim was previously under consideration he was informed that if he relinquished his street occupation the question of granting him a pension would be considered. He refused to do so and the recent inquiries referred to show that he is still engaged iu street employment and apparently has no intention of relinquishing it . 3. For many years it has been the policy of the Pensions administration in dealing with invalid pension claims from blind persons to discourage tbe claimants from engaging in street employment, and pensions have not been granted to persons who continue to follow such occupations. As Mr Scott is not pre? ared to discontinue his present occupation, regret to say that it is not possible for me to authorize the payment of an invalid pension. As a large number of those engaged in selling matches and cigarettes are young, able-bodied persons they cannot be expected to maintain themselves on the miserable pension pittance of 20s. per week. that merely because they are endeavouring to earn a living they should be denied the invalid pension. These persons are not regarded as mendicants, and I therefore take this opportunity of asking the Prime Minister to confer with the Commissioner of Pensions to see if the present unsatisfactory position cannot be remedied. could instruct the Commissioner in the matter. missioner of Pensions informed me that Parliament was supreme. In submitting this matter I am fulfilling a promise given to the Blind Association of New South Wales, and I ask honourable members if they would oppose the blind sellers of tobacco, cigarettes and matches receiving the invalid pension. I appeal to the Prime Minister to ask the Commissioner of Pensions why these deserving people are being so ungenerously and unkindly treated. this is the last occasion on which I shall Deputy Commissioner of Pensions, be able to address the House, perhaps I may be pardoned for occupying the time of honourable members for a few moments. I thank the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and others who have spoken so kindly concerning myself. It is perhaps just as well that I am withdrawing from public life, because it would be difficult for me to live up to the good reputation given me. It has beeu my intention for some time to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) a suggestion made some time ago by Mr David Lindsay, the explorer, before the Public Works Committee in Sydney. Mr Lindsay told the committee that about 160 or 170 miles from the terminus of the railway at Dajarra, across the Queensland border there is a large tract of fine country well grassed, watered and timbered. Fully believing that the Prime Minister will be in a position to give effect to my wishes later, I suggest that he arrange for a survey of that country to be made. If the land is of the quality indicated. by Mr Lindsay perhaps it could be offered to some organization, such as the Salvation Army, on a long lease, on the condition that it was settled. It is unreasonable to suggest They oould make a settlement for. themselves there. A large area could be given to them in fee simple, and another area",69,Voting Blin D Officers For The Whole Hearted Assistance

I do not hide frqin myself, aud I do not wish to hide from honourable members, the fact that I came to the chair indifferently equipped. for the discharge of the duties of that important office; but I was controlled hy a strong desire to preside impartially without distinction of person or party. That honourable members on both sides of fhe House appear to consider that I have not failed in that, is to me a very natural and genuine source of pleasure. There 16 another thing that I ought not to hide, and, on the present occasion, I wish to be quite-frank about it . To a man of my political habits-and , I may perhaps add, temperament-ih e task which the choice of this House cast upon me was not easy, and it was made possible only by the hearty goodwill and cheerful co-operation of honourable members. That made it not only possible, but also agreeable, and for that I render my warm acknowledgments to honourable members, irrespective of party. I thank the right honourable the Prime The House will have to find another Minister and the Leader of t/he Opposi"" father,"" but w ill never have a better nor tion for their referenoes to the officers of parliament. I am personally under a deep debt to the Clerk( Mr Gale) and his colleagues' at the table; to the chief of the Hansard staff ( Mr. The Mormons, for example, Robinson), und his very efficient staff; and to all the officers and attendants, both inside and outside the chamber. My experience of nearly three years in the chair has convinced me that the House is singularly fortunate in its officers. They are men of wide experience, ripe judgment, and unfailing courtesy, and they have made this quaint old parliamentary machine move very smoothly for us. I acknowledge my obligation to the officers of the House. The Prime Minister has referred to the attachments that have been made between us, and as this is my last speech before my retirement from the ohair, I may be ' permitted to say a word or two on that subject. Last night H is Excellency the Governor General struck a similar note. Honourable members are keen electoral fight. Whoever is sent to the new Parliament by the constituencies, or whoever falls by the way-and my experience teaches me that some may f a l l , and some mustI hope we shall all cherish those personal friendships that have grown up amongst us, despite the adverse conditions of contest and antagonism in which we seem obliged to spend our legislative lives. I have had nearly 30 yeears of political life, and to me the most gratifying feature of it is the fact that these attachments can arise and. flourish in such unfavorable conditions. Let me take, as ono example, the references by honourable members on both sides of the chamber to the services, character, and career of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr. Bamford) . I have known h i m since he came from the northern State to the Federal Parliament at the inauguration of federation, and I have been drawn into closer association with h i m during the last three years. To know h i m in t imately is not merely to admire him, but also to love him. He is like most of the Queenslanders who have passed through the early pioneering stage.
