Thursday, 12 February 2004 ----Aviation: Second Sydney Airport been speaking out against the ALP’s proposal to locate a second Sydney airport at Wiltonwhich is to the immediate west of my electorate-since 11 August last year when it reared its ugly head at a Young Labor state conference. I said then as I say now that all Wollongong suburbs would be adversely affected by a major airport at Wilton. My home town of Bulli would be approximately two minutes landing time from such a facility, with aircraft landing and taking off coming in low over the city and its northern suburbs. The geography of the coast and escarpment would magnify the noise. There has been talk of Wilton being a 24hour, seven-day-a-week facility. The Wilton proposal was basically discarded in the mid 80s, largely on environmental grounds, though the people of Wilton still have the spectre hanging over them as no final decision has been made on the second Sydney airport. Wilton is in the Sydney air drainage basin and a major airport would worsen the poor air quality which already impacts on Bulli residents. Plans for large scale residential subdivisions in the area are in train and possible impacts on expanded coal mining operations are a factor. The idea that a major airport would be sited on an underground coal mine is laughable. Wilton is close to major Sydney, Wollongong and Southern Highlands water catchments, which could well be adversely affected if a major airport were established in the vicinity. By 24 January this year senior Labor figures were saying that Wilton was the only realistic option for a second Sydney airport after the previous opposition leader’s surprise decision to dump Badgery’s Creek. At that stage, I urged residents of my electorate to tell the ALP that they do not want an international airport at Wilton. They did this but their efforts were in vain. On 31 January, Labor’s national conference sold out the people of Wollongong, the Illawarra and the Southern Highlands. The opposition leader did a back-flip on his stated belief that environment, air and water quality concerns raised serious doubts about the Wilton site. To add insult to injury, the member for Grayndler told us that the conference decision would result in a site that ‘makes things better for Sydney’ and that local residents’ concerns must be measured against the national interest. Last SundayI attended a meeting of more than 100 Southern Highlands and Illawarra residents at Moss Vale, in company with my parliamentary colleagues the members for Gilmore and Hume. No ALP representative bothered to attend. That meeting unanimously supported my motion rejecting the ALP conference decision on potential sites for Sydney’s second airport and calling for its immediate recision. The impact of the decision is very real. Southern Highland residents are already being told their property values have dropped because of Labour’s ill thought out idea. It will not be long until Illawarra residents start being given the same message. Exporting Sydney’s airport noise problems to Wollongong and the Southern Highlands in the vain hope of protecting the ALP’s inner city seats is just another example of the contempt MAIN COMMITTEE",115,Notices

An airport anywhere in the WiltonBerrima corridor is simply not an option. If the ALP had any sense, they would drop the idea right away. Family and Community Affairs Committee team, the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, for their report, Every picture tells a story. The whole report is something that is long overdue. My concern at this stage is what happens to the report and how far will we go to implement some of the fine recommendations? I have two major areas of concern. One is this issue of denial of contact and the fact that there is no nexus at this stage between a ruling by the Family Law Court regards access to children and the requirement to pay non-parenting payments. So often in my electorate I am confronted with stories from men who have a right at law to have access to their childrenperhaps once a month; perhaps once a fortnight. They also have a commitment at law to pay the custodial parent to look after their child. As there is no nexus between the two at this stage, we sometimes see a malicious use of power by the custodial parent, denying opportunity for the non-custodial parent to access the child. It is inhuman. The frustration it causes often pushes men to the brink of suicide. It is not acceptable that we as a government allow such situations to occur. All it needs is for us to put in place at law a direct nexus between access to children as permitted by the law and the payment of non-custodial payments. If we were to put in place legislation that created such a nexus so that, if access were denied for some unreasonable motive, payments would also be denied immediately. It may shake up the system in the short term but it would teach all partners involved in the negotiations that they had to honour their commitments. The second thing that is primarily required in any shake-up of custodial laws and the operation of the CSA is an arbiter who can sort out the most obnoxious conflicts between parents over access to children, financial support of children et cetera. I urge all involved in the contemplation of legislation in this regard to seriously consider those two aspects: create a nexus between access to children and the payment of non-parenting payments and make sure that there is an arbiter to sort out the most anomalous of these relationships so that people stop being hurt. Australia Day Awards capture the spirit of Australia. Without them, many of the things that we take for granted about the Australian lifestyle would not be possible.

153,Mr Swan (Lilley) (9.46 A.m.),"In Australia we have a lot to be proud of. Our volunteersask for any acknowledgement or reward other than the sheer pleasure of helping and giving their time for others. To them. I say, ‘Please accept this award because, in giving this award, we honour all those who have worked with you.’ One award winner was Arthur Rosbrook, an accomplished and published local poet whose royalties are donated to charity and who brightens the day of the sick and the elderly at Yallambee Lodge, Aspley Respite Care Centre, Ashworth House, Syme’s Grove, Jacaranda Village and Blue Care. In typical fashion, Arthur has penned a few lines of verse which capture the spirit of volunteering in his poem The Joy of Love. I would like to share with the House a stanza from that work. It reads: I’m but one of a multitude, who walk this journey too, All with self-same attitude-doing what we’re called to do. God has given strength to each, sufficient for the day, So we may all with love outreach as He directs our way. These 52 volunteers provide leadership to our community. They make our community stronger and they make it a better community. By their personal example lives the common sense idea that we all have responsibilities to each other, not just to ourselves. Our common interests are just as important as our self-interest. My congratulations go to all the awardees as well as those who were awarded official honours. You have given our community a special gift but you are doing something more: you are making Australia a far better country. Some of those who received awards were Keith Aylward, Joanne Barclay, Kathleen Batibasaga, Joan Bell, Maureen Brown, Denis Cleary, Francis Conroy, Boyd Dunstan, Judith Foot, Brian French, Norman Gilbert, Jenny Hallgath, Denise Herbert, Michael Hopgood, George Hurlstone, Margaret Hurlstone, Pauline Hutchison, Sybil Jennings, Patricia Johnson, Hazel Kerwin, Dulcie King, Ernest Ladlay, Joan McKean, Leslie McKenzie, Athol McLennan, Maureen McKnight, Janella Maginley, Clive Margetts, Claire Merritt, Malcolm Milliken, James Moloney, William O’Brien, Joan Peters, Br Chris Pritchard, Bernard Quinn, Robert Rockett, Dr Peter Rossberg, Arthur Rossbrook, Sr Maureen Skippington, Colin Smith, Sandra Spadotto, Paul Thompson, Howard Hoa Tran, Shirley Treacy, Suzan Tremain, Peter Vanden Berg, Errol Watkins, James Webber, Norman Weston, James Whalan, David White and Joan Woods.

(Time expired) Fisher Electorate: Australia Day stration) (9.49 a.m.)-Australia Day is an opportunity we all have around the country to celebrate what brings us together, where we have come since the first settlement, what we have achieved as a nation and also to reflect on how fortunate we are as a country. Around the Sunshine Coast many communities celebrate Australia Day in their own way. I was particularly pleased to be able to welcome His Excellency the Governor General, Major General Michael Jeffery, who chose the city of Caloundra as the place to be for Australia Day 2004. The celebrations in Caloundra were fantastic, as were the other six community celebration functions I attended on Australia Day around the electorate of Fisher. At Palmwood, I conducted a citizenship ceremony in front of a community full of spirit. Seven local residents became full members of our Australian community. Throughout Fisher more than 200 Sunshine Coast residents became Australian citizens on Australia Day. The Buderim celebrations MAIN COMMITTEE",119,Statements By Members

Australia Day this year was also an opportunity for me to host the Fisher Community Australia Day Awards, which I first established in 2000 to recognise the invaluable contributions of the many community volunteers without whom our communities could not operate. More than 300 people attended this year’s awards to pay tribute to people who volunteer their time and skills without any expectation of return or recognition. The 25 individual winners came from a wide variety of areas, including business, sport, surf lifesaving, medical science, teaching and the church and from volunteers working with children, people with disabilities and seniors. The winners were Chris Davis, Benjamin Day, Dr James Dick, Dr Jeff Tarr, Father Joe Duffy, Robert Hall, Sally Henderson, Chris Pelly, John Joseph, Terry Moonie, Max Percival, Benny Pike, Pastor Artie Shepherd, Cherie Brazier, Mike and Frances Burgess, Colin Cowlin, Frank Gower, Marlene and William Hankinson, Ruth and Gordon Jones, Jean McGrath, Ronald Shoemark and Philomena Woods. Two community organisations serving the community of the Sunshine Coast were also recognised, jointly winning the Des Scanlan Memorial Shield for community services. I established the Des Scanlan Memorial Shield in 2002, in memory of the Sunshine Coast stalwart who gave so much to the community through the Sunshine Coast Helicopter Rescue Service, to recognise groups doing valuable work in the community of the Fisher electorate. Lifeline Community Care Sunshine Coast and the Sunshine Coast Commonwealth Carer Respite Centre were the two organisations doing wonderful work in different ways which were recognised with the Des Scanlan Memorial Shield. The Lifeline organisation has a big community based event on Father’s Day called ‘Doing Dads Proud’. This attracts more than 10,000 people to celebrate the role of fathers in our community. The respite centre does wonderful work in assisting carers to look after family members or friends who may be frail or aged or have a disability or terminal condition and choose to be at home. I am very proud of these organisations and also of the citizens we recognised. (Time expired) Burke Electorate some of the changes to electoral boundaries in Victoria. As those in Victoria would know, the Electoral Commission changed some of the boundaries quite fundamentally. As the current member for BurkeI have been affected in that regard by the soon to be abolition of the electorate of Burke. That is a disappointment to me in many respects. I currently represent, and will represent until election day, all those constituents in my predominantly rural but partly urban electorate. I will miss representing those people and will miss the diverse group of constituents that I am lucky to have. There are changes, and unfortunately Robert O’Hara Burke somehow slipped off the radar in terms of being kept as a name for a federal electoral division. But John Grey Gorton managed to fill his place. He was probably a luckier bloke than Robert O’Hara Burke, who was two hours from being saved under a tree. I think John Grey Gorton survived at least two plane crashes, so I suppose Wills would have been safer had he been with John Grey Gorton rather than Robert O’Hara Burke. Nonetheless, I think it is disappointing that we will now have Gorton and Wills in Victoria; we will not have Burke and Wills any more.

I am happy not to be the future member for McMahon-I have to say that. Having read what Paul Hasluck said about McMahon, I cannot believe what was thought of him. But John Grey Gorton was an interesting character, and I am certainly happy to be a candidate in the next election for the seat of Gorton. Last SundayI had the great fortune of going to Sunshine, a great suburb of Melbourne, to celebrate Harmony Day at a match between Sunshine Heights Cricket Club and Coburg Cricket Club. Of course I wanted Sunshine Heights to win, but they were there to celebrate cricket, which is a great sport in this country, and also to celebrate the fact that there were representatives of 17 ethnicities playing cricket that day. I thought: ‘What a fantastic thing! What a fantastic place to represent!’ I look forward to more matches in the future. Barnes, Mrs Myrtle stituent of mine, Mrs Myrtle Barnes, a happy birthday. This is not just any birthday, because on Saturday, 14 February 2004 Myrtle will be celebrating her 105th birthday. It would be true to say that all people live unique lives, but Myrtle’s story is quite exceptional. She was born on 14 February 1899 near Bourke, New South Wales, where she lived all her life except for the last 10 years or so, since she has been a resident at the Lillian Brady Village Nursing Home in Cobar. Myrtle was sold into wedlock in 1913, at the age of 13, at Nyngan railway station to an Afghan cameleer named Morbeen Khan Perooz, who was about 15 years older that she was. A year later, at the age of 14, she gave birth to their first and only child, a son named Jumah Kahn Perooz. Morbeen took their son to the Afghan mosque at three days of age. Even then Myrtle displayed her strength of character and strong will when she subsequently took her son to the local church and had him christened Jumah Percy Perooz. Jumah went by the name of James for most of his life. Life was pretty tough in the outback Australian town of Bourke for a child bride of an Afghan cameleer in those days. We are talking of the year 1914 and onwards. Myrtle did, however, manage to make a home and bring up her son in those conditions, providing a remarkable education for their son Jumah, or James. Morbeen was a cameleer who had a strong belief in education. He ensured that their son read a lot, in order to receive an education. This strong belief in education paid dividends, with James Perooz becoming the first Bourke man to be certified as a pilot in the 1930s and the first Bourke man to be granted an amateur radio licence, which subsequently became the first amateur radio station in Bourke. James was the first Bourke resident to be called up for service at the outbreak of World War II, when he flew as a fighter pilot in No. 3 Squadron for the duration of the war. Myrtle and Morbeen built the first Afghan mosque in Bourke-one of the first in Australia-and, when the era of camel trains had passed, started an orchard and a sheep station. They also later ran a general store in Bourke, called Perooz Corner, for over 20 years. Myrtle’s husband, Morbeen, died in about 1964, after over 50 years of marriage. Around 1980, Myrtle married her second husband, a man she had known for some time, as he worked in and around their shop as well as driving delivery trucks. ‘Barnesy’, as he was known, was a MAIN COMMITTEE",121,Statements By Members

Myrtle, 105 on Saturday, may have lived what can be described as a hard life, but the years must have been good to her. According to the staff at the nursing home, Myrtle may be virtually deaf and blind but she is still totally conscious of her surroundings and aware of those who are with her. der 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded. Gerick, Ms Jane Frances Pearsall, Mr Thomas Gordon Harding, Mr Ernest William with the practice of the House, the clock will not be used in respect of references to these former members. It will be a matter for each member to judge the length of his or her contribution. all have very fond memories of and great affection for Jane Gerick. A gutsy and determined woman, she was a fine public representative in the House of Representatives. On behalf of the Labor PartyI convey my condolences to the Gerick family. For them, this is the greatest loss of all-the loss of a loved one, a fine daughter, a loving sister, someone who cared for her family in a very special way. We can do many things in this world but few things matter more than looking after your mum, and Jane Gerick looked after hers. To others, Jane was a loyal friend and companion. As one of my colleagues said to me shortly after Jane passed away on Christmas Day, she was the ultimate team player. For the people of Canning, Jane was a public servant in the finest sense of the term. She believed very much in public life and public duty. She dedicated large parts of her life to the service of her constituents, to the service of her electorate. I have always thought that the best life is one lived in the service of others. That is the way in which Jane lived her life-always wanting to help others, always answering invitations and attending functions around her constituency, always there when people needed her. She was the best kind of local member-someone who knew the seat inside out; they knew her and she knew the seat of Canning inside out. All of us-friends, colleagues and constituents in Canninghave much to be thankful for in the life of Jane Gerick. In this debate we pay our last respects, but we do so with lasting memories. Since Jane’s passing, I have spoken to many of her parliamentary colleagues and they have all said the same thing: she was a woman of politics. She loved political life-not just as a job but as a vocation. She was interested in the issues, fascinated by the personalities and very much absorbed by the power plays. For Jane it was never enough to practise politics, she lived it throughout her life-through her experience as a young girl in Wiluna and Geraldton in Western Australia, through her time as a teacher and then owner of the City Business College, and through her membership of the Armadale branch of the Australian Labor Party. Her mentor in the party, Bob Pearce, conveyed these words to me prior to Jane’s funeral on New Year’s Eve: MAIN COMMITTEE",122,Statements By Members

159,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (9.59 A.m.),"This is a very sad occasion for the parliament. WeJane didn’t just join things, she worked for them, she organized for them, and in time she became a leader. She wasn’t one of those who just turned up and expected an easy ride into Parliament. She worked long and hard for the party in the Armadale Branch and the Canning Electorate Council, and by 1997 had so established herself that, when the party was looking for a good local candidate to contest Canning, Jane was the natural choice. She still had to fight a spirited preselection battle. No-one gets a seat easily in the Labor Party-that is one of our traditions. Jane won that contest and then mounted an effective campaign against the sitting Liberal member. That is how Bob Pearce describes her contribution in the Armadale branch of our party in the Canning electorate as a first-time candidate. When I first met Jane, I was the shadow minister for education visiting schools in the Maddington district. She had a strong personal commitment to learning, particularly vocational education. She knew that the best thing we could do as parliamentarians-indeed, our greatest service to the nation-is to leave something better for the next generation, especially through the power of a good education. That is why Jane dedicated herself to the education committees of our caucus and the parliament. As a policymaker, she was an educationalist first and foremost. Jane loved being a member of the Australian parliament. She was well liked and well regarded, especially for her independent views within the Labor Party and her wicked sense of humour. The member for Port Adelaide tells me that he was always ribbing her for being a vegetarian, especially about her preferred breakfast menu-a finger bun and a diet Coke. Jane also broke into one of the last all-male bastions of the parliament: a walking group that included the member for Port Adelaide, the member for Watson, the member for Maribyrnong and the member for Franklin. It is just as well that Jane was a vegetarian, walking around Canberra with those political sharks! She needed to be on her toes. I am sure she learned a bit of machine politics and organisation skills as the walk embarked around the boroughs and streets of the national capital. Jane worked exceptionally hard for the Labor Party and our movement. She was a member of the WA branch’s peak committee, the Administrative Committee, and was a delegate to the state executive and the state and national conferences. She was not just there for the highprofile events; more likely, she was working with the rank and file, running campaigns, knocking on doors, organising functions and, in that time honoured Labor ritual, selling raffle tickets. Most of us in this place expected Jane to be a long-term member for Canning, such was her quality in the constituency and the parliament. But then the tide of public life turned against her, and her hard-won gains in the 1998 election were lost through an unfavourable redistribution, making Canning the most marginal seat in Australia. She took this setback in her stride. Jane did not seek the safest seat created in the redistribution but put all of her effort into holding Canning, to keep the faith with the party and the people who had entrusted her to be their member of parliament. Then came the greatest battle of all: in March 2001, she was diagnosed with acute leukaemia and spent several months in Royal Perth Hospital. Those colleagues who visited Jane will remember her hospital room overflowing with cards, gifts and what seemed like hundreds of teddy bears sent to her by family, friends, grateful constituents and parliamentary colleagues from all parties and all parts of Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE A lesser person at this stage might have given up on Canning. Indeed, one commentator said that Labor would lose the seat by a country mile. But Jane Gerick did not see it that way. From her hospital bed, she marshalled her troops and organised her campaign, finally emerging from hospital to hit the hustings as if nothing had happened. In a difficult election for Labor, Jane lost narrowly, by just a couple of hundred votes, in 2001-quite an amazing result in all the circumstances of that campaign and election. Even then, she did not give up. As a private citizen she went on working with the community groups she had been involved with as a parliamentarian, and then she regained preselection for Canning and started to organise another campaign. With this kind of determination, we all felt sure that we would be welcoming her back here to the House of Representatives in the near future, where she would continue her work. But it was not to be. I believe we can all learn something from Jane Gerick-from her commitment to public life, her public service and, very much, her bravery under pressure. She was an amazingly resilient and determined representative of the people and an amazingly resilient and determined person in all her qualities. Unfortunately, these days politics is not necessarily seen as the honoured profession it was perceived to be, say, 20 or 30 years ago. The level of public distrust and disengagement from politics is somewhat higher. But it does not have to be this way. The life of Jane Gerick and her service in this place reminds us of the things that are good and decent about public life, the things that are good and decent about politicians. As a woman of politics, Jane knew both victory and defeat. She knew both the moments of triumph and the moments of tragedy and despair. She fought all of the big fights, the political and the personal, but through it all she kept her convictions and she kept her courage-‘grace under pressure’, as Hemingway called it. For me and, I am sure, all the colleagues that is a pretty good way of remembering and describing Jane Gerick-grace under pressure always. But now she has left us, way too young. Hers was a life of achievement but also a life that would have achieved so much more for her constituents and for her country. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I offer my condolences to Mrs Gerick and to Jane’s family and friends. I trust and hope that this debate will give some comfort, particularly to Jane’s mum. May Jane now find for herself the care and contentment that she gave so many others. May she rest in peace. family, friends and colleagues of Jane Frances Gerick. I did not know her terribly well, but I had the privilege of working with her on a number of committees. She was a quiet and courteous lady and a fighter for her electorate. That is very true. Her death is a sadness that will be shared by many of us. Her vitality was infectious, particularly to me in the committees. Noone would have realised just how sick she was. To her family and friends: she was well respected on both sides of politics, and you have every reason to be very proud of her and of her many achievements throughout her term here in parliament. I will always remember Jane as a quiet achiever. May she rest in peace. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (10.09 a.m.)-Cancer touches so many people in our country and so many families have had to confront the pain and the sadness that this brings.

160,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (10.08 A.m.),"I would like to put my condolences forward for thedeveloping our cancer policy and discussing it with various cancer specialists in different parts of Australia. One of these people had decided to fax back to me the penultimate draft of our cancer policy with his changes marked on it. Unfortunately, this person got the fax number wrong. I have never told Kim Beazley this story because I was too afraid that I might have got the sack if the cancer policy had gone to the wrong fax number. As it turned out, the fax number that this person had used was that of Jane Gerick. Jane was very sick in Royal Perth Hospital at that time, and of course the attendant would not let me into her office without her approval. So Jane had to be rung up very early Perth time and had to get out of bed to give approval for me to get this lost fax off her fax machine. She was so thrilled that we were developing a plan to make sure that people with cancer got much better treatment in our hospitals right around this country. She was a great help to me from her enormously personal experience in showing how the policy could be an improvement for people who confronted this terrible illness. On another personal note, after Jane felt that she had recovered, my sister-in-law came down with exactly the same leukaemia. Jane was an enormous support to me at that time. I also remember campaigning with Jane in the lead-up to the last election. As Mark Latham said, she was completely unphased-she was going out there to do everything she possibly could to win the seat of Canning. She campaigned from her hospital bed but, when she came out of hospital, she had the side effects of her leukaemia. She had lost her hair and was wearing a wig-and we were in the local community together campaigning. Even though she was so thin and had been through so much, she was still prepared to do what she had to do to win that seat and to hold that seat for Labor. Jane Gerick will be remembered, as someone put it to me, as a very gentle and generous person. What a lovely way to be remembered! As someone said to me, Jane would never turn away from her electorate office someone who was in absolute dire need. Any pensioner who was really down on their luck or anyone who did not know where their next meal was coming from knew that they could go to Jane and they would never be turned away. That generosity of spirit is something that all of us will remember as summing up this lovely young woman. Also, as Mark said, she was a great advocate for education. That was something that we talked about a lot. She was very proud of the business that she had run, training people and helping people get back to work, particularly mature age people-people who had lost hope of ever finding their way in the world again. Once again, that sums up the sort of person that Jane was. She was someone who understood people’s struggles at a very personal level-and, of course, she had to confront the greatest struggle of all. Jane’s brother Alan said that Jane realised that parliament was the place where decisions came from. That is why she wanted to be here. She knew that she could make a difference for her local people here in this parliament. She was a person who was driven by great enthusiasm and commitment to making the lives of the people in her community so much better. I think that is the sort of person that all of us in this parliament would like to be. That extraordinary enthusiasm and energy have been lost as a result of Jane’s death. It was just extraordinary that after everything Jane had been through-after losing the election and the terrible disappointment that comes with that-she did not decide to give it away or to go off and do something else; she wanted to be back here and to again make that contribution for her community. We take our hats off to her because, after what she had been MAIN COMMITTEE through, it was extraordinary to see that fighting spirit come through to want to be the candidate for Canning again. All of us will remember that, when she was very sick in hospital, she was given a teddy bear by the caucus. I gather that it was quite a sight when big Kim was walking down the corridor of Royal Perth Hospital with this little teddy bear tucked under his arm. I think it summarises the sort of person that she was that we knew that that is what she would like to comfort her in a very difficult time. I do hope that the things that all of us are saying today will provide some comfort to her mother Mary and her brother Alan. We remember Jane as a very gentle and generous person. She did so much for so many people. That is what will remain in so many people’s hearts-of course none more so than her mother Mary’s and her brother Alan’s, and our heartfelt thoughts are with them today. Gerick. Jane was a very decent person and a very hard worker. As I have said, as much as Jane and I were opponents and competitors publicly, she was a very principled person. On occasions Jane and I campaigned in the same places at the same time. We had a very civil relationship, which I think is a tribute to her; it was her style. I first met Jane at a local radio station, the Heritage FM radio station, where she had quite an involvement. At that time. I was campaigning, and the first thing she did was to come up to me, stick her hand out in a very friendly manner and say, ‘I’m Jane Gerick.’ I had never met Jane before, but that was the sort of person she was. She was very friendly and forthcoming. During our campaigning we had several face-to-face debates, but they were always very civil and very decent. They were always on the issues; personalities were kept out. That is one thing I would like to mention in paying tribute to her here today. It is no secret that Jane had been very unwell. I admired her tenacity for fighting on throughout her sickness in the way that she did. That she would not allow something like the debilitating disease of leukaemia to stop her from getting out and doing what she thought was right and fighting for her party showed the strength of her person, and I commend her for that. With the opening of the Beddingfield extensions in Pinjarra, I had the opportunity to recognise and acknowledge Jane’s lobbying and hard work. I believe she had attracted over $738,000 in capital grants to the aged care facility while she was the member for Canning. As patron of the local FM radio station, which had shifted in the last few years, Jane did not give up her community work, as the member for Jagajaga said. She then became the chairman of the board of the FM radio station, which gave a lot back to the community because it is a community based radio station. Until her demise she worked very hard on behalf of that radio station. I had the honour of opening the Jane Gerick studio in that radio station recently. As Sharryn-the member for Hasluck-will know, it was a bit difficult because I knew far less about Jane than for example someone like Sharryn. It would probably have been more appropriate for Sharryn to have said the words on that day because she knew a lot more about Jane. But I was there because I am the patron of that radio station; it comes with the territory of being the member for Canning. Naming that studio after Jane was an honour and something important. I think it is a great reminder to the people in that region. MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Condolences
161,Mr Randall (Canning) (10.16 A.m.),"I would like to pay a respectful tribute to JaneFinally, when Jane was last out campaigning I expected a very tough fight, as you do in marginal seats. I knew it was going to be a very tough fight because Jane had started campaigning quite strongly. The last time. I saw Jane was at the Armadale High School graduation night. She came up and said hi in a very friendly way and we got along very well. I would like to pay a tribute to Jane for her decency, her honesty, her hard work and her bravery. I would like to leave that as my tribute in this House. Mary and brother Alan. They cherished her and she cherished them. Whatever loss any of us feel around here-and that loss is deeply felt by many of us-it is as nothing compared in particular to the loss they feel. They were a very close family and in such cases those relationships with brothers and mothers are always important: in her case, as she was a single lady, doubly so. They obviously are devastated by her death because-apart from anything elsethey, and we all, had hopes that the recovery had been complete. Clearly it was not. I also reflect on the fact that if the electoral commissioners had done the right thing at the last distribution and Halls Head had been left in my constituency, as it could have been, what we would have been conducting here today would have been a condolence motion for one of our number, instead of one for an ex-member and a candidate. She only just lost the last election, from memory by some 600 votes, and the area in south Mandurah that came out of my electorate and went into hers-which could easily have been left, on the numbers, in mineprovided the Liberals with a net total to their advantage of about 800 votes. So she would have been with us but for that shift. There are many memories of Jane but my memory of her is propped up in bed in Royal Perth Hospital receiving the caucus teddy and, I might say, a very nice card that was attached to it. She was in a room full of flowers and other stuffed animals and she had an utter determination that she would get back in the business again. She was there, driven to recover by the thought that she had a great task in life that would be fulfilled by her getting back on the job as a member of parliament. We members of the Labor Party in Western Australia were determined that she should have that opportunity, too. I was enormously grateful then as party leader by the way in which all my fellow colleagues-and I did my turn as well-in Western Australia were prepared to step in for the official engagements and in some cases the basic electoral work that would normally have been done by Jane, who was a most diligent local member. We did the work in that time while she was away so that in terms of political representation the seat of Canning would want for nothing. Jane had that sort of effect on you: you basically wanted to help her. The personality she had was an unusual personality for a politician: she was genuinely nice all round and lacked most of our manipulative characteristics. She thereby basically inspired in us a desire to assist her in whatever way we could. Looking back, you would have to say that, despite what seemed such a soft, kindly personality, she was an extraordinary risk-taker. She had been a teacher. She abandoned the security of a reasonably remunerated position in life to chance her arm at small business at the very young age of 25. She acquired an employment training operation, the title of which she changed to the City Business College. She was the owner of that college pretty well until she was elected to parliament, or maybe a bit afterwards. She believed that her experience with the City Business College was a terrific background for the political issues in which she had MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Condolences
162,Mr Beazley (Brand) (10.21 A.m.),"I express my deepest condolences to Jane’s motherto engage. She believed that as a small business person she had an intimate understanding of the likely impact of the goods and services tax on the operations of an agency such as hers. As a person who was entering an area to represent where unemployment issues were rife, her confidence that nobody was unemployable and that everybody with the right skills could find a place in the work force came from the business she had run. It informed the views that she expressed in her campaigning in her area. As someone who loved her mother, family and community, she had a great belief in community institutions. On the cultural side, she had a desire to establish where in Canning were genuine heritage areas and where they ought to be protected-the radio station was alluded to by the previous speaker-but she was also concerned about community services. The southern suburbs of Perth, like many outer metropolitan areas around the country, are quite bereft of the social infrastructure that they need to support the sorts of communities that are burgeoning there. She represented a fast-growth area, which is why the boundaries of her constituency changed so much. But, above all, Jane was a fighter. In my heart at the time. I wanted to give Jane the advice that I think I should have given her. The advice that I should have given her was that the superannuation arrangements that we have in place recognise that from time to time some of us are going to attract an illness that means that we cannot serve. Whether or not we have served the full period of qualification to access that package, we are entitled to approach the tribunal and leave the parliament. I had a feeling that I should have advised her that way-that that is what she should do. She was so sick-that is the truth of the matter. She was courageous in the way in which she stood up to it but she was very ill. I should have advised her as such but she would have not have heeded me. She was desperate to get back to the job and desperate to get back to the task of representation, and she was humble and courageous about it. In the same way as she chanced her arm in relation to small business at the age of 25, she chanced her arm in relation to her constituency. On the redistribution which created an extra seat in Western Australia, she had a claim over the seat of Hasluck. She never for one minute, even though it looked as though it had the makings of a very good Labor seat, contemplated that she would run for that constituency; she continued her run for the constituency called Canning. Canning was going to be a difficult prospect in any set of circumstances but she had that sense of obligation-that, even if the task were harder, she should not take an easy way out-and, I suppose, an attachment to the name of the constituency that set her down that course. All of us thought and assumed that she had fully recovered. That turned out not to be the case. Jane’s demise is a tragedy for all of us. It is a terrible tragedy for her mother and her brother, who were so proud of her and so proud of her achievements, and rightly so. It is also a tragedy for the constituents of the seat of Canning, who would have had at the next election a genuine choice and an opportunity to restore to representation a person who deeply loved them and had made them her family-not having, apart from her brother and mother, a direct family of her own. She very much regarded the constituents of Canning as her family. They had an opportunity to make a choice to return to that representation. That will be denied them now, and the parliament will be denied the opportunity to again see a great fighter for a local community in our ranks here in federal politics. MAIN COMMITTEE I know that every party member in Western Australia bears her affectionate memory, and I know that all of us from Western Australia who will speak here will do so with the strength of conviction of all those in the political party we represent. I say again: my deepest condolences go to Jane’s mother, Mary, and her brother, Alan. a friend and colleague who has passed away. Jane Gerick won her preselection on the same night that I won mine. She had to battle to win the endorsement, but Jane was a battler and a fighter. Jane and I also shared a similar background in that we spent our early years in small, remote goldmining towns. These places are the ideal environment to learn about the character of Australia and what it takes to become a fighter. Jane certainly learned that. She fought a hard but successful campaign in the 1998 election; and, in accord with Jane’s generous attitude to life, she gave credit for that win to her hard working campaign committee and friends who supported her. Jane was a successful businesswoman in her own right. She was also a successful, determined and caring member of parliament. In the lead-up to the 2001 election, she was forced to contest much of the campaign from her bed at Royal Perth Hospital. Jane may have been diagnosed with acute leukaemia, but she was determined to take the fight up to her opponentand she did. What many thought would be a clear victory for the Liberal Party turned into a narrow squeak home. Jane may have lost her seat, but she was prepared to go out and fight to win it back for her great love in life, the Labor Party. Knowing her tenacity, perhaps she would have. Fate, however, did not give her that chance, and we were all devastated to learn that, after being rediagnosed with acute adult-onset leukaemia, Jane passed away on Christmas Day. Jane left a great legacy of commitment to the Australian Labor Party and to her electorate. She was an example of how a person can come into the rough-and-tumble, cut-and-thrust of politics but leave it with a pleasant, caring and sweet nature-untouched and unsullied by the grubby side of our profession. Jane was a decent, caring person, who lived her life fuelled by Coca-Cola, Mars bars and a driving passion to make this a better life for those she represented. My condolences to her mum, her brother and other family members. In conclusion, I want to say that I know that Jane’s family was greatly comforted by the fact that our leader, Mark Latham, was able to get to Perth to speak, with great passion and great commitment, about Jane at her funeral, and I know that it was greatly appreciated by her other colleagues who were there on what was indeed a very sad day. place for someone who was a very dear friend. It is hard to put into words the thoughts that you have. I was at the McG on Boxing Day, on my annual trek over there to watch the test match, when I got a phone call from Rod Sawford. He said, ‘I’ve got some very bad news,’ and he told me of the passing of Jane. I first met Jane at an ALP national conference in Hobart, sometime in the nineties-I cannot remember exactly when it was-and I remember spending a lot of time down at the boardwalk drinking numerous cups of coffee and assisting her in the planning of strategies to join the elite group in this place of people like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, me and others who have won seats from the Liberals. Winning a marginal seat is a hard task-and it is even harder to retain one-but Jane was determined to win a seat for the Labor Party, an additional MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Condolences

164,Mr Quick (Franklin) (10.34 A.m.),"It is very sad to speak on a condolence motion in thisseat in WA, to enable us, and Kim Beazley, to get over the line and form a government. As a member of the independent group, I saw at first hand Jane’s determination. She was a fierce competitor. She was an absolutely beautiful lady, but inside was a dynamo that did not stop. She was determined, she was well organised and she was well planned. She had it all worked out. It was great to see her come here in 1998 to join the small band of us who were here in 1996. She was so proud of being a member of the House of Representatives; it was one of the highlights of her life. As I said, Jane was a member of our independent group. I got to know her really well as a personal friend. It was devastating when we discovered she had cancer. She had everything going for her. She had youth and determination. She had a tough marginal seat, but she knew what she wanted to do and she had the capacity to retain it. Then, out of left field, came the cancer. But her attitude to that was like it was to everything else in life: another struggle and another thing to overcome. She used to delight us here about her experiences with chemo. I have seen friends of mine go through it, and God forbid that I should ever have to go through it. She used to tell a wonderful story that when they trotted in with the chemo she would whack her arm out and say: ‘Give it to me. It’ll keep me alive.’ When she lost her hair and wore a wig she would joke about that. That was great. We got to the stage where we could not tell whether it was a wig or her hair. Our little walking group of Jane; Leo McLeay, the honourable member for Watson; Rod Sawford, the member for Port Adelaide; Bob Sercombe, the member for Maribyrnong; and me used to wander up and down the red path. We used those walks as an opportunity to talk about issues and strategies, and to develop friendships. It was a great walking group.We admired Jane’s tenacity. When the issue of redistribution came up, as the member for Brand said, she had the choice of going to Hasluck or sticking with Canning. Typical Jane, she said: ‘No, Canning’s my seat. I’m going to retain it.’ She knew it was hard-and she did not make it-but she was determined to come back here. She was an absolutely beautiful lady. Her attitude to life was something all of us admired. I could not get across to her funeral, but I thought, ‘What could I do to remember Jane, apart from scan through my memory bank about all the wonderful experiences I have had with her?’ I have a native garden at my place, so I went down to the local nursery and got a lovely Western Australian native. With the three inches of rain we had last week, and with the heat, the new shoots are there. So every time. I get back home from this place, I wander down and look at the WA native in my native garden and think of Jane and her impact on me and our little group in parliament, on the party in general and on the people of Canning. I say to her mum and her brother: we will never forget her. I offer my condolences to her family and friends in WA. a good friend, Jane Gerick. When I was Chief Opposition WhipI had the opportunity to get to know Jane very well. As a new member in 1998 she quickly made herself known to my office, to me and my staff, and she would often call in to talk about this issue or that issue. Jane was very keen to learn the role of a member of parliament and would always come in and talk about how she could do some extra little thing for her constituents. She would often come and say how she would really like to ask for leave to go back to some function in the electorate but she knew she probably should not. You got the impression that one day you would like to MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Condolences
165,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson) (10.39 A.m.),"I would like to join in the condolence today to say, ‘Of course you can.’ But she would always let you know that she wanted to go and do it but she knew that the rules were that we had a role here as well. She also used to take advantage of that great time difference between Western Australia and Canberra. She would get on the phone, ringing people after dinner. If you lived in Sydney or elsewhere on the eastern seaboard and you rang someone up after dinner they might abuse you, but she would be ringing them up and it would be only five o’clock on daylight saving days. She used to get back to her electorate in that way while she was still here in parliament. As has been mentioned earlier, Jane used to go walking with a group of us. I remember that Rod Sawford, the member for Port Adelaide, and I would often slacken off a bit and, when we would be less enthusiastic, Jane would always appear in the office not quite harassing you but in a gentle, friendly, non-aggressive way telling you she was there to make you go out and walk. She would tell Rod and me that we were not really overweight but that we could do with a bit of exercise. When you would go out walking with her, often you would vent your frustrations about the day with someone while walking around. Usually it would be Sawford venting his frustrations with me or vice versa, and Jane would be telling us that we should be kind to each other. She was a very decent, restful person. You could not get angry with Jane Gerick and I think she lowered the temperature on a lot of occasions in places where she was. I remember her love of chocolate, Coca-Cola, teddy bears and the colour pink, and her loyalty to her friends, family and colleagues. She was a lovely quiet achiever. She was content to do her job as a member of parliament and in her understated way was always very conscious of her constituents and the honour that she had in representing them. It is rather ironic and is quite appropriate that we are paying tribute to Jane today here in the Main Committee, because one of the jobs that the member for Port Adelaide and I roped her into was to be a whip here when I was chief whip and the member for Port Adelaide was one of the whips. She showed her ability here. Some of the people that you would have come up here to do the whip’s job would get here late or they would not ring you up and tell you when something funny was occurring. In the early days of the Main Committee, it was often quite a problem for the whips’ offices to coordinate the functions of the place. But Jane was always willing to take her turn and she was always willing to make sure that she kept the whip’s office downstairs apprised of what was happening. She was always very active in the role of the Main Committee. SoI could not think of a more appropriate place for us to be remembering Jane Gerick than here. I was very pleased, as were all her friends, when Jane seemed to win her first bout against cancer and she was back on the road to good health, it would appear. But unfortunately that insidious disease sometimes comes back and catches up with you. Shortly before her death Jane was very happy that she had again obtained preselection for the seat of Canning. As my colleague said, she had a battle to get it the first time and she thought that she was going to have a battle to get it the second time. That caused her a little bit of concern but she was successfully preselected and she was looking forward to the fight, and we were looking forward to having Jane back here with us. But that was not to be, and that is a terribly sad thing. It is a sad thing when you speak in a condolence debate about someone you have served with who is older than you-or, at the age I am getting to, probably your own age-but when MAIN COMMITTEE you have to recall the life of someone who was a lot younger than you and who had a lot to live for it is an even sadder thing. We will all be a little poorer for Jane not being with us. I was very sorry that I was unable to go to her funeral because of the fact that she died so suddenly and the difficulties in getting plane connections from where I was on holiday in northern New South Wales to Perth. It was just not possible. On the afternoon of the funeral I sat down and thought about her for a while. I recalled then how a very nice, pleasant young woman can have such a soothing effect on your life. It is probably a very good thing for parliament-it certainly was for Rod and me-that Jane Gerick was here and calmed us down from time to time. I have to say that it was probably very good for our colleagues that she was, because a few people who were going to get rockets never got them because Jane told Rod and me that we were being a little unkind. My sympathy goes out to Jane’s mother and brother and to all her friends. As I said, it is very appropriate that we remember Jane here in the Main Committee, and it is very appropriate that we remember what a very decent, kind, gentle person she was and how she worked so hard for her electorate. Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (10.47 a.m.)-I too wish to pay tribute to Jane Gerick. As a fellow Western Australian, on occasions I had the pleasure and the honour to be a representative with Jane on the state executive committee of the Western Australian Labor Party and on the administrative committee. As other speakers have referred to, I am one of the beneficiaries of the redistribution that occurred in Western Australia to create our 15th seat, the new seat of Hasluck. In the creation of HasluckI got some of the member for Swan’s seat, some of the member for Perth’s seat and some of the member for Canning’s seat. Indeed, part of the southern area of my electorate-that is, the area of Gosnells, Maddington and Kenwick in particular-for several years was fortunate to be represented by Jane Gerick as the member for Canning. I certainly recall what it was like campaigning with her in 2001. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.48 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. election campaign I worked closely with Jane, as the colleague running in the seat next to mine. I know how hard she worked, in a very difficult situation. As other speakers have indicated, after the 2001 election Jane did not, by any means, cease her involvement with the people of Canning. A number of organisations in the southern end of my electorate maintained very close relationships with Jane, and she continued to work very hard on their behalf. Many calls were received in my electorate offices in Gosnells and Maddington from Jane as she nudged me along into one project after another, never forgetting the groups she had worked with and supported during her time in parliament. Jane was a terrific grassroots worker who was concerned about ordinary people. I have attended commemorations at places like Heritage FM-the community radio station where they recently named a studio after Jane-the Women’s Lifestyle Centre group, which we continue to have some involvement with, the local councils in the area and many of the aged care facilities, particularly Amaroo. I think I can speak on behalf of many others in my electorate to convey respect for Jane and to extend our condolences to her family. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Condolences
166,Ms Jackson,"Prior to attending the division in the House, I was saying that during theIt is sad that I remember celebrating with Jane, only a year or so ago, the end of her chemotherapy treatment. We were looking forward to good, strong, campaigns in Canning and Hasluck for the upcoming federal election. Jane wanted, almost more than anything, to be a member of parliament-she understood the honour of that-and she had a passionate desire to continue to represent people. I am extremely glad she had the opportunity in her lifetime to take up her seat in parliament. From personal experience, I know the tragedy of the loss of a family member. There can be nothing worse for parents than to outlive their children. To her mother, her brother and the rest of her family: I trust you have many fond memories of Jane that will sustain you during your time of grief. Ms ELLIS (Canberra) (11.02 a.m.)-I too would like to put on the Hansard record my thoughts and condolences to Jane Gerick’s family and endorse all of the comments made by colleagues from both sides of the chamber. To say that it was a shock to hear of Jane’s death would be an understatement because I, too, was under the impression that she was in remission, going well and that her health was fine under the circumstances. I was very shocked to learn that not only had she been ill again but she had died suddenly. There were almost 60 death notices for Jane in the West Australian on 27 December. To see almost 60 notices in recognition of someone in those circumstances testifies to me of the esteem in which Jane was held within the Western Australian community and, in particular, within the community of the electorate of Canning. I had the privilege of coming into this place in 1996. At that time there were only four females on our side of the chamber in the House of Representatives. WhilstI enjoyed the company of all of the male members, I must say it was a bit lonely. Jane Gerick was one of those very welcoming female faces who joined us in 1998. With her face also came her absolute pride and enjoyment in having been elected to this place and her joy in being able to work for the electorate of Canning. I had the opportunity to visit her electorate with a couple of colleagues and to do some electorate work and campaign work with Jane. I have to say that when we visit electorates other than our own, no matter which side of politics we come from, we are always impressed one way or the other by the relationship between the member we are visiting and their community. In Jane’s case it was such a joy to see her. She showed us around her electorate with enormous pride and she displayed a great deal of knowledge, a very broad understanding of the people who lived in the electorate of Canning and her absolute dedication to them. It did not matter where we went, whom we met or what we discussed, Jane knew exactly at that moment where the issue was and what her concerns needed to be. I will always remember that very fondly. Yes, she was struck down with acute leukaemia-a terrible thing to happen-but at the same time she was back in this place but still continuing treatment, if I recall. A lot of other members and I, through Jane’s encouragement, became the proud owners of quite a number of little Leuks, the leukaemia bears, because they were part of a fundraising campaign that the Leukaemia Foundation was running. Jane ensured that many of us became the custodians of many Leuks to help to raise money for the Leukaemia Foundation. There was no way that you could have looked Jane in the face and not happily bought more than one Leuk bear. To do that while you are undergoing treatment and hoping to come through an illness as severe as MAIN COMMITTEE acute leukaemia is not an easy thing to do. It is pretty much facing up to your circumstances in a very honest way, but Jane was able to do that. I send my very deep sympathy to her mother, Mary, and to her brother, Alan, and to all her extended family and friends both within the Labor movement and more broadly within the electorate of Canning. They have lost a wonderful member of their community. The Labor movement has lost a wonderful participant and a proud person from the Labor family-we call it a Labor family; Jane was a very strong member of that family. I particularly hope that the words that are spoken in this place today will in some way help to soften the blow that I am sure Mary and Alan and all the others who have been mentioned are feeling right now and, I am sure, will feel in months to come. liament to me; Jane Gerick was a great friend. I came to know Jane in about 1994, when we were both members of the Centre faction in Western Australia. Jane always wanted to be in parliament. She fought for the right to represent people, particularly in Canning, and, unlike many people who want to be in state parliament or in other places, she always wanted to be here. It was the driving passion that she had. At every meeting that we attended we both talked about how we wanted to be here, because this is where the big decisions are made that affect all Australians. Jane was passionate about Canning. She did not want any other seat; all she wanted to do was to represent those people. It was fabulous that she got that opportunity. Graham Edwards talked about how he was preselected at the same time as Jane. We both went through that process together, both within the faction-I listened to all her speeches, trying to get into this place-and within the state executive and I followed her career here. I was very disappointed that she lost in 1998. Had circumstances been different, she would certainly have still been here, as the member for Brand has already said. Jane was a great friend. We could all tell stories about Jane. We all like to talk on planesat least a lot of us like to talk on planes-but you could never really talk to Jane on a plane. We would sit down together and before the plane got to the end of the runway Jane would be asleep, so we would cover her with a blanket and she would wake up as the plane landed in Perth, Sydney or Melbourne-wherever we were going. Jane also had a number of other passions, apart from representing Canning. People have talked about teddy bears. I have one of those bears on my mantelpiece in my office. But Jane had another passion: chocolate-Mars bars in particular. People have talked about Coca Cola. Specifically, it was always Diet Coke. If you ever went to Jane’s office she always opened the fridge and there it was, full of Diet Coke. She had a business and she was a strong local small businessperson. I was running the YMcA SkillShare program when Jane was running her training business in Perth, and we had a lot of discussions about where training should go and what we should be doing to help people get further ahead. Her business did really well. I was shocked. I thought Jane was over her illness. I remember celebrating with her when she had gone through and been given the all clear. I was on Rottnest Island when I got the call from Graham Edwards to say that Jane has passed away. I did not know that she had even been sick again so it was very sad. My condolences go out to her family. She loved her family very much. I am sure that they will be grieving. My condolences also to everyone who knew her. Everyone who knew Jane would have fond memories of her and great respect for her. MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Condolences
167,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (11.07 A.m.),"Jane Gerick was more than just a member of this parhalf of myself and also, as chief government whip, on behalf of the government members my condolences to Jane Gerick’s family-to her mother, Mary, and to her brother, Alan-and to make a few comments about Jane as a member of parliament. She was a quiet person but that does not mean that she was not an effective member. There are members who come to this place who are loud and aggressive and robust. There are other members who are quieter but who are hard working and dedicated. Jane was one of these people. She cared passionately about her electorate. That is hopefully why all of us get elected to this place. She was a fine example of what a good local member should be. She was a member of many of the parliamentary committees, and that is one of the very effective ways that backbenchers can get their messages across and secure the things that are needed for their own electorates. An example of what a great person she was is the way that she dealt with her illness and the way that she never took her eye off the ball regarding her job and her constituents. As someone who has been diagnosed with cancer I know it is very easy to drop the ball and think of yourself and your family and not of other people or of your community. But Jane never once did that. Many of us, particularly on the government side, were unaware of her illness for some time because she never complained. She never made an issue of it. She stuck to the job that she was elected to do. I know that I believed that she had made a full recovery and was in full remission from her leukaemia. Like most members, I was absolutely shocked and devastated to learn that she had died suddenly late last year. I wanted to have the opportunity just to place on the record those few comments about a wonderful person, somebody who will be sadly missed not only by her family and friends but by the electorate and I know by the Labor Party. The fact that there are so many of her colleagues from the Labor Party here today to place on record their thoughts and their condolences is an indication of just how well respected and well liked Jane Gerick was in this parliament. politically and professionally. She was elected to the federal parliament, as people have said, in 1998 as the member for Canning in Western Australia. It was a marginal seat that required a great deal of servicing and Jane and her staff and her friends and her supporters applied themselves extremely diligently in the years that led up to 2001. She had wide interests and had a very no-nonsense approach to life. She was born in Meekatharra in Western Australia on 23 April 1963. She was educated at Curtin University, where she gained a Bachelor of Education prior to working as a teacher from 1984 to 1990. At about this time-1990-91-she was appointed a director of a business college in Perth. But at that same time she began to take a high profile in local Labor politics. She was secretary of the ALP Armadale sub-branch from 1991 to 1998, as well as fulfilling other duties within the Canning federal electorate council and the Western Australian ALP. When she came to Canberra, she joined our walking group. Mark Latham referred to this group as the ‘sharks’, but we called it the ‘Whips’ walking, dining and movie club’. It was pretty well established by this time, with Leo McLeay, Bob Sercombe, Harry Quick and me as the core members. As I said before, Jane had a very no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to political life. She had a mischievous sense of humour and was enigmatic in many ways, but she MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Condolences

169,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (11.13 A.m.),"Jane Gerick was a good friend, personally,was damn good company. The odd bit of gossip certainly was passed, but it was never really nasty. I remember asking her to join the infamous whips’ walking group-the sharks-and she did. She hated exercise. Exercise was not quite her deal, but the verbal jousting, joshing and gossip were too attractive and she limited her whingeing about exercise to a minimum. As Leo said, she provided a soothing approach to the four of us. We would sometimes get a bit angry about having to deal with some of our colleagues and she played a very positive role in that. At times the mischievous humour turned quite wicked, but she shared her comedic views of some others with only a few. I am going to write some of those views down as I remember them, but I will not embarrass people on our side or the other side by referring to them at the moment. What was noteworthy about those comedic views was that there was a complete absence of malice or nastiness. Come to think of it, that is not quite true, but the real barbs were only directed at a small but essentially deserving group. She was a member of the whips’ movie and dining club; however, she seldom appreciated our choice of movie. On some occasions that vote of no confidence was well deserved. She was very finicky about food, and there has been mention of that this morning. She was a very nonconformist practitioner of being a vegetarian. Her diet was appalling really. Diet cokes, Mars Bars and finger buns appeared to dominate the culinary experience, but there were exceptions. She particularly enjoyed the Greek, family style home cooking of Dorelle and Paul at the Greek Symposium Restaurant in Manuka. They too would like their names recorded in sympathy to Jane and her family. When zucchini fritters were ordered-as they always were without words even being exchanged when Jane was present-it was just a given that Jane would have them before anybody else touched that plate. Education helps people to help themselves. It was the basis of her political activity, which was wide ranging across a number of portfolios. She was secretary of the Labor caucus subcommittee, and a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage and the Standing Committee on Procedure. As a marginal seat holder, she relished the challenge of meeting the needs of her constituents and being effective as a parliamentarian in the House. As the member for Swan has said, she loved being a federal parliamentarian and regarded it as a great honour. She was a team player-a point made by the chief whip, the member for Robertson, Jim Lloyd-and those who worked with her always appreciated her cooperation and contribution. Her policy interests, not surprisingly, revolved around education at all levels. Jane was very much an independent person. She was extremely close to her mother, Mary, and brother, Alan, having lost her father when she was quite young. She was a devoutly religious person, but her belief was personal and she was contemptuous of others who used religion as a means to influence people in life or politics. She had similar views about gender politics and rejected it completely. She refused to allow her actions to be influenced by religion, gender, race, sexuality or any other attribute that divided people from one another. She believed and practised inclusivity and rejected those who did not. One walking club morning in Canberra, Jane rang me and said she did not feel up to going for a walk. She had self-diagnosed herself as coming down with a severe bout of influenza. She was extremely ill and weak, but none of us was prepared for the later diagnosis of leukaemia, long hospitalisation and fight back. I visited her in the Royal Perth Hospital with a teddy bear and Belgian chocolates-she did not take the diet coke I slipped her-that were MAIN COMMITTEE her comfort items. She was determined to beat leukaemia. She was driven by hopes for the forthcoming tough battle for the 2001 election in Canning. Her close friends-Bob Pearce, Lois Anderson and her staff, led by Frances Cain-were equally determined that ‘Gerick for Canning’ would not be diminished. Alas, Jane Gerick narrowly lost the 2001 election, but she seemed to be winning her battle against leukaemia. We kept in contact on a nearly weekly basis until her death. Visits to Western Australia always allowed dinners, coffee and activities involving Jane. She was delighted to gain preselection again for Labor in Canning, and in September 2003 she rang a few of us to tell us that she was officially in remission and it was all forward effort to an expected election in October 2004. We discussed some non-conventional tactics to use-had a few laughs as well-and she was genuinely excited about taking a more risky and creative approach to the forthcoming Canning campaign. In December last year she rang me from Melbourne-she was on a shopping holiday, she said, but it was also a chance to catch up with friends personal and political in Melbourne. She was waiting for Bob Sercombe and looking forward to catching up with him again. We agreed to talk more when she arrived back in Western Australia. Political intrigues were happening in WA, and she was extremely worried about one of our colleagues. Her concerns proved, unfortunately, to be accurate. We planned to meet in the parliamentary break in April. In Christmas week, I rang her to wish her well for Christmas and New Year. Unbeknown to me, she was desperately ill in hospital. Nevertheless, she sent a text message to my mobile phone: ‘Hi Rod, have gastro, will call u later. Jane’. Initially she did think that was what was going wrong. That was our last contact. I learned of her death from Leo, who rang me in shock. We were both in shock. He had heard it from a Senate colleague, Steve Hutchins, who heard it on ABC country radio. We could not believe it. When you hear that news, that horrible feeling envelops your body and it is like fear. The pain comes in the back of the spine, and it just goes around the back of the kidneys and back to the shoulders. We were both silent on the phone for what seemed a long time but perhaps it was only a few seconds. We desperately wanted it to be untrue. We desperately wanted this not to be the case-for a mistake to have been made. I rang Harry, Bob, Kay Denman, Peter and Barbara Cook and others, and organised for other friends to let other friends know the tragic news. Bob Pearce and Adele Farina from WA kept us informed as to possible funeral arrangements, and we all thank them very much for that. Many of Jane’s non-Western Australian colleagues, other than Bob Sercombe, could not attend her funeral on New Year’s Eve in Perth. I particularly regretted not being able to attend, but Jane would have understood. We were there in spirit, and for Jane that was all that really counted. Like Leo, I took the opportunity at the time of the funeral to go outside, and I just sat-a few tears, quiet, choked-and those couple of hours just went. Mark Latham, the Labor leader, was holidaying in Western Australia at that time. He delayed his departure to New South Wales to give the eulogy at Jane’s funeral. That would have really tickled Jane’s fancy, as she was a very strong Simon Crean and Mark Latham supporter, and she sent messages of encouragement to both in those leadership challenges and during some of the to-and-fro of political debate in the country. MAIN COMMITTEE Jane Gerick was held in the highest esteem by her friends in the federal parliament. She is sorely missed, and will be missed, but she will not be forgotten. Our deepest sympathy goes to her mother, Mary; her brother, Alan; and her many friends in Western Australia. Vale, Jane. Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (11.24 a.m.)-I too rise to record my sorrow and shock over the death of Jane Gerick. I came into this parliament 3½ years ago. I came in after the sudden and unexpected death of my predecessor. I had no warning of my change of job and my lifestyle. As a result of that, my memories of my first few days and weeks here are pretty blurry. Everybody was busy getting on with their work here and in their electorates and we had an election coming up, but a number of people took the time to help me, and Jane was one of those people. The first impression I had of Jane was of a young woman of enormous talent but with a quiet and efficient manner-the one who remembered to care about those around her. She was unswervingly generous. My first impression of Jane did not change much over the time that I knew Jane, except I also learnt that she had a fierce determination. The timing of my first speech here and Jane’s preselection coincided, and Jane was facing what I gather was a reasonably tough challenge. Jane flew home to Perth to deal with that challenge, which she did successfully. But in the middle of her own crisis, she remembered that I was speaking here and she managed to find the time to send me some flowers. That unexpected and generous action summed up for me what Jane was all about. After the 2001 elections when Jane lost her seat, I rang her a few times to see how she was going. Within a few days, in the midst of her natural upset, she was already taking the action she needed to get back into her business and her life-not outside politics but certainly for the moment outside parliament. Some time later when I was in Perth we met for a cup of coffee. Jane was full of plans for the next election. She talked about the challenges ahead of her and plans to overcome them. Jane was absolutely determined to get back to Canberra. Again, I was impressed her by her determination despite her lack of time for the things that she could not change. I would like to offer my condolences to Jane’s mother and to the other members of her family. Many people here in Canberra, including me, will continue to miss Jane. Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (11.26 a.m.)-I want to briefly place my comments on the record and to offer my condolences to Jane’s mother, Mary, and her brother, Alan. As Western Australians together, obviously I spent more time with Jane than some other members of the parliament. But I have to say that I did not know Jane very well, so I will not try to pretend that I had a closeness that I did not. But, as someone who has been operative in the party for many years, I have been impressed over those years by the contribution that Jane made. She was always diligent and worked extremely hard, both as a representative and as a party member, and was always clear about her values. She was not one of those politicians who would always have an eye to the main charts; she actually believed strongly in the importance of education and training, for instance, and in improving the lot of her less well-off fellow citizens, and she was always prepared to argue that in whatever circumstance she found herself. Many people closer to Jane have commented on things that we all noticed-for example, her self-deprecation. She was never one to blow her own trumpet; she was always keen to get on with the job and, if people admired what she did, she was willing to accept that admiration MAIN COMMITTEE but she certainly did not put herself forward. That was to her disadvantage. She may have been better known to some of her colleagues had she been more prepared to put herself forward. I think that modesty is something that we can all recognise and admire in politics, if only because we do not see it very often. Jane also had, as some people have suggested, not only a mischievous but also a wicked sense of humour. I heard her tell some extraordinarily funny jokes-but, being the sort of person who forgets punchlines, I will not try to repeat them. Jane was always looking a little sideways at the world around her. She was not in any way predictable in the way she looked at people and events-but always did so, as has been said, with good humour. Even during her illness, she would put herself down and make it seem as if her illness was not particularly important, whereas we knew that she was confronting her own death. She never made a great deal of that and, in a sense, allowed those of us around her to perhaps underestimate just how seriously ill she was until it became quite critical. We have also heard about Jane’s rather bizarre tastes in food and the sort of expression of that in the apparent diet that she survived on. I always wondered how on earth she got through a day, but I think there was a lot of game playing in that. I am sure she lived on more than Diet Coke and Mars Bars. I certainly hope she did. Jane was pretty tough, and that was shown in the way that she responded to her illnessand the second time around, when nobody was aware of her illness. I was really shocked when I heard of her death. I was away on leave, and I did not hear about her death until the day of her funeral. I was very sad not to have been able to attend her funeral. HadI known, I would have been there. As it was, I was taking a break on the South Coast and I heard it on the radio on the day of her funeral. SoI am very sorry, and I express my apologies to her mother, Mary, in particular, that I was not able to be at the funeral-being some five hours away by the time. I realised that it was on. I think all of us will remember Jane, whether we were very close to her or simply observed her with admiration. I know that I speak for a great many Western Australians when I say she is the kind of person we were pleased and proud to have represent us in the Labor Party. I know I speak for my colleagues in the parliamentary party and the wider party in saying that we are very sorry indeed that she has left us. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.30 a.m.)-I was elected to parliament at the same time as Jane Gerick, and you form a strong bond with the people who are elected at the same time as you. The thing that impressed me most about Jane was her quiet determination. She was softly spoken and had a soft presence about her, but she was certainly no pushover. She had great strength and was a person who was committed to her philosophy and ideals and to the people that she represented in this parliament. She was a very fine person. Another aspect of Jane’s character or personality was the fact that she never complained. She was a very sick woman, yet at no time did she complain or say, ‘Why me?’ She was one of those people who looked upon illness as a further opportunity, and she fought really strongly against the leukaemia and for other people with leukaemia. One of the last speeches that Jane made in this parliament was in Leukaemia Week. She spoke about Leuk the leukaemia bear, and I am sure there are a number of us here who bought Leuk the leukaemia bear, because Jane was very persuasive. We all felt that this was something that we could not possibly walk away from. MAIN COMMITTEE In the speech that Jane made in Leukaemia Week, she at no time mentioned herself. At no time did she seek pity from anyone. She was strong, and she was fighting for a cause, something she believed in. She was, as I have already stated, a very strong woman, one who loved her community. She enjoyed being here and worked hard here in this parliament. For her, being a member of parliament was the ultimate goal, and she achieved that. I think it is very sad that she was not re-elected, but that is the way things are in this parliament. We are all very vulnerable to things such as boundary changes, and as such Jane was not returned. But I am sure she would have been returned at the next election. Jane worked hard in her community. She worked to build and strengthen her community, and it is interesting that you have heard the previous speaker, the member for Fremantle, say that she continued to work in her community. That shows a strong commitment. She really believed in and loved community; she was passionate about it and about the people she represented in this parliament. I send my condolences to her mother and her brother. They can remember with great pride Jane’s contribution to her community, to her electorate and to Australia. She made a difference, and to make a difference is something very special. Each and every person that is elected to this place is very privileged. Jane recognised that privilege, and she always represented her community and the people of Australia with great honour. lences to Jane Gerick’s family-her mother, Mary, and her brother, Alan. I had the sad opportunity to attend Jane’s funeral in Perth on New Year’s Eve. It was a very moving and dignified service indeed, where Jane’s very deep faith and very strong values were spoken of extensively and certainly very much evidenced by the sad service. Her courage and dedication were clearly the hallmarks of her far too short life. The service was particularly moving for me because only 10 days prior to her passing I had lunch with Jane in Lygon Street in Melbourne, and at that time she seemed to me to be her usual vibrant self. So the tragic circumstances and her rapid deterioration in health struck me very strongly indeed. My leader was kind enough to identify me-along with a few other colleagues-as one of the ‘sharks’ who accompanied Jane on expeditions to films and restaurants in Canberra and even in our vain attempts to keep fit by walking around the place. Jane was certainly a very gentle person, but I can assure you that she well and truly had the sharks deterred; there was an extraordinary strength of character in her-great bravery and determination-and she certainly had the capacity to keep the sharks well and truly at bay and make sure they behaved themselves. She was a very strong and determined person, and that presented an interesting balance to her great gentleness of character on the exterior. She was certainly a gentle person, but one of the strongest and most determined people I have had the opportunity to know. Whilst we have all referred to the people with the greatest loss associated with Jane’s passing, Mary and Alan, there are a number of other people who are very close colleagues of Jane’s in Western Australia to whom I briefly wish to refer and include in my condolences. Adele Farina, whom Rod Sawford referred to, was a great personal friend of Jane’s-a great support for Jane through her difficulties-and I know that Adele in particular has experienced a great personal loss as well. Bob Pearce, Lois Anderson, Kay Hallahan and the West Australian Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Alannah MacTiernan, are people who would MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Condolences

They were close colleagues of Jane’s in the context of Western Australian public and political life and I add them to the list of people to whom I extend my condolences. of my colleagues and extend my sympathy to Jane’s mother and brother. It was not the first time. I met Jane, but the first time. I had a substantive conversation with her was at the Western Australian launch of the 1988 federal election campaign. In the outlying states it is always a tradition that the leader has a national campaign launch and then there is a state launch. On that occasion, of course, Mr Beazley, the member for Brand, was Leader of the Opposition, so we had the formal launch of the West Australian campaign in Perth, and Jane and I were seated together. I was the member for Perth, seeking re-election, and it was her first time as a candidate. We had a conversation about the things that she was doing and how she was trying to win. A number of things struck me about her: firstly, her absolute determination; secondly, her dedication to the task; and, thirdly, her resilience-whatever setback she might have had on the campaign trail was always momentary and she would then move full steam ahead to the next issue or the next battle. In my view, these were the attributes and characteristics that she displayed in the course of her time here, in the course of her efforts to get back here and in the course of her struggle against her illness. I think Jane is fondly remembered for a couple of things: firstly, her obsession with Diet Coke, which always escaped me; and, secondly, her affection for teddy bears-she had a lot of them, but she used to sell a few as well. When she initially recovered from leukaemia, one of the leukaemia research fundraising efforts was to sell teddy bears, whose name, not surprisingly, was Leuk. My daughter is the proud owner of a Leuk. For a period of time it was my daughter’s favourite teddy bear, but I have to attest that that is no longer the case. Jane not only stored and loved her own teddy bears but proselytised for them throughout various communities. Her passing was a great tragedy-a young life taken too soon, before she had completely fulfilled what she regarded as her life’s work and life’s aspirations. She got a terrific send-off in Perth. The previous speaker, the member for Maribyrnong, travelled from Melbourne to represent eastern states colleagues. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, delayed his return from Western Australia to the eastern states to be able to make a formal contribution on behalf of the parliamentary party. Jane was at the end surrounded by very many of her friends and colleagues from the west-her political colleagues but also colleagues from the education profession. She was well regarded and well respected, and I join with my colleagues in extending my deepest sympathy to her mother, her brother, her family and her friends. my sympathy to the family, Mary and Alan, the mother and the brother, and the friends of Jane Gerick. Other speakers have said she was too young to go. She really was-40 years is just too young for life to disappear from one’s screen. I was looking the other day at a quote from Oliver Goldsmith where he said: You can preach a better sermon with your life than with your lips. That was Jane. She was no hypocrite. She did preach a better sermon with her life than with her lips. In the short time. I knew her, which was only the three years she was here in the parliament, I do not think I heard her make a bad comment or say a bad word about anyone. MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Condolences

172,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (11.40 A.m.),"I too would like to join my colleagues and expressInterestingly enough, when you touch on the Coke and the finger buns, the argument I would continually have with Jane was how she could possibly eat a finger bun and stay as slim as she was, when I would look at the icing and put on another half a stone. Then she would say, ‘I make it up with the Coke.’ So it was quite an extraordinary lifestyle she had. People have referred to the bears. I always remember them as the Care Bears. She used to be there selling them or trying to get us to buy them. She loved the job she was doing here. She really lived for her constituency, and I think it was a shame that she never had the opportunity to see what was going to happen in the future. I also think it is a mark of respect that this debate is occurring in this chamber for her. I know people will say it has not often happened before when a person has died in office and when we have a condolence debate, but I thank the government for allowing us and also government speakers who came forward to show respect for Jane by having this Main Committee debate. I think each one of us in our own way wanted to have an opportunity to express what we felt, but each one of us wanted to let her family know that we too join with them in their sorrow. Jane, you were too young to go, but without goodbye you went to sleep and your loving memories are ours to keep. Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (11.43 a.m.)-I join with my colleagues to make a few comments about Jane Gerick. I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by the opposition whip, the member for Prospect, who I think has summed up a lot of Jane’s love for this job and a lot of her devotion and engagement in this job. I was a member of the class of ’98 with Jane. We were a pretty big class and there were also a lot of young women. I think we as a group found a very special friendship because we had so much in common: we were all brand new in parliament and we were facing all those issues that women in a male dominated area start to address and grow with. Jane was always pretty good fun with that. You would normally have a conversation with Jane while she was drinking Diet Coke. It is one of the things you remember about her. I want to particularly pass my sympathies on to Jane’s mum and the family and friends who are obviously suffering a lot from the loss of Jane. She was probably one of the gutsiest people I knew. Given how ill Jane was, she could have decided not to do this anymore. She could have stayed home and spent her time doing fun and enjoyable things. Whilst there is a lot of enjoyment to be gained from representing your electorate, there is also a lot of hard work and a great commitment, and Jane made that commitment really strongly and fought to be able to make it again. I think she would have been an amazing member to have welcomed back to this House and we had full hopes that she would have done so. The thing that I remember most about Jane is that when she came back from being so ill, apart from being ribbed about her fabulous hairstyle, she immediately went into fundraising for the Leukaemia Foundation. Both my children now go to bed with Jane’s Leuk the leukaemia bear that she sold to raise money and the profile of the foundation. Some people wondered why there was a teddy bear sitting on Jane’s desk at her first question time when she came back, but that is pretty much because that is the sort of person Jane was. She was not going to make a big song and dance about the fact that she had been ill or that she had engaged with a commitment to that cause, but she was there doing that. SoI hope Jane’s mum realises that when I tuck my kids into bed I will think of Jane. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms HOARE (Charlton) (11.45 a.m.)-I also wish to include my name in this record of condolence to Jane’s mum, Mary, and her brother, Alan. Like the member for Bass, I was then one of those young women elected in the class of ’98 and quite a special bond formed between all of us. AlsoI sat with or near Jane in that first parliament. I must say that Jane was difficult to get to know at first, she was a very generous person but a quiet person. It took me some time to get to know her, even though I sat near her and we were elected in the same year and also sat in the same group within the Labor Party in the parliament. But once you got to know her, you appreciated her generosity, her strong belief in her values and also her wicked sense of humour. I never joined with the Sharks. I had heard of them and knew about them. I was invited on their walks and to the movies and dinners; I think I went once. I said earlier to Bob Sercombe that I think one of the last movies they went to see was Nurse Betty. The member for Port Adelaide has referred to the fact that Jane was not really fond of the group’s choice of movies, and I think Nurse Betty would have been one of those. We kept in touch spasmodically after her defeat in 2001; it was not Jane’s defeat, it was the Labor Party’s defeat. She worked damned hard. I can remember her saying to Rod that she had the flu and Rod saying to her, ‘Look, go home; go and see a doctor,’ and that was when she was first diagnosed with leukaemia. We were all very buoyed by her determination to beat it; we thought she had beaten it. She was with us during that time here in the parliament and never took a day to feel sorry for herself. She was going to do what she could for the party and for the people of Canning and her wider community. Madam Deputy Speaker Corcorcan, it was you who told me about Jane’s passing when you first heard of it. You called me on Boxing Day. It came as a shock to you and to me. Although you and I could not attend her funeral, we were very pleased that our leader and the member for Maribyrnong represented us there. My deepest sympathy goes to Jane’s mum, her brother, her family and her very close friends. She will be missed by us all. rise in their places as a mark of respect to the memory of Jane Gerick.

174,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (11.49 A.m.),"It is a real pleasure to speak on thepicture tells a story, is really good stuff and I commend it to every member of the House and to the government when considering just what to do on this very touchy issue. As I have said, the report is called Every picture tells a story. I am not one who really holds with that as a title, because I think that the real title is the matter we were investigating and the name of the inquiry-the report on the inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation. But I think that the illustrations on the cover of the report really go to show just how fundamental are the issues we are talking about. Those are drawings done by a young boy named Jack-pictures of how he lives, moving between his mum’s place and his dad’s place, and how he feels when his mum and his dad are fighting. The issues that are encapsulated in those very simple pictures were brought home to us again and again during the committee inquiry. While I do not hold with the title, and prefer the name of the inquiry, I think the title Every picture tells a story should adorn every one of those pictures, because they show that for every child caught up in this bind it is a very serious business. One of the reasons why I am so proud of the work of this committee is that it was accomplished in such a short time frame. We went all around Australia and we had meetings with hundreds of people. We had to arrange processes whereby people could just get up and make short statements to the committee. If we had not done that it would have been impossible for those people to have had their voices heard. There was a stack of submissions which you could not jump over-they are still crowding out my office. Fortunately, they will be taken away and destroyed. Much purely personal and traumatic material was covered and canvassed by people in their submissions. They were desperately seeking from the parliament and the government answers to things that are really tearing up their lives. This report is a very positive one. I thank the secretariat for the work that they did. But, more than that, I want to thank the other members of the committee because they approached our task in such a cooperative and effective manner. There was a lot of willingness among people to focus on the issue. There was no political gamesmanship in it. It was a very good process, so that is why I am very pleased with the outcome. As I have said, this is a very sensitive issue. I believe that if we are able to effectively deal with the problem of child custody arrangements-people object to the word ‘custody’, which is a problem in itself-we must deal with the basic issue of how to continue a family when the relationship on which it is founded is completely torn apart. That is the core question that affects many people in our community. If we can get a greater grip on the matter, give people greater certainty, take some of the emotion and even violent aspects out of it, and provide a more secure footing and a foundation on which at least the children can feel more secure, we will provide a huge benefit to our community. There is not only a huge emotional benefit but also a huge economic cost in the absolute devastation that is brought down on people’s lives and the impact that it has on the community. Our community is suffering big time because we really have not got this right. It has been like this for a long time now-probably forever-but we have to keep on and work at it. We have to keep on trying to make it better. This committee’s report represents a quantum leap towards improving things in this regard. One of things I think we should be doing is looking at the economic cost. Often in the community the only thing we ever think about is money. But if we are not thinking about the economic cost that family breakdown is bringing on our community then often I do not think it even gets a run. I think that is a very sad state of affairs. People do not recognise that when MAIN COMMITTEE people’s lives are being destroyed by interfamily disputes they are hardly able to function and in many cases they wind up going from being very good, strong, productive members of our community to shells of their former selves. That is something we should monitor. We should look at what the cost is to our community. Even police having to attend disputes and things like that is a cost. I will not dwell on that, because I think it really devalues the issue, but I think there are many minds in the bureaucracy that would not even count it as an issue-and that is a sad state of affairs. The findings of this report will not please everyone, but I think they address the problems of the vast majority of people who are caught up in this very difficult situation. There are complaints about the findings we have produced, but I believe they are complaints at the periphery. By and large, I think many of these complaints are coming from lobby groupsgroups, often, who have a chip on their shoulder or have a particular point to prove and want to make that point at the cost of everything else. I think that in this we have to go to what the silent majority say, and I tell you that the silent majority, when looking at the issues that are raised in this report, would agree overwhelmingly with the recommendations that have been brought forward. The report is excellent. The current system is based around adversarial courtroom battles that go on and on. There have been many myths grow up around this adversarial system. The way the system works spawns systematic behaviour among people which is often a very poor reflection on our society. People think that they can dodge their responsibility for their children. That is a common belief. The fact that 40 per cent of people who are paying child support in this country are paying no more than the minimum $5 a week shows just how prepared people are to completely duck their responsibilities to their own children. And that is a belief among many people. There is also a myth that you can use your children as weapons to get at your ex-partner. That is something I have harped on about during the inquiry. The other myth is that you can get a lawyer and take the other partner for every cent that they have. At the moment, I have a case in my electorate of a lady caught up in a dispute. It turns out that this dispute, over the couple splitting up, was 10 years in the planning. The person who left had spent 10 years on it. The file was actually dated 1993, and they spent 10 years planning their separation. It was an ambush when it was dropped on the other person and you can imagine, in the adversarial courtroom system, the person who did the ambushing had the other one absolutely cold. This is what goes on within the adversarial system we have today. It is not based on people solving their disputes in an adult manner; it is based on the fact that if you have a better lawyer and a better bunch of facts you are going to come out on top. AndI think that is also a very sad state of affairs. There are several issues I would like to raise in relation to the decisions the court makes about people, relationships and how access to children is to be apportioned. It is wrong for those decisions to be set in stone, because the relationships between the adults, and the children and the adults, change over time. So it is wrong for a courtroom decision to take a snapshot and say, ‘Righto, we’re going to try to freeze that in time.’ Something more flexible is needed. Court decisions which may be correct today may be wrong just down the track. We need to create a system in which ex-partners are encouraged to communicate and to act like adults towards each other. We have too many people in our community acting like children, MAIN COMMITTEE and they are the fathers and mothers of children. This childlike behaviour from them is poisoning the attitudes of our next generation, and unless we are able to address this the problems will go on. The proposal that has been put forward by our committee, which is really the core of the solution to this thing, is that we take the whole thing-or as much of it as possible-away from the courts and establish a tribunal. We have had the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and those kinds of tribunals set up to do those kinds of jobs. They have been solving industrial disputes in our community for years and years very successfully. Industrial disputes can be very emotional and there can be strongly entrenched views. These disputes can be long running and can also change with time. The tribunal system is able to effectively deal with those disputes. The same sorts of heavy issues apply-much heavier on some occasions-in the types of relationships that are dealt with in this report. To take it out of the courts and use the people who have a background in family relationships to try to solve these problems, rather than purely take some kind of legalistic position-a snapshot and freeze it in time-would be a far more fundamentally fair and appropriate way in which to behave. It will then rely on the mettle of the partners to put their case and to not only properly establish whatever grievances they have but also set out an arrangement for the future for themselves and their children. At the moment, children are often an add-on in what is really a dispute about money. It is about who has the money, who has the power, who has the house, who has the car-and ‘What about this child? Oh, well, we’ll add that in somewhere down the bottom.’ That is the entirely wrong way for people to go about it. We have a system under this proposal put forward by the committee where the children must come first and warring parties are required to address that first. It is something that they should have done long ago as parents, in many cases, but people just do not do that. This is a situation where that can be done. I would like to go to much greater length about all this. The tribunal is the main issue, but there are many other things. There is the idea, for example, that we should resource this properly by establishing an investigative arm to support that tribunal to look at issues like child abuse and situations where there may have been violence. It is important that this be resourced. One of the problems with the existing system in terms of legal aid and the courtroom capabilities is that the resources have always fallen way short of what is needed, particularly when you have so many lawyers involved-and obviously these things can go on and on and gobble up resources. Having proper investigatory processes would also support that. There is a proposal to double the minimum Child Support Agency payments from the totally woefully inadequate figure of $5 a week. We are proposing to double it to $10 a week but, frankly, I think it should be much more. No matter what you do, no matter who you are, no matter what your status in life, if you have a child, they should be number one. And a figure like $5 is put on them-and even now, we are saying $10! I do not think that is enough. As I said, 40 per cent of child support payers are paying that $5. Where is their priority for their children? We have to bump that up the list no matter who they are and no matter what their circumstances. I strongly commend the outcome of this inquiry, the report that has been produced. I sincerely hope that the government is going to put a big effort into analysing every one of the possibilities it covers. Not only do I think the tribunal proposal is a more effective measure; I MAIN COMMITTEE think it will be a more economic one. The reams of paperwork that can be entered into by lawyers when they are trying to prove a case are nothing when it comes down to the basic dispute between two human beings who no longer can stand each other’s company at all. They have to act like adults. We have to have a better system. (Time expired) arrangements in the event of family separation addresses one of the most serious issues facing our society. Unfortunately, with around 50,000 divorces each year and over 50 per cent of those involving children under the age of 18, an increasing number of children find themselves in a shared arrangement situation. That is why this is a very important report; it is an excellent report, and I support what has already been said about it and the short time that it took to bring it together. I believe that it is only right and proper that each parent has an equal and shared responsibility in all matters relating to the raising of their children. The committee’s recommendation 9 is that the Family Law Act be amended to require separating parents to undertake mediation or other forms of dispute resolution before they are able to make an application to a court or a tribunal for a parenting order. I think that is a very important point. This enables the parents to cool off a bit-if that is appropriate term to use-and hopefully sit down and give a lot of consideration to their children’s future. It is quite possible that the first thought in the minds of a divorcing couple is not necessarily the children; there may be other considerations. But no doubt, after they have sat down and cooled off, they will give a lot of consideration to their children’s futures. No doubt there is a range of emotional feelings involved in family breakdown, and few of them are very positive, so wherever possible mediation is preferable to the combative nature of a courtroom situation. There are, of course, some separations that are achieved without rancour. We all know of separations where the parents have remarried and the two families have remained good friends, resulting in the raising of well-adjusted children. On the other side of the coin, though, federal members are frequently visited by constituents who are very distressed by the outcome of their separations. I am sure that the committee heard many examples of this. One of the major areas of concern for the non-custodial parent is their financial ability to get on with their new life, which may include remarrying and starting a new family. Many men, and often their new partners, are very critical of the child support legislation on this issue. Recommendation 25 seeks to address this issue, particularly at the fourth dot point, which states: Amending the way the payer’s child support income is determined by halving the formula percentage applying to income earned from overtime and second jobs worked above a set working week of 38 hours. In the event of a person working more than one job, either part time or casual, only the first 38 hours can be combined to achieve the 38 hour limit. There is always a question, of course, of whether these things can be implemented in practice. It is good that the committee has seen the problem in this area, but there is also the question of whether the proposed solution is practical, and that can only be tested. On the other side of the coin, recommendation 25 also seeks to strengthen the power of the Child Support Agency in collection of child support, which is a major concern expressed by the custodial parents. Most members would have heard one parent saying, ‘I’m paying too much’ and the other parent MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Committees
175,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (12.04 P.m.),"The report on the inquiry into child custodysaying, ‘You’re not paying enough’. If all the recommendations of this report were adopted, there would still be a number of people who were unhappy with the system on this issueprobably more than any other. You will never satisfy everybody. This is not to play down the recommendations in the report. They are very important and, if adopted, will work towards finding the right balance that is needed to produce a better society and better financial outcomes for separated parents and better outcomes for the welfare of the children. I was pleased that the committee was able to visit my electorate of Greenway in western Sydney-I thank them very much for doing that-on 1 September last year. I attended the hearing as an observer and was very interested in what was being said by many of the witnesses. I would like to highlight some of the submissions presented to the committee on that day by individuals and by organisations involved in caring for children from broken marriages. Many of the recommendations contained in the report supported the submissions made in my electorate, although some of the submissions raised issues that may not have been dealt with in the report. One organisation with considerable experience in the field of assisting children from broken homes is Uniting Care Burnside, which spoke against the concept of an automatic fiftyfifty sharing of parenting arrangements. I note that a recommendation in the final report favours an equal shared parent responsibility-and I think the important words are ‘equal responsibility’. The Burnside submission instead highlights the need for children to have the opportunity to express their views. It believes that a fifty-fifty arrangement for the parents leaves nothing for the children. In part, the Burnside submission states: In a situation where a fifty-fifty parenting arrangement is automatic, it is highly unlikely that the opinions of the children involved will be sought, especially when the environment is highly charged and emotional. … … … More effort needs to be taken to include the voice of children who are affected by their parents separating. If this does not occur, the proposed framework is in danger of being in conflict with other legislative frameworks that strive for the best interests of the child. It further states: Burnside’s recommendations for this inquiry are that any changes to the legislation should, firstly, put in place systems where the opinions of the children involved are actively sought; secondly, ensure that children and young people are genuinely included in decision making in these matters; and, thirdly, be changes that are grounded in research evidence about the best interests of the child and about children’s health and well-being. I am pleased to say that recommendation 13 does cover that point. It states: The committee recommends that all processes, services and decision making agencies in the system have as a priority built in opportunities for appropriate inclusion of children in the decisions that affect them. I will continue to draw this committee’s attention to a number of other submissions that were given to that committee on that particular day. These particular presentations show the wide range of views that were presented just on one particular day, and no doubt the committee has had a similar wide range of concerns presented in the many submissions it took and the many hearings it conducted right throughout Australia. OneI find to be of particular interest because of the group of people that she represents. She is identified in Hansard as Ms Mazzone. MAIN COMMITTEE She represents the Immigrant Women’s Speakout Association of New South Wales, which is the peak migrant and refugee association of New South Wales. Ms Mazzone represents a unique group of people, and I do not think we can ignore the situation that they could find themselves in if they were to become involved in separation or divorce from their husbands. AgainI will quote-because I think it is fairly important-from this submission. It states: This is a concern especially for women from a non-English-speaking background who find it very hard to access the legal system because they are not familiar with the Australian system because of lack of easy access to information, particularly in community languages, and difficulty in accessing interpreters. Some have a fear of courts and authorities, especially if they come from a refugee background. There is a lack of cross-cultural awareness in court staff and there are financial issues. The submission continues: This is made worse by cuts to Legal AidwhichI have found to be a very serious issue in my electorateand difficulties in obtaining it for family law cases. Lack of English proficiency would be an especially hard barrier for women self-representing in court. Women might therefore consent to orders they do not think are in the best interests of the child, or they think are actually putting the child at risk, because of barriers in rebutting the presumption. Domestic violence workers have grave concerns in relation to how this presumption will affect children who are experiencing abuse and separating families who are experiencing domestic violence. In that short presentation, you can see a number of issues coming forward. There was a lot more detail than I have given this morning, expanding on the problems that migrant ladies might have in situations that we are referring to. I move on to another witness, who has been identified as ‘witness 2’. This witness emphasises the need for mediation, which has also come out very strongly in the report and in what has been said in the debate on this report. I will read out a short quote from witness 2, who says: The reason I am here today is basically because I believe that mediation is one of the biggest overlooked tools that we have. I would like to see more funds going towards mediation. I think the courts should appoint mediators for every case, to protect the children and also to protect the interest financially of both parties. Often there are other parties involved, depending on the income, circumstances of employment, property and so forth ... That witness emphasised very strongly that particular point. Another witness, who has been identified as ‘witness 3’, made a very strong statement relating to fathering. We cannot overemphasise the role of fathers in family situations, and particularly in the area of family breakup. Sometimes fathers may feel, because they are not necessarily the custodian of the children, that they are being overlooked. I think it is very important that the report highlights this. This is one comment made by witness 3, who says: The experience of fathering for me has been very powerful in my life. IfI had been deprived of that experience it would have been a terrible loss. I only know about it because I have been through it. I would never have known about it otherwise. Another witness I want to refer to is possibly the most unique witness that appeared before the committee on that particular day. I am rather aware of the circumstances here, because this witness is a constituent of mine who had previously come to see me about the particular problem that they had. His concern is, and I read again from this submission: MAIN COMMITTEE My daughter was abducted to the United States of America on the 15 May 2001. My daughter was 3½ months when abducted by her mother. I was the primary carer. I have slept little since my daughter’s abduction. I have not been to bed since, waiting every night for the phone to ring. I do not know anything about my daughter. I do not know whether she is well. I do not even know what she looks like. This is a very complicated situation, and we have taken up this matter with the legal authorities in both Australia and the United States. One of the queries this witness raised on this occasion was how the mother was able to get the child out of Australia. He questioned whether children of such a young age should be issued with a passport, as this could lead to such a situation. This could be a major problem, bearing in mind our large migrant population, where, unfortunately this sort of thing could happen. In the time allowed to me, can I say that I am very impressed with the report. I congratulate the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and the committee’s support start for the excellent support. I would also like to put in a plug for the Child Support Agency, who I believe do an excellent job. They get criticised for the legislation that we pass in this House, but all they can do, of course, is what is in the legislation before them. I think they do an excellent job. They have organised a number of seminars in my electorate, which have been well attended. The people who have attended those seminars have been very appreciative. (Time expired) this report. Up to 50 per cent of the people whom I see in my electorate office come to me with some aspect of the breakdown of a marriage: divorce, separation, property settlement, the injustice of child contact and access, the inability to obtain legal aid or the inability to pay or to be paid child support. In some weeks such issues certainly take up 50 per cent of my contact time with constituents-not that I begrudge that, but it seems to me that the whole system is wrong. As many members have identified that is because, by its very nature, the system is adversarial. If something is adversarial, you are going to have an atmosphere in which one side must win. Far from parents focusing on the children and the quality of their lifestyle post separation, we often see children being used as bargaining chips by separated parents who are having a go at each other. In fact, in some instances it becomes incredibly vicious and vindictive when one parent who feels deprived spends their whole time making contact with the other parent or matters to do with child support as difficult as possible. I have seen a case in which, if the non-custodial parent was five minutes late, the custodial parent had the police waiting for him. In the same case, the children spilt ice cream, for instance, on the T-shirt that they wore to the contact with their father. Two weeks later, when the father picked up the children for their contact period with him, the clothes were unwashed and had exactly the same stains on them. You might say that that is a fiddling little detail but it is indicative of the viciousness that the adversarial system has spawned. I believe for lots of reasons that the principle of equality before the law does not exist in the Family Court. This report goes a long way to addressing such issues. The very first recommendation sets the high point, if you like, when it states: The committee recommends that Part VII of the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to create a clear presumption, that can be rebutted, in favour of equal shared parental responsibility, as the first tier in post separation decision making. MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Committees
176,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.19 P.m.),"Every picture tells a story is a most apt title forIf that could be achieved, it would be marvellous, but for practical reasons sometimes it cannot be achieved. You cannot have kids going from one parent to the other in the one town unless there is some sort of orderly method to it or you will end up with kids who are even more mixed up than they were before. But if parents can be civilised and if the children spend so many weeks or months a year with one parent and so many with the other, that’s great, and that should be the objective. The next matter is parenting agreements. The recommendation relating to a tribunal goes a long way towards achieving them. Recommendation 12 states: The Tribunal should first attempt to conciliate the dispute. If parents can be sat down in a tribunal or with counsellors appointed by the tribunal to set up a parenting plan, it will go a long way towards achieving a much more civilised relationship between the children and the parents and between the ex-partners. The third level is making some orders, and the tribunal will have that power but, as I said, in a less adversarial way than was formerly the case. The fourth tier is where the Family Court will take over. The Family Court will operate in three areas. The first is where there are cases of entrenched conflict, where there is violence, substance abuse, sexual abuse and the like. It will exist to enforce the orders of the family tribunal. I think that is very important. It will review decisions of the tribunal on the grounds of denial of natural justice or where the tribunal exercises power outside its jurisdiction. So, if you like, it is there both as an enforcer and as an interpreter to make sure that the processes of the tribunal have been fully followed. It would be no secret to members that I am no fan of the Family Court. My view is that the Family Court should be dissolved. I think that if this system goes through with tribunals then, with a judicious amount of increase in the district courts or Supreme Courts, these matters could be handled by the normal judiciary, and I suspect they would be handled better. The three things that are left are only cases of entrenched family conflict, enforcement of the orders of the family tribunal and the review of decisions of the tribunal, which could be well and truly handled by the district courts and Supreme Courts. That is my personal view; it is not the view of the government and it is not the view of the committee. I think the Family Court has done nothing to improve separation and child support in this country. I would add a few things to this report, and that is not said with any criticism of it. The report says that in the event of someone not carrying out the orders of the court, especially in relation to contact with children, a cumulative list of consequences for breaches should be taken into account. It says that there should be a reasonable but minimal financial penalty for the first breach and a subsequent breach, and the third breach within a pattern of deliberate defiance should see a consideration of the parenting order being made in favour of the other parent. The final step would be to retain the ultimate sanction of imprisonment. I go along with all those, but I think there could be another step in there. Before getting to the point of transferring the children from one parent to the other, I would put in a rule that, where the custodial parent denied the orders of the family tribunal, for the period of that defiance Child Support Agency payments should be suspended. I have found that vindictive and manipulative custodial parents have always skated through on the presumption that they can have it both ways: they can make life a misery for the non-custodial parent but they know the non-custodial parent is going to have to pay anyhow. If, for example, that non-custodial parent MAIN COMMITTEE was paying $150 a week and was denied access to his or her children for, say, four weeks of the Christmas holidays, the penalty to the custodial parent would not only be the four areas mentioned but there would be a penalty of $600. Having dealt with these cases, my gut feeling is that, once you remove that ability to have it both ways, a lot of the manipulative custodial parents would come into line. But if they did not then you could move on to the next sanction, that the parenting order could be changed in favour of the non-custodial parent. That would be good in some instances but, of course, if the non-custodial parent lived 1,000 or 2,000 kilometres away and could not make the contact anyhow, it would be meaningless. That is why I think the financial penalty of the Child Support Agency might be a better mechanism. Finally, retaining the ultimate sanction of imprisonment is always going to be difficult. What happens in these cases at present is that, when a manipulative custodial parent denies contact to the non-custodial parent, by the time the processes are put in place to get it corrected, to sometimes seek legal aid, to get it before the courts and to get a ruling, anything between nine, 12 or 15 months has elapsed. When you do get the manipulative custodial parent into court, what happens? The judge is reluctant to fine them heavily, because that impacts on the kids. The judge can hardly, say, put a mother on a work release program, because she should be at home looking after those children. Or, finally, if they are put in prison, that creates a whole raft of problems in getting the kids to the non-custodial parent or into foster care. So what happens in the end is that the person gets a slap on the wrist and is sent home. They know they can get away with it, and they do it over and again. That is why I think recommendation 21, as good as it is, should have that extra sanction added to it. The other thing is that, although under this formula the tribunal will certainly be less adversarial and less expensive, we should make sure that, in referring matters to the courts, we have a good team of federal magistrates so that, again, these things can be heard quickly and less expensively. is my experience of them. I will give you an example. When we talk about family matters, I think legal aid should be divided into two buckets: one for normal actions-civil and criminal actions-and another for the Family Court. Also, I think an extra rule should be added to Family Court access, and it should be this: the guidelines should be that both parents receive legal aid or neither does, and not this business of equal means or near equal means. Both should receive legal aid or neither of them should. That way, they would appear before the court on equal terms. I recognise that, if we put a tribunal in place, appearances before the court in these entrenched conflicts will be fewer than at present. Nevertheless, I think that principle is very important. I will give you an example. I had a constituent who lived at Gin Gin, just west of Bundaberg. He had a manipulative ex-wife. She would drag him down to the Family Court, which at that time met, I think, in Parramatta. He would hitchhike down on semitrailers and stay in a dosshouse-a boarding house. He would then turn up to the Family Court where, because of the conflict in this case, the court had appointed barristers to represent the children MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Committees

I think it is an outstanding effort. I commend the member for Riverina on her outstanding leadership. When you look at the number of submissions-there were 1,715 submissions and 186 exhibits-and the number of hearings and the number of people that attended them, it is a remarkable effort.

That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Environment: Water dams or reservoirs or catchment areas, but it does contain 100,000 people who consume water and many manufacturing industries which likewise consume water. Like all Australians, we are concerned about the future of our unique way of life and the future we face with an increasing shortage of water. On this side of the House we have been aware of Australia’s looming water crisis for more than a decade. In 1994 the Keating Labor government set up a water reform process which, had it been followed through, would have restored environmental flows to our rivers. Instead, the Howard government has pursued a policy of drift and inaction and the 1994 initiative has been lost. This government is laying the grounds for a water crisis which the next generation of Australians will have to grapple with. The CSIRO predicts that greenhouse gas induced climate change will cause more frequent and more severe droughts in the years ahead. This will have a major impact on the way of life of urban Australians as well as farmers and others who live in regional areas. Australia should be doing everything it can to strengthen, rather than undermine, international collective efforts to tackle climate change. My view and the opposition’s view is that the Howard government is afraid to ratify Kyoto because it fears some short-term economic and political cost. But what will be the long-term costs for Australia if our cities and our countryside continue to face crippling and permanent water shortages and our vital export industries are ruined by semipermanent drought?

Mr Hunt interjectingmoved if he does not remain silent. ronment is a great sore point for the current government and Australian voters. Perhaps they will have a chance at the next election to reflect on the current government with respect to this issue. Our greatest water crisis area, the Murray-Darling Basin, covers four states. With four Labor governments in those states a great deal of cooperation is possible, but I believe it requires more of a national lead from this government. The environment ministry in coalition governments has, in my view, always been seen as a punishment post-a place for ministers the Prime Minister thinks are duds or ministers he wants to keep out of important portfolios. By contrast, Labor regards environment as one of the key portfolios-as the member for Maribyrnong would know-and has as shadow minister the honourable member for Wills, who is bursting with new ideas. The honourable member for Wills actually asked for the environmental portfolio, as the member for Maribyrnong, I am sure, will confirm. The member for Wills already has a comprehensive plan for saving the Murray-Darling river system which, if implemented, will go a long way towards safeguarding our future water supplies. The neglect of urban water issues by this government is less noticed than its refusal to ratify Kyoto, but its long-term consequences will be just as serious. The urban water research program of 1993-96 recommended three priority areas for research: urban development, environment and water resources, and the performance of water authorities. This recommendation was taken up by the Keating government but, under the Howard government, research in this area has largely dried up, like the rest of Australia. Labor will re-establish a national program of research into water reuse. As a city member representing urban water consumers, I want to stress that water conservation is an issue for all Australians, not just farmers. State and local governments, as well as household and corporate water users, all have a role to play in improving Australia’s water situation. I am very pleased with the initiative of some of my locals. The Port Melbourne Bowling Club, in installing Tift Dwarf river grass in its bowling green, has set a precedent for all bowling clubs throughout Melbourne and has been able to cut its water consumption bill from $2,000 to $900 a year. The importance of the bowling club using Tift Dwarf Murray River grass is that the experts said it could never be done, and now it can be installed on greens all over Melbourne. The cut in water usage would have a small but important effect. This is a national issue which requires vigorous national leadership. Instead, we have a government which is a prisoner of the energy, forestry and irrigation lobbies. It is time Australia had a government willing to show leadership.

The state election in Queensland has come and gone; there have been some winners and there have been some losers. The election has federal implications because there has been a six per cent swing to the Liberal Party in my area-which is terrific. However, it is sad to see the member for Burdekin, Steve Rodgers, lose his seat. I considered Steve to be a good friend and a decent fellow, but I congratulate Rosemary Menkens of the National Party on taking that seat. Rosemary too will be a fine member for the Burdekin. In relation to the seats of Townsville and Mundingburra, the sitting Labor members were returned, albeit with a much reduced majority. In the seat of Thuringowa, Craig Wallace for the Labor Party is a new member; I wish Craig well and I look forward to working with Craig for the good of Townsville and Thuringowa over the coming parliamentary term. I was disappointed, however, with the Beattie government, because the two key issues for Townsville-the issues that our city looks forward to in order to build the future of our citywere unfortunately not addressed. The first of those issues is the ocean terminal-the city gateway. The Beattie government studiously avoided any commitment to that ocean terminal, which will open up Townsville to the tourist industry. It will also help visiting Navy ships, and there will be huge economic benefits for the city of Townsville to have passengers coming in on a regular basis. What was particularly disappointing is that this was a no-cost project to the state government. Although it was backed strongly by State Development, for some reason or other it got stopped in the mechanism of government. It is such a pity to see important projects like this stalled. They should not be stalled; they should get on with it. The port authority, Townsville Enterprise, Townsville City Council and all of the community leaders want to see this happen. It is a no-cost option for the government, and I am just puzzled to know why they have not proceeded. It is the same with the port access road, which will bring untold new opportunities for the city in industrial development and jobs. For some reason or other, the Beattie government decided that they would not proceed with the first stage, which is the cross-river connection, the opening up of the port across the river to the Bruce Highway. That is unacceptable. We are a community that considers itself to be proactive-a community that looks ahead and looks for opportunities. Townsville and Thuringowa is a community where all of the community leaders work together, no matter what their political badges might be. We always have something on the horizon. We do not just complete a project and then say, ‘What are we going to do next?’ We have got this port access road which will bring significant new industrial development to the city, which will underline the importance of Townsville as Australia’s largest tropical city, and yet the Beattie government simply say, ‘It’s not on our agenda’. It is such a shame, because it can go on the agenda as a road of national importance, immediately attracting 50 per cent federal government assistance. We have had the port access roads done in Cairns, in Gladstone and in Brisbane, but we do not seem to be able to get the Beattie government to put it on the agenda for Townsville.

Foreign Affairs: Tonga tunity to join several other parliamentary colleagues in accompanying the foreign minister, Mr Downer, on a visit to Tonga. The new focus that the Australian government is giving to Pacific Island matters and the emphasis on good governance as a major priority of the Australian approach in the Pacific Islands community is very welcome. I will develop these themes somewhat later, when I have got more time. However, there was one particular aspect of the visit that I wanted to draw to the attention of the House, which relates to a letter that was presented to the foreign minister, signed by Prince Tu’ipelehake, who is a member of the Tongan parliament. I will read sections of the letter: I have the honour to seek Your Excellency’s assistance in advocating the Tongan people’s political plight to the leaders of the Tongan Government of whom you are scheduled to meet while you are visiting the country. We want a more democratic system within the current constitutional monarchy, whereby the monarchy is governed by the Constitution and the people have more say in their government. Basically, we want balanced representation in Parliament. Further on, the letter says: Unfortunately, Government is continuing to disregard the people’s will, particularly the need for transparency, accountability and good governance. The recent amendment of Article7 and the introduction of the Media Operators and Newspaper Acts are seen by most Tongans as an obstacle to their liberty; their right to write, speak and express themselves. In short, there is great sadness in the hearts of most Tongans, not only because the economy is deteriorating; their basic rights has been restricted but, also, the realisation that their government does not respect their will and aspirations. The letter concludes: Your Excellency, I am seeking your assistance in bringing up the need for political reforms to be addressed now, as the only platform for us to bring this matter to the fore is through Parliament. This however, is ineffective due to the imbalance in representation. I am certain that with encouragement from the Australian Government (and indeed Governments in the Commonwealth), through our Parliament the Tongan government may be persuaded to begin meaningful dialogue as a prologue to implementing the necessary political reforms. One of the things that is very significant about that letter to the foreign minister is that it is signed by the nephew of the king. This is a letter signed by Prince Tu’ipelehake. In the Age the following day Mark Forbes reported the response of significant figures in Tonga to the declining by the foreign minister to meet members of the Tongan parliament. The article says: Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has been attacked for refusing to meet Tonga’s most popular politician and leader of its democratic movement while paying court to a king who is censoring free speech and refusing to hand over power.

That is a view that I must echo. What is particularly alarming, however, in these circumstances is that, following the publicity that attached itself to the letter written by a member of the Tongan royal family to Mr Downer and Mr Downer’s refusal to meet these gentlemen, ABC Radio Australia news on 13 January carried the following story, titled ‘Tongan prince warned of treason charge’: A member of the royal house of Tonga has been told he could be charged with treason, for pressing for democratic reform in the country. Prince Uluvalu Tu’ipelehake, a member of the Tongan parliament and nephew of Tonga’s King, could face the charge over a letter he wrote to Australia’s Foreign Minister, Alexander Downerand I read sections of that letterThe Prince wrote asking for Australian help ... The following day ABC Radio Australia news carried story titled ‘Tongan prince “unlikely” to face treason charges’.

The Prince has been told that he could be charged with treason and slander after writing a letter to Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer, asking for help to bring more democracy to Tonga. Treason is a crime that brings a punishment of death by hanging in Tonga. These are indeed matters for concern. As I indicated, the broader engagement of Australia in the Pacific region is welcomed across the board in this parliament. The intervention in the Solomon Islands is supported across the board, as is the increasing attention to other countries; yet here we have a neighbour-Tonga-where there are clearly a number of important governance issues. New Zealand is in the process of having a parliamentary inquiry into its constitutional structures so that it can play a role in political development and political evolution in Tonga.

Firstly, it provides an accident and emergency service, and it is this accident and emergency service which is now, sadly, under threat for the first time in its existence. Over 80 per cent of the patients seen at the accident and emergency service are from off the island, so they are people who are visiting the island. Secondly, it provides an acute care bed facility-what you might think of as the traditional function of a hospital. Thirdly, it provides an aged care facility. That aged care facility currently has 30 beds, and ongoing funding for an additional 40 beds has been promised by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth contribution to the running of Warley Hospital’s activities is currently approximately $1.3 million per year, and this will rise by approximately $1.5 million to $2.8 million, so over a 10-year period you are looking at between $28 million and $30 million worth of Commonwealth contribution. It is a significant, real contribution to the work of Warley Hospital. However, there is a threat, as I mentioned earlier, to the accident and emergency service. The accident and emergency service of this community bush nursing hospital loses approximately $100,000 to $120,000 per year. In that situation the members of the board, the staff and the local residents, supporters and volunteers on Phillip Island have all called on the state government, and particularly the Premier, to guarantee that the state will make up that $100,000 gap. At present, as I say, the Commonwealth provides $1.3 million and an additional $1.5 million per annum will come on line to make a total of $2.8 million. By comparison, in this community non-profit bush nursing hospital the Victorian government provides less than $50,000 per year. It is being asked to provide an additional $100,000 to $120,000 per year to ensure that the accident and emergency service, which serves thousands of people from off the island every year, is allowed to stay open. The cost in human health and economics is enormously clear. If the accident and emergency service were closed, lives would be put at risk. In addition to that, the cost to the state of providing an alternative service would be significantly higher than is currently the case at Warley Hospital. In that situation it was extraordinarily insulting to hear the Premier dismiss Warley Hospital as a private hospital and therefore not his responsibility. There are private hospitals, and I accept that they are primarily not the responsibility of the state. But bush nursing hospitals, community owned and non-profit in nature, are fundamentally something with which the Victorian state government should be concerned. Interestingly, the previous government made significant contributions to all of the bush nursing hospitals. The Commonwealth, in addition to the aged care contribution, has recently provided $276,000 to Warley Hospital to update its surgical unit, which is a fundamental part of accident and emergency. So there is, contribution from the community and there is, over a 10-year period, a near $30 million contribution from the Commonwealth, but there is a contribution of barely $50,000 from the state. For that institution run by the people to be described by the Premier as a private institution and just dismissed is not good enough. That comment should be withdrawn and, above all else, the state should contribute the balance of the funding to help keep Warley open. (Time expired) McNaughtan, Dr Andrew activists and humanitarians, Dr Andrew McNaughtan, passed away in his home at Mosman in MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Adjournment
189,Mr Andren (Calare) (12.55 P.m.),"On Christmas Eve last, one of this country’s unsungSydney’s north, aged just 50. I am indebted to John Macgregor for much of the background for this tribute, from his article entitled ‘Heroic champion of the persecuted’ of 12 January. Andrew grew up in Sydney and, after school, did a trades course in welding and became a successful motorbike racer, a danger-defying hobby that perhaps foreshadowed his later activism. He studied medicine at the University of New South Wales but soon became involved in human rights issues that were to lead him first to Nicaragua and then, in the 1990s, to East Timor. In between he found time to travel to Washington to lobby a congressional committee and to expose the FBI frame-up of reformist Florida politician Joe Gersten, who had fled to Australia and befriended McNaughtan. It was in the East Timor struggle, however, that I came to know Andrew through his role as advocate for the East Timorese freedom movement and his involvement with the Parliamentarians for East Timor support group in this House. By his quiet and faultless research and advocacy throughout the 1990s he maintained a constant expose of the hypocrisy of the Western world, including Australia, around East Timor-a sad legacy of silence and appeasement of the Suharto regime that went back to the invasion of 1975. In more recent times, even after the bitterly won East Timor independence, Andrew maintained his tireless advocacy-this time exposing the neocolonial oil deals that the Australian government was trying to strike with East Timor over the Timor Sea reserves. It was Andrew McNaughtan who in late 1998 facilitated a meeting in Jakarta between a then imprisoned Xanana Gusmao and a senior BHP executive over the future of East Timor’s oil and gas deposits-a meeting well before the then President Habibie offered independence as an option in the disputed Indonesian province. It was Andrew McNaughtan who smuggled out of East Timor in October 1998 Indonesian military files which exposed to the world the fiction of Indonesia’s troop withdrawal and the direct link between the military and the murderous militias. As with the oil meeting between East Timor’s jailed president-in-waiting and the oilman, McNaughtan’s handiwork increased the pressure on Habibie to offer the independence referendum. Jose Ramos Horta, a close friend of Andrew, says that McNaughtan took immense risks in travelling to and from East Timor delivering support, and in particular cameras, to the resistance. He realised the crucial need for pictures to highlight the urgency of the East Timorese situation. Noam Chomsky says of McNaughtan: The work he did in East Timor ... was truly inspiring. It was a major contribution to the health and spirits of people suffering terribly, and to informing the rest of us on the realities of those awful events ... he was a person of great courage, honour and dedication. I last saw Andrew McNaughtan in November, when I spoke at a function in Sydney, and he later joined my group for dinner. We discussed his ongoing commitment to achieving a just and fair oil and gas deal in the Timor Gap for the infant independent East Timor-something for which he had lobbied hard late last year in the corridors of this parliament. Andrew funded his own work. He was as generous with his money and resources as he was in spirit. On 30 December a memorial for Andrew was held in Dili. It began at Santa Cruz cemetery and proceeded to Vila Harmonia, once the centre of the resistance. General Taur Matan Ruak, chief of staff of East Timor’s defence forces, told the mourners: No East Timorese leader can deny Andrew’s invaluable contribution to the liberation of East Timor. MAIN COMMITTEE The ones who didn’t have the honour of meeting Andrew lost a great opportunity to hear and see one of the finest souls in the history of liberation of this country. One prays that an East Timor prospering through a just access to its own resources and spared the agony of further spilt blood will be Andrew McNaughtan’s legacy. He deserves no less. Education: University of Newcastle for Dobell paraded around my electorate of Dobell recently, attempting to score cheap political points by falsely asserting that the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle is worse off under the Howard government. Their main argument was the fact that the Central Coast campus did not qualify for regional status under the new arrangements. The Central Coast campus is a growing campus situated in a fast-growing region. The campus is an excellent example of a modern university that provides excellence in teaching and learning and offers various pathways to its students. The campus contains a university, a TAFE and a community college, as well as several businesses, the area consultative committee, Business Central Coast, Business Incubator and Business Mentors. The Howard government is committed to expanding educational opportunities so that our work force will have school leavers who are ready for duties. In fact, the late John Pearce often used to say that the function of education was to teach students so that they could become practical members of the work force on leaving their education facility. The University of Newcastle as a whole will receive an additional $26½ million in core funding under Minister Nelson’s university reform package. The university is also set to benefit from an additional 3,292 places allocated to New South Wales in 2005. I am working with the federal member for Robertson to secure 365 of these places for the Central Coast campus. The deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Newcastle, Professor Brian English, has publicly said that receiving the extra 365 places for the Central Coast campus is far more important than receiving regional status and the one per cent loading which translated to about $1 million annually. Professor English was quoted as saying in the Central Coast Express Advocate on Thursday, 29 January: We were talking about 365 additional places funded at about $11,000 to $12,000 a place. Clearly we have a situation where ALP politicians are merely creating a scare campaign on regional funding to score cheap political points. States are currently preparing submissions regarding the allocation of new university places. Why isn’t the opposition leader pressuring his state Labor colleagues to ensure that the Central Coast campus gets its fair share of these additional places? I am very concerned that under a Latham Labor government our Central Coast campus would suffer adversely. Central Coast students are currently being hit hard by Mr Latham’s state Labor colleagues in Macquarie Street. Students enrolling in most Hunter Institute of TAFE courses in Ourimbah, Wyong and Gosford campuses are facing fee increases of between $169 and $1,000 a year. There is no HECS and no student loans but up-front payment for these courses. This is a big concern when one considers the fact that around 70 per cent of students choose TAFE over university. Why isn’t the opposition leader spending his energies fixing this problem that is hitting many young people in my region who need education the most? MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment
190,Mr Ticehurst (Dobell) (1.00 P.m.),The opposition leader and the Labor candidateQuite clearly the opposition leader needs to reassess his priorities for the Central Coast. The opposition leader needs to start pressuring his state Labor colleagues to support the allocation of university places to the Central Coast campus and to review the TAFE system charges funding. Diverting funding from TAFE to patch holes in public education is not the way to go. He should look at his own education policy which would leave Newcastle university about $6 million worse off.
