The fact with some interest out of that is the proposals that it is so has been acknowledged in Senate for base closures. Everywhere there has been estimates hearings. In those hearings the an argument about base closures, the minister Department of Defence people said the or the local member-who invariably is a government set about overcoming that probgovernment member-ends up saying, 'No, lem not by rearranging the money to fix the this base isn't going to close.'

Signature is the act whereby a State expresses its consent to the text of a treaty but not necessarily its consent to be bound by its provisions. Once a State has signed a treaty it is not obliged to ratify it. However, the Australian government's policy is not to sign a treaty without the intention to ratify it at a later date. Ratification is confirmation of signature and signifies the intention to be bound by the provisions of a treaty. Accession is a single act whereby a State expresses its consent to be bound, instead of signature followed by ratification. Accession is only used in the case of multilateral agreements, usually when the agreement has been previously signed by other States. Acceptance of a convention once it has been signed has the same effect at ratification. * NYIF Not yet in force # NYR Not yet ratified Table2 (2) (a) & (b) (3) (a) & (b) Date of (1) Date of Date of Entry International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions Entry into Ratification into Force in and Protocol Dealing with Maritime Matters Force by Australia Australia 7, Minimum Age (Sea), 1920 27.09.21 28.06.35 28.06.35 8, Unemployment Indemnity (Shipwreck), 1920 16.03.23 28.06.35 28.06.35 9, Placing of Seamen, 1920 23.11.21 03.08.25 03.08.25 15, Minimum Age (Trimmers and Stokers), 1921 20.11.22 28.06.35 28.06.35 16, Medical Examination of Young Persons (Sea), 20.11.22 28.06.35 28.06.35 1921 21, Inspection of Emigrants, 1926 29.12.27 18.04.31 18.04.31 22, Seamen's Articles of Agreement, 1926 04.04.28 01.04.35 01.04.35 23, Repatriation of Seamen, 1926 16.04.28 not ratified 27, Marking of Weight (Packages Transported By 09.03.32 09.03.31 09.03.32 Vessels), 1929 28, Protection Against Accidents (Dockers), 1929 01.04.32 not ratified (2) (a) & (b) (3) (a) & (b) Date of (1) Date of Date of Entry International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions Entry into Ratification into Force in and Protocol Dealing with Maritime Matters Force by Australia Australia 32, Protection Against Accidents (Dockers) (Revised), 30.10.34 not ratified 1932 53, Officers' Competency Certificates, 1936 29.03.39 not ratified 54, Holidays with Pay (Sea), 1936 N1F* not ratified 55, Shipowners' Liability (Sick and Injured Seamen), 29.10.39 not ratified 1936 56, Sickness Insurance (Sea), 1936 09.12.49 not ratified 57, Hours of Work and Manning (Sea), 1936 NIF* 24.09.38 58, Minimum Age (Sea)(Revised), 1936 11.04.39 11.06.92 11.06.93 68, Food and Catering (Ships' Crews), 1946 24.03.57 not ratified 69, Certification of Ships' Cooks, 1946 22.04.53 29.08.95 29.02.96 70, Social Security (Seafarers), 1946 NIF* not ratified 71, Seafarers' Pensions, 1946 10.10.62 not ratified 72, Paid Vacations (Seafarers), 1946 NIF* not ratified 73, Medical Examination (Seafarers), 1946 17.08.55 29.08.95 29.02.96 74, Certification of Able Seamen, 1946 14.07.51 not ratified 75, Accommodation of Crews, 1946 NIP not ratified 76, Wages, Hours of Work and Manning (Sea), 1946 NIF* 25.01.49 91, Paid Vacations (Seafarers)(Revised), 1949 14.09.67 not ratified 92, Accommodation of Crews (Revised), 1949 29.01.53 11.06.92 11.12.92 93, Wages, Hours of Work and Manning (Sea) (ReN1F* 03.03.54 vised), 1949 108, Seafarers' Identity Documents, 1958 19.02.61 not ratified 109, Wages, Hours of Work and Manning NIF* 15.06.72 (Sea)(Revised), 1958 112, Minimum Age (Fishermen), 1959 07.11.61 15.06.71 15.06.72 113, Medical Examination (Fishermen), 1959 07.11.61 not ratified 114, Fishermen's Articles of Agreement, 1959 07.11.61 not ratified 125, Fishermen's Competency Certificates, 1966 15.07.69 not ratified 126, Accommodation of Crews (Fishermen), 1966 06.11.68 not ratified 133, Accommodation of Crews (Supplementary Provi27.08.91 11.06.92 11.12.92 sions), 1970 134, Prevention of Accidents (Seafarers), 1970 17.02.73 not ratified 137, Dock Work, 1973 24.07.75 25.06.74 25.06.75 145, Continuity of Employment (Seafarers), 1976 03.05.79 not ratified 146, Seafarers' Annual Leave with Pay, 1976 13.06.79 not ratified 147, Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards), 1976 28.11.81 not ratified 152, Occupational Safety and Health (Dock Work), 05.12.81 not ratified 1979 163, Seafarers' Welfare, 1987 03.10.90 not ratified 164, Health Protection and Medical Care (Seafarers), 11.01.91 not ratified 1987 165, Social Security (Seafarers)(Revised), 1987 02.07.92 not ratified 166, Repatriation of Seafarers (Revised), 1987 03.07.91 29.08.95 29.08.96 178, Labour Inspection (Seafarers), 1996 NIF* not ratified 179, Recruitment and Placement of Seafarers, 1996 NIF* not ratified (2) (a) & (b) (3) (a) & (b) Date of (1) Date of Date of Entry International Labour Organisation (lLO) Conventions Entry into Ratification into Force in and Protocol Dealing with Maritime Matters Force by Australia Australia ISO, Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of NIF* not ratified Ships, 1996 * NIF Not in force, because the minimum number of ratit1cations has not been achieved.",112,Atsic Is Unable Therefore To Provide Details On The
