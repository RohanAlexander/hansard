The complaints made by representative!! of other States are as to the difference between the census figures and the number of electors on the Federal rolls; but in this case the discrepancy is between the State rolls recently compiled and the Federal rolls. In the electorate of South Perth, a district in which names of electors can easily be collected, there are 1,937 less electors upon the Federal rolls than upon the State rolls. I desire to ask the Minister for Home Affairsi f he has any information on the subject. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have not received tlie information to which the' honourable member refers, and I shall not be able to check the differences between the riewlyoompiled Federal rolls and the State rolls collected in Docember last, until I have the full details. I can, however, infonn the honourable member that the Federal rolls are complete, and show a total of 116,000 electors. Yesterday a telegram was sent to the Electoral Commissioner, giving hira the quota, and instructing him to proceed at once with the division of the State into electorates. the confusion that sometimes exists in the House, I really must direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that interjections across the chamber, and conversations having no reference to the subject upon which an honourable member is addressing the Chair, are distinctly disorderly, and that I shall have to take notice of them unless they are discontinued. whether the Prime Minister has yet received agreement have reached me. any information from theFostmaster-Gencral concerning telephone guarantees, regarding to move the second reading of. the B ill until which I asked him a question a day or two Tuesday. ago? ticulars desired by the honourable member to enable' honourable members to consider havo not yet been sent to me, but, as I the explanation given by the Prime stated before, I shall obtain them as soon Minister.

Sir EDMUNDBARTON formed that the papers were circulated several days ago. There is no correspondence to be laid upon the table apart from that contained in the Imperial Blue Book which was laid upon the table at the beginning of the session. suggest that the papers should be printed and circulated at once. circulated more than a week ago. honourable members should have an opportunity of considering the speech of the Prime Minister upon the second reading. I would remind him that he asked honourable members to suspend their judgment with regard to some aspects of the matter until they had heard his statement. I arn suspending my judgment accordingly, and I hope that we shall be allowed a few days, indeed, I should say a week, in which to consider the Prime Minister's speech ; because we really have not time during sitting days to read ahead of the work under consideration. The days upon which Parliament does not sit, when, according to some authorities, honourable members are supposed to be idle, are fully occupied in preparing for the legislative work which will engage their attention at a later stage. receive an assurance from the Prime Minister that the resolution before us is absolutely non-committal. I mention the matter, because I feel justified in protesting at every stage against the proposal to give the provisions of the naval agreement the force of law. to what has been said, I desire to point out that the papers relating to this matter were circulated not later than the 23rd June-som e nine days ago. 5 R cases will always arise in which honourable members do not receive their papers, and I know that it is the habit of many of us to occasionally forget some documents which may have been circulated amongst the great bulk of parliamentary papers. But the papers relating to the proposed naval agreement were circulated in the ordinary way. I would further point out that the proposed agreement has already been the subject of veiy full discussion out of doors. Not only have many honourable members particiI am inpated in that discussion, but I myself have done my best to give detailed explanations of its piovisions in public. Moreover, on the address in. reply, some honourable members debated the question in a cursory way, whilst others dealt with it much more fully. The matter, therefore, has been the subject of very thorough discussion. Indeed, if I may trespass on the recollection of honourable members, it has been debated quite as much as has any ordinary measure which has come before this Parliament. The second reading debate upon the Bill is not likely to be concluded in one night, and therefore those who wish to speak upon it after Tuesday will have ample opportunity of so doing. Seeing that the papers were laid upon the table on the 26th or the 27th May, and were circulated nine days ago-the Printing Committee having exercised its undoubted powers to order the printing of documents in their regular order-m y view is that we ought to proceed to debate the Bill, after I have moved its second reading upon Tuesday next. -anything beyond the agreement 1 nothing of importance in the Bill that is not contained in the agreement. asked us to suspend judgment until after he had made his second reading speech. did, but in doing so I was asking for the ordinary privilege which any Ministeri n charge of a Bill is entitled toclaim.

22,Sir Edmund Barton,"Certainly Iof the agreement have been thoroughly discussed, all I can do is to adduce arguments in addition to those which I have already pub forward. This resolution is simply the ordinary procedure which must be adopted in the case of a Bill involving expenditure. Such measures must be preceded by a resolution in Committee. When we emerge from Committee I propose to introduce the Bill, have it read a first time, and fix the second reading for Tuesday next. I am quite sure that there will be some honourable members who will be-ready to continue the discussion on that day, so that no time will be lost, whilst others who wish to speak upon a later date will be able to do so. Inasmuch as the motion relating to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill cannot be taken until Tuesday, and as that day can be occupied in debating this Bill, it is only fair that it should be so occupied, without prejudice to the rights of speech of any honourable member who may wish to address the House at a later stage. worth) I cannot agree with the principles laid down by my right honourable friend, who is so sound a constitutionalist. Indeed, I am surprised at his attitude. This matter is not constitutionally before the House until the responsible Minister has made his statement in regard to it . No matter what discussion has taken place in. the countrya discussion which occurred before many honourable members had the official documents in their hands-thi s House has an undoubted right, upon every important measure -which is submitted to it by a responsible Minister, to have a f u l l and comprehensive statement of its principles and its contents pub before it. I do not think that any honourable member should be forced to deliver himself upon this important subject on the night of the Prime Minister's statement. to force anybodv. my right honourable friend a very simple question. I asked whether, in view of the fact that he did not intend to make his statement at this stage of the proceedings, he would give honourable members an interval for consideration after he had moved the second reading of the Bill? In view of the immense importance of this subject, which is an Imperial one, and upon which our attitude will be' watched at the other end of the world, I think that the proper course to adopt would be for the Prime Minister, when moving the second reading of the Bill, to make as ample and complete a statement as possible, and then postpone its further consideration until another day. I confess that at first I was inclined to agree with the view entertained by the honourable member for Wentworth, but I understand from the Prime Minister that the Bill merely validates the agreement which has already been circulated amongst -honourable members. AlthoughI admit that it is usual upon an important measure to interpose an interval during which honourable members may consider the second-reading speech of the Minister, I would point out that we have all the necessary materials before us if the Bill merely proposes to validate the naval agreement;. In view of the Prime Minister's assurance, I do not bhink it is unreasonable for him to ask that the debate shall proceed upon Tuesday next. A further delay would be likely to inconvenience the Ministry. that the Prime Minister has given the very best reason why the debate upon the Bill which is the subject of this resolution should not be proceeded with on Tuesday after the right honourable gentleman has moved its second reading. He has just stated that the discussion of a matter of such importance cannot be finished in a single day. Therefore, honourable members should be allowed an interval in which to consider his speech. I would press upon him the importance of granting an adjournment of the debate for at least twenty-four or forty-eight hours. We cannot anticipate his remarks upon this subject. If he could make a statement now, and foreshadow the substance of his speech upon Tuesday next, we I do not propose should be in a slightly different position, > and might perhaps be disposed to assist him I asked in endeavouring to continue the discussion of the Bill upon that day. But, whilst Parliament is sitting, it is impossible to consider prospective legislation. Under this Bill we shall be asked to vote a subsidy of £200,000 for naval defence. I need scarcely point out that that sum may prove altogether inadequate for the purpose if a tariff war is to be entered upon by Great Britain at the behest of Mr Chamberlain and his party. If a fiscal fight is undertaken, it",14,Naval Agreement Bill

Therefore, it might be that honourable members would be prepared to vote for the expenditure of £2,000,000, or, perhaps, £S,000,000 or £10,000,000, to prepare us for the consequences tliat may result from a tariff war. I will continue my remarks when the standing order which provides that not more than one speaker shall simultaneously address the Chamber is observed. terruption. W ill fche honourable ancl learned member proceed? advertisements which direct attention to defective hearing. do with that matter. W ill the honourable and learned member proceed ? endure the inconvenience caused by the hum of conversation amongst honourable members, but I am not willing to submit to interruption by Minister's. I was pointing out that we might have to consider whether we would not be justified in voting a very much larger sum than is contemplated if an industrial struggle is to be entered upon, and that the serious consequences that might result from the war, which will inevitably follow that struggle,' ought to be taken into consideration by us. AVhen honourable members reflect upon those consequences they will see that we have every right to ask the Prime Minister to grant us a sufficient interval in which to carefully consider his speech. I support the request of the honourable meniber for Wentworth, and if it is not to be complied with, I hold that the Prime Minister should make his statement now. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I thoroughly understand that the proper time for honourable members to object to the discussion upon the Naval Agreement Bill being proceeded with is when the second reading motion is submitted. But I would point out that it might then be tbo late to adopt that attitude. If the Government insist upon proceeding with the second-reading debate of the Bill after the Prime Minister has delivered his speech, we cannot press the matter to a division, because, by so doing, we should be attempting to take the control of the business out of the hands of the Government. I strongly urge that, inasmuch as it . is 5 11 2 desirable to get' on with the business as quickly as possible, we might have the discussion on the second reading of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill after the speech of the .Prime Minister on Tuesday. leave on Tuesday to introduce that B ill ; we cannot take the second reading on the same day. MrM c DONALD I take it that with the permission of the House the ConI observed no inciliation and Arbitration Bill could be introduced to-day if necessary, and advanced another stage on Tuesday. There are many ways which could be adopted, if it is desired to get over the difficulty. It may be that the GovernI have nothing to ment are not prepared to proceed with the Bill, but it is a measure of great importance, on which there will, doubtless, be much discussion, and taking into consideration. the fact that the Prime Minister has already dealt with the matter to some extent, it would be uiifairto ask honourable members to continue the discussion immediately he has concluded his statement. Honourable members may be prepared with ordinary second-reading speeches, but not with replies to the particular remarks which tlie Prime Minister may make; the discussion ought to be adjourned for a day or two in order that the Bill may be given the fullest possible consideration. may make myself a little clearer by adding a few words. It. has been suggested in so many words that the Government wish to force honourable members into discussing the Bill. Nothing is further from the desire of the Government. Buti t is not right to lay down the principle that because the subject matter of a Bil l is of importance, there should in all cases be an adjournment of the discussion. An adjournment depends very much on the stage to which the discussion of the principle involved in any particular measure has been advanced. If discussion has reached an advanced stage-that is to say, if it has been general and public to a large extent-ther e is not the same reason for asking for an adjournment that there otherwise might be. Of course the Government cannot listen to any proposal' to take the conduct of business out of their hands, but I suggest that, without any forcing at all, those who are ready to continue the second",15,Naval Agreement Bill

It is a remarkable thing that because a man happens to be a inember of the military or naval forces of the Commonwealth, he can-not successfully prosecute in the law courts 'a claim against the Department in which he serves. Only three weeks ago in Sydney the leader of the Opposition, when appearing for a defendant, found that his client -could not maintain his rights upon a contract admitted by the Crown, because he was a soldier, and the contract had arisen in connection with his position as a soldier. Last night in speaking upon this matter, I referred from memory to the case of Gillespie v. The Queen, which was decided in the 'Supreme Court of Victoria in December, 1896. Ever since that time, I have been ""trying to obtain justice for the petitioner and a number of others interested with him, but without avail. I hope, however, that this Commonwealth Parliament, "" broad based upon the people's will,"" will see that justice is not denied to men in a particular service upon purely technical grounds. I brought the matter forward when the Claims Against the Commonthe Attorney-General then asked me to give him, in writing, a statement of the case I did so, and received, of course, a courteous acknowledgment of my letter, but nothing more. If the honourable and learned gentlemen, however, will not accept my amendment, I must ask the Committee to pass it in spite of him. I am unable to give the details of the recent Sydney case, but it is practically on all-fours with the Victorian case. The heading of the case in the Argus Law Reports, .vol. 2, contains the following:The petitioner, a soldier in the Victorian I propose to ask the Military Forces, accepted an offer, under a General Order,fcoresign on receipt of six months' ""salary."" Held that upon the wording of the offer, ""salary"" included the 3s. 3d. per diem "" pay"" to which the soldier was entitled under the regulations of 22nd June, 1S01, and also the 9d. per diem to which ho was, under such regulations, entitled "" in lieu of rations."" Bufc Held that agreements between Her Majesty and Her Military Forces in Victoria are not enforceable against Her Majest3% and that the petitioner was consequently not entitled to succeed in proceedings to recover the 9d. per diem in lieu of rations, which had been excluded in the computation of the six months' ""salary."" The ChiefJ ustice, after hearing the evidence which was taken during the trial,which lasted a couple of days, said that no doubt the bargain was made that the men concerned should receive 4s. per diem, and not 3s. 3d. He proceeded, however, to quote the rule in the case of Mitchell v. The Queen, which, he said, laid it down in language as general as could be thatNo engagement, past, present, or future, in respect to service as a soldier, by a soldier, with Her Majesty is enforceable against Her Majesty. Anything that Her Majesty appears to promise to a soldier is merely a matter of her bounty to f ive or withhold as she thinks fit. Her Majesty eing naturally disposed to do what is right, and to refrain scrupulously from doing what is wrong, the anticipation is that Her Majesty will keep her word, but she cannot be compelled to do so. Unfortunately for the men, Her Majesty's Ministers in Victoria were not disposed to do what was right, and they have got nothing. Last night the honourable and learned member for In d i stated in reference to this case that he had neverknown an",17,Judiciary Bill

I did not know of a case in which the Government had refused to ""recognise a judgment given against the Crown. of Victoria, when this case was decided, was the honourable and learned member himself, and he was present during the hearing. But, because of the severe economy then being practised, the claim was not allowed, and, although the Chief Justice had stated that the men were entitled to 4s. a day, they could not get their rights. regulations which prevented them from getting the money 1 said that in equity and at law the men were entitled to the 9d. a day extra which they claimed, but he saidEven if there were a consideration in the ordiproposed by the honourable and learned nary legal sense of the word, still the offer of acceptance would not constitute an agreement, which Her Majesty could be compelled to observe, for the simple reason' that Her Majesty is not compellable toobserve any contract between herself and her soldiers. He concluded his judgment with the remark thatThe agreement was that the petitioner wns to receive 4s. a day for the six months, but it cannot be enforced by him. There must, therefore, be judgment for Her Majesty. If eyer there was a case in which wrong was done under cover of law, this is such a case. Wrong has been dbne to these men, and justice has been denied them. I am sorry, in urging the claim of these men, that I am the representative of the constituency in which Queenscliff is situated, because it may be objected that my action is an interested one. I assure honourable members, however, that I am bringing the case before the Committee simply because I know the facts, and because I know how inequitably the men of our military forces are treated. I think, however, that I shall not appeal in vain to honourable members for justice, even though the Attorney General may not be willing to accept my amendment. point out that the honourable member cannot introduce this clause, as it is neither within the. title nor tlie order of leave of the Bill, intended to regulate the practice and procedure of the High Court. rights of parties. any suit to which the Commonwealth or a. State is a party, the rights of parties shall' as nearly as possible be the same; but that confers no new rights. The honorable member has shown by his arguments that he is proposing to confer a new right. It was owing to the force of the arguments, addressed to the Committee with referenceto PartV . of the Bill by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, that some doubt was. raised as to whether one or two of the clausescame within the scope of the measure, and partly for that reason, and partly because they can be more conveniently associated with provisions of the Judiciary Bill, they have been embodjed in that measure, which confers powers. A provision such as that, member for Corio might be inserted in the Defence Bill or perhaps in the Judiciary Bill, but it could not well be included within a Bill dealing solely with the machinery of the High Court. I therefore suggest to my honourable and learned friend that however great the merits of his proposal may be, and however marked the grievancewhich he seeks to redress, he must necessarily postpone his proposal. is still a part of the Bill, and I contend thatas it deals with the rights of parties, I am quite in order in proposing my amendment. been able to make up my mind, I feel very strongly disposed to agree with the honourable and learned member for Corio on themerits of the case he has submitted. I do not see any reason why a soldier should not have his rights conserved in the same way as other people, but I do not think that we can deal with the subject in this Bill. Therights of soldiers should be properly defined in the Defence Bill, and the honourable and learned member will have an opportunity of"" making his proposal when that measurecomes under consideration.

The amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member would really be an anomaly in a B ill relating to the procedure to be followed in the Federal High Court in respect to rights which exist independently. vision be inserted in the Judiciary Bill1 that would be a proper place, because that measure merely confers jurisdiction. the honourable and learned member for Corio would do well to withdraw the amendment, and endeavour to effect his object by inserting a provision in either the Judiciary B i ll or the Defence Bill. He would receive a large amount of support on principle, but there are some doubts'beyond those indicated by the honourable and learned member for In d i as to whether he could accomplish his object by means of the amendment. There is an important distinction between the Commonwealth and the Executive in regard to the military.

Sir"" EDMUND "" BART ON ( H u n t e r Minister for External Affairs) I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next. I understand that the operations of the Treasurer will be seriously inconvenienced if the Supply Bill is not finally passed today. That measure has not yet been fully dealt with by the other Chamber, if I may mention its sacred precincts, and it will be necessary, perhaps, for you, Sir, .to take the choir at a later stage, in order that the message may be received, and the authorization for the payments to which it refers may bo completed. Owing to the praiseworthy expedition with which matters have been dealt with this week, the business upon the notice-paper has been cleared off, and, therefore, I ask the House, at its rising, to consent to an adjournment until Tuesday.' I ' understand that there is no objection to that proposal. only business which will be proceeded with' to-day? honourable members who can make it convenient to remain, to do so, in order that there may be a quorum present to receive the Message relating to that measure from the other Chamber.
