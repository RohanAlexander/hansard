Because the manufacturers are anxious to obtain tariff adjustments that will enable them to keep their workmen fully employed, and are trying to keep the factories of Australia busy, it ill becomes the honourable member to reflect upon them in the way he has done. I hope the motion will be carried, and that the honourable member will be shown that many honourable members on both sides of the House bitterly resent his statement. motion. The honourable member for Angas surely overstepped the rules of propriety by his sweeping allegation against the representatives of manufacturers Is there anything evil in manufacturers, either directly or viewing members of Parliament or placing their views before them? In making representations to the Tariff Board, they inust go there as principals or send their agents. Is there anything improper in that? There is not, and there can be nothing improper in their visiting Canberra and making representations either to Ministers or to other honourable members. On Friday the honourable member for Angas cast an aspersion on reputable manufacturers.

Section 154 (1) (u) of the . act prescribes that all charges payable or ordinarily payable for placing the goods free on board at the port of export shall be included in the value for duty. The port of export of goods the produce of the United States of America shipped via Vancouver to Australia is the border town where the goods cross into Canada. The cost of conveying the goods to the border town only is includible in the value for duty whereas if the goods were shipped via' San Francisco tlie whole of the inland freight from the factory to San Francisco would be includible in the value for duty. The same position arises in regard to Canadian goods originating inland and shipped at New York or Montreal. For instance, if tlie goods are forwarded to New York for shipment, duty is paid on the cost of inland freight to the border town only, whilst if the goods are shipped at Montreal the whole cost of the inland freight to Montreal is included in the value for duty. ber the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) asked that a copy of tfte agreement made between the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited and the merchants trading in iron and steel, be laid upon the table of the House.

No t t ) asked the Minister for Health the following question':Giving evidence recently before the Royal Commission on the Constitution of the Commonwealth, Dr. Cumpston, the Commonwealth Director-General of Health, said that the inspection of imported food is not a function of the Health Department, and so far as that duty was performed it was carried out by the Customs Department. I desire to know what are tlie qualifications of the inspectors who are permitted to make examinations of food on behalf of the Customs Department? The position in regard to the examination of imported foods is as follows:The commerce (imports) regulations require imported foodstuffs to be marked with a ""trade description"" showing (inter alia) a true description of the goods. In addition the name of any preservative or deleterious On the 5th Decemsubstance contained in the article must be clearly shown in such trade description. These trade descriptions are inspected by the customs examining officers when making other customs inspections, and samples are from time to time submitted for examination to the Federal analyst or the customs analysts in the various States. The technical officers of the analyst's branches mentioned are all qualified analysts. Standards are fixed by the regulations mentioned for the following articles of food:-Baking powder, infant's food, pepper, and cocoa. Brisbane( MrD . Cameron) asked the following questions:1.

The decreased percentage of unfit for Citizen Force service for the years 1918 to 1924. both inclusive, was mainly caused by the reduction in the minimum height standard from 5 f t . 4 in.

When the bill was before another place the officers of the Taxation Department worked out a number of actual examples of incomes, when it was found that the amendment of clause 16 was drafted in such a way that a double deduction of losses from profits was in certain cases possible. As that was not the intention of the Government or the committee, this amendment has been made in another place to give effect to what is really intended. for the faulty drafting of the bill in the first place? drafted by the officers of the Taxation Department and of the Crown Law Department, and it was not until actual examples were fully worked out that it was found that the provision did not give effect to what the committee intended. As the amendment is somewhat complicated, I may state that it is to achieve the same result in regard to losses incurred prior to 1st July, 1926, as the proviso to sub-section 1 achieves in regard to losses incurred on or after 1st July, 1926, namely, to prevent the losses from being brought into account twice in ascertaining the average income by reference to which the rate of tax is to be calculated. As the provision stands there will be a double deduction, in ascertaining such average income for the purposes of assessments for the financial years 1927-28 to 1930-31, of so much of any loss incurred prior to 1st July, 1926, as is deductable under sub-section 2 of the new section in the assessments for those years. This position, which will be rectified by the amendment, did not become apparent until the new section had been applied, by way of test, to a number of specific cases. The explanation of the position is .as follows:-Section 13 (S) provides that the excess of allowable deductions over the assessable income of any year shall be taken into account in calculating the average income. If a taxpayer makes a business loss in a year in which he has no income from other sources the amount to be taken into account as the section 13 (S) excess for that year in calculating the average income of the next four years will be, leaving out of consideration the statutory exemption, the amount of that loss. Under sub-clause 2 of new section 26 as it stands, however, the amount of that loss will be carried forward as a deduction in ascertaining the taxable income of the next year, or of the next two, three or four years as the case may require. As deductions in ascertaining taxable income are also deductions in arriving at the average income, it follows that, unless the case is provided for, there will be two deductions in respect of one loss in arriving at the average income, namely, the deduction of the "" Section 13 (8) ""excess "" for the year of loss and the deduction consequential upon carrying forward that excess as an allowance from the taxable income of the succeeding year or years. The proviso to sub-section (1) of new section 26 was inserted to obviate this duplication of deductions, but as the new section is to apply for the first time in assessments of income derived in the year 1926-27, that proviso is limited to losses incurred after the 1st July, 1926, and hence is ineffective to prevent a double deduction of losses incurred prior to that date, some of which losses will, in certain circumstances, be carried forward under subsection (2) as deductions in ascertaining the taxable incomes of the years 1926-27, 1927-28, 1928-29, and 1929-30.",26,Second Beading

As the provision stands his average income for 1926-27 will be calculated as follows :S. 1926-26 1926-27 = 5,000 Net Total Average Income= NU » Nil. 2 Hence there is no rate to apply to the taxable income of £5,000. words, although the taxpayer's net income for the two years is .£5,000, he will entirely escape tax. Under the proposed amendment the average income would be calculated as follows:£ 1925-26 1920-27 10,000 Net Total Average income for 1926-27 =5,000 = £2,500. 2 A taxpayer would be assessed on £5,000 at the rate applicable to £2,500. It is not every loss incurred in the four years prior to tbe 1st July, 1926, that is deductible in assessments of income derived in the years 1926-27 to 1929-30, and where a deduction is allowable in those assessments in respect of any such loss, it. is not necessarily the whole of the loss that is deductible. amendment aims at the elimination from the ""Section 13(S) excess"" of the year of loss of that part only of the loss which is allowable as a deduction in those assessments.

The object of this amendment is to alter the method of controlling the Commonwealth Savings Bank business, but to maintain the separation of that branch from the central and general branch of the Commonwealth Bank. It enables the board of directors and governor of the bank to exercise all the powers and functions of the proposed commission and chief commissioner respectively u n t i l these are appointed, which may be an indefinite period. It also provides that all references in certain clauses of the Commonwealth HousingB ill to the chief commissioner or to the commission shall be read as references to the governor or the board as the case may be. I made a statement on this subject on the 16th November, when I said that the Government had that morning had an interview with the chairman, the governor and two other directors of the Commonwealth Bank, in regard to the Commonwealth housing scheme, and that they had represented that although I had freely consulted with them on the principles of this bill and the Commonwealth HousingB ill , they had not appreciated the exact intentions of the legislation as to the carrying out of the housing functions, and that on further consideration they were of the opinion that they could continue to administer the savings bank and in addition, the proposed housing scheme. It is due to the committee that I should explain how I came unwittingly to mislead it in some degree, and to show that I did so quite unintentionally. I think my explanation w ill indicate that it was natural that I should have assumed that the position was as I thought it to be. Had there been no changes in the office of secretary to the Treasury and governor of the Commonwealth Bank during the period when these negotiations were in progress the misunderstanding possibly would not During the discussion on bill I stated that immediately after the last election the Government sought the aid of the Commonwealth Bank directorate to formulate a housing scheme in fulfilment of its promise to the electors. placed before the directorate. Our object was to obtain the advice and assistance of the board in formulating a scheme. A f t e r considering the matter the board of directors of the bank resolved, during July, 1926That this board feels that to accept the responsibility of the administration of the Federal Government housing scheme as part of the functions of the savings bank department would be overweighting the work falling upon the institution; and further that such functions are in no way related to the general banking business or to that of a note issue bank or a reserve bank and the board is therefore of the opinion that, under the circumstances, it would be wiser to accept the proposal of the Government to separate the savings bank department from the bank for",28,Second Beading

It is better in the interests of the bank as a whole that the Government should take the necessary steps to bring about the separation proposed, and the board will l)o glad to assist and advise the Government to the best of its ability as to the method of effecting the changes necessary to carry this out. I read that resolution to the House in my reply in the debate on the second reading of the bill. The Government accepted it as an expression of the desire of the boarda desire which it still has-to separate the savings bank from the other branches of the bank so that the savings bank could administer the housing scheme independently. The Government had occasion during the preparation of both the Commonwealth Housing Bill and the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill to discuss the principles of both measures with the directors of the bank. The negotiations were mostly conducted It was and still is the desire of the Government to interfere as little as possible with State housing activities. In December, 1926, nearly six months after the bank carried the resolution which I have rend, we discussed our housing scheme with the Victorian Savings Bank Commissioners. At that discussion suggestions were made that there were possibilities along the following lines:Power to be given to the director? to 'invest vernment proposed. the funds of the Bank, inter alia, in advancing money for buying and building homes, and for discharging mortgages on existing homes, and for the erection of warehouses intended for the warehousing of primary products. Power to be given to the directors to enter into any arrangements with any bank, or corporation, or authority established under the laws of a State, for carrying out the business of the savings bank in respect of advances for homes and warehouses. In the discussions that took place we would control the savings bank, and various suggestions in that regard were put forward, and ultimately incorporated in the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill, which was then drafted. In JulyI took the bill, as drafted, to Sydney, and placed it before' executive omcers of the bank for their consideration. I think it was the deputy-governor who examined it, and I take it that he discussed the matter with the governor. Later, in Dr. Earle Page. September, an arrangement was made whereby while I was in SydneyI was able to discxiss with the Commissioner of the State Savings Bank of New South Wales the actual 'method of operation now proposed in the Housing Bill for the investment of funds. Arrangements for that discussion were made by the Governor qf the Commonwealth Bank, and one of the directors of the bank was present at the discussion. to the drafting of the bill? the bill had been prepared in its present form. I want to make it clear that when the Savings Bank Bill was before the officers of the Commonwealth Bank for their perusal, the Housing Bill had not been drafted, but was in course of preparation. The discussion with the New South Wales State Savings Bank personally. authorities took place after the Housing Bill had been drafted. As no representations had been made by the directors of the Commonwealth Bank in reference to the control of the Savings Bank, and as tbe Secretary to tbe Treasury, who had a considerable share in the drafting of the Savings* Bank Bill, was also a member of the Commonwealth Bank Board, I took it for granted that the executive omcers of the board were thoroughly seized of the position, and satisfied with what the GoI was still under that impression when I moved the second reading of the bill. It was not until after the board had perused the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill and its complementary measure, the Housing Bill, and had considered the debates that took place here, that the chairman of the board intimated to the Prime Minister that he would like to discuss the matter with the Governdiscussed the personnel that ment. He. then stated that, although the board still approved of the separation of the savings bank, as it had always done, it thought that, under the special arrangements by which practically the whole of the administration of the detail work of housing was to be carried out by the State authorities, it would be able to deal successfully with the administration and control of the savings bank, and consequently it was willing to accept that responsibility.

But what is really brought about by the present amendment is best set out in a report of the National Bank of Australasia, which appears in a circular issued during the time the Commonwealth Bank Savings BankB ill was under discussion in this House. This report saysThe present proposals provide that the savings bank business now attached to the bank should be kept distinct aud separate from the other departments of the bank, and be managed by a commission, which is to include otic member of the bank board, thus maintaining co-operation with the general banking department. It does seem desirable that the two main sections of the bank's business should be operated separately, but the question arises whether this could not be done by setting up different managements under the control of the bank's board, which could, if necessary, be strengthened by the appointment of additional members. That is what is being done, and what has now been suggested by the Commonwealth Bank Board of Directors. The amendment, now before honourable members provides that the Bank Board shall retain control of the savings bank.' should have unwittingly misled honourable members in the slightest degree as to the board's intentions. mains unchanged in so f a r as it relates to the separation of the savings batik from the main bank, but as regards the savings bank branch the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank is willin g to administer it as in the past. The Government is falling into line with that suggestion. The amendment to which we are asked to would be incurred, but when the board of agree w ill come as a surprise to honordirectors had had the privilege of reading able members who recollect how much, the debate that took place here they began time was taken up here in discussing to realize that they had been placed in a whether the savings bank should be separated from the Commonwealth Bank. The Treasurer stated that that was really the only point i u the bill. reasons for having a separate control of honourable the savings bauk. discussion on the point occupied a couple of sittings. Honourable members of the Opposition advocated no interference with the Commonwealth Bank as it is at present constituted. We thought that it was quite unnecessary to have a separate savings bank, in view of the fact that none of the detail work in connection' with housing would f a l l on those in control of the savings bank. We realized that the operations of the savings bank would be confined to the lending of money to various authorities in the States who would be charged with the responsibility of carrying out the work of housing, and in consequence of this we vigorously opposed the Commonwealth Bank Savings BankB ill . Recent events have justified our attitude. The bill had scarcely left this House when we saw a change in the attitude of the Government, and before the measure reached another place the Government had climbed down. In order to justify the attitude taken up by honourable members of the Opposition, I shall briefly recall some of the statements made during the discussion of the bill in this chamber. Speaking on the second reading of the bill, the Treasurer saidThe board advised that its operations would probably be overburdened if it were loaded with the housing scheme. It represented to I regret that I the Government that, as it was the custodian of about £140,000,000 worth of assets, it could not very well give its attention to this proposed new phase of the Government's activiTheb ill reties, and suggested that some other means should be adopted. These overtures took place in July of last year, and then the board passed the following resolution, which I should like to read for the information of honourable members :That is' the resolution which the Treasurer has just read. The board said that it could not accept the responsibility for the administration of a Savings Bank Act because of the great additional work that",30,Commonwealth Bank

110,Mr Charlton,"Yes. I think the very difficult position. They began to think that the public would not expect men capable of administering a Commonwealth Bank to ask the Commonwealth Treasurer to relieve them of the responsibilit y of advancing money to other authorities to build homes for their clients. Finding themselves i u. a false position, they stated their objection direct to the Prime Minister. If the Treasurer was correct when he said that this bill was submitted to the directors in July, 1926, what has been responsible for their change of attitude? To my mind, it is obvious that they had no knowledge of the responsibilities that would be placed'upon them by this measure; they were under the impression that they would be required to carry out all the details of a genuine house construction policy, and they came to the conclusion that that was too great a responsibility; but when the debate in Parliament disclosed that the bank would merely be asked to finance building operations by tbe State authorities, they rea-"" lized that they had been misinformed. Honourable members on this side of the chamber believe that an injustice was , done to the bank directors by the Treasurer. We could not conceive that men of their high qualifications would take up such an attitude towards the housing scheme and the Commonwealth Bank unless they were under a misapprehension. In order to clarify the matter, the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) moved that the bill be referred to a select committee to ascertain the views of the directors of the bank on the proposals contained in the measure. The Treasurer strenuously urged the rejection of the amendment, and said that the one principle which the bill contained was the separation of the savings bank administration from that of the Commonwealth Bank. Many honourable members, including some on the ministerial side, were not convinced that that policy was r i g h t ; but, influenced by the Treasurer's statement that the bill was in accord with the views expressed by the directors, they loyally supported him. was speaking on the 26th October, the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) asked this questionWill the Treasurer answer the question raised by the honourable member for Dalley, Mr Charlton. who asked what housing scheme was suggested to the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank? same as that which the House recently discussed. The scheme has been modified in a minor way as the result of discussions with the savings bank commissioners in tlie States; but in principle it remains the same. Subsequent developments conclusively showed that had the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dalley been adopted, much time and trouble would have been saved. In fact, there would have been no need for the bill now before the committee; all that would have been required was authority for the Commonwealth Bank directors to advance money to the State home-building authorities. Either because the directors felt that tlieir good name was at stake, or for some other reason, they took a very firm stand against the Treasurer. I quote the Daily Guardian of the 17th NovemberBACK DOWN BY PAGE ! No Divided Control. Canberra, Wednesday -Afte r forcing a bill through the Kepresentatives, to divide the Commonwealth Bank control, Federal Treasurer Page has somersaulted in an amazing way. Friction, which has existed for eighteen months between the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank and Federal Treasurer Page culminated in an open clash to-day. The bank directors won. They have humiliated the Treasurer politically, forced the Government to reverse its policy on the Commonwealth Bank and Housing Bills, and have caused murmurings against the Treasurer among the rank and file of Federal Nationalists. In an eleven days' debate on these measures, all Government supporters, prompted by Dr. Page, urged that the only business like proposal was to separate the savings bank from the general bank, and place the two branches under separate control by creating. commissioners to administer the savings branch and ration the £20,000,000 to tlie States for the housing scheme. Labour argued that divided control was impracticable. Directors' Ultimatum. To-day Mr E. C. Riddle, Sir Robert Gibson and two other directors of the bank visited While the Treasurer Canberra, and in an interview told the Treasurer they would not tolerate divided control of the bank. Dr. Page capitulated.

It is known, however, that for months the bank directors disapproved and resisted the Commonwealth's banks' field of building homes for the people. The directors deny that their attitude has changed in the matter, and retort that Dr. Page brought down legislation that differed from the drafts he submitted to them. Apparently the directors have declared that the d r a f t measure submitted to them was not the b ill introduced into this House. ""When they asked to be relieved of all responsibility in connection with the housing scheme, they were under the i m pression that very heavy obligations were involved. Later they learnt the actual nature of the Government's proposals, and, as the result of an urgent conference with the Prime Minister and Treasurer, an amendment was made in another place. On the 17th I NovemberI asked this question of the TreasurerHas the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to a paragraph in the Daily Guardian of to-day to the effect that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank deny that their attitude to the Commonwealth Bank Savings BankB ill has changed, and assert that the Treasurer introduced legislation that differed from the d r a f t submitted to them? W ill the Ministers and departments; the GovernTreasurer inform the House whether that statement is correct? Dr. T3ARLE PAGE-On Monday the Prime Minister in the course of a telephone conversation with Sir Robert Gibson, Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, ascertained that apparently there was a slight misunderstanding between the board and the Government in regard to the Savings BankB i l i . A t the request of the Prime Minister the chairman and other directors came to Canberra yesterday, and conferred with the Government. They expressed agreement with the bill, which is now, before another place, but said that in view of the contents of that measure and the HousingB ill the board would like the opportunity to administer the housing scheme. An amendment to permit that to be done has been introduced in another place. The inference to be drawn fro m that statement by the Treasurer is tiiat when they found that the housi .ng scheme would merely involve the advancing of money by the savings branch of the Commonwealth Bank, the directors expressed their willingness and desire to control those operations. The amendment made by the Government in another place was They apof proposed new section 3 5 F : Provided that, until the appointment of the commission(a) the savings bank shall be managed incursion into the State by the board of the bank; and (6) for the purposes of this part, and of the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927, the Governor shali have all the powers and functions of the Chief Commissioner, and the board shall have all tlie powers and functions of the commission; and (c) all references in this part (excepting in sections 35F to 35N inclusive) and the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927 to the Chief Commissioner or to the commission shall be read as references to the Governor or the board as the case may be. It is obvious that the Government has adopted this method to get itself out of a difficult position. The Treasurer has said that this is merely a suspension of the proposals for the appointment of a separate board to manage the savings bank. But does any honourable member believe that any Government would, in the near future, propose the creation of a second board? Such a proposal would be resented from one end of Austialia to the other. Already there are too many boards, committees, and commissions doing the work that should be done by ment appoints these bodies at the average rate of one a week, and no fresh appointment of the kind would meet with the approval of the press or the public.

It should have candidly admitted that a mistake had been made, and that the One directors of the bank had never favoured the separation of the Savings Bank department. Instead of adopting that honourable course, the Government leaves the matter in suspense so that at any time it chooses it may appoint a separate board without seeking parliamentary sanction. The bill should never have been introduced. Owing to the action of the Government much valuable time, during the last week of the session, will be occupied in the consideration of this amendment, when urgent business awaits our attention.

When the Treasurer was questioned as to the nature of the scheme placed before the board, he replied thit it was practically the same as that embodied in the housing bill. That answer is to be found in Hansard. tells us that the housing bill was. never placed before the board, and that the only measure submitted to it was the banking bill. But the board carried its resolution with respect to the housing scheme, and the Treasurer said that it was practically the same proposal as that embodied in the housing bill, with some modifications. How could there be any modification of a scheme that had not surer said that a verbal discussion took place between the chairman and members of the board of directors, and on that they framed their resolution; but we were told previously that the scheme put before them was practically the same as that embodied in the housing bill. The ing bills, he took it that the mind of the board on the latter measure was the same as on a scheme previously alleged to have been placed before it. When the motion was before us for the appointment of a select committee, the Attorney-General remarked that the only principle involved in the banking bill was the matter of separate control. The point, he said, had been already decided by the House. What more was there to inquire into? Yet, we find that that one principle is not accepted by the board. Under this amendment the Government does not withdraw its proposal, so far as the separation of the savings bank department is concerned, but The honourable member for it will be like Mahomet's coffin, suspended in mid-air. The Treasurer gave the Opposition no credit for sincerity or a desire to ascertain the facts. He took up the attitude that we wished to delay the coming into operation of the housing scheme. We answered his objection by pointing out that a select committee could make the necessary inquiries from the board, and a report could be furnished to Parliament during the following week.

That, according to the interpretation of the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) was the only principle involved.

The Treasurer told us that he had discussed the proposal with members of the board in relation to the housing scheme.

The honourable member for Eden-Monaro declared' at the time that the attitude of the board had been wrongly stated by honourable members on this side, and suggested that 'in the absence of any comments by the board, we should accept the Treasurer's statement.

Actually he is doing everything possible, short of repealing it, to render this recent legislation nugatory. The principle complained of is to be suspended indefinitely. It would have been better if the Government had backed down in a frank and honourable way. The original proposal to separate the savings bank branch from the general business of the bank was strongly condemned by honourable members on this side, because the savings bank business may be regarded as the financial heart of the institution. If the proposal had been carried out, the liquid assets of the bank would have been seriously interfered with. The Government's proposal would have meant the appointment of additional commissioners to administer the housing scheme. This, of course, is not necessary since the only additional duties required of the board will be the raising of £20,000,000 for housing purposes and handing it over to other authorities which will be responsible for any actual work done under the scheme. The general opinion outside is that enough commissions and boards have been appointed already, and that the Government would be hard put to it to find any more' of its friends in search of appointments such as these. On this occasion the Senate has been used to correct a stupid mistake made by the Government in relation to the internal administration of the Commonwealth Bank. The manner in which the Treasurer misled honourable members is highly descreditable. I am satisfied that, had the proposal to separate the [110] savingsbank branch from the general business of the bank been considered outside of party lines it would have been defeated. The Senate has sent the bill back with an amendment and the Government has been placed in a very humiliating position. It is unfair to expect members to be in a position to consider fully intricate legislative measures such as have come before us lately in sessions lasting from 11 o'clock in the morning to 11 o'clock at night and sometimes later. is apparent that many honourable members did not understand the main principle of this bill. This Government, before introducing the bill, should have given more consideration to the proposal to separate the savings bank from the main Commonwealth Bank. It should have sought the advice of financial experts, especially the directors of the Commonwealth Bank. It was certainly unwise to introduce it before consulting those who were to be directly affected by the change. When the bill was passed honourable members had been given to understand by the Government that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank were agreeable to the change, but it has since transpired that they were not consulted by the Government, and have serious objections to the separation of the savings bank. As a result the Government has used its influence in another chamber to amend the bill as passed in this chamber, so that the Savings bank may be carried on as at present, but with a possibility of the separation taking place later. When that takes place it will mean the destruction of the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, and that is the ultimate object of this Government, so that private banking institutions may benefit. If any amendment is moved to prevent the savings bank from being separated from the main bank, I shall certainly cast my vote in favour"" of it. This country is carrying a heavy burden of debt, and although we are facing a serious financial crisis, the Government is still indulging in reckless expenditure. There are already eight directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and yet this Government proposes to appoint a commission consisting of three gentlemen, including a bank director, to control the operations",36,Amazing Change In Bank Polios
128,Mr West (East Sydney) [4.59],"of the savings bank The Senate should not be able to interfere with financial legislation. The House of Eepresentatives represents the people, while the Senate represents the States, and its principal duty is to safeguard their sovereign rights. The Government has been guilty of political dishonesty in bringing influence to bear upon its members in the Senate to amend the bill. The separation of the savings bank will certainly undermine the stability of the Commonwealth Bank. It is proposed to spend £20,000,000 on housing and to place a commission in control of the scheme. In five years we expended £10,000,000 in settling returned soldiers on the land, and there is little prospect of a return. This Government is more and more placing the control of finance in the hands of outside and semi-oflicial bodies, and I maintain that this Parliament should shoulder its financial responsibilities, ancl that all expenditure should be subject to the searching in quiry of the Commonwealth Auditor General. I enter my emphatic protest against the separation of the Commonwealth Savings Bank from the main bank, but I fear that it will have little effect, since the Government has a majority, and will therefore force this amendment through the committee. Senate's amendment is accepted by the committee the bill will be left in an unsatisfactory condition. As originally drafted it provided for the separation of the savings bank from the main bank, and was eventually carried in this chamber on the understanding that the directors of jthe bank were in favour of the change. It has since transpired that that apparently is not the case, and the Government has now given an assurance that it does not intend t.o insist at present book legislation which we think is unsatison that portion of the bill that provides for this change. If the amendment is accepted the separation will not take place until the commission is appointed. It has been suggested, meanwhile, that the commission will not be appointed, so that the separation will not take place. It would be very unsatisfactory to place such a bill on the statute-book, and it is unfair to ask honourable members to vote for it. member intend to vote against it? the information given to honourable members. It is not necessarily a sin to vote against the Government virtue. placed on the statute-book in the form now proposed, we have, the assurance of the Government that it will not be given effect. I am quite prepared to accept that assurance; but we must remember tliat this Government will not always be in po.wer. It will be possible for a future Government to appoint the commission and bring the act into force. If it is the opinion of honourable members that the savings bank should not be separated from the main bank, then the Government should make it impossible for that to be done. The Treasurer has now implied that the separation is undesirable. does not consider the separation necessary for the carrying out of the housing scheme. no guarantee that it would not make the change at some later date. admitted that, in connection with this bill, the savings bank should not be separated from the main bank, but the change may take place at some future date by an order in council for the appointment of the commission. Honourable members have been placed in a peculiar position. If we vote against the amendment, what action will the Government take? Will it give effect to the bill as it now stands, or withdraw it? If we vote for the amendment, we place upon the statutefactory. It would be preferable to withdraw from the bill altogether the provisions relating to the separation of the savings bank.

As the honourable'member knows, I am opposed to the housingscheme, and therefore I should not worry if the bill were withdrawn altogether. ing at the matter from that point of view, however. The House as a whole has approved of the housing Scheme, but it has objected to the separation of the functions of the bank. The Government has now agreed that such a separation shall not take place, but this amendment still leaves it open to a future Government to have a commission appointed, ancl to bring about the very state .of affairs to which we now object. The point raised by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) is important, but is not fatal to the argument that the bill should be dropped. honourable member for Batman raised the question whether the Housing Bill makes f u ll provision for the creation of a fund from which the housing scheme is to be financed. The position is set out clearly in clause 7, and the succeeding clauses. makes provision for the creation of a fund, and states how the fund will be administered. conditions of advances, and clause 10 provides power for the commission to borrow money up to £20,000,000 to advance to the building authorities. The Housing Bill would not be affected if the Commonwealth Savings Bank Bil l were withdrawn entirely. It might be necessary to make certain amendments to the Housing Bill. tions incorporated by reference? ence to the commission. As the Housing Bill has not yet become law, and is still before the Senate, it would be quite easy to make those relevant alterations there. The Savings Bank Billj as we have it now with the proposed amendment, consists of ten clauses and the schedule. The essential provision is clause 8, which supplements section 35 of the present Commonwealth Bank Act by incorporating new sections numbered from 35A down to 35w. That is the clause which provides the machinery for the creation of the comI do not say that the mission. As it is no longer proposed to set up such a commission, there is no longer any need for such machinery. I ask the Treasurer to point out what there is in the Commonwealth Savings BankI am not -lookBill which will be necessary when the housing scheme is administered by the present Commonwealth Bank authorities. It is true that there are somewhat extended powers granted in relation to the investment of funds. Reference to these powers is contained in the new sub-section 35w Tyhich provides that the savings bank may invest money held by it in certain classes of advances and investments specifically set out. . It cannot be contended that the Government or the Commonwealth Bank directorate has not power at the present time to do all that was contemplated in that clause, or uncier the bill as amended by the Senate. The bill does not confer any additional authoThe ity; in one instance it restricts the authority now held. It does not confer any more power; it does not facilitate the making of advances for house building. It does nothing but save the face of the Treasurer. The most logical thing to do would be to withClause7 draw the bill altogether, and if the Treasurer were frank he would admit it. He has already admitted that the statements Clause8 relates to the which he made when the bill was introduced regarding the attitude of the directors did not convey the actual position 4",38,Amazing Change In Bank Polios

During the second-reading stage of the bill he was very definite on that point. In reply to the question whether the bank authorities agreed to the alteration, he said:-""I have given the House definite information regarding the actual position."" Well, this afternoon, he disclosed that he had not given the House such definite information as revealed the actual position. We now know that the Commonwealth Bank authorities did not agree to the proposals, and the present serted in the Senate to meet their objection. The amendment we are now considering vitiates the whole of the bill, and renders it unnecessary. The Government should drop the bill altogether, and if it thinks some alteration to the Commonwealth Bank Act is necessary in order fully to effectuate the housing scheme, it can be made by means of a simple amendment. Treasurer back over this bill which it is supposed to modify here. Clause6 provides for the making of a combined statement of accounts by the two branches of the bank; but there will be no need for that now, as the statement as at present issued will meet the situation. Clause8 is really the essence of the bill, and proauthorities, it is clear that there is no vides for the setting up of a commission. That is no longer necessary if the Government and bank directors are to administer the affairs of the Savings Bank. There is no need -for a new name for an institution now in operation. There is no need for the setting up of a commission nor any need to make reference to the agreement between the Commonwealth Bank and the States, because they will have their full effect as at the time when they were made; there will be no alteration. There is no need to make provision for a deputy commissioner, or for the behaviour of commissioners, or for declarations of fidelity and secrecy, or for any of those machinery matters. There is no need, in my opinion, to provide for any different way of dealing with the profits of the Savings Bank, or the investment of funds; but. if there is, it can be done more appropriately by means of a separate amendment to the Mr Theodore. Commonwealth Bank Act. I urge the approved of the proposed Treasurer to reject the amendment, and enable the bill to be laid aside. If necessary, he can introduce a small amending bill to the Commonwealth Bank Act. The position has been fully traversed this afternoon, and the situation more frankly faced by the Treasurer and the comcommitiee than when the bill was previously before the House. I hope the Treasurer will act on the new experience that has been gained. posed this bill when it was introduced beamendment has been incause I did not see any need for it. I thought it was something quite beyond the provisions of our Constitution. The sooner we learn to mind our own business the better. However, we have passed the Housing Bill, and now we have this amendment dealing with the proposed appointment of a commission, and embodying the suggestion of the Government to allow the present directors to Let me take the control the operations of the savings bank. As honourable members have pointed out, we have left the door wide open ""for another Ministry, or for this Ministry at a later date, to appoint a commission. As the function of the savings bank under this bill will be merely to lend money in large sums to the State or local need for taking that power away from the board of directors. I do not want to destroy the bill, because the majority of this committee desires that it should become law, and that facilities should be provided for furnishing the money, but I do not think that the door should be left open for the appointment of a commission while the operations of the bank remain as at present. The responsibility would be there, of course, but not to the same extent as if the commission were actually charged with the building of the homes. In the circumstances, I think it ought to be made clear that there should be no interference by this or any other Ministry in the control of the savings bank. To that end I move the following amendment :That after the word "" commission"" first occurring the following words he inserted:""which shall only be appointed upon a resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament approving such appointment.""",39,Amazing Change In Bank Polios
147,Mr Gregory (Swan) [5.36],"I opI f there is a desire later to appoint commissioners, a joint resolution passed by ""the Houses of Parliament should confirm the alteration.

' surer) [5.35] I Avish to reply to some of the arguments used this afternoon, especially as some are based on wrong premises. I pointed out earlier that the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank still recommends a separation of the Commonwealth Savings Bank from the central bank. prepared to control the section of the savings bank if it merely provides funds for a housing scheme of the nature proposed. I wish that to be clearly understood, because it has been suggested quite recently that a separation was only suggested because of the necessity of controlling a housing scheme. The original resolution of the board on this point reads-. . . . that such functions are in no cannot deal with housing in a general way way related to the general banking business until regulations have been framed, and or to that of a note issue bank or a reserve approved by the Treasurer. bank, and the board is, therefore, of the opinion that, uncier the circumstances, it would be wiser to accept tlie proposal of the Governdifficulty about that. ment to separate the savings, bank department from the bank for the purpose of enabling the bill a definite instruction to the Bank in carrying out of the housing scheme. . . . regard to advances for housing is Subsequently I read a statement by Sir ErnestfHarvey in regard to the Commonwealth Savings Bank's association with the central bank, and its recognition by other central banks, in which he said it was of advantage from a central banking point of view for the two institutions to be separated as is proposed. of the Housing Bill, which has already been passed by both branches of the legislature, readsThis act shall be incorporated and read as one with the Commonwealth Bank Act 1911-27. The effect of the Housing Bill is to limit the power of the Commonwealth Savings Bank to lend money for housing purposes, so if the Commonwealth Savings Bank Bil l were destroyed-to use the words of some honourable members-ther e would be no act to which the Housing Bill would apply. If the Commonwealth Bank Act were amended, as suggested by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), a position which the Commonwealth Bank directors said they could not work under would arise, as the Commonwealth Savings Bank could then deal directly with details of housing schemes. Apart from the appointment of a commission this bill does other things. Clause8 provides for the status of the Commonwealth Savings Bank to be altered. In proposed section 35w, the manner in which the Commonwealth Savings Bank may invest money is stated. It specifically sets out;35w (1). The Savings Bank may invest, any moneys held by it (a) in any Government security approved They are, however, by the Treasurer; (&) on loan on tlie security of land; (c) in advancing money, in accordance with the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927, for the purchase or erection of dwelling-houses, and for the discharge of mortgages on dwelling-houses; wealth Bank do that? definite limitation.

The principle underlying the whole bill is the separation of the savings bank from the Commonwealth Bank. It is true that one of its clauses seems to give the bank addistatute. The bill is not a statute, and tional power to make advances for rural purposes, and to provide certain other powers concerning the nature of the investments which may be made.

Only to-day a measure relating to war service homes, founded on a message, was introduced and carried to the second reading stage, aud could have been passed within an hour if necessary. An amending Commonwealth Bank Bill, enabling the Government to carry out-its policy, which is now embodied in the housing bill, could be handled in the same way and would not meet with any opposition. I do not know why the Government should be so obstinate as to persist with this bill, which consists of ten unnecessary clauses, unless it is merely trying to save its face. It seems that no good purpose can be served by so doing.

It could then be claimed that at least the bill was intelligently drafted. ter and Minister for External Affairs) ![5.57] A certain amount of confusion has arisen in the committee. The separation of the savings bank branch from the general or central bank involves two major principles, one of which has regard to the housing proposals of the Government, and the other to the functioning of the institution as a true central or reserve bank. The housing policy of the Government was announced at the last election and almost immediately after it was endorsed by the people the Government took up with ""-the Commonwealth Bank directors the formulating of a scheme. The Treasurer has pointed out that the directors definitely declared that they did not desire to be associated with a Government housing policy on the ground that it was not one of the functions of a central or reserve bank, although conceivably it might be a function of a savings bank. After the discussions had taken place the bank directors adopted a resolution, with the.terms of which honourable members are acquainted, to the effect that a satisfactory method of conducting a Commonwealth housing scheme would be to place it under the conbranches shall be kept separate, and it is trol of the savings bank and to separate that branch of the bank from the central or general reserve bank. That view, it is only fair to point out, was based upon the idea that the savings bank itself would make advances to the individuals who desired to acquire homes under the scheme. the bank directors were based upon the mutual understanding that the bank should be permitted to fulfil the true functions of a central or reserve bank, which' would' cause it to become the keystone of the financial structure of the Commonwealth. The directors made it quite clear that they considered that if they' participated in a housing scheme it would be difficult for the bank to fulfil its major function of a reserve bank. As the ideas of the Government on the subject crystallized the idea of the Commonwealth Bank making advances direct to persons requiring homes lapsed, and the proposition that it should merely loan mOneys to State instrumentalities and other bodies which would in turn lend to applicants for homes was adopted; but in view of the definitely adverse view which the bank directors had expressed respecting participation in a housing policy it did not occur to us that such an alteration in the basis of the proposal would lead to an alteration in the views of the directors of the bank. The position to-day is that the directors do not at all agree that the central or reserve bank should be associated in any way with a housing scheme; but only that the savings bank should participate in it . The point which the Government failed to grasp was that, in view of the fact that the amount of detail work involved had been reduced to a minimum, the board r felt that if a separation of the activities of the savings branch from the other branch of the bank were effected it could control both the activities' of the central bank and those of the savings bank. This involves a separation of the two branches of the bank, although both will be controlled, by .the one directorate. will the separation 'take place ? bill that in future the accounts of the two even contemplated that when an officer of the general bank is detached from it for service in the savings bank certain provisions shall be made respecting his transfer and the maintenance of his rights. the assumption that a separate corporaA l l our discussions with tion would be set up, but that has all been destroyed. member for Swan moved his amendment the Government agreed to accept it on the",43,Amazing Change In Bank Polios

Every time this matter is discussed the more fogged we become. Minister's speech has not enlightened us at all. He has claimed that there are two major principles involved, the housing provisions of the bill and the separaThere tion of the savings bank from the central bank. But it is rather strange that we should have that view introduced at this stage, because previously it was urged all through our discussions that the object shall have difficulty .enough in getting the of the bill was to remove from the Commonwealth Bank all matters relating to housing and the financing of a housing scheme. It was only after the Commonwealth Bank Board took exception to what had been done, and stated that further consideration should be given to the matter, that an amendment was submitted by the Government in another place to practically suspend the whole of the provisions of the Commonwealth Bank (Savings Bank) Bill. Now the honourable member for Swan( Mr Government's' proposal to establish a' Gregory) has moved a further amendment providing that no Government shall have power to appoint a separate commission to control the Savings Bank without the authority of Parliament. The Government has accepted that amendment, and asks honourable members to agree to both proposals, which, in effect, mean the shelving of all its proposals in this regard. The Government could nav. adopted a very much better .course i i trying to get. out of the difficulty in whicl it found itself as the result of a ver obvious mistake. Instead of acting in. & straightforward way, and admitting fte mistake, instead of saying, "" There has been some misunderstanding;""the directors! of the Commonwealth Bank are prepared) to manage the Savings Bank business) and consequently we are now prepared to allow this legislation to go by the board,"" the Government has brought forward a proposal which can be regarded as nothing but a subterfuge. It could easily have inserted some clauses in the Housing Bill to cover the whole position; but I submit that it was not even necessary to do that. The Commonwealth Bank already has sumcient power to advance money on any acceptable security. No harm would have been done if the Commonwealth Bank (Sav-. ings Bank) Bill had been dropped; or, in view of the work to be done we adjourn, The Prime if it had been allowed to stand over. That would have been a more sensible course than the one we are now following. Where is the urgency for this bill?: is certainly need to get money to lend for housing schemes. There is little chance of borrowing money either in Australia or abroad at reasonable rates within the next few months; we money that is required for existing needs.. That being so, this measure is by no means urgent. Very few honorable members are satisfied with the turn that, events have taken in regard to this legis-, lation. They realize that a big mistake, has been made, and the simplest course for the Government to pursue would be' to put the bill aside for the time being,. or to admit frankly that there is no needi for it. The bill is almost entirely a» ; machinery measure to give effect to> the-, separate savings bank with a separate-, board. It has now decided that a new' board is unnecessary.

The Treasurer emphasized the importance of the provision enabling the bank to advance anoney for the erection of warehouses. 'The bank can advance money for any purpose without this special legislation. It is quite clear that this special power -was put in this bill only because the savings bank business and the loans for housing were to be removed from the control of the Commonwealth Bank. The Prime Minister said that this legislation is necesout that Sir Ernest Harvey recommended sary to make known abroad the fact that Australia has a central bank. Einanciers abroad already know that the Commonwealth Bank is the chief institution of its kind in Australia, and has comjplete power in regard to banking. . What *does it matter to the world if we set up another bank to be called the savings bank, or continue the savings bank business under the authority of the general bank, if in either event the same authority will control the business? The mere separation of the savings bank from the general bank would not raise the status of the Commonwealth Bank abroad. In deed, it would have the opposite effect, because the total profits of the bank would be reduced. Minister at a greater disadvantage than he was when trying to defend this bill. ness is kept separate from the general ""business to-day. the Commonwealth Bank Act requires that their accounts and balance-sheets shall be separate. has been endeavouring to demonstrate the unwisdom of separating the two. plied to the setting up of an additional controlling authority. I say that both branches of the Commonwealth Bank should be under the one directorate. Although they are under the one directorate now, their accounts are kept separately, and this amendment will make no change in that regard. member say what injury the amendment will do to this institution or to any one of its clients ? ing that the Commonwealth Bank will suffer in prestige if it is shorn of some of its business. I am convinced that this legislation represents an endeavour by the Treasurer to give effect to the recommendations of Sir Ernest Harvey regarding the establishment of a central bank which would not engage in savings bank business. Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 7.4-5 p.n that the Commonwealth Bank should be placed in the same position as the Bank of England. It was not entirely . i matter of making it a central bank, but that it should be a bank of reserve. The Prime Minister argued that that was what the Opposition advocated. Of course, it is well known that the Labour party considers that the bank should have the fullest latitude in regard to finance. I do not desire to delay the committee by prolonging this discussion. When the bill was introduced it was urged that it was necessary because the board of directors was not prepared to carry out the duties that the housing scheme involved. Now it has been clearly shown that themembers T never heard the Prime of the present board are prepared to carry out the additional work. They did not understand in the first place that it merely involved the lending of money. Consequently the Government has accepted the amendment inserted in the Senate. This amounts to a complete backdown from the position that it originally assumed. It would have been much better, in view of the decision of the board of directors, if the Government had abandoned the bill, and sought to achieve its object in some other way. I submit that at the present time the bank has power to grant the money required for the housing scheme, which is all that is provided for under the bill. A further backdown on the part of the Government is shown by its acceptance of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). cause it puts it beyond doubt that the Government cannot appoint a new board without the sanction of Parliament.

205,The Honourable Mr Charlton,"Undoubtedly ; beam not so much, afraid of future governments as the present Government, because it has shown a desire to appoint this board. The amount of time spent in the discussion of this proposal is evidence of that. We have to thank the present board of directors for extricating Parliament from a difficulty. Had they not intimated their willingness to undertake this work the amendment would not have been inserted in the bill in the Senate; but now that the Government recognizes that many honourable members even on its own side are opposed to what was originally proposed, it willingly accepts the amendment. If ever a government has been humiliated in connection with a measure introduced by it, this Ministry has on this occasion. Its aotion has completely vindicated the attitude adopted by the Opposition when the bill was originally before us. ThereI leave the matter. The consideration of this bill and the present amendment has obviously caused so much heart burning in governmental circles that one cannot believe that the Government, in accepting this proposal, is taking what it considers to be the best course in the circumstances, and the only natural one to adopt. The Labour party opposed the bill in the first place on a vital matter of principle-the proposed separation of the functions of the savings department from those of the general bank, so as to create a second and entirely nqw bank. We opposed that vigorously, if I may say so, as one who took a minor part in the good work, and although we did not realize it at the moment, we opposed it successfully. We took the somewhat unusual course, in speaking to the amendment moved by the dore), of inviting the directors of the bank to refer to our deliberations, and the speeches we had made from this side, directed to showing that if the present directors were not able ' to handle this new function we should be driven reluctantly to the conclusion that they were not fitted for the important work that they were called upon to discharge. And so the Treasurer makes the amende, whether it is the amende honourable, or the amende hesir tante, I am not quite sure; but I am prepared to accept it in good faith. The amazing fact about it is that, scarcely had the amendment been proposed, after most profound deliberation and heart-burning in governmental circles, than a further amendment was moved from the rank and file of the Ministerial party, vitally affecting the amendment before the committee. This was to the effect that the position created by the Senate's amendment should not be varied except by a further decision of the Parliament. That proposal the Treasurer accepted without hesitation and without debate, other than the recommendation of the honourable member who submitted it. It is at this stage that the Prime Minister enters the lists. He asks us not to reject the bill altogether, because he says that, even with the amendment, it makes provision for the separation of the two functions of the bank. Well, with the amendment carried, the Savings Bank Bill remains, and will, I grant, establish a separate savings bank. It will create that strange paradox, a corporation without a body. We shall have a corporation known as the savings bank, with managers who, after all, will be the managers of the whole concern, just as they were before either of these bills was contemplated. I cannot help thinking that the amende is not so wholehearted and frank as it might have been. I feel that there is in this persistent determination of the Government to pass the bill something more than the mere desire to retain what is in the bill. I think that there is a desire to save the faces of the members of the Ministry, and very little else. But there is another aspect of it, and that is that members of the Opposition are not too sure of the whole-heartedness of the Government and its supporters with regard to the Housing Bill. We know that the proposal came somewhat late in the day. A wide hiatus occurred between the election promise of the Housing Bill and its fulfilment. I am one of those who are sufficiently suspicious of the Government to believe that, if the bill were now rejected, it would not be beyond the Government to drop the housing proposals altogether. I do not want any such excuse as that to arise. I am prepared, with my Leader, to rest upon the fact that the Labour party in this matter did",48,Amazing Change In Bank Polios

207,Honourable Member For Dalley ( Mr Theo,"a very useful p.ublic service. Indirectly it conveyed a message to the directors of the Commonwealth Bank that was appreciated by them, and they in turn conveyed to the Government a message of a kind that it was not prepared to accept when it was tendered to the Government across the table by members of the Opposition. Without unduly glorifying ourselves for our success, we are entitled to offer ourselves, a little congratulation. I , like the honourable member for Dalley, would prefer that the whole bill should be scrapped, and that the Government should take the obvious course of dealing with the housing scheme, as it well could, through tbe existing savings ba.nk legislation, or with any necessary amendments of a machinery character that might be thought necessary. sure of the whole-heartedness of the Government in that regard, and, therefore; I am prepared to have the large amount of dead wood that we shall have in this bill put by in the legislative wood-shed in the shape of useless legislation, so long as we get the kernel in the for m of the housing scheme, and the Commonwealth Bank w ill not be rent asunder.

I hope that, in the consideration of the tariff schedule every honourable member, even the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs himself, w ill refrain from making it a party matter. I do not know whether I am right or wrong in saying so, but I understand that all parties are agreed that requests for increases or reductions in the tariff-should be permissible without any suggestion being made that party issues have been raised. I hope that the debate w ill be conducted in that spirit. Naturally I do not expect to get all that I am asking for , but I am anticipating that I shall be able to obtain fro m the Minister some concessions in regard to certain items. the raising of duties is regarded by some honourable members as a non-party question, and the lowering of duties as a party issue. if tlie Minister definitely ranges himself on one side with regard to the amount of duties that should be levied, there is no reason why members of his own party should support hi m absolutely. I thoroughly endorse this statement made But I am not too by the Minister wheri introducing the amended tariff scheduleWe in Australia possess wonderful natural resources in the way of raw materials, and we realize that the foundation of our security lies in the control and development of those raw materials.

Maize is used for the manufacture of starch, glucose, cornflour, and one of the by-products is an excellent food for cattle and sheep. pays in wages and salaries about £60,000 per annum. It also is of considerable assistance to the timber industry, because of the demand set up for casks for the transportation of the glucose to the several cities in Australia where it is required as the raw material for other, industries. casksI understand that the Maize Products Company requires from 20,000 to 25,000 casks a year-give s employment to about 40 or 45 men, and this industry in turn gives employment to between 45 and 50 bush timber workers. Imported glucose, of course, is landed in foreignmade casks and in no way i-.ontributes to the employment of Australian workmen as is the case with the Maize Products Proprietary Limited. All who believe ih decentralization should support my request for increased assistance to the company in question, which is endeavouring to meet the Australian demand for glucose. Last year Australia' imported, from the United States of America and Belgium, 1,270 tons of glucose, representing 17 per cent, of our total requirements."" If the whole of our needs last year had been met by the local manufacturers it' would have meant the' consumption of an additional 106,000 bushels of maize; representing in value about £35,000; 4,000 casks, representing about' £6,000 ; and the payment in Wages to Australian workmen of about £6,000, as well as about £3,000 for cartage, or a total of about-£60,000. I think I have said enough to show that representatives of the primary producers should be in sympathy with my proposal. A great deal of maize is grown at Orbost and Bairnsdale in the constituency of the Minister' for Markets and Migration ( Mr Union, an important federated body, have Paterson), and large quantities are grown also in the northern portion of New South Wales and in Queensland. I am not aware if. much ia. grown in. Western Aus--. tralia at present. Maize-growers; as' a rule, receive on an average from 5s. to 6s. a bushel for maize. Last year the price rose to as high as 6s. Id. In the United States of America the glucose manufacturers are able to buy the raw material at from 3s. to 4s. a bushel so that they have a distinct advantage over the glucose manufacturers in Australia. America must be having' a bad time if that is all they get for their corn. Mi'. PENTON -Any responsibility for low. prices in that country must rest upon the Government of the United States of America. We have already done something in Australia to protect The manufacture of these our maize growers, I presume at the instigation of members of the Country party, including the Minister for Markets and Migration. I do not suggest that the Minister used undue influence. He has a perfect right to look after the interests of his own constituents. AllI know is that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) sawfit""some time ago to impose a duty of 3s. 6d. per central on maize, ostensibly to meet South African competition. I am making no complaint about that. The maize-grower has every right to seek protection from what he may believe to be unfair competition. After all that is the natural sequence of events in connection with' tariff duties. If we impose substantial duties for the protection of maize; it follows that further protection will be necessary for themanufacturer's of glucose. I wish to make it clear, however, that' increased duties in this item will not mean an increase in the cost of the' glucose to Other' industries-. 1 It is largely used by manufacturers of confectionery, by tanners; brewer's, manuf acturingchemists, biscuit manuf acturer's and bakers. The extent to Whichi t is used by manufacturing chemists is surprising. I anticipate that the Minister will say that he cannot agree to an increase in the duties, but I should like to make clear to him and to honourable'member's generally that I am not now speaking only on behalf of the manufacturers. Members of the Manufacturing Grocers' appealed to me' through their secretary, to support a request for an increase in the duties.. I . trust, therefore that. the. Min; 1 ister will deal out even-handed justice.",50,Customs Tarif F
216,The Glucose Factory Mr Gregory,"The maize growers inThat is all that I am asking shall he done in this case. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) the other day, when speaking to the land tax proposals of-the Government, made it plain that his one object was to ensure even-handed justice being meted out to all sections of the community. I confess that my personal predilections are in favour of doing what is possible to assist the worker. It is my desire that he should be assured remunerative employment so that he may keep his wife and family in reasonable comfort. Unfortunately, owing to severe competition from the United States of America, there is reason to fear that unless additional protection is given to manufacturers of glucose, the industry will go out of existence. On this point the Tariff Board's report statesWere it not for the fact that the leading confectionery manufacturers in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane are shareholders iu the Maize Products Company, it is quite likely that the competition from overseas would have succeeded in extinguishing the local industry. ber should read further from that report. read seems to sum up the conclusions of the board. Its members appear to be favorable to further protection being granted to the manufacturers of glucose. watering of stock? company, like many other companies, has watered its stock to a certain extent, but I point out that it has also challenged an analysis of its books. Since its inception its average annual profit has not been more than 13 per cent, on the original share issue, and out of that certain charges have had to be met. Taking into account the increased capitalwhich some would call watered capitalthe profit would not be anything like 13 per cent. The company is quite prepared to allow the Minister to send one of his officers to examine its books. cent., quite sufficient? tion. I plead with the Minister to give this industry some additional assistance, and not to crack the party whip. I hope that he will allow a vote to be taken on this item, to ascer tain the feeling of the committee, and if it is against increasing the duty to the extent that I advocate, then to come to a sensible compromise. The duty proposed in the schedule is 12s. per cwt. British preferential, 15s. intermediate, and 15s. general tariff. from Great Britain; most of it comes from America. from Belgium, but most of it is imported from the United States of America. An impetus has been given to the manufacture of glucose in the United States of America because prohibition has compelled the brewers to engage in the manufacture of commodities other than alcoholic liquors, and among those is glucose. That has caused a certain amount of competition with us in the growing of maize, and to-day, unfortunately, there exists in the United States of America a combine whose operations are likely to cause the cessation of the manufacture of glucose in Australia. It is, indeed, peculiar that when dealing with the tariff, a firivate member has to move for a reduction in an item in order to obtain an increase in it . It is, therefore, necessary for me to move that this item be reduced by Is. in order to suggest an increased duty of 15s. per cwt. British preferential, 18s. intermediate, and 18s. general tariff. It is unfortunate that we have little time in which to discuss the tariff or any measures that will be introduced before the adjournment of Parliament at the end of this week. I , therefore, do not propose to take up the time of the committee unduly, but since the employment of workmen and workwomen is at stake, I shall fight to my utmost for them. The Minister has sufficient power to protect this industry. Had it not been for the fact that large manufacturers in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne are shareholders in Maize Products' Proprietary Ltd., its factory would have been closed ere this.

A consignment worth £1,000,000 was taken by the RMS. Makura. Almost half of this shipment was made up. of refined gold won in New Guinea. The American mail steamer Sonoma took a further consignment worth £1,000,000. The shipments were made by the Commonwealth Bank in order to adjust bank balances owing to the imports being so much above tlie value of exports. During the past financial year tlie Commonwealth Bank shipped to San Francisco gold to the value of £11,000,000, of whicli approximately £4,000,000 represented new gold. The shipments last week were the first to be made in the present financial year. Australian workmen, enterprise, and capital produce gold within the Commonwealth and its dependencies, only to have it shipped to the United States of America to pay for our excessive .imports. In the item before us, we have an opportunity to limit to some extent the shipping of gold from Australia. We cannot send sumcient goods. borrowing on the American money market, and the American manufacturers are doing their utmost to expand their trade with Australia. Some of them are establishing factories in Australia, and I believe that the tariff will encourage others to come here. Qur imports from the United States of America exceed our exports to that country by £28,000,000. We receive £50,000 worth of glucose from the United States of America, and by increasing the item as I have suggested that money would be saved to the people of Australia, and a measure of assistance would be given to primary production. Maize is a primary product, and I , therefore, look for assistance from those who claim to. represent the primary producers. I am always prepared to assist rural industries. I should be prepared to support a proposal to. increase the duty on butter from 3d. to 7d. per lb., and on potatoes from Is. to 2s. 6d. I am an honest and consistent protectionist. In this case we are using our own raw materia] and manufacturing the finished That article, and that is one of the finest things that we can do to bring about the proper development of Australia. I ask the Minister not to throw cold water on my proposal, but to give it a trial, and, if it reacts against the interests of Australia, I shall not oppose its withdrawal. I ask the committee to agree to the further increase in duty, which I have suggested in order to safeguard an Australian industry and provide employment for our own workmen. I do not wish honourable members to be under a misapprehension regarding the discussion on the tariff schedule. The honourable member for Maribyrnong. has signified his desire to move an amendment. Minister is favorable to an increase in duty, I shall leave in his hands the moving of the necessary amendment. members to understand that, if a motion for a reduction in an item is moved as an instruction to the Government to increase the duty, it does not follow that, if it is agreed to, an increase will subsequently be given.

Trade and Customs) [8.30] I think it. is quite obvious that when tariff resogiving these figures to show that the lutions lie upon the table for some weeks they beget, all sorts of representations, and in some cases it may b'e possible to find out one or two Weak spots in them. At all events it gives honourable members an opportunity to fairly consider what has ' been proposed by the Government. I listened very carefully to the remarks of the honourable member for Maribyrnong upon the subject of glucose, and to the arguments which he put forward for increased protection. The duty has already been increased in the foreign schedule from £12 to £15 a ton, and' I see no reason, as a result' of the representations which have been made to me, both here and elsewhere, to hesitate' at allih recommending the proposals of the Government to the committee. Perhapsi t will-clarify the position if' I give honourable members all the information I haye regarding the posi-1 tion. Maize products manufactures of. any sort are of very great benefit to the maize growers, and I realize to the f u l l the importance of such industries. The company engaged in making glucose pays from £60,000 to £70,000 a year in wages to 280 employees;-and uses, in the course of its business, about half a million bushels of maize a year. Such an industry is of the very greatest importance to the primary industry of maize growing, and should receive generous assistance from Parliament. whether or not the proposals of the Government are fair and reasonable. The : importation of glucose for 1925-26 amounted approximately to 25,000 cwts., valued at £25,000. In 1926-27 the importations showed a very slight decrease; .but were still approximately 25,000 cwts., The Australian production in 1925-26 was 148,000 cwts., as compared with an importation of 25,000 cwts., and in 1926-27 the Australian production was 144,000 cwts. These are the figures of trade and manufacture under the duty of £12a ton, and in. addition totliat duty there is also a duty amounting to £1 10s. per' ton of glucose imported on the casks in which it is packed. Therefore, even under the old tariff, there was a protectionof £13 10s. a ton on imported glucose, and that has been raised to £16 10s. a ton in this schedule. I am proposal of the Government is sound and reasonable, and, may I say^ somewhat generous. In fairness to the Maize Products CompanyI should say that the price of maize has a very important bearing upon the position; nevertheless, on present figures it seems to me that the Government's proposal covers all the appeals to the generosity of the committee that were made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong on behalf of the maize-growers. I hope that the item will b'e passed as it stands. I rise to support the motion for an increase in . duty, and appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the request. It may be said that the honourable member for Maribyrnong is' interested ih this matter because the glucose factory is in his electorate. The same thirig might be said about myself, for maize, from which glucose is made; is grown extensively irt my electorate. Maize-growing; however, is not limited to my area. It is a national industry' and other honourable members also are interested in it. The Minister has made out a case which Would justify a refusal to increase the duty at all equally as well as a proposal to increase it by' the amount proposed by fhe Government. In Let us see 1926, the Tariff Board recommended ah increase of 3s. per cwt. in the duty, but, subsequent happenings have made a higher duty necessary. We are driven into the position of asking for an-increase. The Government has increased the tariff toprotect the secondary industries;and the primary' producers are called",53,Customs Tarif F

We have been driven to see that some consideration is given to the farmers, graziei'8, and other primary producers. The Tariff Board made its recommendations on the evidence before it at the time of the inquiry; but much water has flowed under the bridge since then. The price of maize has fallen in America, and that has a direct effect upon the growers here. The industry is not in so prosperous a condition now as it was, and there is less land under maize than in previous years. In my electorate land which was selling for over £100 an acre can now be bought for a good deal less. Ir, bus been said that this company has watered its shares, and that it has distributed dividends of 134 per cent. One would think from those figures that the company must he in a flourishing condition, yet it is possible to buy £1 shares f u l ly paid-up for 12s. These increases are not asked for so that we may capture rl.ie American trade, but that, we may maintain the Australian industry. Minister.has admitted that 280 people are employed in this industry, but I think there are a good many more. A great many casks are used for packing the glucose, aud. the cutting of the timber used for. those casks is a primary industry: Men are employed in the bush cutting the timber, and other men are employed in the cooperages making it up into casks. I should think that at least -10Q men are employed in subsidiary-industries. That, however, is to adopt a protectionist argument, and I do not propose-to build my case on that. I think the industry is entitled to an increase in duty, and if it was fair that it should receive an increase of 3s. a cwt. in 1926, it is, I think, entitled now to one of os. ber is asking for protection against the protectionists? cally what it amounts to. The people are being driven off the land because of high wages and increased costs, and it is time they asked for a little for themselves. That is particularly applicable to the Many dairying industry, and it also applies in this case. Exceptf or the importations from abroad, another 160,000 bushels of Australian maize would have been used in the manufacture of glucose, and that would have given a great impetus to maize-growing. ber suggest that the glucose manufacturers would have imported maize if they could have got it here? have been imported more cheaply. The Minister has granted increased protection on cornflour, which is a product similar to glucose. 2s. 6d. a central on maize. maize products. member say that cornflour and glucose are the same thing? at any rate, and are made from the same grain. might as well say that boots are the same The tiling as leather. and glucose are very closely connected. They both concern the growers of maize. If the Minister would grant the extra increase asked for it would leave the industry in practically the same position as it would have been if the recommendations of the Tariff Board had b.een given effect to at the time they were made. Taking into consideration the reduced price of maize in America, and the extra cost of production, due to such things as the reduction of working hours as the result of legislation passed in New South Wales since the report was prepared, and the institution of compulsory insurance in that State, an increase of os. now would just about equal the 3s. recommended by the board in 1926.

Surely a higher duty is not needed. The manufacturers of products from maize in the United States are competing with the manufacturers in the other parts of the world, and are providing good conditions and pay wages as high as we do.

I was pleased when I first heard that a maize products company was being established; I thought it would assist persons engaged in the production of maize, and that possibly there would be a surplus which it would be able to export.

The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr another item in the tariff. No industry Fenton) has said the manufacturers of ""glucose have guaranteed that if this extra duty is imposed they will not increase their price.

But even if the guarantee he has given be reliable, I want to ask why we cannot sometimes have a guarantee to reduce the price. Why haye we always to consider living at present prices? We are now assailed by competition from countries that are reducing their cost of production. are surrounded by countries, who either by working harder or by employing better methods, can produce more cheaply than Australia. main in our isolated position with prices going up or maintained at their present, high level. As a matter of fact, we are having these increased duties not because the manufacturers are doing badly-the records show that they are not-but for an entirely different reason. World prices are rapidly diminishing, and the people of Australia will not be content to maintain costs of living owing to the high taxation they have to pay. The Australian manufacturers realize that presently there will be so much competition from outside Mr Mann. that their prices will have to be brought But this is not the down, and the only way to prevent it from happening and prevent the public from having a moderate and sensible cost He is already afforded heavy of living is to impose higher duties. In a word, the purpose of this tariff is as much to prevent prices' from coming down, just as they are coming down in other parts of the world, as it is to send I have already pointed out that, them up. The effect of these duties will be either, to maintain prices or to prevent them from falling.

Does the honourable member claim that because we have increased the duty on maize'we must increase the duty on every commodity into which maize enters ? If so he is drawing attention to the tragedy of this system of protection. It is all right when it is applied to one or two commodities, but if applied all around the position becomes absolutely hopeless. If it is applied to the basic material and must be applied at every stage in the manufacture of that material, the cost of each manufactured article in the series gets higher and higher until it eventually reaches a height of cost almost beyond contemplation. And then honourable members talk about diminishing unemployment. It seems to me that their idea is to make everybody prosperous by making everybody poor. Unemployment increases the moment we diminish the purchasing power of the community. The imposition of duties and the subsequent higher cost of living make drains on the wage fund that it will not stand. Yet honourable members continue this policy by which more and more men are thrown out of work. The unemployment that it is said we have to-day is the result of the handiwork of those who will not recognize economic truths and persist, against their better judgment and in spite of the facts brought home to them, in the imposition of higher and higher duties. The blame for the present unemployment rests upon them. The unemployment of to-day is bound to be increased by the imposition of this schedule of duties. proposed duty on glucose would not afford any protection to the primary producer. industry that provides a market for him. say that it would be a protection to them. impose a duty higher than the value of the maize itselfa duty that would be more than equivalent to supplying the industry with maize free of cost. This protection cannot be given except by penalizing the children and increasing the cost of living. Surely the present adverse trade balance and unemployment are finger-posts warning us that we are moving in the wrong direction. Instead of continuing in that direction at an accelerated pace, we should call a halt; yet honourable members are continually contending for a higher tariff, which will only make the position of the Australian producer more difficult. The interest on the national debt cannot be paid by secondary production; the only articles we can export are primary products, and the country is dependent upon the oversea sale of them to pay the annual interest bill. The primary producer is being asked to carry too great a burden. an Australian and a protectionist, I desire that the schedule shall be adopted as speedily as possible, subject to such amendments as will make the protective policy more effective. But I have long ceased to believe that either protection or free trade will make poverty impossible. It amuses me to hear the free traders talking of free trade as a solution of the problems of unemployment and poverty. Great Britain is a free trade and low-wage country, and today over 1,000,000 of its people are out of work. When, during the great war, there was a",60,Customs Tarif F

Looking to the future, I wish to obviate the possibility of our people being again dependent upon any other country in the event of another great war. The glucose manufacturers have done good work in the production of by-products from maize. I know that they are not guiltless.; they made huge profits during the war, and they have since watered their stock. But they are not alone in those faults. If , through the wasting of their profits, the shareholders are not prosperous to-day, I will not deny them the measure of protection that is necessary to enable them to carry on. I am sorry to say I know of many instances of the watering of stock; but that practice is not peculiar to Australian manufacturers -it is world-wide. My view as a protectionist is that, if there is to be a monoduty is imposed, and the glucose manupoly I would sooner that it were in Australia, so that we might have some chance to control it. MacRobertson, who is a large shareholder in the glucose company, has done wonderful work for Australia.

If the proposal of the honourable member for Maribyrnong is not adopted, those who imported 1,270 tons of glucose last year at very low prices, will find it profitable to continue importing an increasing quantity from year to year, in the hope of crushing out the Australian industry. temporarily enjoy the benefit of cheaper confectionery, as a result of this competition, they would eventually pay dearly for this luxury if the Australian industry were destroyed. I want to see Australia become a big nation, and in respect of commodities of which our manufacturers can produce the requisite quantity and quality I would not bother with a tariff; I would adopt simple prohibition. The manufacture of glucose is giving employment to a large number of farmers in Victoria, and I shall be surprised if the Minister for Markets and Migration ( Mr Paterson) does not support the request for an increased duty in order to help the maize growers in the Bairnsdale district, who are largely dependent upon the manufacture of glucose. The potato growers also may find themselves beholden to this secondary industry. One company is being formed in Victoria for the production of glucose, starch, and other by-products from potatoes. If this industry succeeds it will help to stabilize the potato market. Instead of potatoes being sent long distances to a glutted market, they will be bought by the factories at prices which will be profitable to the growers. I hope that the Minister will be true to his protectionist principles, for which even honourable members of the Opposition at times are impelled to cheer him, and will grant fhe request made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. If an increased facturers take advantage of it to exploit the people, a future Parliament will be able to deal with them.

I have always considered it We should be a cardinal postulate of economics that a nation should be as far as possible self-contained.

I am not unduly alarmed even by the sentimental aspect presented by the honourable member for Forrest and the honourable member for Perth, who spoke qf the damaging effect from a dietetic point of view of such a tariff upon children. When we examine the reports regarding the physique of school children, we find that it is not so much the food, or the cost of the food, that has lowered their physical powers of resistance, as the unsuitableness of the food given to them. Those foods that for the most part contribute to their health are not unduly dear, provided they are supplied at the right time and in the right quantity. I further venture to suggest that if the company whose operations are under consideration made glucose out of wheat, the honourable member for Forrest would be found to be an ardent supporter of its request. maize and not wheat, he cannot dissociate himself from his free trade convictions. I hope that the committee will not take up the free trade cry too seriously. I have great pleasure in supporting the proposed duty. support the item, because it means that relief will be given to a section of the primary producers, and, indirectly, to an industry in which the whole community is interested. The honourable member for Perth favours sending gold to the United States of America to pay for the 1,270 tons of glucose imported last hope that the committee will accept year. Isi t reasonable to export gold to America to bring to Australia products that we can grow ourselves, and grow in abundance, if the producers receive fair treatment? The imports of glucose last year amounted to the equivalent of 500,000 bushels of maize and from the United States of America alone the imports amounted in value to about £40,000. has to contend with the Navigation Act, the Arbitration Court, customs duties and profiteers. No wonder people are leaving the land. I am surprised at any honourable member uttering one word against the proposed duty on imports from a foreign country on goods that we can supply in abundance ourselves. Maize is produced in America and South Africa under such cheap labour conditions that we cannot compete under our Australian conditions. Although the industry is in its infancy in Australia, I believe that it has a great future. I agree with honourable members opposite that it is far better to have combines in Australia than abroad. If the manufacturers treat the public unfairly, it will «be competent for this, or some future Parliament, to deal with them. I support the item as it stands, feeling confident that a substantial increase is warranted. I support the increase in duty on glucose from 12s. British preference, 13s. intermediate and 12s. general tariff, to 12s. British preferential, 15s. intermediate, and los. general tariff, as proposed by the Minister, and strongly oppose the reduction asked for by the honourable member for Swan. The Tariff Board was specially appointed by Parliament to examine requests for increased duties from every possible angle. As a result of years of experience, the members of the board have become specialists, and members would be well-advised to be guided by their expert opinion rather than enter into an unholy free trade alliance with the honourable members for Swan, Perth and Forrest. After thorough investigation the Tariff Board has recommended this increase, the recommendation has been reviewed by the Minister and the Cabinet, and I the duties brought down by the Minister. The board took into consideration the cost of manufacture and the cost of corn and glucose, both here and in foreign countries such as America and Belgium. The industry can only be carried on in Australia because the sweet manufacturers are the main shareholders of the glucose manufacturing industry, The Australian producer and always secure from this company the glucose required for the manufacture of confectionery. The industry provides work and wages for over 250' persons, and four times' that number are indirectly engaged in the industry.

Tens of thousands of maize producers are entitled to the protection that they will indirectly receive under this proposal. The Minister was good enough recently to bring down a tariff that gave the producer a direct protection of 3s. 6d. per central on maize, and an embargo on black-grown maize from South Africa was also imposed. Now the whole of that protection is undermined by the importation of a by-product of maize in the form of glucose. a Australian open to Australian maize-growers. The primary producer is entitled to have the home market secured to him by this measure of protection. Australia imports 1,270 tons of glucose, representing 106,520 bushels of maize, from' the United States of America. This importation is likely to be increased. The more maize is imported into 'Australia the more our home market is reduced to our own product. I hope the committee will support the proposal.

I believe in protection, but under certain conditions. This is a proposal to increase the duties on glucose from 125 per cent, to 145 per cent. That, in my opinion, is too high. ""We should not forget that glucose is the raw material for a number of other important industries in the Oommonwealth. It is largely used in the manufacture of biscuits and confectionery. I maintain that 1 shall leave beer out of consideration, and reasonable proportion of the confine my attenton to the effect of these market should be kept duties on the manufacturer of biscuits and confectionery.

The products of Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall, which are manufactured in my electorate, are admitted to be as good as any in the world. I am advised that it will be impossible for that firm' and other manufacturers of confectionery to pass on the duties. Consequently, they will fall directly upon those manufacturing conlength, but since many cerns. There is a possibility that these increased duties to benefit the Maize Products Company may have the effect of closing a number of confectionery and Board, to which reference, has been made by other honourable members, statesThe price of maize in Australia during the last five years has not varied more than 3d. per bushel on the mean average. In 1921 actual sales made for milling maize were from 4s. 3d. to 6s. per bushel; in 1922, 4s. 10d. to 5s.; 1923, 5s. to 5s. 10d.; 1924, 3s. lOd. to 6s.; 1925, 4s. 3d. to 5s. lOd.; the mean average prices for these years being 5s. l^d., 5s. 2}d., 5s. 5d., 4s. l i d . , and 5s. o|d., indicating that the last two years have been the lowest years in maize. Apparently _ the price this year will be much lower than in former years, because there has been a splendid season in The schedule Queensland and in parts of New South Wales. If there is over-production, naturally prices will come down. It follows then that if extra duties are imposed, and if, as is anticipated, prices for maize decline, the Maize Products Company and not the grower, will secure all the benefit.

I notice also in the report of the Tariff Boarc a statement that when it was not 1 possible for manufacturers to obtain glucose from America, the Maize Products Company immediately raised its price, and when imports of glucose were again on the market, the company dropped its charges. It is evident from what has happened in the past that if increased duties have the effect of checking importations, the price of the local product will rise. the company raised its priceby 30s. as soon as the new schedule was laid on the table. dangers that we have to face. I understand that the only two manufacturers of confectionery in South Australia are shareholders in the Maize Products Company, and that they informed the Tariff Board that they did not desire increased duties on glucose. The manufacturers in Tasmania are in the same position. There is every probability, therefore, that increased duties on this article will seriously penalize manufacturers of confectionery and biscuits. Any industry that is protected by 100 per cent, duties, and requires additional duties to enable it to carry on, should cease operations. I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan( Mr In 1923-24 the total value of all indusGregory). was rather surprised to hear the arguments from this side of the committee in favour of an increased duty on glucose. It has been, said that the duty would benefit the maize-growers, but I contend that they have sufficient protection already, if not too much. I am a primary producer, and the industry with which I am connected receives no protection. We are not asking for protection, but I submit that, where necessary, the primary producers have as much right to be protected as persons engaged in secondary industries. Unfortunately, it is impossible to protect some primary industries. Although those engaged in rural industries are producing 73 per cent, of the wealth of Australia and 96 per cent. of our exports, they are receiving little Apparently higher rates will benefit, indeed, from our policy of pro* tection. The duty on glucose is already high enough, if not iOo high. It has been said by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), that the duty will amount to 148 per cent. My estimate is SO per cent. not taking the natural protection into account. industry is now receiving a protection of 60 per cent., and the natural protection would increase it to 80 per cent, or 90 per cent. That is quite sufficient, if not too much, protection for any industry. I have always favoured a reasonable protection of industry against foreign imports manufactured by cheap labour. This duty certainly goes further than that. Generally speaking, the maximum protection should not be. more than 35 per cent, or 40 per cent. It has been calculated that natural protection to an industry is from 25 per cent, to 41 per cent. That has been given in evidence before the Tariff Board, and I think is not questioned. with different classes of goods. less than with heavy goods. The average is about 30 per cent. Any industry that is protected to that extent, and cannot progress, does not deserve encouragement. tries iii Australia was £348,577,583, the salaries ancl wages paid in these industries being £77,278,265. In 1925-26 the total value of the output of all industries in Australia was £449,157,000, the salaries and wages paid amounting to £81,616,221. In 1923-24 the percentage of wages paid to the total output was 22.14, and in 1925-26, 18.11. that means that under a 35 per cent, duty the manufacturers here would have an advantage over overseas manufacturers of 15 per cent., without taking into account labour and landing charges which the foreign manufacturers have to pay. That certainly is ample protection. It is time that we called a halt in our policy of extreme protection, because it is benefiting no one.

They get it, and the manufrom Southern Europe, which were facturers ask for increased protection because of the higher rate of wages that they have to pay, and they get it. So tbe vicious circle goes on. If our duties were reasonable, about one-half of what they are to-day, we should probably be able to manufacture for export, but there is no prospect of our doing so at present. A few days ago the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) compared the position of Victoria under* protection with that of New South Wales under free trade, before federation took place. I folmaize and glucose in Australia only lowed his remarks closely, and I agree with what he said. At the time he referred to, I was living near the border of New South Wales, and I quite realize that under protection Victoria benefited to a much greater extent than New South Wales in population, production, and employment. But the honourable member did not mention that the tariff under which Victoria progressed so well, was low, indeed, compared with the tariff of to-day. The late Mr Alfred Deakin would turn in his grave if he knew that we were imposing such heavy duties. ' In his time a duty of 40 per cent, was considered high. Does the honourable member for Riverina propose to connect his remarks with glucose, which is tlie item under discussion ? to show that the proposed duty is unreasonably high when compared with the duties under which Victoria prospered in pre-federation days. Some of the duties in operation to-day are four or five times liigher than they were at that time. It is now proposed to increase some duties to the extent of from 80 per cent, to 100 per cent., and as I am absolutely opposed to such an increase, I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). was r.ather astonished to hear the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) suggest that the duty on any locally produced commodity should not exceed 35 per cent. I should like to inform the honourable member that on hops which were once imported from Kent, England, -at 5£d. per lb., there is now a duty of about 9d.; and on currants and raisins, landed at l&d. and 2£d. respectively, a -duty of 3d. A duty of 3d. per lb. it imposed also upon apples, and a duty of 4d. on pears. In supporting a higher duty on glucose, I am thinking more particularly of the maize-grower and also of those engaged in the manufacture of glucose. For the year ending the 30th June, 1927, 1,270 tons of glucose were imported. Why should we not use our own maize to produce that quantity? We can assist the production of by imposing a sufficiently high duty to prevent supplies coming from America which enter into competition with that produced in the Commonwealth. It is our duty to see that the interests of the primary producers are safeguarded, and that a market is found for the maize produced in Australia. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) claims that he wants to assist the primary producers; but he has a peculiar way of assisting them when, as in this case, he submits an amendment to reduce the duty on a commodity which they produce. Since the Tariff Board's recommendation was made about twelve months ago, there has been a marked difference in the cost of the glucose imported from.America. The Tariff Board states that I t was proved that whilst the Australian manufacturers' cost of production was £33 6s. I was endeavouring 4d. a'ton, American glucose was sold on the Australian market at £33 Is., or 5s. per ton under the Australian manufactured cost. Since the inquiry by the board has been completed, importations from America and Belgium have been quoted at £31 10s., or 36s. 4d. under the Australian cost of production. Are we to destroy the Australian maize-growing industry aud to tell our farmers, who have to face adversity in the form of droughts and the difficulties of transporting stock in dry seasons, that we do not think they need any further assistance ? The only way to assist them in. this instance is to increase the duties and thus prevent American producers from sending their surplus glucose to Australia at a price at",66,Customs Tarif F

I cannot understand honourable members saying that they are acting in the interests of the primary producers when they are assisting to destroy the home market for this commodity. As the Tariff Board has submitted a report favourable to the maize-grower, it is the duty of honourable members to assist them by supporting the Government's proposals. Rice producers are protected to the extent of 90 per cent., but the honourable member for Riverina, who says that a duty of 35 per cent, is sumcient for any product, does not object to that impost but actually advocates it. Some honourable members believe in high duties when they protect industries in their own constituencies, but they oppose .others that will benefit producers in every part of the Commonwealth. that the Minister will realize that the state of affairs in the glucose industry is different now from what it was when the Tariff Board submitted its report, so that there is a greater reason for higher protection. I support the request of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) for an increase in the duty on glucose, and I hope that the Minister will reconsider his decision on the matter. I am persuaded that the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has moved his amendment, not primarily for the purpose of securing a reduction in the"" duty on this commodity, but as part of an insidious free trade campaign which he is afraid to carry on openly. His action is, if I may use the term without offence, hypocritical. The honourable member does not believe in a duty on either glucose, maize, or anything else. member does not believe in a duty on anypoint; but the item under consideration thing that can be imported into Australia is glucose. for sale at a lower price than that for which it can be produced here. ber for Darling proposes to talk about member for Riverina may be willing to ' honesty, he should use my exact words, join the die-hards of the Henry George and be fair te me. honourable member and his small coterie of anti-Australians in this chamber are honest in their belief that the way out of our economic difficulties is to buy in the cheapest market; they would be acting more honorably if , in that belief, they were to resist the imposition of all duties. The honourable member aud his friends, who comprise our few remaining followers of Henry George, have made a couple of converts this evening in the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) and the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) ; but before the debate on the tariff schedule is"" concluded I am quite satisfied that those two honourable gentlemen will provide us with a somewhat surprising display of fiscal gymnastics. They cannot consistently advocate free trade for one primary industry and its by-products without doing so for others. free trade, but only the imposition of a fair duty. the honourable member for Swan will find that the honourable member for Riverina will fall from grace when rice is under discussion, and that the honourable member for Franklin will go toboganning to fiscal perdition when the timber duties are being considered. The latter will doubtless be a whole-souled prohibitionist in his desire to protect the products of our Australian forests. I am not a fiscal prohibitionist. My object is to try to make Australia a self-contained nation, for I believe that in that way only shall we ensure the salvation of this great continent. All the primary and secondary industries which are necessary to the development of Australia should be protected. I must ask the honourable member not to continue in that strain.

The honourable member should place himself in the position of those who have competitors in low-wage countries overseas.

There is not one honourable member who has not at some stage been generalizing. member must not reflect upon the Chair. There is ample opportunity for the honourable member to discuss the duty on glucose in all its details without generalizing to the extent that he was doing. to reflect on the Chair. If the wool industry were imperilled the honourable [111] member for Riverina would be one of the first to come to this Parliament, and particularly to. honourable members of the Labour party, to ask for their assistance party is a protectionist party he would not ask in vain. Things are coming to a pretty pass when the Labour party has to appeal to representatives of the primary producers to protect primary producers. One of the points raised by those who seek a reduction of the duty on glucose is that the maize-growers of Australia are already protected; but, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, they are not, even at the present rate of duty. The latest figures in the I am not asking for a Commonwealth Year-Booh relating to maize are for 1925-26. The last financial year ended five months ago; but the figures we have before us to enlighten ourselves on maize are seventeen months old. It is a shame that we in this Parliament, and the people of Australia, cannot get in the Year-Booh figures that are not more than six or seven months old. Statistician is to blame. I think the blame must rest with the department that does not give him sumcient funds to do his job. nate enough to secure figures from the Customs Department dealing with the year 1926-27. I shall quote the net importation of maize. In some years there are exports and in others there are imports. For 1921-22 the net import was 8,746 bushels, worth £708. The Customs Department deals in centals and the Commonwealth Statistician in bushels. That is an anomaly. Honourable members should at least he able to get information in standard measures or weights. In 1922-23 we imported 1,190,000 bushels of maize worth £202,000. In 1923-24 we imported 2,534,000 bushels, \yorth £505,000. In 1924-25 we exported 2,500,000 bushels, worth £511,000. In 1925-26, the last year for which the figures are available, we imported 1,507,000 bushols, worth £308,000. These figures show that the maize industry is not protected to the extent some honourable members would have us believe.

In most instances I think the duties in this schedquired to produce one ton of glucose. ule are too low, and I am supporting the honourable member for Maribyrnong in his desire to help the glucose industry. Many of our friends who have been complaining about the watering of stock would be the last to give any assistance' in this Parliament to the passage of a Commonwealth company law which would prevent the watering of stock. Honourable members of the Labour party have been continually asking the Government to take action against companies who do this and impose prices which will enable them to pay dividends on fictitious stock. Those honourable members who protest against this kind of thing would very likely be. the first to endeavour to protect the interests of those people who water their stock. tion ! member for Swan is not always foremost in attacking vested interests in that regard. I support the honourable member for Maribyrnong, not only because of my desire to establish the glucose industry and keep it going, but also as a protest against the free trade amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan. There is a wide divergence between the views of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) and those of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). The former desires to increase the duty on glucose to £18 a ton, and the honourable member for Swan wishes to reduce it to £10 a ton. I personally do not support either extreme. The glucose industry is of value to the community, and we must adopt a reasonable attitude towards it. I have no fault to find with the Tariff Board's recommendation. The members of the board made a very carefuly study of the evidence submitted to them, and conscientiously recommended to the Minister what they considered best in the interests of the industry and the country. The glucose industry is not of very great importance; its production in 1925 was worth only £283,000; but I am interested in it because of its relation to the primary producer. In 1925 it purchased 7,400 tons of maize, and I understand that 76 bushels of maize is reThis is a market of considerable importance to the maize-grower. Maize has frequently sold at the trifling price of 2s. 6d. to 3s. a bushel. We cannot hope to keep men on the land if that is to be the reward of their labour. I am not an extreme protectionist, but every industry must be given a 'chance. When it is given that chance it is the duty of the management to show some appreciation of the protection afforded it by doing all that is possible to supply, the consumer at a reasonable price. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) had a great deal to say about confectionery, but I notice this paragraph in the Tariff Board's reportWere it not for tlie fact that the leading confectionery manufacturers in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane are shareholders in the i Maize Products Company, it is quite likely that the competition from overseas would have succeeded in extinguishing the local industry. That is a convincing reply to the objections of the honourable member for Franklin. During the last two years this company used approximately 1,000,000 Dnshels of maize, of which only 37,000 bushels were imported. Those figures show at a glance that the company is of substantial value to the primary producer. maize production of Australia?",69,Customs Tarif F

Fortunately the whole of Australia does -not experience a dry season at the one time, and there is always some maize-growing district which is able to supply a considerable proportion of the requirements of the glucose manufapturers. that the good sense of the committee will prevail, and that no consideration will be given to the proposal to reduce the duty to a ridiculous amount. The Tariff Board has adopted the right principle in proposing that the duty should be increased from £12 to £15 per ton. With that protection the Maize Products Proprietary Limited wil l be assisted, and from it the maize-grower will derive great encouragement to remain on their farms. -Every honourable member, whether he be a free trader or protectionist, or merely a. "" fr'eetectionist,"" will agree that it is is desirable, and indeed nescessary, to develop our secondary industries, mor<> particularly those which utilize the primary products of this country. Minister, when introducing the tariff, pointed out that "" reductions in prices to the consumer have followed the establishment of efficient industries in the Commonwealth."" its report said that in regard to quality, the difference between Australian glucose and the imported article is not perceptible. It went on to sayTlie increase in duties was not requested in in the total for Australia. The maximum order to put the price up, because if the price area sown to maize was 414,914 acres as far were raised too much, sugar would be converted and used as a substitute. The Minister pointed out that the policy of protection has developed at the expense of the importer and of the foreigner, and not at the expense of our own population. ber for Perth alleged that the proposed increase of duty would tremendously increase the cost of production and the selling price of glucose in Australia, but, as the Minister stated:Keeping in view the need for developing our industries rendered necessary by our isolation from world centres, and also bearing in mind that some of these industries are basic and vital for tlfe purpose of defence, it is worth only the manufacture of glucose but also remembering that this policy of protection is costing the people of Australia probably less than Is. per head per week. Even this sum is being used to help pay for the legacy of the Parliament gave protection to the maizewar. Therefore,if protection does involve some slight increase in .the selling price of a commodity, it is not such as the people of Australia would boggle at. The Tariff Board pointed outThe applicant company is now faced with the position of intense competition from manuI hope facturers in the United States of America. . Werei t not for the fact that the leading confectionery' manufacturers in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane are shareholders in the Maize Products Company, it is quite likely that the competition from overseas would have succeeded in extinguishing the local industry. Whatever"" was done by the company in regard to the issue of bonus shares, the fact is that it is now in a very bad position, and unable to compete w it h glucose from abroad. The Tariff Board concluded with this terse recommendationIn view of these circumstances, as well as of the receding prices, and increasing importations of American glucose, the Tariff Board considers that the Australian industry is in need of further protection and accordingly recommends the present duty of £12 per ton to be increased to £15 per ton. The duty proposed by the Minister is in accordance with that recommendation. The We have to consider not only the secondary industries, but also the growers of maize. I have not heard any previous speaker refer to the fact recorded in the Year-Boohf o r 1927 thatThe Tariff Board in The cultivation of maize has decreased in Australia by more than 20,000 acres during the past decennium. Increases in area were recorded in both Queensland and Victoria, but the decline of more than 30,000 acres in Jfew South Wales was responsible for the reduction back as 1910-11, this acreage being considerably in excess of the average planted during the last ten years, which amounted to 315,948 acres The maximum production of maize in Australia was recorded in 1910-11, when the harvest exceeded 13,000,000 bushels. No approach The honourable memto this figure was made in recent years, until a superabundant crop in Queensland during 1924 brought the total to nearly 12,500,000 bushels, but the average for the past decade was only 8,000,000 bushels. Moreover, the falling off in the demand coupled with the low market price for the grain adversely affected the industry, particularly in Queensland, and the harvest during 1925-20 was only 7,500,000 bushels. These facts are of vital importance. Not the production of maize is being i m perilled. The fact has been urged that growers when it imposed a duty on",70,Customs Tarif F

Therefore the maize-grower will receive roughly half the duty and the manufacturer the rest. That seems to be a fair and reasonable proposal, and I hope that the committee will support it. I cannot agree with those honourable members in the Corner who say that the company, which has met with abuse from certain quarters, has only maintained its majority sales in Australia because it has from time to time reduced the cost of its products.

This company is prepared to allow its books to be examined by auditors from the Customs Department. I understand that the average profit paid on its original capital is not more than 13 per cent. I remind the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) that Cadbury, Fry and Pascall, the big confectionery manufacturers at Hobart, at times obtain their glucose from the Maize Products Company, and I believe they are satisfied with both the quality and the price. I am advised that, although the price of glucose has fallen from £45 So far as the cost of to £33 a ton, the retail price of a 3-oz. block of chocolate has remained the same throughout the Commonwealth. block been increased? manufacturers have done that. However, I shall not further delay the committee. I was hoping that I would have a more favorable reply from the Minister( Mr Pratten). In closing, I express the hope that if the industry is injured by the dumping in Australia of the United States product, the Government and Parliament will step in and save it. from utter extinction. the debate on this item may be taken as an indication of what is likely to happen in connection with the discussion on other items in the schedule, all I can say is that honourable members who are supporting these higher duties present a pitiable monopolies. I protest, also, against their tactics in drawing a red herring across the trail by endeavouring to persuade honourable members that the maize growers are going to benefit by the imp'osition of these duties. Notwithstanding that there is already a heavy duty on maize, our importations last year totalled 37,000 tons.

Do honourable members realize that this alleged free trade move represents a duty of £12 a ton ? Why then do they persist with such stupid arguments? Other unfair insinuations have also been made in the course of the dabate as to the reasons which actuate those who have spoken in opposition to the proposed increase in the duties. The suggestion that the maize-growers will benefit is absurd. We have heard the same argument before.
