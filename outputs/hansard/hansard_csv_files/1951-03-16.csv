I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether the name of the printer and publisher is recorded on that document ? member for Chisholm hand in that document? question. as the document is in the hands of the Clerk, that is all that is necessary because, by its very nature, it cannot be a newspaper. of order. You liave ruled, Mr Speaker, that so long as the document is in the hands of the Clerk it is in the hands of the House. I ask you whether the publication purporting to be the minutes of a conference of the Australian Labour party, which has been produced by the honourable member for Chisholm, bears the name of the publisher. I ask that question seriously. whether it bears the name of the publisher, and I rule that that is a matter for the Committee of Privileges to discover. about to say previously, it would be wrong for me to assert the truth or otherwise of the reports. However, I point out to the honourable member for Dalley that, if they are not true, the printers and publishers of the newspapers are liable to be dealt with in such a manner as may be determined by this House. The Committee of Privileges should determine whether or not they are true and report its opinion to this House. The House should make every endeavour to ascertain whether they are true or false because, if such practices are being carried out, not in small ways as they have been carried out in the past, but on a scale that leads to reports being flaunted in the public press throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, the dignity, traditions, practices, and precedents of this House are being dragged 'into the gutter to be swept out to sea by a flood of totalitarianism. If honourable members merely vote according to tickets as they are directed to do by persons outside the Parliament, and if they are in no way responsible to their electors, I consider that one general election, whether it be in favour of the right or the left, could enable one political group to gain complete control of the nation. honourable member for Chisholm in order is not the in making a ranting speech with political motives ? ber's remarks are in order. my remarks in order to give force to a vital feature of the motion that I shall now submit. If honourable members have any interest at ail in democratic parliamentary government, they should be very concerned to ensure that the rights and privileges of this House shall be upheld. Therefore I move That any attempt tiy any .person or authority to direct or instruct a member of Parliament as to what he shall or shall not say, or as to how he shall or shall not vote in Parliament is an attempt to induce a. member to violate his oath of allegiance, is a contempt of Parliament and a-breach of privilege.

46,Mr Wilson (Sturt) [10.50],"Idemocracy tkat every member of tbe Parliament should be absolutely free to act and vote in respect of all things according, small groupof Communists^ or of other to the dictates, of"" his conscience. The highest court of the British Empire has held that any attempt by an outside body to impose obligations upon a member of Parliament is illegal and improper. If the statements that have been reported in the press: and that, are contained in the alleged minutes of the conference of the Australian Labour party, to which the honourable, member for Chisholm( Mr stone unturned to ensure that the' ConKent Hughes) has referred, are true able member will withdraw that remark. able member that I shall take action to deal with him if he repeats his offence. and the minutes of thc conference of the Australian Labour party to which the honourable member for Chisholm has referred, are true, those resolutions are totally illegal and ""improper, and any honourable member who acts upon them will commit an offence against the law of the land and the privileges of this Parliament. This matter has been brought forward because it is obvious that, if conduct such governing bodies. That is nowhere more as that which has been reported in the press were to be permitted to continue, democracy in this Parliament would become nothing but a sham; and, in certain circumstances, not the elected representatives of the people but an outside body of persons not responsible to or elected by the people would make the laws of the country. The members of this honourable House would simply be rubber stamps to record decisions made by such an outside body. It is the duty of this House to uphold constitutional democracy and the privileges of honourable members, and the Parliament should take the sternest action against any body of persons that attempts to influence, control or dictate the opinions of honourable members and the manner in which they shall record their vote. It is not difficult to imagine just what could happen if the Parliament failed to take appropriate action to prevent abuses of the nature that have been disclosed, by the honourable member for Chisholm. It is qudtes obvious that if a persons,, by passing, resolutions audi by imposing on& sanction or another upon, certain members, of this House to. compel 1 them to vote in a certain way,, could virtually gaini control of the government of this country and overthrow, democracy im this Parliament.. Therefore^, I trust, that the motion will be; carried and that the. Committee of Privileges will leave na stitution shall be upheld,that democracy shall be protected and that the privileges of honourable members shall be protected. mit that the House should reject thismotion out of hand, and for certain reasons which I shall mention. In form, this motion purports to deal with"" the problem generally, but in fact the honourable member for Chisholm( Mr Kent Hughes) dealt with it by reference solely to the proceedings of the Australian Labour party. As far as I know, neither such a proposal, nor anything like it, has ever previously been submitted to this House. In modern 1 democracies all political parties, including the Liberal party, the Australian Country party, and the political parties that have preceded one or other of them, have evident than in the United Kingdom, to which country the honourable member for Chisholm has referred. I assume for the moment,, without taking any technical points, that the document which the. honourable member for Chisholm produced, is a true copy of a report of the proceedings of the Labour conference. Whence he obtained it, I do not know. Labour conference in relation to certain matters. I invite members of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party to examine their own proceedings and systems of government. It is true that the Labour conference is the supreme governing body of the Labour movement. Every member of the Australian Labour party takes a pledge to abide by the Labour platform. The supreme body that",13,Compulsory Training Ap Provieb Laboub Poeicy Changed

54,Dr. Evatt,"It covers decisions of theinterprets that platform is the Labour conference. That fact is well known. This sort .of objection dates back to pre-federation days, when .the .Labour party wafirst .formed in New South Wales. That was 60 .years ago. In fhe past this matter has been treated not as a matter of privilege in this House, but as a matter of public criticism and disputation in elections. It was said 60 .years ago that the Labour jparty was .governed by an outside'body and the same .old cliche is repeated to-day by the honourable member for Chisholm. The Labour .conference is an inside body which represents the Labour movement, to which every representative in this House pledges h'is allegiance. Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) is bound by the rules and decisions of his party. -the honourable member for Wills( Mr knows the facts to be that the Labour Bryson) say that some one was a liar? liar!"" The honourable gentleman must withdraw the expression. able member that if .he again interjects in that ""way, he will not see the sitting out. The Xabour movement is governed in the way I have described. Parliamentary representatives of the Australian Labour party, having given the undertaking contained in the pledge, are usually prepared to abide by it. If , in any instance, they cannot reconcile the decisions of the Labour conference with their personal views, they are perfectly free to leave the party or to refuse to obey its dictates. That is all there is to it . The platform of the Australian Country party contains, I think, a plank which prohibits it from forming a coalition with other political parties in the Parliament, except in certain circumstances. Is that prohibition binding? Theoretically, every member of the Parliament acts individually and would be free to form such a coalition. Therefore it would be possible to point to a personal conflict between the provisions of such a constitution and the absolute freedom of individuals. In modern times everybody knows that. This .matter is only something that has been dredged up by the honourable member for Chisholm out of some past learning or discussions -that he has had on the subject. I say that there is no sincerity in this motion. -It is simply a rather shabby piece of propaganda put forward on a Friday morning when we have almost disposed of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill (No. 2) and there is not much business before the House, and "" everything goes "". TheI f this were seriously put forward as a matter of privilege in this year of grace 1951, 60 years after the formation of the Labour movement and the adoption of its constitution, there would be no objection to its being considered by a committee of privileges. But I submit that the whole thing is frivolous. Everybody -party conference is the supreme governing body of the Labour party. There is not be a no concealment of that fact. It has been a matter of comment and debate ever since the 'nineties, when the Labour movement was started in this country. Indeed, in substance the same thing applies to all political parties. Perhaps in other instances the control is not so open and democratic. I cannot tell. Very often the control is open, and we have had records in connection with decisions given by the conferences of other parties. I refer to the Australian Country party as one illustration. I do not criticize its constitution. How else could parliamentary business be democratically controlled in a democracy? Does anybody suppose that the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) has a free hand here on everything? a free hand ber for Mallee or the honourable member for Chisholm has a free hand, then every member of their respective parties has an individual right, and, therefore, for combinations of members at party meetings to accept a decision of the majority of these members as binding would be",14,Compulsory Training Ap Provieb Laboub Poeicy Changed

He would be ashamed not to do so,, because he has come here as a representative of its policy. against my party. has twice voted against his party! But every member of the Australian Country party knows that what I say is true, and no one knows it better than the honourable member for Mallee. In substance, the position is the same in relation to the Liberal party and its predecessor, the United Australia, party. that it is not correct, because party meetings of the Liberal party make decisions about what is to be done in the House. Theoretically, every individual member of the party could vote according to his wishes and not according to the wishes of the party meeting. For these reasons I submit that there is an element of unreality about this motion. It is like something from Alicei n Wonderland. The terrible fact has been discovered in 1951 that the Labour party is governed democratically. What is this Labour party conference, this outside body? It is a body that is representative of all the six States. It is democratically elected by 1 members of Labour leagues and trade unions, who send their delegates to declare, define and apply the Labour party's platform. The substance of what the honourable member for Chisholm has said about the proceedings of the Conference is true, whether it is formally proved or not. But I challenge him on the broader ground. I say that it is true, in substance of every political party. The honourable member for Chisholm has been in State politics and knows that. There is no caucus in the Liberal party. Dr. inember for Chisholm say that when decisions have been made by a party meeting that he has attended, he does not regard such m a j o r it y decisions as binding on him? Does he, or does he not? The honourable I heard the rattle. member does not so regard them. members are elected to. the Parliament by I have twice voted the people and not by outside parties. The honourable member House is elected by the people. I ask the honourable member for Chisholm, who has brought this motion forward, whether, if the majority of members at a meeting of the parliamentary Liberal party decided in favour of a certain course of action, he regards himself as bound by the decision. the honourable .member has never voted in It is of no use to say this House against a decision from which he dissented at a party meeting. The parties are an essential ingredient in the democratic system. We are working under a party system, and the supreme governing body of the Australian Labour party is the triennial conference. Members of the Labour party accept the decisions of that conference, which is not an. outside organization, b.ut a body charged w i th the task of interpreting, explaining, and declaring Labour policy. There is nothing wrong w it h that. It is certainly not contrary to any legal rule or principle. The honourable member for Chisholm has merely repeated something that was said by the late Sir George Reidi n 1893, when he was fighting tbe Labour party in New South Wales. It would not be in the interests of any party to refer a matter of this kind to a committee of privileges.

These are powerful influences. I shall not traverse this matter at length. Unfortunately, some honourable members opposite are yapping at me from across tbe table. ter must not use such terms. expression. They are saying across the table that my statements are not true, but members of the Australian Labour party know quite well that affiliated unions have their rights at pre-selection ballots. They know, too, that the former Prime Minister, now the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), is a member of this chamber only because he received party endorsement principally on the votes of coal-miners who act under the direction of their Communist leader, Williams. The honourable meniber for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) principally because they were supported at pre-selection ballots by waterfront and maritime organizations, including the Waterside Workers Federation, which is affiliated with the Labour party. Mr Curtin interjecting, word from the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) ancl he will be sent out of tbe chamber for the rest of the day. Workers Federation is able to determine who shall be elected to this chamber. No man can be elected to this Parliament for a waterfront constituency unless he obtains sufficient votes from the waterside affiliated with the Labour party, and are workers. Minister has said that certain members of this chamber gained pre-selection because of the votes of Communists. I point out that, in New South Wales, every member able member is entitled to raise on a point of order the method of election of members of this' chamber. I ask the Minister to confine his remarks to the terms of the motion now before the chair. I contend that this matter is one that should be submitted to a committee of privileges. It should not he impossible for any Australian citizen to be elected to Parliament unless he has the support of a union such as the Waterside Workers Federation, dominated by the Communist, Healy; or the Seamen's Union of Australasia, dominated by the Communist, Elliott; or the Amalgamated Engineering Union, dominated by its Communist leaders; or the Australian Railways Union, dominated in Victoria by the Communist, Brown. That is the back-bone of the Labour movement, and it is time that it is understood. do not like it, I know. that the Australian Railways Union and the Seamen's Union support Opposition are here members in pre-selection ballots. That statement is distinctly not true. a. point of order. I ask the honourable member to resume his seat. Minister is not true. whether the statement is true or not. The honourable member has not raised a point of order. that the constitution of the Australian Labour party establishes undeniable rights for the membership of unions which are affiliated with it, and I have been enumerating unions which are under the domination of Communists.

Does he expect the press tomorrow morning to report, under bold headlines, that there has been a conversion of the fascist without a shirt, or that one who, only a few years ago, proclaimed his allegiance to fascism, is to-day a champion of democracy and parliamentary government ?

Once the trade union movement had been destroyed or weakened, so that it could no as abominable on the ground that longer protect the people, the Government intended to make a direct attack on living illustrates the split that has taken standards.

The Minister for External Affairs, who is in charge of the bill in committee, favours totalitarian government, and has said as much, but I remind him that we have not yet reached the stage where the people will tolerate totalitarianism. The Government introduced this bill on the pretext that it wished to defend democratic institutions. That is the very line that Hitler followed in Germany. He talked about national socialism. I ask the Minister for External Affairs to answer, if he can, the questions put by the right honourable member for Barton. [12.3] -It is amusing to note the confusion in the rninds of members of the Opposition over this bill. Some have said that the measure is too weak, and will be ineffective. Others have condemned it it is too severe. Their attitude place in the ranks of members of the Opposition. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), who is leaving the chamber, said that this was a bill against the trade unions. Actually, it is a bill for the trade unions. It is a bill against the small minority factions which, in some instances, though not all, is a bill against the Communist old man of the sea who rides on the back of the unions and cannot be shaken off. This incubus cannot be dislodged because, when a Communist faction gains control of a trade union, it rigs the ballots so that it can never be displaced.

I remind honourable members that the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) published under his own name last August the following statement on this subject:Again and again attempts hy an outraged rank and file to sweep out their Oommunist party oflicials are frustrated by red control of the ballot-box. He also pointed out that, although the measure enacted by the Chifley Government for the purpose of curing that state of affairs had been well meant, it had not gone far enough. He declared that the rank and file members of the trade unions were demanding the right to have properly controlled and fair secret ballots, free of Communist interference, so that they might rid themselves of their old man of the sea. The bitter truth, which was well illustrated by the honorGriffiths), is that, when the Communists have gained control of the electoral machinery, it is very difficult to oust them. Clause6 provides for the establishment of effective counter machinery because it will enable a group of members in a union, representing a majority the bill. minorities will represent a majority of the membership in almost every instance. They will be empowered to demand that properly conducted secret ballots shall be held. The honourable member for Shortland described with a great deal of frankness and truth the methods that are adopted by Communists so as to rig postal ballots. He told us that they had printed at some Communist-controlled printery an excess number of ballot-papers, which they filled in and posted to the returning officer, relying on the fact, that many of the genuine ballot-papers issued to members would not be returned. [Quorum formed.] It is obvious that members of the Opposition, who have run out on this bill, do not want to be present in the chamber while it is being discussed.. They do not know what to do about, it. They have been instructed by their party machine to oppose it, and they are doing so, though many of them would like to vote for it, but lack the courage to do so.. One of the reasons for this lack of courage is that their preselections are in many instances determined by the Communist unions, to which they have to truckle in order to retain their seats in this Parliament.

The statement by the honourable member for Wentworth that members of the Labour party are dependent upon the support of the Communist party in winning pre-selection is most offensive to me. to the honourable member for Melbourne honourable member made such a statement, he must withdraw it. the honourable member for Melbourne because, if you will permit me to do so, Mr Chairman, I should like to have an opportunity to prove that my statement is correct. honourable member must withdraw the remark because it is offensive.

233,.. .. .. 53 Motion (By Mr Menzies) Agreed To,"THE EX-SEEVICEMEN Minister) [12.53] I move That the House do now adjourn. In view of recent parliamentary happenings I have tendered certain advice in. relation to the Parliament to His Excellency, the Governor General. I am not in a position to inform the House of His Excellency's reply. Although this may he the last day on which the House will he sitting for some time, Ministers will he called upon to carry out certain administrative duties pending their defeat, and I take this opportunity to urge the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) to give consideration to the need to' review the Government's immigration plans.. There are people in Australia to-day who, although they originally approved whole-heartedly of the immigration scheme, are now beginning to have some doubts about whether it is working out in the way that they expected. I am not raising an objection to the whole body of immigrants, many of whom are quite acceptable persons, and, no doubt, will make satisfactory Australian citizens. My objections are 'based on other grounds. In my opinion, the immigration scheme is ill balanced. Too many people are being brought to this country in too short a time, thereby overstraining our economy. The increased demands for food and accommodation for the immigrants are placinga pressure on our economy that is accentuating the inflationary tendencies. I also wonder whether -some of the people who ar& being brought here can ever become useful citizens. From time to time, the press publishes criticism by various persons in official positions throughout Australia. I refer particularly to statements by high police officials, who direct attention to thedanger of a crime wavethat confronts the Australian community because of the Government's failure, in its administration of this AIR FORCE SNOWY whom we permit to settle here. Police authorities state that because of the inadequacy of the records kept by the Government, and the fact that many of the immigrants have a poor knowledge of the English language, they have great difficulty in carrying out investigations and interrogating those people, and consequently, in apprehending persons who may have committed violent crimes here. When police authorities direct attention to that danger, the Government should not completely disregard their opinions or their advice. The assurance given by the Minister for Immigration that the method of screening prospective immigrants is adequate, is proved to be useless when it is found that undesirables continue to enter the country. I also direct attention to the fact that the Director-General of Public Health in New South Wales has stated that 77 New Australians are receiving treatment in mental institutions. I have nothing but the greatest sympathy for those unfortunate persons; but it must be admitted that if the immigration scheme had been properly policed, and if a psychologist had been a member of the panel that screens prospective immigrants, it would have been impossible for many of those persons to obtain permission t> settle in Australia. They would have remained in their own countries, where they would have been cared for by their own people. As patients in mental institutions in Australia, they are a continuing charge on this community, which it should not be required to bear. I repeat that I have the greatest sympathy for those unfortunate patients, but I believe that they should be cared for by their own people in their own country. The treatment of immigrants on their arrival in Australia is open to severe criticism. I do not blame those unfortunate newcomers who wished to escape from intolerable conditions overseasj and to settle here-. I am opposed to the policy under which the Government brings them here before our economy is ready to absorb them. A few years ago, the immigration",30,Members

235,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [12.54],"experts, after having given careful consideration to every aspect of the matter, decided that 70,000 persons a year was the maximum number that we could expect to absorb into our economy. Yet the Australian Government is now speaking of bringing immigrants here at the rate of 250,000 or 300,000 a year. It astonishes me that a Government can he so callous, and have such a disregard for the welfare of people. The Government appears to deal with immigrants on the basis of the old army method of referring to them as so many bodies. It considers that so long as it can get the number of people it requires to take up the lag which, it says, exists in the supply of labour, that is all it has to worry about. The Government does not worry about whether the immigrants are properly housed and fed, and whether there are sufficient schools and hospitals to meet their needs, but merely brings large numbers of persons to this country, and leaves them to make their own way, heing content so long as certain -branches of industry have an adequate supply of labour. The immigration policy is also caus-> ing difficulties for Australian citizens. The best "" immigrant"" that the Australian community can have is the Australian-born child. shortage is accentuated by the influx of immigrants, and thousands of young Australian married couples are unable to have as many children as they wish to have because they refuse to rear families in the intolerable housing conditions that exist to-day. Because of the continuance of the immigration policy many persons, including ex-servicemen who fought to defend this country, are denied the opportunity to live as ordinary civilized human beings. The emergency housing. centres are most unsatisfactory. Minister for Works and Housing( Mr that has been caused in this country, and Casey) declared that Australia had no slum conditions that could be regarded as a breeding ground for communism. I can only suggest that the right honourable gentleman, if he believes that state-. ment to be correct, has inspected only the housing conditions at Palm Beach. Mr Ward. to Herne Bay, Hargreave Park, Bradfield Park, and other emergency housing settlements, where people live under terrible conditions. That situation is a disgrace. Whilst the Government claims that such housing settlements are only for use in an emergency, they will continue to be used for many years if anti-Labour governments are in office, because those governments will not be able to provide accommodation for all the people who require it. The Minister also spoke of imported prefabricated houses. I shall be interested to learn how many of those structures have been obtained. ] venture to express the opinion that, despite the predictions of the Minister, the number would not run into"" four figures. So far as I know, none of those imported prefabricated structures has yet been made available to accommodate families. Although the life of this Government is drawing to a close, it is not too late for the Minister and his colleagues to act on the suggestions that I have made about the immigration plan. Perhaps an "" immigration holiday "" could be declared so that the country might have an opportunity to examline the present position and the requirements of the people who are already here; and when that The housing had been done, we could determine when the scheme should be resumed, and the number of people who should he brought here. Anyhow, I suppose that it is almost useless to talk to a dying government, and that I should be directing my remarks to my colleagues, who will form the new government after the next general election. I have raised these matters in the faint hope that, in the four weeks or months that may elapse before the new Labour Government takes office, some action will be taken by the present GoLast night, the vernment to alleviate the great distress the great damage that has been done to our economy, by the unrestricted immigration scheme. few days ago, the honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes) addressed a question Obviously he has not been to the Minister who is acting for thc",31,Pabliament Immigration Scheme Properly To Screen Immigrants Settlement Of For The Purpose Of Ensuring That Undesir Hides Royal Ables Shall Uot Be Included I N Those
236,Mr Treloar (Gwydir) [1.3],"AMinister for the Interior( Mr Anthony) about the acquisition of land for the settlement of ex-servicemen in New South Wales. Quite a number of people are complaining that their land is being taken from them at unjust prices. That is contrary to section 51 of the Constituof that State has no right of appeal tion, which provides for the acquisition of property on just terms. Those persons are of the opinion that the Commonwealth, as a party to the scheme for the land settlement of ex-servicemen, should ensure that justice shall be done to the land-owners concerned. I hope that the Minister will make a clear statement to the House on that matter, so that the responsibility of the Commonwealth and of the States may be known to the public. I also ask him to state whether the conditions that operate in New South Wales in connection with the land settlement scheme also obtain in other States. master-General) [1.4] I must admit that the complaint of the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Treloar) is well founded. Indeed, I consider that the New South Wales Government has acted outrageously in the acquisition of land for the settlement of ex-servicemen. Section 51 of the Commonwealth Constitution provides that land may be acquired from iiny citizen only upon just terms. That is to say, if the Australian Government acquires land it must pay fair and just department that the Minister administers i-oiii pensation for it. of appeal to which dispossessed landPersons whose land is acquired by the owners may appeal? recent judicial decisions of the New to the High Court. However, that is South Wales Supreme Court make it not the case in New South Wales, where clear that a land-owner in New South land that is now worth £10 or £12 an Wales whose land is compulsorily acre is being acquired for only £4 or acquired by the New South Wales Go£5 an acre. The Government of New vernment cannot claim the benefit of South Wales is now adopting 1942 section 51 of the Constitution. Important valuations as the basis for its acquisilitigation took place before Mr Justice tions, and in some instances it is adding Roper, the Chief Judge in Equity, some 15 per cent, to those values. This is a time ago, and subsequently an appeal very serious matter for the owners of against His Honour's judgment was land whose property is acquired for the heard and determined by the Eull Court settlement of ex-servicemen, and many of the Supreme Court of New South of them are being unjustly deprived of Wales. The Full Court upheld Mr many thousands of pounds. New South Justice Roper's finding, that because the Wales is the only State that is treating New South Wales Government is a sovereign government, it is empowered to acquire land on any terms that it thinks fit. The effect of the determination is that a person in that State whose property is acquired hy the Government against the amount of compensation paid to him for his land. The New South Wales Government has compulsorily acquired a number of land holdings for the settlement of ex-servicemen. Some of the holdings acquired have been quite small, whilst others have been large properties. However, the size of the property acquired does not affect the principle that a person whose land is compulsorily acquired from him should be entitled to fair and just compensation. If the New South Wales Government believes it to be necessary to acquire certain holdings for the settlement of ex-servicemen we make no complaint about that action. However, it is obvious that the cost involved in settling ex-servicemen on suitable land should be borne, not by the owners of the land that is resumed but by the government that resumes *t. The New South Wales Government has acquired land in some instances, at 1941 values, which, of course, have very little relation to present values. acquires land for post offices.

241,Mr Anthony,"That is not so.land-owners, so unfairly. The governments of ""Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania are administering their land settlement schemes as agents for the Commonwealth, which is providing finance, and fair and just compensation is paid to land-owners. In any event, land-owners who are dissatisfied with the compensation awarded to them have a right of appeal to the courts. The Victorian Government acquires land at current market values, and,. since the removal of land controls early last year, the Queensland Government has also paid current market values in respect of all land acquired in that State. Although the Commonwealth is providing a substantial portion of thefinancefor the New South ""Wales land settlement scheme, that does not affect the legal sovereignty of the Government of New South Wales, and, as I have already pointed out, land owners who are dissatisfied with the terms on which theii property has been com1 pulsorily acquired have no right of appeal. The Australian Government is prepared to shoulder its fair share of the cost of land settlement in New South Wales, as it does in all other States, and goods that do not belong to them, believes that the cost of land settlement should be borne, not by the unfortunate land-owners, who are compulsorily deprived of their properties, but by the whole community. I take this opportunity to dissociate the Australian Government completely from the actions of the New South Wales Government in this matter of land acquisition. We have done, and are doing, everything that we can to protect the interests of all persons forces. As I know from my war-time who are deprived of their property for the land settlement of ex-servicemen. Those' persons are entitled to fair and jusr compensation. The same principle applies, of course, not only to land-owners, but also to' all other persons in the comof the most important items to stockmunity whose property is compulsorily acquired in the interests of the nation. They are entitled to justice and fair play. The action taken by the socialist Government of New South Wales in this matter of land settlement shows just how far a socialist government will go when it has unlimited power. Mr Rosevear having heen given the fall,. to the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), who is now in charge of t i e House, that a number of honourable members apparently desire to speak during this debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House. I remind the right honourable gentleman that the staff of this chamber were on duty until an early hour this morning, and they have been on duty continuously since 10.30 a.m. I therefore suggest to the right honourable gentleman that the House might now suspend its sitting for lunch. I think that we might do so out of consideration for members of the staff, who must remain on duty continuously, whereas honourable members may absent themselves from the chamber in order to obtain refreshment. Sitting suspended from 1.11 to 2.15 p.m. desire to ventilate oncemore a matter which I regard as of extreme importance. I refer to the situationthat has been created by certain merchants who have withheld from the market and which they will probably ultimately sell on commission on behalf of the owners. The goods to which I refer are cattle hides, whioh are of extreme importance for defence stockpiling. Such hides normally would go to the tanning industry, not only for the manufactuire of civilian footwear and other leather equipment, but also for the manufacture of footwear for our defence experience as controller of leather and footwear, leather is extremely important for the equipment of our defence forces. There has been much, talk in this Parliament about stockpiling. Leather is one pile, and yet the Government tolerates a hold-up pending, a court decision. Honourable memibers discuss firom day to day certain workers who withhold from the labour marketthe only thing that they -have to sell-thei r labour. Here isan example of people who are not the actual owners of. the goods that they ai'e withholding from the market.

243,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [2.15],"Ipublio and tbe Government to ransom and prejudicing tbe employment of thousands of workers simply because they believe that if a certain court judgment is favorable to them they will be able to extract from the public, before any control is exercised over them, substantial increases in the price of hides. I am amazed that it has required three questions from me to identify a Minister who might know something about this matter, but so far as I can discover there is little that this Minister does know about it. He said that the Australian Government ihas no power by wbich holders of hides can be compelled to submit the hides in question to the Australian Hide and -Leather Industries Board, and that the State powers in that connection are under challenge. I suggest that the Government has a power of acquisition in view of the extreme importance of this commodity for defence equipment. I suggest that there is a power of acquisition that should be exercised until the market becomes normal, and the powers and functions of the board have been legally established. In reply to one of my questions the Minister saidBy reason of an application to the High has disclosed some knowledge that the Court there is little that the Government can hides have been held up and that a blackdo about the matter. However, it is probable market may continue to exist until the that numbers of these hides are being bought directly by tanners from the stores instead of court gives its decision, and he cannot through the board. The Government plainly admits, in that or they will rot. answer, that there is the possibility of a blackmarket in these hides, which will continue pending the decision of the salted? court. No other interpretation can be placed on the answer. is being withheld? purely for speculation. According to the information that I have had from the able member's time has expired. footwear industry and the admission of the Minister himself in reply to my the risk of being unpopular in the dying question, there 'are interests in this coundays of the Nineteenth Parliament,I try which arewithholding these hides shall bring one matter to the notice of the that are essential for civilian ahd defence Minister for Air( Mr White).

But the Minister also saidHowever, it is probable that numbers of Sporting Sub-Committee, I have received these hides are being bought directly by tanners from the stores instead of through considerable correspondence from very in the board. If that is the case, then a black -market exists of which the Government has knowledge, because the Minister says he has knowledge of it. The Minister continued, in answer to my questionIn any case tlie condition of the hides willcompel the holders to dispose of them within a reasonable time. I shall tell the House a. story, to indicate how long hides will keep. During the war the government of the day found difficulty in getting enough hides. In looking for sources of supply it was discovered that there was a ship near South Africa which had been twice round the world attempting to sell a cargo of hides. We contacted that ship and brought it to Sydney. The hides were purchased by the Government, sold on the market and used by the industry for defence and civilian needs. Therefore it is utterly stupid for the Minister to suggest that stockpiling for the defence forces should be held up until these hides reach a stage of decay which will force the possessors to sell them. If the Government is serious in all its talk of stockpiling, here is an opportunity for it to do something concrete. The Minister dismiss the matter lightly by saying that ultimately the hides will have to be sold preserved.

Although ice hookey is not played to a great degree in this country, it is the national sport of the sister dominion, and the Canadian Royal Air Force team set the world standard in 1948. Of course, a visit by such a team would be of more than ordinary significance. Honourable members who have received copies of a Canadian booklet will realize that Canada is a wonderful country. Advantage should be taken of any opportunity to exchange sporting teams between Australia and Canada. I understand that a naval ship from Canada will be visiting Australia soon. There is a particular significance about the Roj'al Canadian Air Force so far as Australia is concerned, because thousands of our young men went to Canada during the war to complete their training under the Empire air training scheme. During their stay they received the utmost hospitality and co-operation from the Royal Canadian Air Force, and I am sure that many Australians would now welcome an opportunity to strengthen the links of friendship that were forged during the war. Of course, an important factor is the expense that would be involved. Perhaps we could extend an invitation to the Canadian Air League to fly the latest type of aircraft to Canberra, in connection with the jubilee celebrations, and to embody an air l if t of the ice hockey team. I am sure that such a gesture would be well received by the people of this country, and would act as a stimulus to our recruiting campaign. Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [2.31] -The honourable member for Corio( Mr Opperman), who is chairman of the Commonwealth Jubilee Sporting Sub-Committee, has had considerable experience in sporting activities. In that field he has been most successful and I feel confident that he will be equally successful in the jubilee general election, rather late now to discuss anything in and will be returned to the Parliament with a large majority. I was in Canada last year and I know that the ice hockey team of the Royal CanadianA i r Force is very keen to visit Australia. Thousands of our young men were trained in Canada during the war under the Empire air training scheme. The Royal Canadian Air Force ice hockey team is a world champion team, and I believe that it would be very popular in the sporting events to be held in Australia this year. Of course, means would have to he considered to get the team to Australia. Earlier to-day I spoke to the High Commissioner for Canada about this matter, and suggested to him that the Canadian Pacific Airlines may be able to bring the team to Australia. The players could be quartered by the Royal Australian Air Force during their stay here. Alternatively, it may be possible to arrange for the Royal Canadian Air Force to conduct exercises in Australia this year. I heartily endorse the proposal, and I hope that the honourable member's suggestion can be implemented. endorse the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) concerning the difficulties in relation to the projected scheme to bring 100,000 German immigrants into this country. As he stated, the protest is not against Germans as Germans, but against the inadequate screening of the people who come here. The Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) has decided to make this an administrative act rather than to throw the matter open for discussion in the Parliament to see whether things are as he says they are. There is a strong body of opinion outside of this Parliament, in the nation itself, concerning this matter. It would be foolish to suggest that there are not people who have the utmost approval for the scheme, but others ara equally concerned about the difficulties. The Minister has been rather arrogant upon the matter and has insisted that what is proposed can be done by administrative act. But surely this is something that we should be able to consider and discuss. It is this Parliament, since the jubilee dissolution fete is about to be held, but one must go on record in order to apprise",35,Pabliament Immigration Scheme Properly To Screen Immigrants Settlement Of For The Purpose Of Ensuring That Undesir Hides Royal Ables Shall Uot Be Included I N Those

It has been indicated to the Minister plainly, by protest meetings, representations siderable anxiety is entertained about the proposal by people who do not generally concern themselves much with the nationality of people who come into this country, provided they are not fascists or enemies of democracy. Those people have asked the Minister to assure them that our screening is adequate. Has he any evidence to the contrary that the folkedeutsch are Hitlerites? The Minister should consider the history of these people who are on the fringe of the fatherland before he decides to deal with this matter administratively. There are serious reasons why the matter should he more deeply investigated. To ordinary people, particularly war widows, these things exercise n. deep and abiding concern. I shall now draw the attention of the House to the third ingredient which I believe to be the most important in the whole matter. Asi t has been already canvassed, I shall .not overstress it . It was reported to President Truman by General Eisenhower that there were in hitlerized youths, the remnants of the Hitler youth movement, with whom nothing can be done owing to the circumstances of the occupation. These youths could not be de-nazified. They were the recalcitrant larrikins of the occupation. They are now badly trained adults, with a bad outlook on life and they are thinking in terms of revenge. What is to happen to those 500,000 people? Are some of them to be included in the number of Germans that it is proposed to bring to this country? That brings me back to the problem of screening. Let us find out how many people we have to do the screening work. I do not propose at this moment to give the House the particulars that I have upon that matter, but I can assure honourable gentlemen that, according to my information the number is totally inadequate and the officials concerned are lacking in knowledge of idiomatic German, and of the circumstances in which Nazis could infiltrate into the camps that are now being prepared for German immigrants. There is a great body of evidence that the and petitions, that convolhdeutsche are determinedly waiting for Der Tag. Surely we shall not be so foolish as to let these people into this country to constitute a fifth columm. The irreconcilable group to which I have referred appears to be the pool from which we shall draw these so-called splendid settlers. It would be too dangerous to allow a large number of Germans to be brought to this country as a result only of an administrative act by any Ministerf or Immigration. In view of the fact that the present Ministerf o r Immigration is following the grand plan of immigration that was bequeathed to him by his predecessor, he has no need to bo inflexible on this matter. Let him bring it before the Housef or discussion. If everything is fair and if proper safeguards are provided, we may be satisfied; but if safeguards are not provided, the proposal may be disastrous to the development of this country and even more disastrous to the development of our immigration policy, which some people are beginning to mistrust. In that case Germany 500,000 irreconcilable it must be resisted to the finish. A certain amount of unfairness has been displayed in connection with this matter. When the great citizenship convention was held in Canberra recently, a certain group decided that Germau immigration was a touchy subject. There was an angry debate upon it . The chairman, who was Mr Boyer of i ""ie Australian Broadcasting Commission, prayed, first, that a vote should not be taken; and secondly, that the debate should not be reported in the press. Both these things were done. W h y should anything be hidden about this matter? Let the Minister bring it before the House and let us discuss its possible effects upon the future of o.ur immigration scheme and the safety of the nation. In the last few days it has become alarmingly apparent that the Government may order a slowing down or a suspension of work upon the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric and irrigation",36,Pabliament Immigration Scheme Properly To Screen Immigrants Settlement Of For The Purpose Of Ensuring That Undesir Hides Royal Ables Shall Uot Be Included I N Those

It is paradoxical that a project of tremendous value to defence should now be threatened in the name of the defence programme. The Minister for National Development ( Mr progress for many years, it was not until Casey) has told me that the fate of the Snowy Mountains scheme now depends upon the result of a complete, new and drastic re-exam|ination of the whole programme of public works, which is to be undertaken by a committee upon which the Commonwealth will have one representative and the States six representatives. It is notorious that"" in the last few months some State instrumentalities have shown jealousy of the Snowy Mountains scheme and have expressed a desire for the suspension of work upon it. That makes anybody who knows what the fate of the scheme may be in the hands of a committee of that kind very apprehensive. I take advantage of this opportunity waters of the Snowy Mountains area to register the strongest protest against represents a wastage of human effort, any possible reconsideration of this great financial loss to the community, and unwork.

It is an unfortunate fact that, although the value to Australia of the waters of the Snowy Mountains has been recognized since the 1880's and an agitation for them to be utilized was in the regime of the Chifley Government that any action was taken to utilize them. If work upon the Snowy Mountains scheme had been commenced -30 or 40 years ago, we should not now be faced with the present tremendous deficiency of electric power. If Australia now fails to develop to the full the water and power resources of the Snowy Mountains area and suspends works upon the scheme, the result will be a financial loss to the country, in view of the commitments that we have undertaken, of approximately £9,000,000 a year. Moreover, an additional consumption of at least 4,000,000 tons of steam coal a year will be required.

It is not sufficiently realized that we shall not only benefit fro m it tremendously at the end of that time, but also that, progressively through the whole of that period, substantial blocks of power w ill become available for use. The planned capacity of the Snowy Mountains power stations exceeds the combined capacities of all the steam and hydro-electric generating stations that are in operation in Australia to-day. The scheme provides for an output of power one hundred times greater than thc present capacity of tbe Kiewa hydroelectric scheme, and ten times greater than the ultimate capacity of that scheme. capacity of the Kiewa stations? of the Snowy Mountains power stations is 50 times greater than the present capacity of Hume, 130 times greater than the capacity of Burrinjuck-which , for the information of the honourable member for Chisholm, is 20,000 kilowatts-and nearly four times greater than the present total capacity of all steam ahd hydroelectric generating plants in New South Wales. Two million acre-feet of irrigation waters a year w ill be made available to New South Wales and Victoria by that scheme. That quantity is more than four times the quantity now being diverted for use in the whole of the Murrumbidgee irrigation area. It is also five times the total quantity of water in Sydney Harbour. The scheme is financially sound on the score of electricity production alone, without any account being taker, of the gain to the nation of additional irrigation water. merits of the scheme solely from tlie defence aspect, it should be recognized that most of the main generating stations in New South Wales are within gun-range of the coast, and ii re conspicuous and vulnerable targets for hostile aircraft. On tbe other hand, t.he proposed sixteen power stations of the Snowy Mountains scheme w ill be scattered over a, remote area, with, in most cases, hundreds of feet of granite cover as protection against bombing. A completely unfounded complaint has been made that the Snowy Mountains I.2.J] project will absorb an undue proportion of the resources of the country, and that it will not produce electrical power for two or three decades. The fact is that the scheme lends itself to the production of substantial blocks of power in progressive steps. The Snowy Mountains HydroElectrie Authority is confident that the scheme can produce 80,000 horse-power in less than four years, with au additional 80,000 horse-power or even more two years later, and with considerably largei blocks of power following progressively as the scheme advances. Notwithstanding irresponsible statements to the contrary, the authority is not unduly depriving other Australian organizations of techstantly made by officers of State organizations.

270,Mr Menzies,"On two occasions thisI t is a fact that, pending a hearing of a H i g l i Court action which challenges the validity of the New South ""Wales Hide and Leather Industries Act 1948 and certain activities of the Australian Hide and. Leather Industries Boardi n pursuance of that act, certain hide merchants' and brokers' stores are not presenting their hides for appraisement and disposal in normal weekly quantities. The Commonwealth Government has no powers hy which holders can .be compelled to submit tlie hides in question to the board and the State powers in that connection are under challenge. The position is the suhject of urgent consultation between Commonwealth ancl State authorities, but it appears that, hy reason of an application to the H i g h Court, there is little that governments can do about the matter. However, it is probable that numbers of these hides are being bought directly by tanners from the stores instead of through' the board and that in any case the condition of the hides w ill compel the h'olders to dispose of them within a reasonable time. the honourable (member for Lang( Mr honourable member that the likelihood of Mulcahy) addressed the following question to me:I ask thc Minister for Immigration whether it is a fact that numbers of displaced persons arc inmates of mental hospitals in Australia'; If so, how many displaced persons are so situated? Will the Minister intensify thc screening of prospective immigrants, particularly those who come from war-torn countries? I i i m y ireply I indicated that I would furnish the honourable member with any information additional to that contained in statements I had already made. I now furnish the following information:A recent statement by the New South Wales I) i rector of Mental Hygiene was to the effect that 77 new Australians are inmates of mental hospitals in New South Wales. Figures are not readily available for other States, but on the basis of those available for New South Wales it can safely be said that there is no undue incidence of psychosis amongst migrants. Over the past four years, 150,000 migrants have settled in that State and the instance of mental disease in the migrant population is, therefore, in ' the vicinity of five in every 10,000 settlers. The Statistician's yearly figures since 1045 have shown approximately four persons per 1,000 head of population as on the books of New South Wales Mental Institutions and thc incidence in the nativeborn population is, therefore, far in excess of that found in the migrant population. Tho medical selection criteria to which the Australian selection oflicers, including Australian doctors, work arc unquestionably high and pruvidu for the rejection of' any one with a history of mental disease or who shows, any signs of mental instability during selection interview. It can be taken, therefore, that iu all cases where a former displaced person is now an inmate of a mental hospital, the mental disorder, although undoubtedly in thc majority of instances a direct result of wartime ""or immediately post-war experiences, did not become apparent until after the migrant's arrival in Australia. The suggestion that medical selection should be intensified by the appointment to the selection board of a qualified psychiatrist, or by the introduction of special psychiatric tests before selection, has been carefully examined, but it is considered, if properly implemented, to be almost out of the question' and quite impracticable iu thc light of the beneiits wbich might be t dcived. Tests of this nature, to be properly effective. I understand, would need t'o be imposed over a lengthy period by doctors specializing in several different mental conditions. Apart from the time factor alone precluding such tests, the additional presence at the selection board of a psychiatrist would bi' of little avail unless some evidence of the mental disease was apparent at the time of interview, in which event rejection would immediately be recommended in accordance with existing practice. I can assure the psychotic conditions being present amongst prospective immigrants, particularly those from the war-torn countries, is borne constantly in mind by our skilled selection teams and every possible safeguard is taken to ensure that only those who are mentally and medically fit arc accepted for settlement in Australia. The statistics furnished above confirm that the incidence of psychosis amongst migrants admitted to this country is remarkably low. representing the Minister for Social Services, upon notice1.

The National Welfare Fund Act 1943-1950 appropriates from the Consolidated Bevenue Fund for the purposes of the National Welfare Fund the amount of the social services contribution which becomes payable in 1950-1951 and subsequent years on incomes in 1949-1950 and earlier years. Moneysi n the National Welfare Fund arc available for making those payments which are directed by Commonwealth legislation to be made from the Fund. The relevant Commonwealth legislation is administered by the Departments of Health and Social Services and thc Ministry of National Development. 2. The amount of the social services contribution collected for the year ended the 30th June, 1950, was £100,559,869. The estimated collection for the year 1950-1951 shown in the budget papers is £71,000,000. In addition to the social services contribution of £71,000,000 (and apart from tlie pay-roll tax collections of £26,000,000), an amount of £30,000,000 is to be paid out of Consolidated Bevenue into the National Welfare Fund in 1950-1951. This special appropriation of £30,000,000 makes good the loss of revenue for the welfare fund due to the merger from the 1st July, 1951, of social services contribution and income tax into a single levy on incomes. 3. The cost of administration for the year ended the 30th June, 1950, was £1,249,310, which represents .1.46 per cent, of the amount distributed by the department under the various benefits. 4. Payments from the National Welfare Fund in 1940-1950 were as follows:r.i.'iielil:.
