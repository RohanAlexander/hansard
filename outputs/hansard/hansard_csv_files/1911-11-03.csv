Yes","terday afternoon the House resolved that intoxicating liquor shall no longer be supplied within its precincts, but about a fortnight ago the Senate negatived a similar resolution. Must honourable members who occasionally desire alcoholic refreshment be invited to the bar by honourable senators ? Is a notice to be put up in the bar "" for honourable senators only, and will members of this House be expected to go elsewhere when they wish a little wine for their "" stomach's sake,"" as I occasionally do. House are not to be permitted to obtain liquors within the precincts, the bar should be removed to another position, because it is aggravating to have to pass a place where another member is getting a drink when one is not allowed, to get one there himsel f. make a definite statement at 'present, but under the circumstances, if the honourable member wishes to go to the bar he had better get a senator to take him there. the Prime Minister whether he is aware of tion of saying anything that would annoy the state of things prevailing in the norththe Prime Minister.

Has he read what has been said by the Premier of tlie State, as reported in this morning's Age', to the effect that the work of the port must be carried on, and that the Government will take all steps necessary to prevent the trade of the port from being suspended ? Will the right honourable gentleman tell the -House what steps he has taken to co-operate with the Premier of New South Wales to keep the Inter-State trade of the port of Sydney going during the strike? If no steps have been taken, ipri. will he tell the House how he proposes to assist the Premier of New South Wales? 10.30 need be answered is the last one. The others mean nothing but a placard.

I ask the Attorney-Generali f his attention has been drawn to the following statement in this morning's paper, made by the Premier of New South Wales, who saysThe Inter-State wharf labourers are bound by leagues in other States, without any notice to the Government, they suddenly leave work in violation of that agreement. No definite grievance was stated to anybody in authority in order that some efforts at conciliation might be made,, but cessation of work was suddenly brought about by a section of the Sydney branch. own attitude. I will appoint an arbitration tribunal to immediately consider the issue The work of the port must be carried on, and the Government will take all necessary steps to prevent the trade of the port being suspended. Whatever the consequences may be to the Government, they will discharge their duties to tbe community. Under the circumstances, it is the fairest of fair things that the Attorney-General should tell the House and the country what he is doing to co-operate with Mr McGowen to remove these blocks to InterState trade, which it is the special function of the Government to safeguard. That is my question to the Attorney-General, and I now desire to say generally ber must not go on to speak in general terms. to say in another form what I have alreadly said. ber has already asked a question. but I ask the leave of tbe House to say generally two or three words bearing on a very important matter.

26,Mr Fowler,"Why does the honorablecalled to the statement made by MrI f it is not an industrial agreement the ComMcGowen; and the facts, as stated by him, and read by the honourable member for Parramatta, are, to the best of my knowledge and belief, absolutely correct. That is to say, an agreement did and does exist, and it covers members of the union who work in Sydney as well as those who work in every other port of the Commonwealth. It is a fact that, without any notice at all to their organization, or to any of the branches, the men in Sydney ceased work and broke the agreement. of .course, as I have said here previously, that on their doing so, the Council was immediately called together, and the men were asked to resume work, and declined. ramatta went on to point out what Mr of the dispute extending to the other States McGowen had declared his intention to do. arbitrators, I say that there is nothing to arbitrate about. There is the agreement which, the Federation has entered into, and the men must keep it-the y must abide by the conditions, and there is nothing to arbitrate about. are concerned, I know nothing of the terms of the agreement, if any, existing between them and the deep-sea stevedores. As regards this Government, the position appears to be this: Under the agreement there is a provision made for a penalty, which is, after all, nothing but liquidated damages, for the recovery of which the Attorney-General cannot proceed. Industrial Court proceed? asked the Registrar to supply me with a report as to what he conceives to be necessary and proper under the circumstances, and the following are extracts from that document-On reference to clause 13 of the agreement between the members of the union and the steam-ship owners which was filed with me on the 33rd ultimo, it will be apparent that the amount referred to for breach of the agreement is not a "" penalty"" within the meaning of section 78 of the Act, but "" liquidated damages,"" and therefore the proper person to sue for the recovery of the amount is the Commonwealth Steam-ship (sec. 44*), or one of its component companies (sec. 44*). If it is a penalty in the proper sense and not' damages, the agreement itself seems not to be an industrial agreement under the Act, for it relates to industrial disputes in the State of New South Wales only, and not to industrial disputes extending beyong the limits of a State (sec. 4). monwealth Steam-ship Owners' Association can. sue for it also, and the chances of success are therefore much greater than if the Registrar sued for the recovery of the penalty. The foregoing is clearly an answer to any question as to why the Registrar has not sued under, sec. 44 (2) (a). If proceedings are taken by either the Commonwealth Steam-ship Owners' Association or by one of its component companies, or by the Registrar, they would seem to have to be taken,, not against the Wharf Labourers' Union or Waterside Workers' Federation, or the officials thereof, who are apparently innocent, but It is a fact, against some one or more workmen who have actually struck work (sec. 44 (1). As regards the Commonwealth Court of Arbitration, it would be well to understand clearly that it has no jurisdiction to deal with thisNew South Wales dispute by way of arbitraThe honourable member for Partion; but as there was for some time danger the President exercised his jurisdiction under section i6« to call the parties together to prevent the extension of the dispute to some other State. That appears to be the position, and nothing, therefore, can be done by the Government until, if such a contingency So far as the deep-sea men should unfortunately arise, the dispute extends to other States, when, of course, quite apart from the agreement, there would be an Inter-State dispute, over which the Court has jurisdiction. There remains,, then, nothing for the Government to do, and everything that can be done By the organization, as such, has been done. I very much regret the position individually I am perfectly confident in my own mind that the overwhelming majority of the men now on .strike do not desire, and never did' desire, for one solitary half-minute, toI strike. ment of the Attorney-General that the vast .majority of the men now on strike did not desire to strike, who is responsible for the strike taking place ? bers who have had any experience of unions will understand perfectly the position which I put. According to the statement made to me by the Registrar, there were 170 or 180 men present at the meeting which originally decided to strike. There may Owners' Association have been a few more or less at the meetingI am not quite sure-bu t there are 4,700 men, to my certain knowledge, in the union. If that meeting had not carried a resolution to strike, there would have been no strike. That is what I meant; and I am going by what I know of the union-",14,Wharf Labourers Strike

One Jewish minister pointed out that if Saturday were now fixed, it might be proposed to have the election on Sunday on the next occasion. the matter carefully considered. A great race of people, who have played a most important part in the history of the world, should have arrangements, which they consider prejudicial to their interests, carefully weighed. sonal explanation. Last night I so far forgot myself as to say to the honourable member for Wentworth something for which I am truly sorry. That honourable member was man enough to come and tell me that he did not intend to insult me, and I , of course, accepted his statement. That the honourable member had no such intention is borne out by' what appeared in the newspapers of this morning. I mistook the meaning of the words he used, and I apologise, not only to the honourable member, but to the House. mitted to express my deepest regret that I should, even momentarily, have inadvertently offended the honourable member for Maranoa. My regret now is that for one brief moment he should have thought me prig enough not to feel a deep respect for the ability and grit whicli have enabled him to graduate with honours in the university of life's experience.

[11.3] -We should have some statement from the Minister of Home Affairs regarding the item, "" Timber storage shed, £ 1 4 6 . "" I presume that if this item be agreed to if will be followed by a proposal to expend a certain sum on the purchase of timber to be stored and seasoned. periment, I believe, will be found to be impracticable, and neither advantageous nor economical. It is absurd to think of storing in one centre timber for distribution all over the Commonwealth when local requirements can be supplied on the spot. I doubt very much whether there is as much in this idea as some people believe, but even if the Government specified that contractors for Government buildings should use only seasoned timber supplied by the State, I tliink that the scheme would be found unworkable. I am afraid that there is something in the nature of a fad about this proposal, and, as the representative of a district where hard woods are largely produced, I think the experiment should not be proceeded with. If the Government specify that only seasoned timber should be used on a Government work, why should not the contractor for that work be permitted to purchase that timber wherever he desires to do so? There of storing millions of feet of timber, so that it may be properly seasoned. Seasonedtimber can be purchased in Sydney or Melbourne to-day by any one who requires it. I am not so hide-bound as to be unable to appreciate any innovation, but I am afraid that this experiment is due to the fact that the Minister, who has no personal experience, has been led away by the recommendations of others who are also without experience, and that it will result in loss to the Government. The experience of all men engaged in the building trade is that seasoned timber can be purchased, in the sizes specified, in almost any part of the State of New South Wales. If the tf intention of the Government is merely to erect sheds in Melbourne or Sydney, and store timber there, I fail to see how they are going to compel contractors for the erection of public buildings in, say, my own electorate, to carry timber from' the Sydney shed to the district where, peihaps, it was produced. I am willing to giye fair consideration to any innovation that may be proposed, but I hold the view that this experiment should not be taken up, and I hope the Government will not proceed with it. I trust that the Minister will stand by the item. I have been in the building trade all my life, and am satisfied that the Government are w ell advised in taking steps r to secure a supply of seasoned timber. Nothing depreciates the value of a building to a greater extent than does the use of unseasoned timber in its construction, for green timber causes the walls to crack in every direction.

58,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [11.17].,"purposes' in Australia, that there is great difficulty,' for example, in getting timber, especially Queensland pine, for butter boxes. There should be no need for the Department to rent premises for storing purposes. offices in various centres can be made use of for storing timber to be used from time to time in the surrounding districts. I am not enamoured of the idea of patent or hurried seasoning. I question whether it gives the same good results as are obtained from sun-dried or air-seasoned timber. If the Minister proposes to extend his operations iri that direction he will require far more money than he asks for in this item. If he wants to go even further than he now proposes, I will lend him every help, because a good supply of seasoned timber will mean that the erection of our public buildings will not be retarded by a shortage of timber supplies. the Government are serious in wishing to season a lot of timber for use in public buildings they can hardly expect to do it by the methods proposed within the time required. known systems for seasoning timber, and if any of them are to be adopted provision will have to be made on the Estimates for the. necessary machinery and kilns. Storing in sheds is not always the most desirable wav of seasoning. It takes a long time. In England it has been found that the best way with certain timbers is. to leave tlie logs lying in the water until the natural sap is leached out Then the water which has taken the place of the sap is evaporated, and the timber is found to be better seasoned than if the sap had been left in it. As to the statement that timber is not procurable for public purposes in Australia, honourable members can find an object lesson in this building, containing as it does perhaps the finest piece of work that has ever been put up in the way of timbering and joining. If has stood here for twenty or thirty years to my knowledge, and I defy any one to say it was not built 'with seasoned timber. There is nothing wrong with it after all that time. got in Australia. money can get whatever he wants in Australia. Storing a. 'lot of timber in a shed will never meet the requirements of the Department.' They must go a little deeper into the matter. Whatever timber is required can be obtained in the log or the plank fjromthe different States, brought to one centre, and there put through theprocess best suitable for each class. TimThe back yards of the postber is brought to Melbourne in the log. from all parts of the world to-day. I passed a trolley load of oak logs only the day before yesterday in Collins-street. They had come from Japan, and would beseasoned here by 'whatever process was most suitable. The system of seasoning, which is suitable for hard wood is not suitable for soft wood. If the Department stacks a lot of timber in twenty Or thirty sheds, and tries to treat it all by the same process, no good result will be arrived at. The best and most scientific methods known to the world must be adopted. A great deal has been said of the process of Powellising timber by putting it through boiling water or steam, and then treating it with arsenic and sugar,, but I think the boiling or ""steaming has as much to do with the result as the stuff which is put into it afterwards. Someyears ago a vacuum system by which the natural sap was drawn from the timber, There are a number of wellwas established at Port Adelaide, in South Australia, but so far as I know no process has been so successful as that which I have described as adopted in England. Whoever took on the business of furnishing this House knew more about fhe processes of seasoning timber than we do here to-day. so much in a hurrv in those days. ing of the Federal Capital will be done in a hurry. I believe there will be plenty of time to adopt any system known to the world for seasoning the timber that will be required to furnish the new ParliamentHouse there. It would be hardly advisable to use the hardwoods of Australia irr all work. Before money is spend on shedsthe Minister should get the"" best advice obtainable as to the systems of seasoning, most suitable for the woods which he proposes to use. I agree with a good deal that has been said, but I believe the Minister's actionis in the right direction. The question seems to be whether he should adopt somerecognised artificial system of seasoning timbers, or whether he should erect sheds as proposed.""

Consequently it is necessary to procure it at once, and allow 'it to season by exposing .it to the open air, perhaps under cover of sheds. -Our experience has been that timber is now bought direct from the mills and put down before it is properly seasoned, with the result that the floors shrink, and have to be taken up and relaid. with hard woods. timber, but to hardwoods particularly. In one case I put the timber aside for four .months to season, and as a result I had .no trouble with the floor. The Powellising system which is used by a certain firm in Sydney is chiefly intended to prevent the ravages of white ants. The Minister has acted properly in providing sheds so that timber may be obtained from the -different mills within the Commonwealth, .and not imported. If we have"" timber of -our own, we should obtain it and allow it -to season until it is wanted. I can assure the honourable member for Franklin that 'timber is scarce in Australia. present a timber-growing constituency-as I did in the State Parliament-and know -that timber supplies are rapidly being exhausted, and that as a result the price of timber has increased by 5s. or 6s. per 100 feet during the last few years. per cent. within the last eight years. .a loss a few years ago. ber having increased, it is the more necessary that the Government should have its own supply of seasoned wood. -should be stored, not in one State only, but -wherever it is likely to be required, and particularly in the Federal Territory, where there will be so great a demand for it in the near future.

The Our position is that we reCommonwealth would save considerably by adopting that policy. As the honourable member for Hunter has pointed out, storage for timber should be provided in all the States. voted to provide for storage in Victoria. have an explanation from the Minister of what is intended. The need for storing timber has been emphasized by honourable members. I am sorry that the Minister, who prides himself on his progressiveness, has not commenced to grow timber for the Commonwealth. We are asked to vote and re-vote sums for expenditure on the Federal Capital amounting to j£ioo,ooo, and if the whole amount were expended in planting timber in the Federal area, it would make provision for the future which would be very valuable, and prevent expenditure in directions in which it is not yet necessary. We have, too, enormous areas which might profitably be devoted to the planting of timber. Re-afforestation is one of the most important problems that the ComI remonwealth and the States have to face. The States might have done more, and we might have done more. In other countries timber reserves are a most valuable asset. The German Government looks after its forests in accordance with the most scientific and best technical principles, and benefits therefrom to the extent of several millions a year. Most of the Federal area, not being suit-able for cultivation, should be fit for the growing of timber, it having been proved all over the world that where there is a sufficient rainfall timber can be grown satisfactorily on poor country. On the European Alps, land wbich was previously valueless has been planted with Timber trees, and now produces good returns. afforestation appears on the"" Estimates.",19,Estimates Additions New Works And Buildings

Minister of Home Affairs) [n.43] -The Department has had a good deal of trouble at times in obtaining seasoned timber, and complaints have been made by honourable members about the difficulty of getting work done Owing to the difficulty in obtaining assistance from New South Wales and Victorian officials, who have had an immense amount of work to do themselves, although they have done what they could for us, we have decided, in the interests of expedition, to look after our own works in the two States named, and are, therefore, providing timber stores in them, so that if we cannot get what we need from the mills we can draw on our own supplies. On the Federal area we had a great deal of trouble in getting timber, and had to send all through the electorate of the honourable We should make plantations member for Eden-Monaro for it, buying it green. In some of my own houses I find the verandahs looking at me when I go for the rents, showing that the timber has not been properly seasoned. to be stored? necessary for the works we have in hand. Honourable members opposite appear to be afraid that we are going to establish a great branch or department for the sale of timber. There is, however, no such intention underlying this modest vote of £700. .£500 last year. £50 0 ? A decent kitchen could not be put up in some houses for such a sum. One of the projects in the Federal territory is afforestation. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro says that I never do anything without letting the world know; but did I let the world know as to the afforestation worry me about it to-day? The timber stored in the sheds whether the Minister is redeeming his promises. Minister must always do that, because his promises are his capital. I agree with the I honourable member for Wimmera that there are several processes used; for instance, the one in operation in Sydney has cost the present Mayor of that city ^25,000. Possibly later we may have to adopt some process of the kind, which, I understand, has been successful in Western America for over thirty years. They will be required, perhaps, in the building of the transcontinental railway, when there must be timber to resist the white ants. At present, however, we only ask for £700, with a view later to having a shed in each State where timber can be stored and ready for use without delay. We are going to run great industries and have mighty activities in contemplation ; and, we must make preparation, especially in a territory like this, where there is little or no settlement, and everything is in a state of nebulosity.

106,Mr Palmer,"I cannot secure his atnot go far enough. He says that we ought to have our own saw-mills. If the Ministry submitted such a proposition to the people it would probably be rejected, because the country is not yet ripe for Socialism. By passing such items as these honourable members opposite are gradually undermining existing conditions in favour of a state of affairs under which the number of Commonwealth employees will be increased, and those engaged in private enterprise will have to compete with those employed by the State. Such a thing ought not to be encouraged, and I think, therefore, that we ought to reject this item. Representing, as I do, a large and important constituency, comprising the Goulburn .Valley and Echuca districts, I shall raise a vigorous protest against every item of the kind in these Estimates. This is simply the initial movement towards establishing that which the people whom I represent strongly object to. able member represents only a minority of the electors-7,000 , as against 10,000. election I do not think the honourable member will represent any one.

I believe that it will be simply enormous. member will have a chance of stopping anything of the kind by his vote in this House. but, unfortunately, that will not put a stop to the proposal. It is just as well that the public should know that the Opposition are in an absolutely helpless position, so far as the protection of their interests is concerned, since the Government have behind them a majority that is prepared to support them, willv nfTly, right or wrong. This is simply another socialistic move, calculated to be . for the advancement of a party, and not for the well-being of the country. I should not have risen but for the stupid and uncalled-for remarks made by a number of honourable members regarding this question. member must withdraw that remark. who have opposed this item have shown that they have no knowledge of the matter. Users of timber will admit that the Minister has been well advised, for in no part of the Commonwealth can dry timber be purchased to-day. they like to pay the price. tractors in Sydney who are prepared to give 2s. and 3s. per tnousand feet more for dry timber than they are giving for that which is now available; but they cannot get it. Green timber is more costly to work than is dry timber. A joiner cannot use green timber and give satisfaction to the person for whom he is working, and the same may be said with regard to the use of unseasoned timber in the building trade generally. Every system of drying timber tried up to the present time has been purely experimental. Timber can be made fit for use only by atmospheric drying, and honourable members opposite, instead of condemning the Minister, should give him credit for taking action to ensure a supply of dry timber for use in our public buildings. Timber for furniture and fixtures must have been stored for at least four or five years. That which has been put .away for fifteen years is better still, and will pay for the cost of storing. Timber used in the manufacture of pianos is sometimes stored for twenty years. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin that the timber-getters have O'MALLEY -The honourable not been receiving a fair price; but that has not led to any reduction in prices to the consumers. The middleman has been reaping the advantage. Our timber supplies are controlled by a combine, which, either on the ist October or the first of the present month, put up prices by 10 per cent. Our referenda proposals having been rejected, we cannotdeal with such com< bines, and it is therefore more than ever necessary that this action should be taken. I trust that a much larger sum will be asked for to provide for the storing of timber, because seasoned timber must be an invaluable asset to the Commonwealth.

The weir involves the question of whether we are to have a pumping scheme of water supply, or, as the honorI t will be a able member for Swan suggested the other day, a gravitation scheme. Is that question to be decided by the Minister at his own sweet will, or are we to have a say? It seems to me that we have reached a stage when we must insist on some scheme being submitted before we vote further Last night I said that some money. There are other unsatisfactory aspects of the question.

The Minister either knew nothing of the Government being determined to go on with the Estimates this week, or he simply sent those officers away on a fool's errand. If he considered it was necessary to get the information, he certainly ought to consent -to postpone this itemuntil it is obtained. Singularly enough, he tells us to-day that.a report is to be issued to members showing what has been done up to date; but what is the use of giving us that information tomorrow when we are dealing with the item to-day ? In order to test the sincerity of the Committee, and taking it that the Minister has spent .£24,000 out of the £33,ooo, I move That the item "" Federal Capital at Canberra, towards cost of establishment, ,£100,000,"" be reduced by ^66,000. The amendment is a very timely one; and I hope it will be carried by the Committee. At this critical moment, we ought to have regard to the expenditure that must take place if this vote be passed. A warning was given last year when £[50,000 was asked for purely preliminary work; and we had no idea that the Minister would this year submit votes involving an expenditure of between £[300,000 and £[400,000. sands are to be spent this year. ourselves to a policy involving, as the Minister tells us, an expenditure of perhaps £[3,500,000. committed itself to this expenditure by adopting the Constitution. made a bad bargain, we should carry it out faithfully; and I have never lieard any desire expressed by any honourable member to repudiate the contract entered into. But, having selected a site in good faith, it seems to me unseemly to attempt to force an expenditure of millions; all we should be called upon to do at present is to carry out works of a preparatory or preliminary character. I have in my mind more particularly the planting of trees. until the trees grow ? We all realize that New South Wales, as the largest State, may desire to have the Federal Seat of Government within its territory. Personally, I should be prepared to allow the Parliament to sit in Melbourne for twenty years; then in Sydney for twenty years; and then, if practicable, in one of the other States for a similar term. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. is no possibility of calling a halt in the huge expenditure that is promising in connection with the Federal Capital. downhearted. dealt with on purely national lines without our spending more money for' some considerable time on the Capital site. I do not think that the honourable member for South Sydney,, nor any other honourable member, can complain that any desire to repudiate the bargain entered into with New South Wales at the inception of Federation has ever been manifested in this House. Some honourable members think that the Capital site having been selected, we should have proceeded at once to erect there necessary public buildings. very well from the stand-point of the life of one individual, but we are intrusted with the destinies of Australia as a whole, and our first duty is to encourage people to come here, and to assist in developing the resources of the country as speedily as possible. Our public moneys should be expended in that direction before we proceed to a large outlay on ornamental buildings for which there is no crying necessity. If any of our early pioneers who struck out on the land, either as farmers, graziers, or cultivators, had expended the whole of tlieir capital in building elaborate homesteads, instead of fencing in their ground, excavating dams, and otherwise improving the productivity of the soil, they would have found themselves in the Insolvency Court before they had made a fair start in the development of their holdings. But what position are we taking up? We are but a small scattered community controlling an enormous territory comprising 3,000,000 square miles, and there can be no doubt that it is the unmistakable duty bf this Parliament to push on with the 'development of the continent.

We have to take up a new position in the light of the statement made to-day by the Minister of Home Affairs. were told that the item of £50,000 which we were asked to vote towards the establishment of die Federal Capital at Canberra was merely designed to meet preliminary expenses. To-day, however, we are asked to agree to an additional vote of £66,000, and we have forecasted by the Minister an immediate expenditure of £[313,000. be expended on preliminary work, the total cost of which will amount to £[313,000, and we have the Minister's own statement that that work is to be the basis of a further outlay of £3,500,000. This is a very serious matter, having regard to the fact that the present Government has already heaped up the debt of the Commonwealth to the extent of £[14,500,000. not the occasion on which to discuss the whole of the finances of the Commonwealth, but we cannot view this proposed expenditure of something like £[3,500,000 on a Federal Capital without glancing at the growing general expenditure of the Commonwealth. ber wish the public to believe that this Government has incurred a debt of £14,500,000? ber has no reasonable conscience. gentleman might well have waited until I had finished my statement before making such an uncalled for interjection. said that this Government had piled up a debt of £[14,500,000.

In connection with the Northern Territory, we have taken over a debt ol £3,500,000; the construction of the railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie will involve an expenditure of anything up to I £[5,000,000; the liability taken over in connection with the Oodnadatta railway amounts to another £2,000,000; and our Defence expenditure has been increased by about £4,000,000.

I have no complaint to make regarding the way in which our liabilities have been increased to this extent. We shall be able to deal with all This sum of £66,000 is to those matters when the Budget is before us; but I may say that I agree with the principle that, for the development of this great continent, these enormous works must be undertaken. That in itself is the best justification we could have for our objection to an expenditure of £3,500,000 on works at the Federal Capital, which cannot be reproductive, are not necessary, This is and, in time of drought and scarcity, must seriously detract from our ability to enter upon great undertakings that are essential to the development of the country. It is because we have incurred this great liability that I say we should hesitate to enter upon an expenditure with respect to the Federal Capital, for which there can be no justification at this early stage in our history. In view of the enormous debt we have incurred, we must also remember that our taxation has been substantially increased. The revenue from Customs and Excise last financial year is nearly £[3,500.000 in excess of that of previous years, and we have also collected something like £1.500,000 in respect of the land tax. I am not prepared to say now whether or not there is any justification for the largely augmented revenue which the Treasury is enjoying, and to which our wonderful and beneficent seasons have materially contributed; bin, in the light of this enormously increased revenue, and the substantial instalment of direct taxation that has been imposed, and in the light of the liabilities already incurred-amounting , as I have said, to nearly £[14,500,000-it must be admitted",29,Estimates Additions New Works And Buildings

By this vote of £[66,000 we are committing ourselves to an expenditure of nearly £400,000. I desire to know, Mr Chairman, whether I should be in order in moving an addition to the amendment providing that the money be not voted until the matter has been referred to a public works committee. The member would not be in order in moving such a condition, because it would apply a condition to the vote, which is distinctly against what is laid down in May. strongly that I shall take the course of submitting a motion in the House affirming that a Public Works Committee should be appointed. We are faced with enormous expenditure in the case of the overland railway and the Northern Territory, if the latter is to cease to be a mill-stone the establishment of this city. The popuround our necks, and become reproductive. It is too much to ask any Minister or Department to deal with large expenditure of the kind without the assistance of some such body as I suggest, and such as can be found in operation in some of the States.

The sooner we realize the seriousness of the position, and_appoint a Public Works Committee, the better it will be for Australia. to support the amendment. I looked on the Minister of Home Affairs as a business man; but the manner in which he placed the Estimates before us the other night inment, at the same time, should ask us to clines me to waver in my loyalty to that ideal. I have had some experience 'in drawing up estimates; and I know that it is necessary, not only to show all the deStates which do very valuable work, and tails, but to give reasons for the details.

It is only when the Minister finds himself, as it were, in a hole, that he lays before us information which shows an expenditure, not of £[100,000, but of £313,000. It is false economy to ask for only £[100,000 if a larger sum be necessary, because to fall short of funds at a particular period of construction It is stated that the Federal Capital will cost £3,000,000, but I think the figure will prove to be much higher. When, a little time ago, we asked for some consideration to be shown to the members of our Military Forces, we were told that the finances would not permit of it ; and yet we are asked to vote this large sum for the purposes of a Federal Capital. I feel quite sure that if the question were submitted to tlie country, every State but that of New South Wales would vote against lation of Australia is only a little over 4,000,000; and yet it is proposed to have another capital. It is true that in the United States there is a Federal Capital, but it is purely a political city-prac tically dead commercially-and there are 103,000,000 people to share the cost. As for Wimmera, we are faced witli expenditure in other directions amounting to £[14,000,000; and yet the handful of people here are to be asked to provide another £[3,000,000 for this unnecessary undertaking. It seems strange that the Labour party, which aims at high ideals, cannot see its way clear to pay the individuals who are the producing workers of the country sufficient to bring their families up in comfort, and that the Governpass the vote under discussion.

There is, however, one aspect that has not yet been dealt with. It is the determination, I understand, that this city shall be a model one in every respect, and to that end competitive designs have been invited. We are now asked, however, to vote money for certain works, and we are not told whether these will dovetail in with the plans as ultimately adopted. It appears to rae that, in carrying out works at this stage, we run the risk of having to undo them when the plans for the city are adopted. That is not a fair position in which to place the country and Parliament. Before a penny is spent in any permanent work, the whole scheme and design should have been settled.

280,Mr Fenton,"Why erect a weir onbidgee is not a river from which drinking water could be drawn ? can be got from it, if it is tapped high up. I objected last year, and object again now, to the pumping scheme. It is not right to put the country to that great expenditure simply for water-supply purposes. have first to dam back the Cotter, and then from that dam to pump the water up to the top of a hill 800 feet higher, and carry it from the reservoir there across the Murrumbidgee river in pipes; and thence into the Capital. The scheme, now that I have seen it, strikes me as even more '' wild-cat'' £[25,000; road-making and deviations, than I thought it before. I admit that it is beautiful water. I understand that when Victoria comes into her own, the country south of the Murrumbidgee will pass into her possession, and then the water supply of the Federal Capital will come within her territory. Unfortunately, it appears that we are to be committed to a great expenditure on the Capital site; and I believe that, possession of the land yet. as the years go by, and increasing amounts are asked for to carry out this great scheme, Parliament will become more and more doubtful of its wisdom, until, probably, it will refuse to vote further money for the purpose. If we happen to strike a few bad seasons, any Government that goes on expending money on this site will be doing what, to my mind, will be criminal. It must be remembered, in regard to the water-supply scheme, that when a stream like the Cotter is dammed back, and millions of gallons of water are stored in the dam, underneath the surface of that water, as a rule, a large amount of vegetable matter accumulates. That is sure to happen in this case, and considerable trouble will be caused by it. Instead of having a live running stream, the water coming in will just flow over the surface, and over the top of the weir, while the water underneath, which will be taken to supply the city, will be almost dead water, adversely affected by a great deal of vegetable matter, was simply an ordinary bridge to and, perhaps, not conducive to public health. Instead of having a real live graviproved conclusively to me that there was tation stream from a pure source into a dam immediately outside the Federal Capital, we shall be, unfortunately, 'troubled with a bad water supply. Firstly, therefore, we shall have a somewhat deficient supply of water as compared with what we might have had at other sites ; and secondly, we shall be put to a great amount of expense in order to get the water to the O'MALLEY -The Murrumcity. I hope that the bridge which is to carry the water across the Murrumbidgee will be used for general traffic also. general traffic on the one side, and the water pipes on the other. penditure on the bridge a little more We justifiable. The works proposed involve an exceptionally big expenditure. The weir is to cost £30,000; the mains and pipe head, & c , will run into £[140,000; the bridge over the Murrumbidgee will cost .£40,000; the temporary railway from Queanbeyan to the Capital site will cost £10,000; offices at Acton and afforestation, £[13,000; and joinery timber, £[5,000. With regard to the latter items, I expected, after hearing the delightful picture presented to the House by the Minister on the last occasion, to see a number of trees fairly well advanced at Yass-Canberra. some difficulty about obtaining the land; and if it is true that its value is only £[2 per acre on the average, as the honourable member for Wimmera said be given away. On seeing that country, I thought that the words used in the New South Wales Legislative Council, to the effect that the Federation could have this territory, as it was of no good to the State, were very true. What timber is growing diere is very .stunted. When there, I saw a. bridge being built across the so-called Molonglo river, which we called a creek. I learnt from the men engaged on the work that the timber they were using did not come from the neighbourhood, but was brought from a place a long way outside the confines of the Territory. It was not timber of extra size, and there were no difficulties about the work. It span a mere creek. That incident in the Territory a dearth of the materials necessary for building even an 'ordinary town. The Minister is also going to spend a considerable sum on brick-making. If the Government cannot make better bricks there when their machinery is erected than those which, I saw being used in erecting what I understood were to be permanent buildings on the Acton Estate, I am sorry",36,Chairman The Honourable Might Largely Increase The Ultimate Cost

I admit* that I saw the Cotter river under cliarming conditions, which left an impression whicli is hard to remove; but, at the same time, I find from the figures that the flow of 160,000,000 gallons a day is often reduced to 4,000,000 gallons.

It would appear that even the Department of Home Affairs is much in doubt as to the desirability of the site that has been chosen for the Federal Capital, judging by the following circular issued by the Minister for the information of persons, undertaking work thereThe greater part of the city area lies on the Molonglo River, and during periods of prolonged dry weather the river ceases to run. It is readily fordable at short intervals during the greater part of the year, though subject to sudden alterations in volume. In 1891 the highest recorded flood took place, when the waters overflowed the steeled site for the Federal Capital. The maximum record summer temperature is 104 .deg. During winter the temperature frequently falfe below freezing point. I have been informed, too, by residents that the statements are borne out by facts, and that the city will be on practically the lowest part of the site. Round about are some stone-covered hills, but in winter the place is fog bound.

While the revenue is what it is, the expenditure may not be much felt, but the day will come when it will cause great inconvenience. I do not know whether I shall again raise my voice against this project. Hope deferred maketh the heart sick, and the hope of the reversal of the decision regarding the Capital has made my heart very sick indeed.
