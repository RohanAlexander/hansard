If there is any other information for which the honourable member wishes that I can get, I shall be pleased to lay it on the table of the House. the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if the latter has yet made up his mind as to whether all applicants, or only those whom the selection committee has chosen, shall be permitted to present themselves for examination for admission to the Naval College?

His question related generally to certain regulations respecting entry to the Naval College, the true purport of which, I believe, the honourable member understands. The reply of the Minister is that he does not propose to alter those regulations. ister whether, having heard the answer just given, he agrees with it, and whether -he proposes to permit any selection board in this country to prohibit any citizen, or the son of any citizen, from presenting himself for examination for entrance to the Naval College? acquainted with the regulations to express an opinion upon them, and, therefore, should like notice of the question.

Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. make no apology for having taken this course, because it is the only one which enables an honourable member tb bring forward matters of public importance; and that to which I wish to direct attention is of the greatest importance. All will admit that we have in Australia the right material for the making of an ideal army. There are not many nations whose youth would show so much keenness and intelligence in training themselves for the defence of their country as ours have shown. There are not many nations whose youth would be ready to drill at night in the light of a miserable lamp, a non-commissioned officer following at their heels with a lantern in order that the commanding officer might see whether they are or are not in step. But, in spite of their keenness and intelligence, coming more and more hopeless. I cannot imagine any body of legislators framing laws compelling boys to register, and to attend drills without making compliance with these laws compulsory. orable member knows that to-morrow is Grievance Day. not make any apology for taking from private members the time allowed for the discussion of their business. At the beginning, there were very few absentees from cadet drills; and, had an example been made of those absentees, the present state of affairs would not exist.

17,Mr Ryrie,"No doubt.. The Governvoluntary. When the parents of one boy saw that another boy absented himself from parades and received no punishment, they naturally asked why their own boys should attend. Things went from bad to worse, until at last there were 20,000 defaulters. This disclosed a very serious state of affairs, as such a number of defaulters means fhat the scheme is breaking down. Instead of these first defaulters being punished, they were threatened by the Area Officer, for instance, that if they were not efficient for the year, it would be entered against them in their books, and they would have to complete another year's service after the age of twenty-six. Imagine the effect of a threat of that kind upon a boy of fourteen. When I was fourteen, I looked upon the age of twenty-six as something in the far distant future. ference to a regulation or to a section in the Act? was under the regulations. Under the Act, the boys who are defaulters are to be handed over to the custody of a military officer. This means that a boy is supposed to report himself to a military officer to carry out the drills that he has missed. In some training centres, three defaulters may turn up to do four hours' drill. No instructor can drill three boys for four hours. The sergeant-major, who is the instructor, has his clerical work to do in his office, and the result is that he sets the boys to clean out the office, or to clean rifles, or something of that sort, to put in their four hours. This does not make for efficiency. In many training centres, there is perhaps only half a company of boys, and in that there might be only one defaulter. That boy has to undergo four hours' drill. The non-commissioned officer is supposed to go to the training centre-and it might take him two days to get there-in order to drill one boy for four hours. The thing is absolutely preposterous. ber suggest that the boy be birched? to get over the difficulties which they have brought upon themselves. So many wrong and ridiculous orders have been given that I propose to refer to one or two of them. The latest Military Order re prosecutions, promulgated on 3rd August last, is as followsCommandant, Military District. The summons should be served by a member of the Battalion or Area Staff, thereby affording such member a better opportunity of getting into touch with the Cadets on his strength as well as to save, in most cases, a sum equal to the cost of the summons, which is generally charged if an officer of the Court serves same. This means that the unfortunate non-commissioned officer, who is the drill instructor in the area, is supposed to deliver the summonses himself. Let me point out what this means to him. I have taken one country area, and the summonses which were actually issued in it, as an example. With this as a basis, I propose to show the distance that the sergeant-major would have to walk to deliver them-. The distance from a training centre is a limit of 5 miles, you making reand we may take it that the boys who made default would most likely be those living furthest away. There were four training centres in this one country area, and if the sergeant-major had to serve the summonses from those centres to the residences of the cadets who actually had summonses served on them, he would have had to travel from No. 1 centre, 13 miles; from No. 2 centre,. 8 miles; from No. 3 centre, 18 miles; and from No. 4 centre, 27 miles. That make* a total of 66 miles which he would have had to walk; and, at the same time, carry out the many duties he has to perform. The non-commissioned officers are overworked asit is, many of them now having to perform the work of two men each. Imagine one of them having to walk 66 miles to serve these summonses. your part. „ given the summonses actually served OIL boys, and I have also given the distances. district. area, and am not going to name it.

How would he serve the summonses? Besides having to walk from each training centre to the residences of the cadets, the sergeant major would have to take the train to reach the centres before he started walking. crawl! these men are crawlers. They have plenty of work to do. He has to take to Shanks' pony or Irish tandem. That is the only way in which he can serve the summonses. A very important order has been issued in connection with musketry. hensible to me that such an order should have"" emanated from the military authorities. I do not say that the Minister of Defence is personally to blame, though he is nominally responsible. course, rely upon his professional advisers, who are supposed to understand their business. all events, whoever was responsible for the promulgation of this order did not understand his business. The difficulty is to find out who is responsible. I take this particular order out of a number which I consider to be wrong. It must be recollected that these cadets were served with rifles only in November last. month's interval from drill during the Christmas holidays. Of course, musketry is absolutely the most important part of a soldier's training. Even amongst adults a great deal of time is needed for musketry training. Before a man can be called a trained soldier, and can be regarded as proficient in the use of the rifle-that is to say, in its use under all the conditions which may pertain in war-h e has to go -through a protracted course of training. .First of all, the recruits' course takes from hours! drill with the rifle to engage in field six weeks to three months of continuous, training in the use of the rifle. After the recruit is to that extent qualified, he has to go through the trained soldiers' course, which will take probably six months of continuous training. So much training is necessary before a soldier is permitted to engage in field practice. But, in connection with these cadets, an order was issued which required them to engage in battalion competitions with the rifle before they were anything like proficient in its use. There is no getting away from the meaning of the order, which was distinct and definite, and was promulgated from Head-quarters, Sydney to the District Commandants, and from them to the Brigade Majors and Area Officers. In one paragraph, the order saysAll members of the Administrative and In structional Staff will assist in these competitions. That is to say, in the battalion competitions. Further on we find it ordered in connection with competitions thatThe Committee concerned will arrange the match as far as possible in the form of a simple tactical exercise with ball cartridge. Any one who understands anything about soldiering must see what that means. It It is absolutely incompremeans field practice with ball ammunition for these boys. The order continuesThe details of the exercise must not be made known to teams until the day of competition. Ranges will not exceed 400 yards. Conditions He must, of will include an advance in skirmishing order and utilization of natural or provided cover; "" slow"" fire at a fixed service target; snapshooting at disappearing targets and at moving figure; 320 rounds per team will be issued. That is the order which was issued to the Brigade Majors and the Area Officers, to be by them carried out with boys who had had only a few hours' training with the rifle. I have already pointed out that the rifles were only issued in November, and these competitions were supposed to take place in April. The boys had not gone through a course of musketry. Many of There was a them hardly knew what a rifle was. They did not know what the trigger was for, or how to hold the weapon.

I do not know what the results would have been if the order had been carried out. Probably, there would have been loss of life. But the order was absolutely ignored by the Brigade Majors and Area Officers engaged in carrying out the compulsory training system. honourable member alluding? clause (2), paragraph (b), issued in 1911. able member sack, the men who issued the order or the officers who refused to obey it? should be sacked, but something will have to be done, or the scheme of training will absolutely break down. Things are becoming more hopeless every day. WhatI have said is known to be absolutely correct by all military men, and especially by the instructors engaged in carrying 'out the scheme. The reason why the order was not carried out is that the officers realized that it would mean disaster to attempt it. Imagine boys of fourteen years of age, who had had only a few hours' experience of the rifle, engaging in field practice with ball cartridge ! The Department evidently did not realize that a mistake had been made; in spite of the fact that at a school held in July, in Victoria Barracks, Sydney, including all the Area Officers and all the Instructional Staff in New South Wales, a Conference was held, and a resolution passed dealing with this very question. The Minister took absolutely no cognisance of the resolution. To show that there was no recognitipn of any blunder having been perpetrated, I propose to quote from the report by the Minister of Defence on the progress of universal training for the year ended 30th June, 1912. In paragraph 52 we have the statementFor the first year the number of teams competing in the local battalion series has been somewhat disappointingAs a matter of fact, only a few teams from schools and colleges, the members of which had been using the rifle for some years before this system came into force, actually competed. There were no teams from the areas. The officers dared not carry out the orders given. This state of affairs is subversive to all discipline. Is it not absurd that printed orders issued from head-quarters should be absolutely ignored? Such, however, is the fact. To show that the Minister did not realize that any mistake had been made, and that he took no notice of the representations made by officers possessing expert and local knowledge, I am quoting this paragraph, which continuesbut this can perhaps be accounted for by the fact that many of the officers and instructors considered that their companies had not attained a sufficient degree of efficiency to enable them to compete with any likelihood of success. It is not suggested that any danger would have been involved in carrying out these exercises. The Minister misses the whole point. He says, furtherI n future it is intended that area officers and members of the Instructional Staff should be given to understand that any of their companies failing to be represented in the local battalion competitions without sufficient reason being given will be considered as a lack of enthusiasmon their part, and an entry will be made accordingly in their official records. The men are reprimanded for not carrying out the order-for failing to select teams to compete. in the paragraph read by the honourable member. It is merely an intimation that the battalions must be up to a certain standard within a given time. if they do not send along teams in future an official entry will be made against their records. I should like now to refer to a question affecting the pay branch of the Department. Area Officers and members of the Instructional Staff are subjected to very great annoyance and inconvenience and, in many cases, to great loss,_ in connection with this branch of the service. Let me explain the system adopted in financing areas. In connection with each area there is what is known as a contingent fund, made up of £ 1 5 granted for each training centre in the area, and is. per head for every cadet within that area. Out of that contingent fund disbursements have to be made by the Area Officer for rent of office, storerooms, and drill halls, purchase of stamps and stationery, for the payment of markers where there is a local range, and for train faxes to convey lads to ranges when there is no local range available. Under the universal training regulations, each Area Officer is supposed to receive a sum of £ 1 0 to meet disbursements, and when he has expended tliat amount, he is required to forward vouchers and receipts to the Department, which will then* make him a. further",17,Prosecution Of Senior Cadets

This first instalment of £ 1 0 is not given to him at the beginning of the financial year. Sometimes weeks, and even months, elapse betore he obtains it, and by that time he has spent, perhaps, from £ 1 0 to £ 2 0 . in his vouchers, and is then kept out of his money from seven weeks to three months. Area Officer has been out of pocket for the time being to the extent of £ 4 0 or £ 5 0 . The money, of oourse, is eventually refunded, but owing to departmental red-tape tliis delay takes place, and great annoyance and inconvenience is caused. Some of the officers have private means, and can afford to wait for the money, but all cannot do so. This delay in making payment has the effect of causing increased rates to be charged for drill halls, store-rooms, and so forth. who conduct a cash business do not care to wait three months for their money, (ind, as a result of the system, the Departhas led to laxity in the matter of drill.

It appears to me that the real object which the honourable member had in view in bringing forward this motion was to give publicity to some imaginary grievances on the part of the officers themselves relative to our military system. Having regard to the fact that the compulsory trainday's work should be lost. In my ing system has just come into operation, we need to be very careful and guarded in our actions. There is at the present time a good deal of aversion to the system, and the present smouldering fire may easily be fanned into a flame. Once public dissatisfaction with the system is aroused, we may be sure that within a very short time the whole system will disappear. The people are masters of the He sends situation, and they are not going to agree to any system that is not conducted on satisfactory lines. The question is whether I know of instances where an the Government have been honestly endeavouring to carry out this system in a satisfactory manner. is not raised. the honourable member had been present, he would have heard it brought forward. The Government"" have endeavoured during the last few months to meet the position vvith which they are confronted, and the honourable member who submitted this motion Tradespeople, for instance, complains very strongly that the failure of the Government to prosecute the cadetsthat is the main point of his indictmentmy opinion, the Government did everything in their power to meet the position as it presented itself to them and to the public. No one could have initiated any prosecution before such a time had elapsed as would enable the Department to ascertain exactly what number had not complied with the statutory requirements. Taking into consideration the fact that the scheme is in its infancy, we should extend as much consideration as we can, realizing that a scheme'of such magnitude cannot be put into operation in six months, and every one expected to comply. To my mind, the compliance with which the Act has been met is marvellous. Honourable members, in urging that the laxity is due to an absence of a more rigid observance of the Act, lose sight of the fact that there is another side to the question. We have to give some attention to the convenience of the lads and their parents in the fixing of the drills. I do not wish to say a word against the officers, but it must, not be forgotten that, very often, drills are fixed at times which are not suitable for those engaged in industrial callings, and the lads have to decide whether they will lose a day's work or strictly comply with the Act. Very often, both parents and boys may come to the conclusion that it is not fair that a own district, the absence of half-a-dozen wheelers practically lays a mine idle on a",18,Prosecution Of Senior Cadets

45,Mr Joseph Cook,No; that question,19,Prosecution Of Senior Cadets
46,Mr Charlton,"It is raised. IfSaturday. Under such circumstances, do honourable members contend that the officers should have power to strictly enforce the law ? If the House once takes up that position, we may say good-bye to compulsory training-it s death-knell will be struck. The officers should make it their business to get into touch with the lads and their parents, and consider their convenience as much as possible by fixing the drills in such a way as to cause the minimum interference with employment. Unless this is done, we must expect more dissatisfaction. In my own district, I hear complaints every day, and some of these I have voiced here as occasion permits. In the mines there, the work is divided into two shifts, and the drills are fixed for the Saturday, generally when the boys have to go to work in the afternoon. It will be readily understood that a mine manager,' in the absence of a number of wheelers, both under and over eighteen years of age, may practically have to lay the mine .idle, while some of the boys may lose as much as 9s. for the day. It is the duty of the ""officers to ascertain the local conditions, and consider these in fixing the drills; but, up to the present, that has not been done, and I see no justification for blaming the Government. It speaks much for the administration of the Act that it has been possible to bring it into operation with so little friction up to the present. The honourable member who preceded me contended that the sergeant-major should not be compelled to deliver summonses personally. I do not know whether the sergeant-major should be compelled to do so or not, but the system initiated by the officers, before central control was exercised, was very unsatisfactory, and, in New South Wales, cadets were dragged up before the Courts even after an order had been given by the Minister that there were to be no further prosecutions. The officers themselves are endeavouring to too rigidly apply the Act. I realize, of course, that there must be discipline, but .we ought to be very careful how we proceed. We cannot expect all at once to instil into the mind of the young, especially, the necessity of complying with every comma in the law; this can only be done in course of time, when I have no doubt that with wise administration we shall get the people of Australia to cheerfully adopt the system. The lads who expressed strong objection to compulsory training are gradually disappearing ; but, if there be attempts made here to have the Act more rigidly administered, and motions moved with the object of taking the control from the Minister and giving it to the officers themselves, it will prove bad for the system. It appears to me that the complaints emanate from the military authorities, or some of them. Who is responsible for recommending the regulations ? l t must be the head of the Military Forces; but if the system is to live, we shall have to be careful to endeavour to meet the convenience of those concerned. In the case of the Citizen Forces, there is not that necessity for rigid discipline that there is in the case of a standing army; and, while there must be discipline, we ought to display a little humanity. If we do so, it is probable that, in the space of a year or so, the system will become so popular that there will be no difficulty, and the rising youth of Australia will look forward to the opportunity and privilege of drilling for the purpose of becoming efficient to defend their country if necessary. If , however, we begin at the present juncture to find fault, and endeavour to make it appear that there is great laxity, we cannot have satisfactory results. As to the 20,000 defaulters, these were only for certain drills which the lads were unable to undergo j and that diminishes very considerably the significance that might be attached to that large number. Very few of the young fellows neglected to attend drills generally, but only certain drills; and the question they had to decide was whether, in order to attend, they should neglect their occupation, and possibly throw hundreds of men out of employment. In a new system, we can make some allowance for the youth in such a position, who feels that it is preferable to go to work and keep the wheels of industry moving, believing that he is committing no great crime. Now, however, that it is known that all must comply, I believe that there will be no further trouble; but the officers should understand that they should fix the drills at convenient times, so as to interfere as little as possible with the ordinary employment of the lads. would imagine, to listen to the honourable member for Hunter, that the honourable member who moved the adjournment of the House had urged on the Government the more rigid enforcement of the Defence Act. It is amazing to any one who heard the honourable member for North Sydney that any such deduction can be drawn from his",19,Prosecution Of Senior Cadets

It would be still more amazing, if we did not know better the histrionic powers of some honourable members, to see the extraordinary earnestness with which the honourable member for Hunter sought to break down and repudiate a position which the honourable member for North Sydney never set up. strict fact the honourable member set out to show that Departmental methods within the areas are faulty, and I think he proved his case. Hunter told us that we must have some discipline. What sort of discipline are we likely to have in future if the sergeant major is to personally serve summonses upon every person who should be served with a summons in the whole of the military area in which he is employed ? whole system, under such conditions, will be farcical, and must break down. member think that the sergeant-major would have to walk all over his area to serve summonses ? or an allowance for a horse. Does the honourable member for Hunter believe that the sergeant-major should be required to carry out his duty for nothing? areas will not be able to avail themselves of tramways, nor will they have special carriages provided for them on the State railways. They must ""pad it "" if they are to serve the summonses, and if they are kept busy in this way what chance will they have to carry out the work of drilling recruits of the cadet system, for which they have been primarily appointed? The honourable member for North Sydney drew attention to another matter which is of the greatest public importance. It is of more importance to the cadets themselves than to honourable members who may be seeking fo secure support in connection with matters of this kind at the next general election. The honourable member for North Sydney clearly showed that in the present stage of cadet musketry the proposals with regard to firing practice are not safe. It is not from any lack of a desire on the part of members of rifle clubs to co-operate in the trainmg of cadets in musketry that this unfortunate state of affairs exists. Over a year ago the Department was approached by the rifle clubs of Australia, the members of which were all anxious to co-operate, and their cooperation would be invaluable in the country districts for the training of the cadets,, many of whom are the sons of riflemen and marksmen of the different rifle clubs. Speaking from memory, I believe that their desire to co-operate with the Department was, in the first place, fostered by the As a matter of Department, but as soon as the members of the clubs decided to carry out the work in the country districts their proposal was relegated to the pigeon-holes., and has since The honourable member for been lost sight of ber know when, it was relegated to the pigeon-holes ? was made to me about two months ago, and I understand that the difficulty has all ocThe curred within the last eighteen months. -This matter of the training of our cadets to 'shoot is one of very great importance, and the honourable it should be dealt with in a business-like way. We cannot frame ideal regulations for cadets who are marksmen, and expect them to be carried out by cadets who do He is not given a horse, not know how to handle a rifle. That is all the honourable member for North Syd-' ney contended, and he is deserving of the thanks of the House for bringing this matter under the notice of the Minister. not. Another matter to which the honourable member referred was the extraordinary length of time it takes to provide Area Officers with the money necessary to meet their obligations within their areas. It must be within the knowledge of many honourable -members that the statements of the honourable member for North Sydney in this connection are absolutely accurate. In these days, when a number of the members of this House are constantly advocating extensions of Government enterprise, it is a curious reflection that we should find so many signs of the incompetence of Government methods to deal with the simplest business transaction. Here we have the simple matter of paying over money On the receipt of vouchers, and it cannot be done on the nail. What ordinary business firm could expect to carry on its business for a week under such procrastinating methods? What chance would we have to run a great industry, if , before we began the payment of accounts on receipt of vouchers, we allowed them to be three months overdue?

53,Mr Kelly,"A complaint in this regardof opportunities for sarcasm which I do not propose to follow at* this moment Here we have the simplest operation which it is possible for a clerk to perform, the mere payment of money already in the till to some one entitled to it on the production of vouchers; and, although the vouchers are produced, the money is not forthcoming for three or four months, or until some sleepy Department has made up its mind to do what its duty required it to do months before. This practice of defaulting, on the part of the Defence Department, will, if persisted in, lead to the unpopularity of the cadet movement throughout the Commonwealth. It does not make the movement popular with tradesmen, or with those who are responsible for its efficiency in their respective areas, that the Government should not meet their obligations as they become due, and that Area Officers should be exposed to the badgering which the present system exposes them to, and possibly to loss which occasionally results from it. I think that the honourable member for North Sydney has performed a public duty in bringing these matters so prominently before the attention of the House and the Minister representing the Minister of Defence. Adelaide) [3.27] -If there are no other complaints to be made, I propose to offer a few remarks in reply to honourable members who have uttered what, according to them, are complaints against the administration of the Defence Department. particularly regret the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth, because they constitute a charge of incompetence against practically the whole of the officers of the Military Forces, and the administrative staff in particular. As a matter of fact, some of the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney constitute an attack upon the ability and military knowledge of officers whose duty it is to advise the Minister of Defence in many particulars. tions that good men sometimes make mistakes ; that is all that the honourable gentlepossible I have refrained from touching man can make of it. the interjection of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, these officers are good men, but occasionally all good men make mistakes ; and we have arrived at one of those unhappy moments when these good men have made mistakes. In the circumstances, I might almost leave my reply at that, as the honourable member for North Sydney will understand that he has been complaining because some trifling mistakes have been made by some exceptionally good men. As, during the honourable member's excellent military career, he no doubt made a mistake now and again, he might now see his way to withdraw his remarks, and agree that these trifling mistakes by exceptionally good men may be overlooked. takes were trifling. utterance of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who, as an ex-Minister of Defence, is almost as well up in these matters as is the honourable member himself. Seeing that the honourable member for Parramatta had much to do with the passing of the Defence Act of 1909, and that he even put his signature to some of the regulations which are still in force, it is to be presumed that he knows almost as much about them as does the honourable member for' North Sydney. Honourable members will, I am sure, recognise that there are such persons as barrack-room lawyers, just as there are fo'cas'le lawyers, and I suppose that there was never a junior officer either in the Military or Naval Forces who did not think that he knew more than his seniors. Similarly, there never was a citizen who, having passed through either arm of the defence service, and subsequently entered Parliament, did not consider that he knew more I than did all the officers who had adopted the military or naval profession as their life's calling. Minister himself? There may be times when I may think that I know more about these matters than do the senior officers who have devoted practically the whole of their lives to matters military. But during the period that-as the result of the good-will of my colleaguesI have represented the Minister COOK. -Mer e suggesof Defence in this Chamber, it will be conceded to my credit, I think, that as far as military matters.

Buti f he spoke merely for himself, and if the utterance of the honourable member for Wentworth is to be regarded in a similar light, the position, better by criticism. of course, assumes an entirely different character. ber for North Sydney spoke of what he knows. in regard to Area Officers receiving payment for petty expenses are concerned, it has to be remembered that the compulsory training scheme is an entirely new one, that the Area Officers are new to their duties, and that many of them are so unfamiliar with administrative work as to occasionally make more than ordinary mistakes. I suppose the honourable member will be surprised to learn that some of them have yet scarcely a grip of how to make out a return of the expenses which they have incurred. If a claim be wrongly made out by one of them, it is scarcely to be supposed that the paying officers, regardless of the consequences, this remark apply to the criticism of the will immediately liquidate it.

I do not wish it to be understood that the Minister of Defence considers that the scheme is running perfectly, or that anomalies will not require to be removed, or that regulations, nay, even the Act itself, will not needito be amended as the result of more experience. But when we consider that during the last year or so a change has been made from the old system, which, in spite of the laudable enthusiasm of some 20,000 or 25,000 of our citizens who had enrolled themselves as volunteers, was quite inadequate for the defence of this country, to a system which is not only infinitely larger, but the principle of which is entirely new to Australian thought, I venture to suggest that it is being put into operation with comparatively little trouble and with little cause for complaint. to criticism except so far as the honourable member for North Sydney failed to make himself acquainted with certain conditions with which he could have become familiar had he chosen to visit the Defence Department, or to ask for information in this House. I hope that honourable members do not regard my observations as indicative of any objection on the part of the Government to criticism. On the contrary, the Government court the fullest possible criticism, and will be glad indeed of every possible assistance in order to enable them to put this non-party scheme into practical effect for the welfare of our country. I do suggest, however, that more responsibility attaches to the criticism of a member of this Parliament than attaches to that of other citizens, and particularly does honourable member for North Sydney, who has had many years of excellent experience in connection with military matters. I am sure he will recognise-as I facetiously remarked at the outset-that there are persons holding junior positions in the Defence Forces of this country who invariably seniors, and it is just possible .that whilst However, every effort is we are passing through a period of transition in connection with our defence scheme, criticisms such as those to which the honin too publicly, may prove more harmful than helpful. I need scarcely add that it is criticism of a helpful character for I do not suggest that mistakes which the Government will feel grateful.

I hope that the Honorary Minister will tell these men that there is a lot of money owing to them by the Department which they may get on application. We have it on his authority that these men have for months been kept out of money to which they are entitled, and the sooner they send in their claims for it the better. That is the statement which the Honorary Minister has practically made to the House. One of the amusing things in the debate was the attitude of the honourable member for Hunter, whose speech practically amounted to this: "" You fellows on the Opposition side must not complain about the Department. You are all wrong when you criticise it. Leave it to me to sail into the Minister."" honourable member for North Sydney had said, seeing all sorts of sinister motives in his action, and then made an attack on the Department of a quite different kind, warning the Ministry what it must and what it must not do When the honourable member for North Sydney makes a suggestion, it is, according to the honourable member for Hunter, quite wrong. With him everything seems to depend on the side on which a member sits. The honourable member for Hunter must be reminded that he does not possess a monopoly of the right bf criticism. He professes himself to be the opponent of monopolies, and while voluble in his complaints against the Government from day to day, I hope that he will not believe that he has a monopoly of the right to criticise, but will allow the honourable member for North Sydney to make a complaint now and again. ness. He must not impute sinister motives to those on this side who bring facts before the Minister concerning the administration of a very important piece of legislation. The Honorary Minister has told us that a good deal of the trouble has arisen from the fact that many of the Area Officers scarcely know how to make out a return. thing. Minister made use of that remark-that many of them scarcely knew how to make out a return. able member is indulging in shocking misrepresentation. the honourable member for Parramatta that it is the parliamentary rule that an honourable member must accept the word of another honourable member. that you will call the Honorary Minister to order a little later -when a similar incident occurs. It is his custom to sit there and say that no statement made from this side is correct. We shall see how the Hansard report reads. We are all unfortunate over here, because we all understood the Minister to say the same thing. If there is any difficulty in making out a simple return of that kind, it is a sorry commentary on the Area Officers. If after fifteen months' occupancy of their position, He deprecated all that the they do not know how to make out a simple elementary return of expenses, it is a very striking reflection on them. I should like to ask the honourable member for Hunter if it is an unjustifiable complaint to make against the Government that these cadet officers after fifteen months have still no uniforms ? If the honourable member knows anything at all about the matter, he knows that nothing is more subversive of discipline and authority than that a man should not have the requisite uniform when dealing with lads who-have uniforms. One of the first things that should be done by the Department is to see that these officers are properly clothed when they are in positions of authority. It all comes back to thisand this is the moral I want to pointthat the Government are not officering these areas in the way they ought to be officered. It is an old complaint of mine, and the results are being seen every day. The very That is only elementary fairman who should be the king-pin of the whole system is being treated in the way alleged. He has to foot it round delivering summonses to boys who do not go on parade. We are told he has to walk 60 miles in delivering batches of summonses. Is that what he is supposed to do ? He cannot train the army if he is doing that kind of thing. He is, or was intended to be, the man responsible for the efficiency of his area, but, of course, he is not so today, and the Government cannot hold him strictly responsible.

Clause 1This Act may be cited as the Sugar Bounty Act 1012. short and relatively simple measure has reached a point at which we ought to deal with it in a simple and direct fashion. After listening to the statement made by the Minister in charge of it, and the debate since, it appears evident that the passing of the Bill at this time is not justified even by the Minister himself. As he looks rather surprised, let me refer him at once to the Hansard report of his speech, at page 3113 of this session There he mentions the Prime Minister's suggestion that a reforming policy on a considerable scale would probably be best dealt with in the next session. Then, after an interjection, the Minister himself said, "" I am prepared to consider it""-meanin g the policy involved in such a radical Bill"" at any time, because my desire is that the workers shall be safeguarded in this industry, as well as in every other."" The Minister himself, then professes himself prepared to deal decisively with this question; but his Bill is not a proposal to deal with it effectively at the present time. It is merely a postponement, an extemporized means of dealing with it for a short time, until another and more searching measure is introduced, probably largely based on the findings of the Sugar Commission. In the circumstances, this Ministerial proposal is not only reduced to the slenderest proportions and intended to be ex[120] tremely short-lived, but is open, as the debate has shown, to sundry very serious objections. In point of fact, the Bill is hard to defend, either as a practical measure, or on the ground of its legal validity. If it be challenged in the Courts, as rumour indicates, it will mean simply another considerable outlay of money and a long postponement. Why, then, does not the Minister take the action now which he foresees that he will be called upon to take before long ? No doubt the receipt of the report of the Sugar Commission may qualify him better for coping with it more explicitly in some directions; but, at the same time, the proposition which appears to find'more favour with the Minister himself, and, probably, with his colleagues, would give this Bill another characterenabling both the bounty and Excise to dis(Consideration resumed appear. This We cannot do in Committee. That would leave us simply with a Protectionist duty on the sugar industry. All questions relating to the sufficiency or excess of that impost would, of necessity, -be exhaustively considered in connection with the report of the Sugar Commission, now resuming its work. By this means we should avoid the conr tinuance of what honourable members representing the sugar districts evidently consider a serious practical injustice. Indeed, I think the figures, not challenged, quoted by the honourable member for Richmond, speak for themselves. They will come with a shock of surprise to the general public. These show that, since the initiation of this policy, the Excise levied by the Government amounts to £5,879,000, while the bounty which has been paid, or as some say, returned to the growers amounts only to £3,778,000. Plainly then, the bounty and Excise system, which was intended to serve the double purpose of maintaining the sugar industry, and maintaining it by white labour only, has so far failed, that the growers of cane, who are practically employing white labour only, have been mulcted in the sum of over £2,000,000. Of course, it will be pointed out that there is an import duty of £ 6 per ton; and that they pass it on by increasing the price of their product. Still, these figures, if they mean anything, imply that although we have achieved one of our objects, we have so far failed in the other branch of our endeavour. That is to say. we have succeeded in securing to white labour the employment given in this industry, and practically in extinguishing",25,Prosecution Of Senior Cadets

To-day we have an opportunity of dealing with this problem in a simple, direct and practical fashion, by relieving i he growers of the. undue burden of which they complain, contenting ourselves with the operation of the Customs duty of £ 6 per ton. Of course, we first rely upon the undertaking which has been given by the Premier of Queensland, that if this measure be put aside, he is prepared to introduce legislation into the Queensland Parliament securing adequate rates of payment to all white labour engaged in the industry, providing tribunals to which workmen could appeal as to wages and hours, and taking the further step of excluding coloured labour altogether from employment. If those three conditions are fulfilled, it would be hard to say what else we have to ask or could hope to receive. The Minister looks forward with considerable confidence to the operation of this Bill until next year. But why wait for next year, when the proposals which are to be submitted by the Queensland Government can be legalized this year, so that we can put a stop to this levy upon the growers of the very considerable difference between the bounty paid to them and the Excise which they are called upon to pay?

Of course, I am speaking after the event, and in the light of what we all know; but looking back upon what occurred, an error of judgment appears to me to have been committed-n o more and no less. Such errors must be expected occasionally. I regret that one should have been made in this case, because of the delay in the settlement of the question. Personally, and without trespassing on subjects which are not before us, I believe that this Parliament will not cease the pursuit of knowledge in the sugar industry until it is completely satisfied, and has probed its operations to the bottom, and in every direction. Let no mistake be made. Concealment in this matter must be rendered impossible. This is a question into which the Government of this country is fully entitled to inquire, and to push an inquiry to its extreme. The sooner that task is completed the better for every one interested. It is undesirable to discuss a case which is sub judice, and therefore I make no comment affecting the merits. The members of the governing body of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company may be, for all I know, angelic personages absolutely above reproach. I know nothing for or against them, and assume nothing.

The acceptance of that offer would meet the present situation much better than this proposal of the Minister's, which has already been pronounced by pretty high authority to be unwarrantable and unconstitutional. It may possibly be challenged in the Courts, and, if challenged, may involve us in another legal tangle in which we have no desire to be engaged, however much it may profit the legal profession. anything. challenge anything which they believe to be unconstitutional. That is the reason why I urge that the matter should be dealt with in a form of which the constitutionality would be unchallengeable. Here we have a means of settling disputes which are only expected tb last a year or so. On the other hand, we have the means offered by the Queensland Government which should be permanent and unchallengeable at law. Their Act can be brought into operation at once, so that we may have the sugar growers relieved, at least a year earlier than the Minister promises, of the Excise they are called upon to pay in excess of the bourity they receive. workers will receive no benefit, and will have to continue to work for 22s. 6d. per week. proposal of the Queensland Premier is to create Arbitration Courts, to which there is to be an appeal on those very questions of wages and hours for the workers. Before those Courts, these questions can be settled in the light of experience already acquired. Jt is claimed that experience shows that [120]2 the present wages are insufficient; and they certainly appear to be open to challenge. The promise is that the Courts will be established in the State where the industry is conducted, where all the circumstances do not desire to prolong this are known, and investigated far more successfully on the spot than by tribunals afar. Hence, it seems that it would be a reasonable and a nationally profitable I believe thing to put aside this measure in its present shape for the time, so as to allow both the Excise and bounty to go. On the State legislation, to which reference has been made, being passed by the Queensland Parliament, before our present session closes, surely the Minister would have every guarantee for the policy he desires to see introduced free from the risks, vexations, and possible legal costs involved in this proposal.

I have always taken the stand that if we abolish the Excise and bounty we must take care that the public are not too much burdened by the rate of the import duty. I am therefore pleased that the honourable' member for Ballarat has mentioned that the amendment which he has submitted is to be incidental to the consideration of what ought to be the import rate, in the light of the information supplied to us by the Commission. I do not wish to say that the present protection goes to the grower or the miller, because we are at present somewhat in the dark as to who gets the bulk of the money that the sugar consumers of Australia and the Treasurer are giving to some persons connected with the industry. the Opposition says that the public pay the Excise. we apprehend the question.

It was asserted in 1905 that one company was making 10 per cent, before 1901, and that its profits ""in 1905, under the operation of these duties, amounted to something like 70 per cent. I hope that the Commission will inquire into these matters, and I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it should be the aim of both parties to see that the Commission is armed with whatever power is necessary to enable it to deal expeditiously with the questions that have been submitted to it. On the whole, it seems to be a rather precipitate act to challenge the validity of a measure which has yet scarcely had an opportunity to be put into operation, and the validity of which may not be questioned at all if the proceedings under it are temperately conducted. We know, of course, that there is always a chance of the validity of an Act which imposes a penalty being challenged, but one does not usually look for such difficulties until they arise in the ordinary course of administration. If we are going to abolish the Excise and the bounty, we ought, perhaps, to provide that they shall cease on and after such-and-such a date. That is usually the way in which we deal with an alteration in the Tariff. Meantime, why should not the Premier of Queensland bring in his Bill? for some years of protecting the men engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland. About twelve months ago it was pointed out in the Conciliationand Arbitration Court that, in some cases, there was absolutely no protection for the worker. It was said that on one side of a roadway in a town in North Queenslan8 the wages of a particular class of operators were 7s. or 8s. per day ; while men doing the same kind of work on the other side of the road were receiving ios. or IIS . per day. One set' of men was under a Wages Board, the other was not.

If we adopt the policy of ultimately abolishing the Excise and the bounty, and allowing an import duty to remain-that was the policy adopted by Sir George Turner, and it is referred to in Dr. Maxwell's report-it will be possible for us to carry it out if the Queensland Government pass with expedition an Act providing for fair rates of wages in the industry. That, however, does not close the question. I am pleased, therefore, that the Leader of the Opposition has said that,",28,Sugar Bounty Bill

In fruit production, the price of sugar is a very important element. It was pointed out a few years ago that the duty of j£6 per ton meant something like 130 per cent, off the value of the plum crops. That is to say, the men who had to pay the dutypaid 128 or 130 per cent, less for the crop than they would otherwise have done. On some crops it represents something like 70 per cent., and so on; and no doubt it is a very large addition to the cost of production in manufactures, such as those carried on by confectioners and brewers. It has been stated that the addition is something like 40 per cent, in connection with the sweetened milk industry, and, therefore, we ought to take these matters into consideration when we have the interests of the people at heart. Sugar has been regarded, I think, by the Labour party as one of the necessaries bf life on which import duties ought to rest rather lightly. That used to be part of the policy of the South Australian Labour party. industry in Australia there would be no duty on sugar. some duties. duty ? pared to abolish the duty? dustry in Australia. I should be prepared to abolish the duty. considerate; the Minister would put a tax on a man who does not exist. There is nothing in abolishing a duty that is inoperative. A duty of j£6 a ton is a very heavy pressure on the consumer. If it is proposed, within a reasonable time, to establish a Wages Board in Queensland, there is scope for the adoption of the policy recommended by the honourable member for Ballarat; but, in the general policy, there are considerations which we must not overlook. We have to consider, for instance, what is the external price of sugar. I do not know what the price is at present in the world's market. think. because there was a dearth of sugar in the we once start the indusfry there under any last two years or so, and that led to a request that Russia might be relieved from and allowed to export some of its surplus. The conditions of 1901 will, I believe, be brought about again shortly, owing to the Sugar Convention having been abandbned by some of the principal countries; and, if that is so, we should have cheap sugar again, as we had ten or twelve years ago. We ought to know what is the external price, and what it is likely to be for the next twelve months, and also what is the internal price, so that we can see to what extent our policy may be leading to a higher rate for local sugar than is justified by the world's market. What the producers are paid is one of the matters to be considered. The question of who pays the ExciseI shall leave to others; all I know is that the Excise is ultimately paid by the consumer. Then there is the question of what is the difference in price between crude and refined sugar. It was stated five or six years ago that the difference was only 25s. in Europe, but that it was much more here. I think the difference in Europe is 35s. somewhat significant, and I hope the Sugar Commission will tell us something about the matter. I should like the Minister, if he can, to help us to find out what is going on in Japan and some of the other eastern countries in sugar production. A good deal has been written on the subject, and I believe that Japan is developing her refineries very much. If so, I am confident, from what I have seen, that the export market will hot exist for us. now. cannot even meet our local consumption. In an article in, I think, the Financial Review, it was pointed out that there are labour difficulties in the sugar industry of Japan, but that, if some of these are got over, the sugar industry will develop largely. The position is that any hope of export to the East may be affected by the fact that the eastern countries are themselves manufacturing. I mention this because I stated yesterday that at present we are producing only a very small proportion of tEe total The Northern Territory might give many 7",29,Sugar Bounty Bill

If , by an import duty, we offer an inducement to large production, surely I am entitled to information as to the possibility of placing the product; or, otherwise, we shall be placed in the position of Europe, where full prices were paid in the producing country and the sugar sold elsewhere at a low price. Before the Convention, many industries in England were flourishing because they took advantage of the sacrifice of revenue and consequent lowness of price caused by the bounty given in exporting countries. sugar production reaches the point of Australian consumption, why should the producer not take a holiday, instead of producing for people in other countries? apparently agrees with me When we talk about our great sugar industry, we cannot say that the limit has been reached that will satisfy us; and if we do develop the industry under a mistaken policy of excessive fostering, we ought to know where we can place the product. Independently of that, we ought also to know what is to be the rate of duty in order to cover the addition to the wages paid at present. It may be a £ 6 , a £ 4 , or a £ 3 duty. probable, but it might be. Knowing what the industry is, and the number of people engaged, it is very unlikely that even a £ 6 duty is required on our present consumption in order to enable fair rates of wages to be paid in Queensland. We do not desire to get from the import duty alone the money necessary to pay a fair rate of wages. Surely the wages are not to be made up altogether by the import duty. of duty and the rate that is actually paid might be covered by a shrinkage in the profits to some extent. If we find that one branch of the industry is receiving undue profits, let us understand to what extent those profits are caused by our import duty; and, if the producers do not surrender the proportion that is necessary to keep labour in a proper condition, it is our place to correspondingly reduce the import duty. I hope that on this point we shall be given some information. In Canada, they deal with some monopolies by reducing the duties. They deal with patents, for instance, in that way. Government have the power to suspend a duty without referring the matter to Parliament. good deal of talk about combines and trusts, but I might remind honourable members opposite that it was part of the policy of the last Government, as is shown in a memorandum which was printed by the present Government, to introduce machinery which has since been adopted in Canada in order to investigate combines and trusts, without the necessity of the delay and expense of litigation. An Act has been passed by the Dominion Parliament of Canada, to which I may subsequently refer in a debate in this House, which is acknowledged to be working very effectively to control combines. What is required is done simply by a thorough investigation as a preliminary to any judicial proceeding. A body of experts is appointed for the purpose, and its powers of inquiry have been found to be ample. stitution give the Canadian Government more power than we have under the Commonwealth Constitution? question.

We have not properly decided the full effect of our legislation on this subject. There is a test case before the Court on which a judgment may be delivered this week, but if that judgment should be adverse to the Crown, it will not follow that we have not the power to make our Act more effective. As a matter of fact, one part of the Act was amended in The difference between a fair rate 1909.

I hope, therefore, that honourable members will not think that because we may fall in our legislative progress, we cannot get up again, and, it may be, go on with greater strength, taking more care to discover how our Constitution may be applied. When the honourable member for Capricornia was reterring yesterday to -combines, and suggesting that he did not hear sufficient condemnation of them from this side, I was tempted to remind him that in 1902, some honourable members on this side predicted what would take place. I have a quotation here from a speech made at the time, but 1 do not wish to inflict it on the Commitfee. us at that time thought that the result of the policy then proposed would be to give the command of a great part of the local markets to some of the refining companies. I find that in February, 1902, I saidThe proposal to hand over upon the present estimate ,{,'500,000 annually-a n amount which will probably have increased by 1907 to ^700,000 --to one or two trusts is a perfectly monstrous one. I have not the slightest doubt that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company being cognisant of what is occurring here, in conjunction perhaps with another companyI think there was another company operating then. will by that period practically control the whole I do not think we should hesitate to take sugar production of Australia, and will thus add ta their profits tbe loss occasioned to the Commonwealth by reason of the abolition of the Excise. I further saidThe high duties of £ 6 and £ 1 0 will stop imprecept which I learned very early in my portation, and therefore the whole of the revenue, both import duty and Excise, will go to the producers-to a trust whicb will control production. That is where local production is not equal to the local consumption. Whether there really is a trust or monopoly is a matter for investigation. I can assure honourable members opposite that I can speak for the whole party on this side when I say that we are quite as anxious as they are, when we really know the facts, to prevent any body of men obtaining too great profits as the result of any policy we place upon the statute-book. At all events, we are quite as anxious as are honourable members opposite to see that the producer and the labour employed in the production of sugar shail get a fair share of any sacrifice the Treasurer makes, as the result of any policy adopted by this Parliament. There is a good deal in the statement of the honourable member for Angas that, on many points in connection with the sugar industry we require more light. We do require to know to what extent the duty collected on sugar has swelled the profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. not say. able to find that out in time. I should never be one to prevent the fullest inquiry to ascertain what we are perfectly entitled to know. If the people of Australia, in order to keep the sugar industry going, are prepared to impose a duty which has the effect of raising the price of, say, sugar to the consumer in Australia, they are entitled to know to what extent that duty swells the profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. If the Government are prepared to treat that company fairly, I think they will have no difficulty in finding out how much of their profits are accounted for in that way. WhilstI admit, with the honourable member for Angas, that there is a great deal in connection with the industry on which we require more light, I do not think that should prevent this Parliament at once dealing with branches of the industry upon which we have the fullest light. whatever action is shown to be necessary in the interests of the producers and workers in the production of the raw material. Looking over the discussion on the second reading of this Bill, I was reminded of a lifeO, what a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive ! orable member had finished speaking? heard honourable members for whose intelligence I have always entertained the very highest appreciation give utterance to sentiments which, in my opinion, showed that they had been totally unable to ascertain what the true effect-of the legislation which this Parliament has passed in connection with the sugar industry really is.

Had we imposed an Excise duty direct upon the growers of cane by coloured labour, we should have known exactly what we were doing. position to do thaf, so we did what we had a perfect legal right to do. We imposed the Excise duty indirectly upon the manufacturer, and, through him, we penalized the grower who grew his cane with coloured labour, and that is what we did it for. We did it to penalize the cane-grower who employed black labour-to get rid of coloured labour-and if the Excise and bounty had not operated in that direction that class of labour would not have been dispensed with. Surely that must be patent to all. Yet honourable member after honourable member opposite has told us that the Excise is not paid by the grower, but by the consumer. How any sane man can make such a statement. I am utterly unable to comprehend. There is the fact that we imposed the sugar Excise for the purpose of penalizing the cane-grower who employed black labour. That it did penalize him is perfectly evident, seeing, that black labour has disappeared from the canefields. member say that the Excise has penalized the cane-grower who employed white labour ? has, but not to the same extent. It penalized the white grower, owing to the peculiar way in which it was allocated, to the extent of £ i per ton instead of £ 4 per ton. I admit that for every ton of cane that is consumed in Australia the consumer pays £ 6 per ton more wholesale than, he would be required to pay if there were no sugar grown in Australia, and if no duty were imposed upon it. £ 6 per ton more than we would otherwise be called upon to pay for this commodity. states that not only does the consumer pay the £ 6 per ton more for sugar, but he also pays the £ 4 per ton Excise duty. Such a statement is absolute nonsense. Whilst the consumer does pay jQ6 per ton-or , to be strictly accurate, £ 5 ios. per tonmore for sugar than he would otherwise be called upon to pay, the operation of the Excise and bounty is merely a shuffle of the cards between the growers, the refiners, and the Government. It does not touch the consumer at all. As proof of that, I say that if the bounty and Excise were abolished to-mbrrow, the price of sugar would not be changed to the extent of a single farthing to any consumer in Australia. This Parliament imposed the Excise duty for the purpose of penalizing the cane-grower who employed black labour. That it achieved its purpose is abundantly evident. If the sugar Excise were paid by the consumer in the true sense of the word-in the way that the Excise, say, upon beer, is paidand if the sugar bounty were really in the nature of a bounty, would the growers be such idiots as to ask the Commonwealth to dispense with both ? us to dispense with the beer Excise. ter. If the consumer really paid the Excise, aftd the grower really obtained the bounty, the latter would be getting in the open market £ 4 per ton more for his cane than he is getting to-day, apart from the honourable bounty. In other words, he would be getting an additional £ 7 per ton. Yet he is anxious to dispense both with the bounty and the Excise. He does not want them. Their removal would not affect the price of sugar to the consumer to the extent of a solitary farthing. worker ? only two States in which sugar is grown in Australia, namely, Queensland and New South Wales, although I know that there is some talk of sugar being eventually grown in Victoria. In New South Wales, the industrial legislation permits of the workers combining to secure the establishment of a Wages Board, and of that Board determining what rate of wages shall be paid in the industry. Consequently, the workers there are fully protected. In Queensland, at the present time, there is before Parliament a Bill which, in a few days, will become law, and which will confer just the same protection upon the workers there.

The information on which J have made my calculation was not given to me by the gentleman -referred to indirectly by the honourable member for Herbert, but by growers in my own electorate, who have been engaged from their boyhood in growing cane; intelligent men, who know what they are talking, about, and have a better practical acquaintance with the industry than any member of the Committee. Working on the information which they have supplied, I have found that the increase in wages made by the Minister equals 37.5 per cent., and that the decrease in time worked is equivalent to an increase in wages of 17 per cent., or 54.5 per cent, altogether. the world is that a man can do as much in eight hours as in nine or ten.

If the alteration made by the Minister be reckoned as equivalent to an increase of only 50 per cent, in wages, it means an increase of 7s. 6d. to 8s in the cost of producing a ton of cane, so that when I said that the increase was 6s. 6d. per ton I was below the mark. Even if a man can do as much work in eight hours as in nine or ten, there is still this increase in cost. Now, according to the growers, 75 per cent, of what they receive for their cane is paid away in wages. The honourable member for Darling Downs gave figures which had been arrived at by a grower who had kept careful accounts, who had only £112 a year as a return to cover interest on his investment, and all expenses except labour. Allowing that the cost of production is now 75 per cent, of the amount received, it will be seen that to add 50 per oent. to that cost makes it impossible to carry on the industry; and is it to ba wondered at that from every sugar-growing district come telegrams to the effect that cane will not be planted this year? heard before.

The average rates of wages prevailing in the remaining three districts, which are. producing probably 90 per cent, of the sugar of Australia, are something like the rates that were fixed in the recent order. duce only 10 per cent, of the total output of sugar? not think that it produces more than 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, of the total. sugar contents of the cane are less as we come down south? tons of cane grown in No. 1 district will produce 1 ton of sugar, whereas 10 tons of cane grown in No. 4 district are required to produce the same quantity. That a., the estimate framed by the Department of Trade and Customs in connection with the payment of the bounty. No one has said that the rates fixed are unfair or unreasonthe whole of our industrial legislation is to able. Indeed, I think that every honourable member would desire to see at least those rates of wages paid.

Are the old conditions to be allowed to continue while the Commission is sitting? Is it fair that whilst some employers are paying the higher rates that are set forth in the schedule which I have just read, and which has been prepared from information obtained from an absolutely reliable source, less scrupulous persons should be allowed to pay lower wages? The information which I have just put before the Committee was obtained from men who have nothing to gain by giving incorrect figures, and, as a matter of fact, it has never been challenged. All the papers have been seen by some honourable members of the Opposition. They were made available to honourable members, and have been placed from time to time on the Library table. I obtained them for the information of the honourable member for Darling Downs, and neither he nor any other honourable member has questioned the figures. Is it fair that some growers who are prepared to deal justly by their employees should pay the higher rates, while others who are less scrupulous get their employees to work for less? not holding up the Commission. they are. growers ? Some of the growers are paying the higher rates. some should be able to do a little better than others? the less scrupulous, "" Do as you please""? Is it not a fact that one of the objects of protect the fair employer from the sweater ? Even when the appointment of Wages Boards in Victoria was opposed by the Employers Federation, some fair-minded employers asked for them, because they said that whilst they were prepared to pay reasonable wages they were dragged down to sweating rates by unscrupulous persons ' in their respective industries. It was to compel the unfair employers to pay fair wages that the rates were fixed. This Bill is to allow the whole question of wages to be decided at the outset by the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court or by a Wages Board. The proposal made by the Leader of the ppposition will not carry him one step forward. If the honourable member says that as a matter of principle the Opposition do not desire to refer the question to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, well and good.

They should have received 36s. a week and their keep, and you must pay that amount""? Would not the honourable member say at once, "" If the dairymen had known that they would be required to pay those higher wages they would probably have run their industry on different lines""? I hold that in all fairness we should let the growers know what they have to pay before the work is actually done, instead of compelling the Minister to withhold the bounty if he finds that unfair conditions have beeh imposed or unreasonable wages paid. looking the fact that the Premier of Queensland has promised to bring forward a scheme for a Wages Board. ber for Capricornia has said that, if the regulations have had no other good effect, they have given the field workers an opportunity to obtain a Wages Board, an opportunity never before afforded. it. knowledge any award it may make. probably legally unsound? legality of the proposition is a question that we cannot decide. It is said that many workers have been dismissed in consequence of the rates of wages prescribed. I have here the Sugar Journal, in which there is an article headed, "" The latest attack of Tudorism,"" setting forth a number of motions which the branches of the Cane Growers Association are asked to pass. One of these is as followsThat the members of the Association bind themselves, and hereby undertake, not to pay any higher wages than they did last year. The growers are asked to bind themselves to that resolution. As to the dismissal of men, there is the following advice contained in a circular letterIt should be remembered that the harvesting is mostly done by contract, and that the cost, as a rule, fully amounts to the wages now prescribed by the Minister. It would, therefore, be advisable, wherever possible, to get rid, at once, of all labour, such as chippers, & c , and the bounty could not, in such cases, be withheld. This resolution asks the growers to so act as to compel the workers to appeal to the Minister; and in another article, in which I am described as "" a political highwayman ""Justice of the High Court a worse name not long ago. worry me very much. the Sugar Journal? Association. The circular letter contains the followingAll the farmers are asked to do is to withhold payment of the new rates so as to avoid, by their own action, aiding the Minister to establish the new standard, which he is illegally endeavouring to enforce. I take it that I am not illegally endeavouring to enforce anything; all I say is that, until the case is decided, the bounty will not be withheld if these rates are paid, but that the bounty will be withheld if less than these rates are paid. I take it that no Minister of Trade and Customs, when once regulations of the kind have been issued, would refrain from doing his best to see that they were given effect to. I trust that honourable members will net oppose the Bill simply because it happens to be a Government measure, but that they will, on' the other hand, admit, as I think they must, that it is to the interest of the grower to know exactly his position before the work begins, instead of waiting until it is completed and new rates are prescribed by the Arbitration Court, or any other tribunal. The discussions on this question are, in my opinion, fully justified, because, not even excepting bread,. is there a commodity in such common use as sugar. Other food stuffs may be used by certain sections of Cane Growers the community, but sugar is used in some shape or form by every person from the .cradle to the grave.

To-day the honourable member comes forward with a return prepared by some hypothetical person, who alleges that for a number of years in the Richmond electorate the average cost of the cane has been from 15s. to 16s. per ton. My reply is that, under those circumstances, this person has been growing cane for less than nothing, because .and the cost of refining may be taken at the returns show that 16s. has never yet been paid, minus the bounty, in the Richmond district.

There is not farmers. Yesterday I cited figures to show an honourable member opposite who would the benefit it had been in certain centres havevoted money to satisfy any claim of of my electorate.

The Company pay the Excise as the sugar is taken out of bond; but they add the £ 4 , with the other charges, to the price of the sugar.

The Minister referred to the Aitswork hard enough or he could have earned tralian Sugar Journal, and I should like it. to make a quotation from the same publication for the 3rd August, 1911, a little earner ? more than a year ago. Senator Findley, who is Acting Minister for tion which I am not competent to decide. External Affairs, has laid it down that if wages and conditions ruling in Australia are to be paid to white immigrants, and there is no strike in progress or contemplated, requests for permission to indent labour must be granted. The editor goes on to comment upon that in this wayWhile the Minister is engaged in deciding all these points, however, the season for which the labour is required, may, as in the case of the sugar growers' recent applications, have passed by. Then the application is cancelled, as was done by several of the sugar-growing districts recently, and the State loses the advantage of suitable immigrants, whilst the industry suffers. My object in reading that extract is to show that, notwithstanding what may be said, these men are employed for only a portion of the year. No one knows that better than men who have traversed the sugar district. Their work lasts as a rule from five to six months. season. general work. In the north of Queensland there are nearly three months during which it is quite impossible to get on the land on account of the wet season. The growers start planting, perhaps, in April, and if they happen to be very fortunate complete this operation in May. _ Ih July the crop has to be harvested. Quite 90 per cent, of the harvesting is done by piece-work, and this regulation will not affect that work at all. Indeed, it is highly probable that in order to get inside the regulation the whole of the work will in the near future be done by piece-work. At the present time harvesting is done by piece-work, and chipping, in some places, is undertaken by the lineal chain. tween the rows of cane the scarifier has to be used, and between the stools a hoe has to be employed for chipping. cited by the honourable member, will the grower experience any trouble in getting the bounty ? to be reasonable. not earn the standard rate of wages, the member quite accurate in his statement that the standard rate of wages need not 'be observed under these conditions? I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether that is correct? that an average man by working a certain number of hours per day at so much per ton can earn the standard wages, how can. it be proved that he cannot earn it? the honourable member is right in his contention. Will the Minister say whether he is right? Minister will not go outside the rule which obtains in any district in regard to harvesting which for years past has been done by piece-work. I shall not pursue this lineof argument any further. But before concluding my remarks I should like to read a letter written by the secretary of the Sugar Workers Union of Australia, which appears in the Age of this morning. These workers are federated now, and are becoming a powerful body. The letter is as follows :SIR, Would you kindly grant me space to make public the methods adopted by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to prevent the employees obtaining a Wages Board? I may, perhaps, be permitted to digress for a moment to say that I omitted to mention previously that the rate of wages which I quoted from the Sugar Journal applies only to the employees in sugar mills. So far no Wages Board has been established in BeQueensland to determine the wages of rural workers. Last week they sent a petition around the works asking the employees to refuse a Wages Board, and those selected to take it around told those that they asked to sign it that it would be better for them if they signed it, and that thc company would grant them an increase of 2s. a week at Christmas. I may state that to my mind the fact of telling them it would be better for them if they signed it contained a threat of dismissal in the event of a refusal. It is not surprising to me the attitude the company is taking to prevent the union obtaining a Wage* Board for the industry, because I happen to know that in 'Sydney about 1905 or 1906 the",42,Schedule Cane Industry Rates Of Wages For Coming Season

Thanking you for insertion of previous letter -Yours, & c , G. Union of Australia. 16th September.

It was stated by those in authority that in some rooms of these establishments men and boys were working absolutely nakeda condition of affairs which is not creditable to us as a community. Sub-clause 2 of clause 2 of this Bill providesOn the bearing and determination of the appliwith the Queensland legislation cation, the President, Judge, person or persons, shall have all the powers which, under the Excise Procedure Act 1907, belong to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I would point ^>ut that section 5 of the Excise Procedure Act of 1908 sets out thatOn the hearing of any application no party shall (except by consent of all the parties and by leave of tile President) be represented by counsel or solicitor. I ask the Minister whether he will permit a similar provision to be inserted: in this Bill so as to make it quite clear that without the consent of all the parties to a dispute counsel shall not be employed? [5-57]-I would not like this debate to close without making one or two observations upon this Bill, because the sugar question is one of very great moment, not only to the two States which are interested in the production of sugar, but to every part of the Commonwealth from the point of view of the consumer. I have endeavoured .to closely follow the discussion, and to gather information from those honourable members who represent sugar-growing districts. It seems to me that the first and principal object of this Bill is to force the employees in the sugar industry into the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. In his closing remarks, the honourable member for Capricornia reminded the Committee that his party specially represented the workers, and that if they miss the opportunity which presents itself under this Bill, when they The union, in the again appear before the electors the employees in the industry will say to them, "" You were in power, and you had the opportunity to allow us access' to the Arbitration Court, but you neglected to avail yourself of it . "" I think that the honourable member will agree that this is a fair representation of his position. to consider how much the sugar industry will stand? Judging by several of the speeches which have been delivered, it is doubtful whether, in some of the districts, an additional burden can be placed on the growers without destroying their profits altogether. The testing time for the industry has arrived. The honourable member for Ballarat proposes the entire abolition of Excise and bounty. land will provide a local tribunal to deal with the question of wages. What was the original purpose of the bounty ? It was to do away with black labour, and it has been so far successful that to-day only a small percentage of the labour employed in the cane-fields is coloured. The honourable member for Ballarat, in submitting his amendment, told the Committee that the Premier of Queensland would undertake to introduce a Bill prohibiting the employment of coloured labour in the cane-fields, and that provision would be made for a tribunal to deal with the question of wages. with the question on the spot more do honourable members opposite want ? tion of New South Wales? sugar is grown in New South Wales, and it is grown entirely by white labour. more black labour employed in New South Wales than in Queensland.",43,Schedule Cane Industry Rates Of Wages For Coming Season

On what ground do honourable members representing cane-fields resist the concession that is offered in the abolition of bounty and Excise? amounts to £ 4 a ton, and of it £ 3 is repaid in bounty, making the collection for revenue purposes £ 1 a ton. If that amount of revenue be surrendered, it will be a disand a bonus, which subsequently became a tinct advantage to those engaged in sugar growing. the Queensland growers are practically unanimous that the bounty and Excise should be abolished at the earliest opportunity. Black labour is practically a thing of the past, as the Prime Minister must admit. my opinion, if the law were relaxed, in three years 25 per cent, of the labour employed would be coloured. ment is at variance with the statements of other Queensland representatives in this and previous debates. However, the matter is not one of speculation. There must be statistics showing what proportion of the labour in the cane-fields is coloured. The Queensland Government proposes to introduce legislation to put an end entirely and for ever to the employment of black labour in the cane-fields. South Wales? no black labour is employed there. black labour to any extent is employed in New South Wales, surely the Labour Government of that State may be trusted to go as far as the Liberal Government of Queensland in this matter. The statements of honourable members show to me that, at any price, and despite the interests of this position filled newspapers and pages of big industry that has cost Australia so much, honourable members opposite will not abandon their power to drive those engaged in the industry to one particular Court, or, it was a physical impossibility for white rather, before one particular man. ister and Treasurer) [6.10] -As I ha.d not the pleasure of hearing his remarks, I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition had in his mind in moving the omission of the word "" bounty.""

The standard of comfort of a white man keeping a wife and family does not enable him to compete with a coloured man who had no obIn ligation whatever to civilization, and seldom had wife or family. The object was to enable the white man to compete with the black man in an industry where manual labour is employed to a larger extent than in any other industry that I know of. A white man with a hoe, and a coloured man with ahoe, are nearly on an equality. It is only in the arena of machinery and technical skill that the white man has no need to trouble about black competition. black man gradually and surely.' dealt with the repatriation of the Polynesians.

Ten years afterwards we hear from that side of the iHouse quite a different prowill not start at all, and the grower reposal-to do away with both the bounty and the Excise. I agree with that, and always have agreed with it . I have always held that the Excise and bounty were merely superstructures for the purpose of the transformation of the industry. Unlike the honourable member for Herbert, I did not tell the sugar-growers at the last election that I was against the repeal of the Excise and Bounty Acts, but I advised them not to agitate for their repeal, and had good reasons for so advising them. would never have got the same return for his cane, small as it is at the present time, were it not for the fact that there is a difto give a."" fair return to the labourer, the ference between a payment by the Government and a. payment by the buyer of his raw material. It put him in a more impregnable position to be receiving returns from two sources, because the small man always knew that he would get the bounty exactly in cash from the Government, and he could more easily calculate whether he was getting a fair deal from the man who purchased from him the raw material from which sugar was produced and ultimately sold. It is for that reason that I have always strongly advocated the existence of those two enactments until such time as there could be brought forward a proposal such as this, but of more far-reaching consequences, to enable a Judge ""of the High Court, sitting as a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, to determine what is a fair remuneration for the worker to get, and the proportionate shares that should go to the actual white grower of the cane, and to the small miller, leaving it to be discovered what the refiner and seller should do with the commodity that they deal with. That is a policy which has been as much advocated by the honourable member for Ballarat as by myself or any one clear, run sary. regards the sugar industry. grower is as helpless as the sugar-worker under open competition. The sugar crop at the most valuable time is absolutely worthless unless the miller will take it and crush it for him. agricultural commodities, in a time of scarcity the price increases, and a man gets a larger return for a smaller amount, but in the case of a failure or partial failure of the cane crop, possibly the mill ceives no return. The growing of cane absorbs all the energy and time of the grower, and the loss of a crop is a veryserious thing to him. described the whole thing as a gamble. well the industry is a very good one, but when things are otherwise the result can be expressed very emphatically. Unfortunately, in the present year there will undoubtedly be a very small crop, and there I believe that the small grower are difficulties in consequence; but any one who says that there is not sufficient money in the sugar industry in all its branches grower-that is, the owner of the holding -the sugar-miller, and the refiner, with a large margin to spare, has never looked into the industry. I cannot understand why we as a'National Parliament should hesitate to send the whole matter to a competent Court which has been established by this Parliament, and get that Court, with its powers, to deal with the evidence, sift the question, and determine it finally. The honourable member for Ballarat speaks of dealing with the matter in little local districts. the Court to deal with the whole of Queensland and New South Wales? deal with them, in three months. those concerned. ing with the large Colonial Sugar Refining Company.

I have stated publicly for the last six or seven years that the superstructure of Excise and bounty should be wiped away as soon as we had a competent Court to deal with the question. imply that if we had local Courts in Queensland and New South Wales dealing with local disputes, that would prevent the workers going to the Arbitration Court on appeal ? The honourable member would set up a Court which would allow an appeal to another Court. That would lead to difficulty and expense. It is far better to set up, in the first instance, a Court from which there would be no appeal, and whose ""decisions would be final, definitely settling the matter that it is a practical proposal. Why? The"" in one act."" act. sible thing to do. I ask honourable members not to get it into their minds that this Bill deals only with the wage of the workers. far more than that. It is in the interest of the small grower as well as of the worker. It gives him the protection of a Court in his desire to deal justly between the persons whom he employs and those to whom he sells his product. As soon as the growers fully comprehend that position, I venture to say that they will be agreeable, and exceedingly anxious, that the power should be given to this Parliament to enable it to establish a Court to insure that justice will be done to all parties. A question has been raised as to the effect of this amendment. It simply means nothing beyond creating a discussion. It is meaningless so far as this Bill is concerned. It does not attempt to improve the measure. It simply tests the question whether the method proposed -should be abandoned or not. be passed now, or whether it should be held over until the Queensland Legislature has taken action. orable member is entirely in error. What is now proposed would not attain the object he desires. I believe it would fail to secure a settlement of this important question, because it would prevent a Court being established which would deal with several individual cases on the evidence, and would leave it to a Government, which is the least satisfactory method, to deal with matters of this kind. We believe that we should go to a Court to get a final and definite determination on the evidence. There are many other features of the sugar industry which I should like to discuss, but this is not the proper time. As soon as the grower can be assured of protection regarding the value of his product in selling it to the miller, and the miller can be guaranteed against the refiner, and we get that general power to deal with all these mattersa power which, I think, is necessary to the CommonwealthI shall be heartily inclined to support the abolition of the bounty and Excise. My suggestion was carried to Queensland, and came back here in a letter from the Premier, Mr Denham. I say State, in my opinion, has power to prescribe what kind of labour shall be employed in any particular area. That can be done by a State Act. I do not think that this Parliament has power to deal with such a question. asked the Law Department a question on that point? I believe that an opinion has been given that we have power. the opinion was on the lines that we had not the power. I admit that, looking on the Constitution as a layman, I entertained the opinion that we. could discriminate between persons. States? commit myself to the specific statement, the Crown Law officers may have given an opinion to the contrary. The language of the Constitution led me to Eelieve that we had power to distinguish. In the earlier years of this Parliament, when the matter was being debated by the lawyers -and there were four or five distinguished lawyers in the Cabinet of which the honourable member for Ballarat was a member -the assumption was that we had not that power of distinction.

345,Mr Fisher,"Yes. But I would notexists, and that they can do as they choose in the matter. members, as I have suggested to my electors, that this superstructure of Excise and bounty ought not to exist any longer than is sufficient to accomplish its object. Some honourable members say that the object is accomplished, and that practically white labour is now employed in producing nearly all cane. should continue the bounty and Excise. But do honourable members recollect that there is a difference of £3 per ton in favour of sugar-cane grown by white labour? Do they know that £3 is the difference 'in favour of the grower of the raw material of the industry-the cane? It amounts to nearly half-or at least 40 per cent -of the amount the grower receives for his cane. If we remove that barrier, and leave others free to employ coloured labour, we undo all our work of ten years. It would be stupidity and want of foresight to wipe out that work. That is an answer to the statement of those honourable members who say that we have accomplished our object in securing the employment of practically all white labour in-the industry. I say that we should be courting disaster if we did what is suggested. No other country in the world has developed a great tropical industry by white labour. What we have done is unique in the history of our race. It is a compliment to this Commonwealth of which it can be justly proud that we have accomplished it. I am not concerned to deny that the work has entailed considerable expense, nevertheless the advantage to Australia has been considerable. In the teeth of opposition, this National Parliament carried its white labour policy into effect. It has since worked successfully. I trust that the opposition to this measure will not be carried so far as to press the amendment to a division, because I am just as heartily in favour of the idea underlying it as the honourable member for Ballarat is. But, to use the title of a distinguished playwright, whose work was recently produced, "" The Time is not yet Ripe."" It is nearly so, and I trust that something further will be done in the matter in the near future.

I am not aware that any statement has been made by a member of the Opposition indicating such an objection. On the contrary, we are anxious that the question should be referred to a competent industrial tribunalThe present system, I admit, is unsatisfactory. It is desirable that the growers, before they proceed with They therefore ask why we their work, shall at least know what rates of wages Will be recognised by the Minister; and all that is attempted by this amendment is to secure a definite expression of opinion that it is desirable that the bounty and Excise shall be at once abolished. If carried, the amendment would have the effect of indicating that the Committee was desirous that they should be abolished. Apart from that, we only ask by this amendment not that the present Bill shall be rejected, because there is no determined opposition to it from this side of the House, but that it shall be postponed until the Premier of Queensland has had an opportunity to carry out his promise. There is no objection on our part to an increased wage. Honourable members on this side have indicated from time to time that they welcome the idea of an increased wage being paid in the industry. We do not object to the Bill as a Bill, or to the principle contained in it, nor do we object to an increased wage. But what we do say is that negotiations of a very satisfactory character have been Though going on between the Prime Minister and the Queensland Government. The Prime Minister has definitely announced that he is in favour of the abolition of the bounty and Excise, and he has been 'fortunate enough to obtain from Mr Denham, the Premier of Queensland, a promise to introduce and pass legislation having for its object the prohibition of black labour in connection with the industry. of decent wages? In the first place, I am anxious that this important matter shall not be dealt with piecemeal. We have an opportunity for its practical settlement, not in a piecemeal, but in a comprehensive way. The Primeham's proposal is essentially practical, and one that completely meets the situationIn all these circumstances, what dowe suggest?

It is quite clear that the Excise is not paid by the consumer, but by the grower; and I again urge that the proposal to postpone this measure to enable the Premier of Queensland to carry out his promise should be accepted. sire to place on record my fear that, if the Excise and bounty are abolished, the sugar growers of Queensland and New South Wales will be in a worse position than they are at present. Honourable members opposite are of opinion that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the other' millers will, in such an event, pay the growers the amount now represented by the Excise. owners will pay 8s. 8d. per ton more if the bounty and Excise are abolished. But what did the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the other millers do in the pre-Federation days? Did they pay the cane-growers anything like the price now received, including the bounty? I have information from the Customs authorities to the effect that, prior to Federation, the cane-growers were paid from about 7s. od. to 15s. per ton, whereas they have since received from 13s. to 16s., with the 6s. bounty added, making the price of cane from 19s. to 22 s. per ton. My fear is that, as the Prime Minister said this afternoon, if we abolish the Excise and bounty, the industry will revert to coloured labour. We have been told that Mr Denham proposes to introduce legislation ; but let him do so, and pass it, and obtain the Royal assent. I remember that, when an endeavour was made in the Queensland Legislative Assembly to prevent aliens taking part in the industry, the Bill then passed was refused the Royal assent for, I suppose, certain reasons advanced by the Imperial authorities ; and we have yet to learn that the Imperial authorities will conin any particular industry. sent to a measure such as is now proposed by the Queensland Government. singular fact is that not a word was said by the Queensland Government as to remedial legislation, nor was there a word from my honourable friends opposite about an agreement to improve the rate of wages, until the Minister of Trade and Customs brought down this Bill. I believe that honourable members opposite, including the Further, honourable member for Moreton, were on a deputation to the Government in May, 1908, the object of which was to protest against the Ministerial regulation or Ordinance providing that the growers should pay 30s. a week for casual labour. cerned, that is not true. member's statement.

How he is to enact such legislation I do not know. I know that we would not have the power, for example, to say that Chinese shall not be employed in the cabinet-making industry in Melbourne. I am. very doubtful whether any Government will be able, to pass any legislation providing that aliens at present in Australia shall not engage If we abolish the bounty and Excise legislation The of this Parliament we shall bring about a condition; of affairs which is described in a report made to the Minister of Trade and Customs by Dr. Maxwell.

It is a very singular thing that this report has never been printed. I ask members of the last Government to explain that. made, but it only came in just as we were going out of office. said. In this report Dr. Maxwell refers to a report made to the Queensland Government by the then Queensland Health Officer, Dr. Ham, as to the conditions of Kanaka labour in the sugar industry, in which there is a special reference to fhe Fairymead plantation, owned by Messrs. Young Brothers. This plantation was conducted on such highly moral grounds that the owners ran their molasses into the river rather than permit rum to be made from it. infamously that the Philp Government at the time suppressed Dr. Ham's report. Dr. Maxwell says in his reportConcerning the treatment of coloured labour, recourse is had to conditions that existed during the operation of the Queensland "" Pacific Islanders Act."" In his report to Sir Edmund Barton in iqoi, the writer says :"" In general, that provision (Pacific Islanders Act) is most amply complied with; but that has not rendered impossible given cases of violation of the Act, and certain of those of a reputed flagrant character."" In explanation of this statement, the Royal Commission is advised to call for a report, which was made by Dr. Ham. in igoi , as Health Commissioner for Queensland. Dr. Ham's report deals with the state of the Kanakas and their living conditions upon tbe estate of the Young Bros., nt Fairymead, Queensland. Dr. Ham's report was suppressed by the Queensland Government of the day. A private copy was furnished to the writer; but as the State Government had suppressed the document, it could not be commented upon by officials excepting by general reference, such as was made by the writer in the report to Sir Edmund Barton, already referred to, which reference was made at that time in the expectation that the suppressed document would be called for. The attention of the Royal Commission is directed to the suppressed report in order that the writer may not bave occasion to speak publicly of the document; and also that the Royal Commission, observing the reported outrageous treatment of the Kanakas by given persons prior to the advent of Federal legislation, may duly appreciate the possible recurrence of such conditions if the coloured alien again comes under the control of such persons without the protection of the Commonwealth. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, it that is the particular mill in their paris estimated, produces from 30 to 40 per ticular zone. If the mill-owner considers cent, of the raw sugar manufactured in the price asked for by the cane-grower Queensland. site have spoken of agreements made by the growers with millers, in which it is stated that the millers are prepared to pass on to the growers the amount now represented by the Excise duty should that duty be removed. But the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has made no statement the report as to its intention to increase the price paid to cane-growers under its immediate jurisdiction and supplying cane to its mills. I remind the honourable member for Richmond that there has been a continual fight in his district between the sugar-cane farmers and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and that a number .of the farmers in that district have gone out of cane-growing altogether, and have turned their attention to dairying, because of the unsatisfactory methods of the company. The same thing applies from the Richmond River right away up to Cairns, where the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has large interests and a number of cane farmers But they treated their Kanakas so under its control. I believe that if we were to abolish the bounty and Excise legislation the position of the sugar-growers would be no better than it was prior to Federation, and it would possibly be a great deal worse. They would not get a greater share than they are now getting of the ^6,000,000 which the public of Australia pay for their sugar. Honourable members can imagine for a moment what the position would be. We have the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the millers united under an honourable understanding, so called, to charge certain prices for sugar, and to pay certain prices for cane. mills, too? Queensland, when a Government central mill was asked to purchase cane from a grower who was not satisfied with the price paid by the mill nearest to him, the Queensland Government refused to compete with the other mills, and referred the grower to the mill in his own particular zone. reasonable thing to do? think so.

370,Mr Higgs,"The sugar farmers do notgether upset the scheme for the four divisions unless that rule were observed ? of the cane-growers at the present day is that the combine has cut up the whole of the sugar districts into zones. They will permit Messrs. Gibson and Company, of the Bingera plantation, to take a part of the country, and the Windermere mill another part. The growers in each district must take their cane to a particular mill. The mill, therefore, has complete control over the cane-grower. The latter has his crop there, but he cannot do anything with it unless the miller buys it. What a deplorable state of things that is for the farmer. ferent in the four Government districts? vernment had done the right thing, when, they found that the cane-grower in a private zone was not getting a fair price for his cane, they would have purchased it. Sugar-growing, I would point out, is entirely different from the growing of any other agricultural product. take his vegetables or fruit, put them in the cart, and hawk them himself. If the worse comes to the worse he can sell his apples from house to house. But he cannot do that with his sugar-cane. with his apples, either. worse he can hawk them if he is near enough to a markef. sent to London. his cane to London. grower of cane is at the mercy of the combine. At the present time the beneficent Government of Australia extends a protecting hand to the grower to the extent of granting him 6s. per ton upon his cane. If we abolish the bounty the grower will have no more redress than he has to-day. He will be under the control of the combine, provided that the electors of the Commonwealth do not vest the Government with sufficient power to enter into the business. member doss not agree with the Prime Minister that the bounty should be abolished ? Minister to the extent of saying that if the growers in public meeting, assembled ask for the abolition of the bounty and the Excise, I do not see how I , as a representative of the people, can refuse to vote for such a proposal. I hold in my hand an account of .the sugar industry in New South Wales. It is headed, ""The' Colonial Sugar Refining Company's new agreement,"" "" A serious position."" The article deals with the state of affairs which obtained in the Richmond River district two or three years ago. The complaints of the farmers there are those of the growers at the present time. The farmers in the Richmond River district complain of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's refusal to pay them for their cane according to individual analysis. The grower properly says, "" I send in 20 tons of cane from high land, and I get no more for it than I do from cane which is grown upon low land."" knows that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company met the growers in connection with that complaint. A man may to pay for the cane according to analysis. eventually by giving them the option of doing either one thing or the other. do it paid on the sugar contents of their cane, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company will not agree to that proposal. At the time of which I speak the growers asked for an agreement with the company to extend beyond the year 1913. As a matter of fact, they desired it to extend till 1916. The company refused to grant them Consequently the this extended agreement. In my opinion the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the millers are prepared to be very generous at the present time. They talk about paying the farmers 2s. 2d. per ton extra for their cane for every £ i that the Excise is reduced. But I venture to say that they will not give the growers an agreement to that effect over a ten years' term. They will give them an agreement for two or three years until the legislation they desire has been passed, and then the growers will be at their mercy.

384,Mr Higgs,"The growers want to begrowers' conference which was held at Bundaberg in 1909, saidWhen the bounty was increased some time ago the Colonial Sugar Refining Company made a corresponding decrease in their price for cane. Mr Mann, a delegate to that gathering, saidI t was aggravating for a farmer to receive 15s. a ton for one sample of cane and 7s. for another sample. Mr Beale saidThe grower should have an opportunity of finding out the value of his cane before it went to the mill. He had had a sample taken and analyzed, and .was told it was worth ns. 6d., but when he cut his crop some of it realized only 6s. per ton. Mr Cooper saidIn the Merang district the farmers believe in the people are again induced to Vote being paid for their cane by analysis. Mr Cattermull saidSome of the delegates were of opinion that cane should be paid for by weight, but that was not fair, because a man on a low piece of land might grow 40 tons to the acre, and on another piece, but higher up, only 16 tons was grown to the acre. The cane on the low land would not have the high analysis of that on the high land. it could comply with the request of the ber quoting from the Record? the Bundaberg daily newspaper. I know that the honourable member made a slighting reference to tbe Cane-growers' Record last evening. That journal was published by the growers of the Bundaberg district, who were not foolish enough to be misled by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the big millers. through the wiles of these companies, and published that paper for the instruction of some of their members and of the general public. It was not a Labour newspaper. going. member thinks that is a matter for pride. But although the publication was discontinued the Australian Sugar Growers' newspaper was not. It is a very flourishing journal to-day. sidized by big interests. the cane-grower? pretty bad, it is true, but sometimes it is necessary for people to be placed in an awkward position before the public will take any interest in their case. cane-growers are compelled to pay a higher rate of wages before they can secure the bounty, honourable members opposite may e possibly endeavour to compel the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the big millers to give the growers a sufficient price for their cane to enable them to pay that rate. I know that this Bill will not help the growers to pay increased wages. We have endeavoured to help the growers. Last year we asked for power to legislate to assist the cane-growers, but the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader, and all their followers, although professing to desire power to legislate for the control of monopolies, went through Australia urging the people to vote "" No"" to the referenda questions, and thus the Commonwealth failed to acquire the power to help the sugar-growers. If next year against the Labour party's proposals, the sugar-growers must remain in the position in which they are to-day. honourable member's mind? Parliament obtained the necessary power, Cane Growers Association of Australia that reasonable prices shall be fixed for the payment for sugar-cane by the millers and refiners. Queensland and New South Wales desire that the Commonwealth shall fix the prices to be paid for cane. I know that this will be difficult. The British Parliament They could see has not attempted for hundreds of years to fix prices, public opinion having turned against that course. But we shall have to revert to it again before we can relieve the community from some of the exactions of the big combines-' The cane-growers in public meeting assembled in the Bundaberg district, unanimously determined that no redress could be obtained until this Parliament, or a tribunal appointed by it, had fixed the prices for cane. The meeting declared that this could be done, beI t is, no doubt, subcause the sugar contents -of cane can be determined with the same exactitude as the butter contents bf milk. That is what is in my mind. The Constitution does not at present allow us to do what they ask. Next year the people will be again appealed to for an extension of power.

I hope that the grower will relish the argument. The proposal of the honourable member is to put an extra impost on the grower, so that he must kick, and thus better his condition. The honourable member also said that power was needed by this Parliament to fix the prices to be paid to the grower for his cane. He admits that the system of fixing prices broke down centuries ago, when civilization was at a much simpler stage. Seeing that the system broke down then of its own sheer weight, how can it succeed under the infinitely complex conditions of modern times? Honourable members opposite are heading back to a point from which we have progressed slowly and laboriously during several centuries. He wishei us to return to conditions from which we have escaped only by continuous efforts, extending over a very long time. The experiment which he proposes cannot again be tried under the simple conditions of the Middle Ages. It is true that there is now more machinery at our command, and that we have greater experience, but, on the other hand, society is a much more, complex thing than it was in the days of old. I do not think it is at all likely that we shall revert to the old position. Matters are now too complex to allow the application of a proposal such as that of the honourable member for determining the proportions of the value of a product that shall go to all the persons engaged in producing it . One statement made by the Minister this afternoon comes strangely from the lips of professed to be almost omnipotent. They set out with fair promises, with power to work their will through this Parliament, and to make good all the promises they had made to the great proletariat outside, and now we hear from the Minister that: "" We shall all be dead before we can get to know what the inner working of the sugar company is . "" Apparently he desires that the not know. of the pessimists. After thundering their anathemas at the last election against all these combines, and saying to the working men of Australia : "" Put us into a position He argued that if the of power and we shall put an end to these monopolies; we shall discover how they are fleecing the public, and remedy the trouble""; they now say, one after the other: "" Woe is me, I can do nothing, and we shall all be dead before we are able to tell what the sugar company is doing."" I have never before heard such a confession of failure. Absolute failure is confessed here freely and frankly by these stalwarts who came here to do what the former members could not do. Now they say: "" VVe in turn have been here nearly three years, and we shall be here thirty years before we can do anything at all in that direction."" It seems to me that if there is any fairness, justice, or equity in the mind of the great public outside, they will say to the Labour party: "" You have failed. You say you have failed. You have not made good. You have not done the job you said you could do, and we shall not trust you with any further expenditure of our money.""

It appears from what has been said to-day that all that Mr is equally a victim with the worker. From Denham has done has been done in response to an invitation from the Prime Minister. All that this amendment means, therefore, is that the sooner that end, declared to be desirable by the Prime Minister himself, on behalf of the Government and the Labour party, comes about, the better it will be for all. concerned. Another reason why it should come about was stated by the honourable member for Capricornia himself just now-that if the bounty and Excise be abolished an extra return, amounting to 8s. 8d. per ton of cane, will immediately be made to the grower. the honourable member for Capricornia to say that it would be 2s. 2d. per ton of cane for every £ 1 by which the Excise was decreased.

But he is to have less remaining in his pocket as a consequence of this measure. I suppose that that is a fair statement of the case. Or is the grower by some magical process to get more into his pocket the more he pays out?

426,Mr Joseph Cook,"The facts are.pocket. Here we have a. proposal to compensate the grower also. The Leader of the Opposition urges that if this amendment be carried, and the bounty and Excise abolished, and if a local tribunal be set up to insure that the men receive fair rates of wages, both parties will benefit, instead of only one. So that the amendment aims at giving the man who has to cultivate what it is fair for him to get according to the decision of a competent Court, with whom the matter will rest, whilst at the same time it will insure that the man who has to pay the extra money will in turn get a little for himself as well, so long as the duties remain. ever, who oppose the amendment, as the Government are going to do, are simply saying in so many words : '' You growers must pay, but you shall get no benefit for yourselves."" orable member say that the Sugar Refining Company should pay? That is the proper way to talk. member has not been present this afternoon. able member before, though. able member knows everything about the subject will he allow me to address a few words to those who do not profess to know everything? The more speeches I have heard from the Ministerial side the more I am convinced that the case is as I have put it, that whilst the Minister is proposing to make the grower pay more to the man who does the cultivating, he will not give any relief to the grower himself. The honourable member for Gwydir asks why the Sugar Company does not pay the grower more. The Sugar Company say that they will if the Excise and bounty be abolished. But the Government say that they shall not lae abolished. get no more either from the refiners or anybody else. It is abundantly clear from what we have heard this afternoon that the grower is the man who is to foot the bill, and the Government resolutely decline, by opposing this amendment, to give him an atom of the relief which he otherwise would get. What the Minister is going to do both by this Bill and by his regulation, edict, decision, fiat, or whatever it may be termed, is unconstitutional. A better authority than any which the Government can command-and that is said in no disrespectful way, because it is recognised that Mr Mitchell is one of the leading barristers of the Commonwealth, in the very front rank of them all-say s that the Government cannot do this thing. Yet the Minister will take this devious and doubtful way when there is a straight way to the same goal. In the interests of the working man himself, by whom my honourable friends are desirous of doing a fair thing, they should accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition. It may turn out that this suggestion is the surest way to justice. Abolish the bounty and Excise, and Those, howthing. ter of Trade and Customs suggest, then, that when the Prime Minister made that suggestion to Mr Denham, he was trying to fool the worker? Because it is that agreement that I am talking, about the whole time. Will that give the worker nothing ? "" Next session."" ister who'says that an agreement submitted at the suggestion of his own Prime Minister will give the worker nothing. That is a fine comment' on his own chief. The Prime Minister suggested this agreement with Mr Denham. Now we are told from the Minister of Trade and Customs' own lips that the worker will get nothing out of it. All that this amendment means is that that agreement should be carried out at the earliest possible moment. Mr Denham has undertaken to do his part with all despatch. at the Prime Minister's suggestion. Royal assent to the Bill before I will believe that he will do it. to this-that , notwithstanding that the Prime Minister is quite satisfied that a bond fide agreement has been made if that is so. to know that honourable members opposite are repudiating what their chief has done. honourable member says.",55,Tempora Ry Chairman Those Gentlemen Who Two Or Three Years Ago

I shall argue this question no further. Honourable members opposite must take the responsibility for their own action. They will find in the sequel, so far as I can see, that they will be no nearer the solution of their difficulties. They are embarking on a measure of doubtful constitutionality. Indeed, there is no doubt of that in -the minds of those best able to judge. that be so, the Government will simply lead the workers once more into some piece of tomfoolery, and then they will say, "" We would have done what was necessary in your interests but for the High Court."" The workers, if they are wise, should say to the Government, "" The trouble is due, not to the High Court, but to -your foolishness in not carrying through an agreement which would have given us positive relief of a definite character in the speediest possible time."" That is how I view'the situation, and if I were Leader of the Opposition I should not press this matter further: The responsibility is with the Government, and I submit that, in the end, it will be found that they are again embarking on a doubtful, devious course when there is a plain and straight course before them.

We are dealing with all its perplexities and complexities. member's own side opened that aspect of the question. second reading of this Bill opened last Thursday, and there was an idea that the Bill would be easily disposed of last night. It was not. As soon as we met to-day, an honourable member of the Opposition moved the adjournment of the House to discuss If another question, and here we are, with another day gone, still dealing with the Bill. I hope that the Prime Minister will take every means, short of using the "" gag,"" to insure the speedier transaction of business this session.

He added that if the Queensland Government introduced and passed a Bill abolishing coloured labour in the sugar the settlement we all desire as an award industry, he would influence his colleagues and his party to agree to pass next session a Bill for the abolition of the Excise and bounty. The honourable member for Parramatta has overlooked the fact that the promise given was that such a Bill would he introduced next session. It was with considerable pleasure that we learned that Mr Denham had promptly written agreeing to the suggestion, adding also that his Government thought there was no need to wait until next session, but that an Excise and Bounty Repeal Bill might be introduced this session.

Honourable members should not forget that the proposal now before us did not succeed, but was antecedent to, the suggestion made in regard to the abolition of the Excise and bounty in the sugar industry. .Some honourable members have argued, as the Melbourne Age did this morning, that this Bill was brought down since the proposal was made for the abolition of the Excise and bounty, and the imposition of a Customs duty solely as a protection for the industry. I remind them that the Minister stated, in introducing the Bill last Thursday, that this proposal had already been under consideration.

I approached the State Government on the matter myself, and also the then Minister of Trade arid Customs-Si r Robert Best-and asked him to prevent the cane going from the Nambour mill to Mount Bauple. The Government were then offering to pay the freight on the cane from the Nambour district to Mount Bauple, and were taking away from the people's mill at Nambour the cane which they needed for the successful running of the mill. mill? the usual central mill conditions. So was the Nambour mill, until the Nambour people, who had a little more pluck than some of the others, decided to relieve the Government of the responsibility. They have been running it as a co-operative mill since. I quote this to show that at least in one instance there were two mills open to growers. Government refused to take cane for some time, but they are taking it there now. The reason they gave for refusing on that -occasion was that the mill was a small one, and they had not sufficient power to crush .any more cane"". In fairness to the Queensland Government, the honourable member might have informed the Committee that, in order to have these mills established, the will meet with the approval of the growers growers have to enter into contracts, and practically hypothecate their farms, to supthe ultimate result, if the amendment were ply a certain quantity of cane. A sugar mill, if not kept going with cane, can not fee carted away at short notice, but becomes so much scrap iron. In sugar centres, if tlie farmers want a mill, it is not only necessary, but it has been the practice in Queensland, for them to guarantee to supply it with cane. Most of the central mills (.are carried on very much on co-operative lines. The expenses are taken out of the proceeds of the cane, and the balance, less depreciation and redemption, is paid to the farmers. There are a few private mills, -but that is the general rule, I think, so far honourable member for Capricornia apas those mills are concerned.

WhatI meant by it was the districts that are declared: by the Government, on which the payment of bounty is based. all. The honourable member ought to go to the Bundaberg district to see the zone system in operation. a number of central mills in the Bundaberg district, and it is necessary to have a zone system so far as the mills are concerned. There is no doubt a benefited area declared before a mill is established, and those who havefarms in it hypothecate them to the Government before the mill is constructed. The time to object to a zone system is before you enter into your compact. After you have entered into it, it is fair to carry it out, and help your fellow I know that at Nerang the farmers by growing cane, as each farmer agreed to do when the establishment of a mill in their midst was asked for. I therefore do not see any objection to the zone system, even as defined by the honourable member for Capricornia. I think the action of the Leader of the Opposition in moving to abolish the Excise and bounty of Queensland at any rate, and I believe that carried, would not be at all detrimental to the wage-earners in the sugar industry. After all, a number of the wage-earners are the small farmers themselves. Particularly in the Moreton district, where they go in for very small areas of cane, the farmers do practically the whole of the work themselves, and so, in my district, they will not be seriously affected. We are quite content to let the bountv and Excise go, if the Minister will agree to the proposal. parently quite overlooked that I laid the utmost emphasis on the fact that the abolition of coloured labour was secured first, and in no sense affected by, or involved in, the proposal I was submitting.

557,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat) [9.52],"Th ehad been afforded to the Queensland ' Government, and to the New South Wales Government also, to decree the abolition of coloured labour in those States. That would have removed all difficulty. It freed us from the responsibility which the honourable member appeared to consider rested upon us, of providing in some other way for that abolition. It was not suggested that our sugar policy should be adopted until the question of coloured labour had been settled. The honourable member for Brisbane also misapprehended the question, and his references to black labour dangers are met by the same statement. There was no proposal to encourage or permit the restoration of black labour in any form. that your proposal makes it possible. solutely impossible under the procedure we proposed. It was not intended that the new Act should be brought into operation until that possibility had been excluded. My attention has been called to almost the first speech that I had the honour to deliver in this House, which happened to involve this very question. That speech laid down, in respect to Australia, as a whole, and especially for the sugar industry, a continuous reduction of the black labour already in the country, and the absolute exclusion of additions to its numbers. On that issue, therefore, honourable members scarcely need the assurance that they had misapprehended my whole proposal. We are greatly indebted to the complete and frank statement of the Prime Minister In fact, the greater portion of the motive power of the amendment was diverted by his speech. He frankly admitted that he looked forward to an early abolition of both the Excise and the bounty, which was the principal proposal I contended for. He stated his firm conviction that this would be brought about in a short time. He regards the passage of this measure as merely a temporary expedient, bridging over the interval until the time-possibl y not more than a few months, certainly not later than the next session-whe n he proposes to make that -abolition complete. to the Arbitration Court. meantime. The Prime Minister's statement, however, reduces the difference between us entirely to the manner in which, in the meantime, existing sugar interests should be dealt with. The Prime Minister is strongly convinced that the best opportunity of establishing the conditions of employment on a sound foundation is by an appeal to the existing Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I do not agree, nor can I concur with, his opinion that its decision would be arrived at in three months. In the first place, I believe that much more than three months would be necessary to deal with all the issues affecting labour connected with the sugar industry under the new circumstances about to be introduced. In the next place, I cannot but believe that the proposal of the Queensland Government for the creation of Wages Boards, perhaps as Courts of first instance, offers a speedier and better solution of all local difficulties. These issues undoubtedly derive a great portion of their complexity from the fact that, whatever thefindingsadopted, they will need to be applied in very different ways in. the very various parts of the vast State of Queensland. Few of us who have ever visited that State but have been immensely impressed, not only by its great extent, but by the contrasts between the conditions existing in different districts. To adopt a system applicable to the sugar industry as a whole, and yet capable of being adapted to many differing surrounding conditions, is a task which, it seems to me, will certainly not be performed within the time which the Prime Minister was sanguine enough to suggest. But the suggestion that local tribunals should deal with these practical issues, permitting an appeal to the Arbitration Court wherever appeal proves necessary, either tb harmonize the differentfindingsor to develop them, would attain the object we have in view in the earliest possible time, and wittf the least expense. It would also permit a reorganization of the industry throughout Queensland in the speediest possible way, and with the expectation that the solution effected would be more than temporary. It would, at all events, endure until the industry was thoroughly reorganized, or until its conditions were altered either by a higher Court or by legislative action. It will be seen, therefore, that the Prime Minister very nearly approached our desire. The particular points in which we still differ from him were not in regard to the main principle. His reference to the appeal to the Arbitration Court showed that",64,Innes

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. [10.0] -The debate has covered a considerable amount of ground relating to many phases of sugar production. The Bill itself is simply a proposal to empower the Minister of Trade and Customs to call to his aid, in determining what is a fair wage for those employed in the industry, the Arbitration Court. When that wage has been fixed, the Minister, is further empowered to regulate the payment of bounty, so that it may be given to those in the industry who pay the wage determined upon as a fair one, and withhold it from those who do not comply with the determination. So far I am in sympathy with the proposal of the Minister, and am prepared to give it my support. But I recognise, as the honourable member for Parramatta does, that this method does not promise a complete solution of the whole trouble affecting the sugar 'industry. I do not, however, agree with.him -as to the methods by which he proposes to -meet the difficulty. Three sets of interests are munity. mentioned as involved, namely, the interest -of those engaged in earning wages, the interest of the growers, and the interest of -the refiners. But, apart from those, there is the great interest of the consumers. Whilst we are very properly concerned -about the wage-earners, the farmers, and the manufacturers, we should not lose sight of the interests of the great body of people who have to use this product. Sugar enters very largely into general consumption. "" There are very few for whom it is noE one of the necessaries of life. Tfiis Parliament some years ago passed legislation imposing a Customs Tariff against outside competition to the extent of £ 6 per ton on all cane-grown sugar, and £ 1 2 per ton on beet sugar, which would otherwise be' a serious competitor to cane sugar. That was done in order to bring the industry under White Australia conditions. We also imposed an Excise duty and countered that with a ' bounty to those engaged in the production of white-grown sugar. The result is that the industry is now practically conducted under white conditions; so much so, that only something like 15,000 or 20,000 tons : out of a total production of 226,000 tons are being produced by coloured labour, whereas formerly the major part of the -^production was by means of black labour. We must realize, however, that these increased charges are passed on to the consumer. Moreover, apparently the wage earner does not get the full benefit from the charge to which he is entitled. Apparently, the cane-grower is in a similar position. In fact, the farmer is in a very unenviable position. He is, so to speak, between the devil and the deep sea. On the one hand, he is met with a demand for increased wages; and on the other he is pressing against the great sugar refining monopoly. How are we to remedy the difficulty? It seems to me that our regulations and our legislation in this regard can have but slight beneficial effect. We may by thL Bill insure fair play for the labourer in the industry. There are in the sugar industry to-day men who assert that 22s. 6d. per week is more than they can afford to pay. They practically demand that, since black labour has been done away with, the industry shall be carried on by white men receiving, practically, black men's pay. An industry that cannot pay a living wage ought not to be bolstered up or tolerated in this comto pay a living wage if there is fair dealing. that the honourable member is right. The sugar industry is natural to certain parts of Australia'; and like any other industry natural to Australia, it can pay a living wage if reasonable opportunities are afforded it. I am not going to blame the farmers, in view of the conditions that beset them, because they feel that they are unable to pay higher wages, and view with considerable alarm legislation of this character. They, like the consumer and the worker, are the victims of a huge monopoly that has grown up here; and until we are able and determined to attack that monopoly and crush its monopolistic power, this problem will not be solved. Until that is done, we shall have, in con nexion with the-primary part of the industry, conditions that will mean sweated wages for the workers, poor returns for the farmers, and exorbitant prices to the consumers.

In same cases free gifts of shares, which in the open market were selling at from £ 3 7 to £ 3 9 ios. each, have been made to existing shareholders. All these different methods have been adopted by this company to dispose of the large profits it has made from its operations and the monopoly it enjoys.
