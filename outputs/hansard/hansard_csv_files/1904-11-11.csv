I say, with great respect, that, as a matter of constitutional propriety, it would be grossly wrong for me to mention any such matter in this Chamber, because it would strike at the very root of the independence of the House. ment were made in the form of a threat. upon which Ministers have tendered such advice, and upon which it has not been accepted. last thing a Ministry would think of doing would be to make a statement to the House. The mere fact of such advice being given terminates the connection of the Ministry with the House, because if it be accepted, the House goes, and if it is not, the Ministry goes. The matter is not, in any case, one for this House to discuss. I would state further that I draw a sharp distinction between conduct tending to the disorganization of this House, which is indulged in between three or four members, and conduct which has the formal sanction of the whole of the members of the Opposition. If the whole of the members of the Opposition desire .to reduce this House to a state of impptency, which will make its further continuance useless, and an offence, all I can say is that they have many methods of showing that desire, and that'the moment it is shown, I think that certain questions of serious import will arise which may in the end affect this House very closely. I would, however, be the last person whilst this House is proceeding, as I believe it is as a whole, with an honest desire to transact public business, and to make I desire to ask the its existence useful to the public, and whilst""the conduct which tends to disorgan-' ization and disintegration has not the f u l l sanction of the Opposition) to make any such statement as that suggested.

Under these circumstances; the most painf u l contingency-the extreme contingency,to which the honourable and learned member's question refers, has not yet come within the sphere of even my private cogitations. I can assure the thirty-six gentlemen sitting on the other side of the House that when they show me in unmistakable terms, or by their conduct, that they are determined to bring about a dissolution at once, my own impression is that that event would not be very far off. any honourable member will dissent from the It would do, if the stateconstitutional position taken up by the Prime Minister.

Unfortunately, this consecration of military banners is to take place next Monday. I trust that the Prime Minister, or the Minister of Defence, will take action to stopthe proceedings in connection with that ceremonial. Regarding the Minister's statement that I only gave him notice of my intention to move the adjournment of the House at 28 minutes to n o'clock fixed by the Minister is rather late. I told him at least a fortnight ago that I contemplated taking some action in connection with this matter. fnember said that it would be raised during the discussion upon the Defence Estimates. Minister cannot urge that he is being taken by surprise. Seeing that the Estimates of his Department are to be discussed to-day, he should have beenfully prepared, and, therefore, his statement that this matter should be debated entirely upon the Defence Estimates falls to the ground. I do not desire to do anything which is contrary to the wishes of the honourable and learned gentleman, because I must admit that in this matter he has given me all the information for which I have asked. I wish to say that this matter, although it is apparently a trivial one, involving as it does an expenditure of only £ 6 6s. 6d. orable and learned member kindly take his seat ? I have no information upon the matter, but I would ask the Minister of Defence whether the expenditure of £ 6 6s. 6d., tp -.whiclvthe honourable and learned member for Corio refers, is included in any vote upon the Estimates which are to be considered in a few minutes. ordinary vote which appears upon the Estimates. Mr .SPEAKER -In that case, I do not think that T ought to allow the honourable and learned member to proceed, inasmuch as his motion would anticipate discussion upon another matter, which will presently come before the Committee of Supply. If this expenditure can be dealt with in the The Minister debate upon the Defence Estimates, I ought not to permit the honourable and learned member to proceed at the present stage. very fact that you had to ask the Minister of Defence whether the expenditure to which I refer is included in the Defence Estimates shows that the item is not specific. If. you rule that I cannot proceed with my motion, I submit that it necessarily follows that no public expenditure can be discussed until the Estimates are under consideration. which has been raised by the honourable and learned member, I would say that I should I s not my statement true? regard his question as one of urgency-in view of the fact that the ceremony to which he refers will take place upon Monday next if the Defence Estimates were not to beconsidered before that day. But seeing that they are to be considered this morning, and that consequently the honourable and learned member will not lose his opportunity of discussing this matter, I do not think that I the ought to permit the debate to continue. To do so would allow a discussion which will follow in a few moments to be anticipated. mit that my motion covers more than the immediate expenditure contemplated in connection with the consecration of military banners. But concerning that expenditure, I would point out that you are assuming, sir, that that particular matter will be discussed to-day. I submit that it is extremely unlikely that that will be so. The item is a long way down upon the Defence Estimates, and, consequently, it is improbable that it will be reached to-day. As the ceremonial to which I have referred will take place on Monday next, I would ask you to reconsider the matter very carefully before ruling finally that I cannot proceed with my motion. honourable and learned member for a second.",17,Adjournment Formal Consecration Of Banners

The honourable and learned member's motion deals specifically with a matter of public expenditure. It readsTo consider the Royal Review next Monday, and the expenditure of public money on a denominational service in connection with the consecration of banners. Seeing that the whole question of expenditure will come up for discussion in a few moments in Committee of Supply, I finally rule that the honourable and learned member cannot proceed at this stage. motion. learned member cannot do that. pleases, he can submit a motion dissenting from my ruling. It is quite competent for him to do that. I have already ruled .that he cannot proceed upon the formal motion for the adjournment of the House which he has handed to me. your ruling is that the honourable and learned member's motion for adjournment cannot be proceeded with, but that upon the first item of the Defence Department it will be quite competent for him to make any remarks which he may think fit upon the general administration of that Department, including the particular matter of the consecration of military banners. If that be so, I appeal to the honourable and learned member to accept the position, and to discuss that matter upon the Defence Estimates. proposed review takes place on Monday next, and it is extremely likely that no vote will be arrived at upon that specific item of expenditure to-day. honourable member desired to raise a fresh point of order. My answer to his statement is that, even if I permitted a discussion upon the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corio, no decision upon the item of expenditure in question would be arrived at. and learned member take his seat? The honourable and learned member has a right to address me upon a new point of order, but not otherwise. not have my motion before me when you ruled that it was out of order. I now find that it states that I desire to move the adjournment of the House to consider a matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the Royal review next Monday, and the expenditure of public money on a denominaticnal service in connection with the consecration of banners."" In my remarks upon that motion I do not propose' to confine myself to the expenditure of public money for denominational purposes. I intend also to discuss the Royal review, which takes place on Monday next. I wish to give an undertaking to that effect, and consequently I ask that I may be allowed to proceed. My motion has already been supported by the requisite number of honourable members. If he that I ought to permit the honourable and learned member -to proceedi.

I think, however, that it is well that we should have this matter cleared up for our future guidance. I desire to know whether the very fact that a certain number of honourable members have supported the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corio is not practically an affirmation that I would point out that the this matter is one of urgent public importance, and under such circumstances ought it not to take precedence of all other business ? I thought that the orable members rose in their places to support the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corio is conclusive evidence of its urgency. In the face of that fact I should not be justified in ruling that the business is not urgent, and could not therefore be brought forward.

I submit this motion with a great deal of regret.

I may add for his information that in South Australia an additional precaution is taken owing to some special circumstances which are said to prevail there. In that State the contractor has to furnish with his tender a statement showing the weekly wages or rates of piece-work to be paid under the contract. In Committee (Consideration, resumed from 9th November, vide page 6786): Division 41 (Chief Administration), -£4,789That the item "" Secretary, £oao, "" be reduced by I take this action in order that the iCommittee may have an opportunity to express its dissatisfaction with the proposal of the Minister to hold a denominational and sectarian service in connection wth the Royal Review and consecration of banners to take place on Monday next. I have at the outset to thank the leader of the Opposition-wh o naturally desires on the first item to discuss the question of the re-organization of the Defence' Forces-for giving way to me. It is most unfortunate that the Minister was permitted a few days ago to drag a red herring across the track by making a statement as to the proposed re-organization of the Forces, when he could have done so on the motion for the second reading of the Bill to carry out the Government proposals. purpose of obliging honourable members. views upon this question, but shall reserve my remarks until the Bill which has already been circulated is before the House on the motion for the second reading. That will be the proper time to discuss the whole matter. I ask honourable members to support this amendment on the'ground that in doing so they will merely carry out the traditions of the Committee. When the Estimates were before us in 1902 a proposal was made to strike out an item of £ 2 0 0 to provide for the expenses of a religious service in the Exhibition-building in connection with the coronation, and the Ministry allowed the item to be struck out without calling for a division. The service in question was a denominational one, but the Committee very properly decided to strike out the item on the ground that as every tax payer had to pay equally for the services of the Commonwealth, it was unfair that certain persons in the community who did not agree with this service should be called upon to contribute to the cost of carrying it out. The Minister seems to take up the position that the service to be held on Monday next will not be a denominational one, simply because a number of denominations will be represented at the ceremony. ing denominational in the prayer. j person who did not belong to a denomina1 tion? unless he were a .Christian, that is the only limitation.

I object to preference being shown to any special denomination, when there is a minority-it may be a minority of only one-oppose d to anything of the kind. It is an infringement of 'the spirit, if not of the letter, of the Constitution, which provides that no religious body shall be established, and that no preference or discrimination shall be shown in regard to any religious denomination. I take it that this service can be objected to strongly on denominational grounds. On the 20th ultimo I asked the Minister of Defence whether it was true that it had been arranged to consecrate the banners in the Melbourne Anglican Cathedral, or in Albert Park. The Minister repliedIt was stated in one of the newspapers that it had been arranged to consecrate the banners in the Melbourne Anglican Cathedral, but that statement was incorrect. No such proposal has been made to me. I am endeavouring to have the banners consecrated at a parade by chaplains of the Commonwealth Forces. At another stage, he said that he did not. agree with their being consecrated in the Anglican Cathedral. the consecration taking place in a church of any particular denomination. learned gentleman saidWhenI saw the paragraph in the newspapers a few days ago, with regard to the proposed consecration of the colours in the Anglican Cathedral, I bore in mind the fact that we have no State church in Australia. I sent to the barracks for information as to whether the statement was correct, and drew attention to the fact that there was no State church in Australia, and that therefore I did not think it desirable to have the ceremony performed in a church of any. particular denomination, whether the Church of England or otherwise. The honourable and learned gentleman also said that he proposed to have the'ceremony: carried out in Albert Park, and addedI see no reason for not following the practice of the British Army on a similar occasion in Australia. I said I did not know, but I thought that it had been done before in Australia. the quotations from Hansard that the Minister does not remember what he did say, and that he objects to the banners being consecrated by any particular denomination, but not to their being consecrated by particular denominations. I wish the Committee to take notice of the form of prayer,' and to inquire as to its source. The first part of the prayer is taken from the Communion Service in the Book of Common Prayer; the second is from the Evening Prayer in the Book of Common Prayer; the' third is from the Collect for the fifth Sunday after Trinity, from the Book of Common Prayer; and the last is an original composition prepared by the Minister, or some one acting for him. I intend to read a part of the prayer, since it.led to-end u less sectarian strife in England. If there' is one part of the Book of Common Prayer which it would be unfortunate to adopt for this purpose it is that to which I am about to refer. It led to 2,000 clergymen leaving the Church of England on St. Bartholomew's Day, 1662, because they did not' believe in the King's supremacy over the Church of England, and in the Divine right of the King to rule churches. They thought the State should confine itself to State matters, and leave the Church to look after religion. They objected to the Crown's authority over spiritual affairs. It is admitted by historians that some of the most learned, most devoted, and most spiritual members of the church at the time left it rather than submit to a portion of the prayer which the Minister has selected for use. The prayer readsO Lord, our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of kings, Lord of lords, the only. Ruler of princes, Who dost from Thy thronebehold all the dwellers upon earth; most heartily we beseech Thee with Thy favour to behold our most gracious Sovereign King Edward VII . then come the words and so replenish him with the grace of Thy Holy SpiritThat is the part to which exception was' taken in olden times.

October last, I asked him-and the question and answer are recorded on page 6208 of HansardW ill the Minister of Defence place a copy of the prayer previously referred to by him in the Library for inspection by members ? To that the Minister repliedThe prayer will be taken into consideration by all the chaplains who are to take part in the ceremony before it is finally adopted, in order that care may be exercised to see that no expression remains in it to which any denomination might take exception. When this has been done I shall have no objection to a copy of the prayer being laid on the table of the library, in order that it may be perused by those honourable members who desire to read it. We have an example, in the history of the Victorian Bible in State Schools League, of the effect of attempts of this kind to scrutinize and to water-down religious opinions and beliefs. Nearly all the denominations were at first represented in that league, but very soon the representatives of a denomination whose adherents number one-fourth of the population left it."" Then the Unitarian representative left it . Then the Jewish Rabbi, and finally the ConD o not drag in those gregational representative left it, and it was discovered that a collection of Biblical extracts which would suit all denominations The historic facts stand and should would be regarded as having no religious value at all, because with many people, when a matter loses its denominational flavour, it becomes non-religious. This subject has already been raised by some of the denominations. I have received a letter from the Rev. A. Rivett, of Albury, dated 7 th November, who stated that he brought In the printed programme of the serthe matter up before the Congregational Union of Australasia. I am informed that a denomination whose adherents number one-fourth of the population will refuse to be represented by their chaplain at the ceremony to take place on Monday next, is the honourable because a chaplain who represents another denomination has been chosen to be the principal chaplain on the occasion. So that the ceremony is certain to cause offence, and the Committee should support me in ferences from spreading any further. The Minister said that he would refer this matter to the chaplains of the Department. I asked him if he would allow the proposed prayer to be read by representatives of denominations who are not represented in fhe Chaplains Department of the Defence Forces; but the Minister said that On the 27th he would confine the matter strictly to denominations who had representatives. fine it strictly to officers of the Commonwealth Forces who were chaplains; that I would not refer the matter to' any denomination which had not a chaplain in the Forces.

A t the ceremony on Monday next the adherents of denominations not represented by chaplains will number 1,545,000, or one-third of the total population of the Commonwealth.

Sir more than once in Western Australia. which could not be done in any of the other States, and, I hope, will never be done under the Commonwealth Administration. That was because the State at the time had not representative government, and was administered by an autocrat. The Minister has asked what objection there can be to the colours under which our troops have to fijrht being consecrated with prayer. I would remind honourable members, however, that, nowadays, regimental colours are never carried on the field of battle.

The other statement was made in reply to an interjection of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The Minister also told us that he had sanctioned these proceedings because the King'sRegulations provide a form of prayer. I have looked through the King's Regulations, and I find that there is no form of prayer provided there. I wish to know I do not know of any such under what section of the King's Regulations these proceedings are authorized? In the first place, the King's Regulations apply only to authorized denominations. I understand that some Methodist chaplains have of late been appointed, but, when the King's Regulations were issued, the only authorized denominations in England were Presbyterian, Church of England, and Roman Catholic, all representative of State churches. The King's Regulations, upon which the Minister depends for his JOHN FORREST -It has happened authority wish the honourable and learned member would quote my words, and not paraphrase them. the Minister's words, because he has denied his statements several times. The King's Regulations sayWhere a minister of any one of the recognised Protestant denominations is not available, officers and soldiers of that denomination may attend the service of either of the other denominations that they may elect.

The Minister said nothing Avhate\'er would be done to infringe the spirit or letter of the King's Regulations. I am informed, however, that no troops will be alloAved to absent themselA'es from the parade. The men will be compelled to be present.

Chaplains representative of each of the denominations having chaplains in Victoria are also to take part. chaplains in other States are also represented in the Victorian forces, namely, Church of England, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Roman Catholic. A chaplain of each of these denominations, in addition to the senior chaplain of the Forces, has been requested to attend. This matter arose on the 12th of October, when a paragraph appeared in the Argus, stating that the consecration was to take place in the Anglican Cathedral, Melbourne. That was the first intimation I had, and I immediately had the extract cut out and .sent to the General Officer Commanding, with the following minute:' The Minister would be glad lo be informed what colours are referred to in the above extract from the "" A r g u s "" ; whether the information therein given is corect; and, if so, whether such procedure is proposed, in view of the fact that there is no established Church in Australia. Any such proposals should, the Minister thinks, be submitted for his consideration before being adopted. I was informed by the General Officer CommandingNo arrangement has been made at present for consecrating the standards sent by His Majesty the King. The Minister may rely upon my consulting him in the matter. Then the General Officer Commanding discussed the matter with me, and we arranged what, as a matter of fact, is to take place on Mondav. That is, the senior chaplain is to lead,' and the other chaplains representative of each of the denominations which have chaplains in the forces have been asked to be present.. present ? exacts accuracy in language in others which would be praiseworthy in himself. No chaplain can be ordered to be present, because no compulsion can be exercised in such cases.

The chaplains have been requested to take part in the service. What the exact words of the communication were The denominations having I do not know, because I did not send it . At any rate, they have been requested to join in the service, and I do not think that any of them will refuse to do so. The chaplains'are to meet and arrange with Mr Mort, the senior chaplain, as to how they will divide the duty of repeating the prayers. Of course, from a military point of view, seniority depends on seniority of commission, and the Rev. Mr Mort is senior, because he has been longest connected with the Forces as chaplain. I do not propose to discuss the prayers that are to be offered. The honourable and, learned member for Corio says that they are extracted from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. I do not profess to know. I am not an Anglican, but I belong to the Presbyterian Church, about which the honoiable member for Kennedy seems so muchconcerned. At any rate, I do not know that any non-Anglican susceritibilities have so far been offended in the least degree by the form of the proposed prayers. I confess that I regret that the honourable and learned member has considered it necessary, in the performance of his duty to the public as a member of this House, to act as he has done. regrets it, .and I regret that his action has rendered mine necessary. MrM c CAY I regret the action of the honourable and learned member, because if any unpleasantness should arise he may take to himself the credit of having caused it. the thanks of the Committee are due to the honourable and learned member for Corio for bringing this matter before them.

I endeavour to cultivate the Christian spirit, because I have a profound belief in those verities; but the proposed ceremony will practically require on the part of those who join in it the recognition of a particular church, or a particular form of religion, and will tend to bring the grand and noble aims of the Prince of Peace into ridicule. It is for that made to ascertain their whereabouts, and. reason that I protest against it, and shall support the amendment. I shall support the honourable and learned member, in protesting not against the mere words to be used in the prayer, but against the principle involved in the introduction of a system that must bring the grand and noble religion of Jesus Christ into ridicule, and make it but a mere travesty. to take part in the discussion of the proposed consecration ceremony, but as some honourable members appear to take a different view from that held by the soldiers as to what is meant by serving under the colours, I think it is necessary to briefly deal with the question. Let me relate to the Committee a little incident which took place in South Africa at the time of the Zulu war, in order to show how highly the troops value their colours. Just before the battle of Isandula, the two battalions of the 24th Regiment met in South Africa for the first time since the Peninsular Tugela. It seemed to me that the saving War, and they celebrated the occasion by setting apart a special d'ay for the trooping of their colours. were expressed at that ceremony are so firmly imprinted on my memory that I shall never forget"" them. It was a regular galadav for the two battalions. Shortly afterwards the battle of Isandula took place, and while General Thesiger, afterwards Lord Chelmsford, was away with part of the two battalions, the remainder, with the colours, remained in camp. able members had witnessed the anxiety which the men betrayed for the safety of their colours, they would not have anything to say against the consecration which is to take place on Monday next. A banner, after all, is only a bit of silk-sometime s a fragment little better than a rag-but the whole history of a regiment is sometimes contained in it ; and in this case the history of the 24th Regiment was bound up in the little bit of silk which was the subject of such deep anxiety. Honourable members may, perhaps, remember the story of Lieutenants Melville and Coghill, who, ; believing the colours to be in danger, tore .them from, the poles, and wrapped them round their bodies like a cummer-bund. They swam through rivers, they dropped down bluffs, but eventually, in their anxiety to get away, and so save che honour of. '.he regiment, they were shot. The first thing that was asked when we came up with the relieving force was, what had become of the colours? Attempts were if honourable members had seen the anxiety expressed by both officers and men about their loss they would not oppose the proposed consecration. The regiment with which I served, the Royal Artillery, had no colours with them, because their colours are kept either at London or Woolwich, I forget which. always kept at home? always kept at home the 24th Regiment would not have had its colours in danger on the occasion of which I am speaking. is twenty-three or twenty-four years since I left the service. Some days after, Lieutenants Melville and Coghill were found with the colours wrapped round them, and their bodies were brought into camp at Helpmakaar, on the Natal side of the of the colours was the only thing that kept the regiment together. The colours are The sentiments which symbolic of the unity of a regiment. The names of the engagements in which it has taken part during its whole existence are inscribed on them, and the trooping of the colours once a year is a great day. Those who have seen the trooping of the colours of the' different regiments of Guards at St. James' in London know that it is a sight always to be remembered. The proposed consecration If honorservice at Albert Park will be a similar proceeding, to which I see ho objection at all. If the Government think fit to have these banners consecrated, all I have to say is, let them be consecrated. If I were a member of the Forces, and had any religious scruple about being present at a ceremony of this kind, I would stay away. The Minister said that any one who objects to it' may stay away, so that I do not know what objection there can be to the course proposed. The honourable ""and learned member for Corio has told us that men staying away because of religious scruples,",28,Department Of Defence

I thought that there was a great principle underlying the proposed religious service at the Exhibition Building, and I was not prepared to vote £ 2 0 0 for it, because I am opposed to anything like the recognition of a State church; but I should like to know from the honourable and learned member for Corio what denomination takes exception to the particular form of prayer which is to be adopted at Albert Park. Every one of us, in one way or another, when he prays, asks for the blessing of the Almighty, and that is all that is asked for in this instance. 1 do not cavil at the wording of the petition. With regard to the sentiment created by ^proceedings of this kind, I say that honourable members ought to serve in the Forcesi f they wish to know the value of sentiment. The colours of a regiment are only a little bit of bunting, but the feeling I had when I saw. the flag flying over Rorke's D r if t , when we came up to its relief, was such as I have -never experienced before or since. If those who follow the banners which are to be consecrated on Monday next have the same feelings it will be a good thing for them. Take away sentiment, and what have we left? Nothing at all. these banners increase that sentiment ? think that it is a good thing to consecrate the banners, though I do not care whether it is done by a Church of England clergyman, a Presbyterian, or one of some other denomination. If the ceremony creates in others the sentiment which was aroused in my own breast, it will be a good thing for them. stand that the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corio is, strictly speaking, to reduce the proposed vote by J £ I , whatever his reasons for moving it may be. I have time and again in this Chamber opposed to the utmost of my ability the reduction of the Defence Estimates, and I take this opportunity I understood the honorto do bo again. There has been a great deal of discussion upon the particular matter referred to by the honourable and learned member for Corio, but I wish rather to give reasons why I think that the provision made for the defence of Australia is too small as it is, and why, in consequence, we should not support the honourable and The honourable learned member's amendment. question raised by the honourable and learned member for Corio. to prevent other honourable members from continuing .the discussion of that question after I have concluded my speech. to prevent a distinct issue being raised. and learned member for Corio may be called upon to withdraw that remark.

219,Mr Crouch,"If you, sir, rule that myfor the defence of the Commonwealth presuppose an invasion or an attempt by a foreign power to take territory from us, with a view to establishing a colony or naval base in Australia. I do not think, however, that that assumption is a tenable one. I hold that the most likely form of attack would be a raid on our commerce or on one of our chief ports. Australia is too distant from other parts of the world for any important power to contemplate the invasion or seizure of our territory. But we are bringing into existence to meet such a remote contingency a field force, the organization of which seems to have already been practically perfected. Let me give one or two reasons for my opinion that an invasion of Australia will in all probability never take place. The only country which in modern times has carried on a campaign similar to that which would be necessary for the subjugation of Australia, or the seizure of any of our territory, is Great Britain; but, in spite of her enormous mercantile marine, and the great wealth which she possesses, she found the subjugation of a small people in South Africa an almost impossible task. With the exception of the United States, with which I hope ws shall never have any difference, there is no power in the world capable of effecting a serious landing on our coasts. Furthermore, we should not lose sight of the fact that an enemy could not seriously consider the invasion of Australia until after England had permanently lost command of the seas. On the other hand, it is quite possible cruisers may occasionally escape English that the fleets of England may temporarily in time of war lose command of the seas, though I hope that that will never come about. It is also more than probable that long distance cruisers will occasionally be able to evade the British Fleets engaged in blockading the ports of our enemies. fore. again. In time of war the duty of the English fleets would be to, as far as possible, blockade the ports of the enemy; but single cruisers might now and again succeed in slipping through the cordon of British warships, and afterwards try to damage the mercantile marine of Great Britain. And then, with a view to prevent food supplies from reaching that country, they might raid distant ports of the Empire. As it would be virtually impossible, owing to the proximity of the cruisers co-operating The dispositions made with the English Fleets, for such cruisers to attack vessels bringing England's food supplies near the English coasts, that is, at their point of arrival, they would go further afield and seek to intercept them at their point of departure. And, consequently, I hold that the forms of attack which we have most to fear are such raiding of our ports, and such interference with our shipping, as might be made by a powerful commercedestroying vessel of the enemy. The protection of our ports may seem of small moment to people living in the country, but as the four chief coastal cities of Australia contain one-third of the population of the Commonwealth, while, with the exception of a few detached lines in Queensland, all our railway systems branch out from them; as, in short, they are our chief centres of external and internal distribution, their protection is a matter of the utmost importance. A cruiser of heavy tonnage and' fai r armament, such as the Russian vessel, Gromoboi, which recently visited these waters, would be able to so terrorize our merchant marine as to make it take refuge in these ports, and to intimidate our people to the extent of seriously interfering with the whole business of the country. if the British Fleet in these waters was destroyed. recently paralyzed business in San Francisco. show that it is probable that foreign blockading squadrons, in the same way as the Russian Fleet escaped from the Japanese squadron engaged in blockading VJadivostock. cruiser did any damage in'these waters, the fact would be reported to the British happened bevessels engaged in defending our coast. I shall be able to show that that w ill not take very long-that the fact to which the Minister has referred will make it essential to the cruiser to deliver an immediate attack against our shipping and the bases of our shipping. AndI will endeavour to show that our ports are not in a position to repel a sudden raid of this na r ture. Several suggestions have been made with a view to insuring the more effective_ protection of our ports: The'head of the late Government suggested",30,Groom I Think That Those Words Contain

228,Mr Kelly,"I admit that. I think that torpedo-boat destroyers should be obtained. such a proposal is that the formation of a separate fleet for Australia would not be best calculated to promote the well-being of the Commonwealth, or of the Empire of which we form an important part. Torpedo-boats are most effective for the purposes of attack; and can develop their best qualities only during night attacks and whilst manoeuvring in smooth waters. enemy's ship would, however, make an attack under the conditions most favorable for her purpose, and would certainly not at night attack a port defended by torpedoboats. tive manoeuvring of a torpedo squadron is smooth watera condition which seldom obtains along our coasts. think we may, for the present, dismiss the suggestion that we should obtain torpedoboat destroyers. marine boats? their slowness, are useful more for the purpose of ' attacking than for defending ports. A large number of submarine boats are being constructed iby France, and also by England, with a view to attack each other's ports in the channel. A submarine is too slow to attack a moving ship with any certainty. She can direct her movements so as to deliver an attack at a fixed point and in a given time. If , however, an enemy's cruiser were off our shores, her commander would not insert an advertisement in the newspapers intimating that she would be at a given place at a certain time. not think, therefore, that for defence we can placs much reliance upon submarines. Our harbour defences must, since neither torpedo craft nor submarines are adapted to our requirements, take the form usually adopted, namely, that of a system of minefields, protected by quick-firing batteries, which are themselves protected by heavy guns of position; this latter to keep the enemy's ships beyond striking distance of our mine-field protection armament. With these mine-fields we should be in a different position from that occupied by the Russians at Port Arthur, who largely used floating mines. moral effect-and , therefore, are most demoralizingly effective-upo n an enemy. Our object, however, would be not only to prevent an enemy's cruisers from coming into our ports, but to enable our own ships to navigate our coasts and harbors with perfect safety after the enemy had been driven The natural objection I have to from our shores. They would, of course, for some considerable time afterwards be exposed to great danger if floating mines were used for the purposes of defence, and for that leason we have to put on one side any idea of adopting them. I hope that very shortly the great powers will arrive at an understanding precluding belligerents from sowing the sea with floating mines. Ordinary An mines, such as are used for harbour defences, are intended to prevent an enemy's ships from rushing past the forts. We have recently had illustrations of the fact that modern ships of war can stand a treThe second essential for the effecmendous amount of battering. One battleship recently arrived at Chifu with such a large number of holes in her that they Therefore, I represented a considerable portion of her superficial area. And an 'ordinary armoured' cruiser could undoubtedly rush past any forts we have in Australia. Any mine-fields designed to prevent war ships from executing such a manoeuvre, must be protected by quick-firing artillery of comparatively light calibre. The batteries containing these guns must in every case be protected by heavier guns, capable of preventing a cruiser from approaching within close range. According to May, warships have so 'preponderating an armament that if they were able to approach within 600 yards-whic h is about the range at which they could effectively work all their guns-of a battery of light guns, they would soon be able to put it out of action. Therefore, it is necessary that we should have heavier guns mounted in commanding I do positions, to make the enemy keep at a respectful distance. We have not in Australia any such heavy guns as are mounted on fortresses in other parts of the world; and I do not think that we require guns of excessively large calibre, my whole argument being based upon the supposition that an attack by an armoured cruiser, not by a fleet or battleships, is what we have most to fear. The defences of Sydney are in a far better position than those of Melbourne. tection than Melbourne, because it is nearer the open sea. Floating mines have an enormous more protection, and for reasons other than that mentioned by the honourable member. It is the naval base for the British Squadron in these seas; and, although I ciuite understand that the Imperial authorities undertake the protection of their bases, we cannot ignore the fact that Sydney is specially",31,Groom I Think That Those Words Contain

For this special reason special measures must be taken to insure the safety of Australian interests in and about that port. Well, sir, I have shown the necessity for two forms of batteries-quick-firin g batteries for the protection of the mine-fields, and batteries of heavier guns for the protection of the lighter armaments; but, of course, it is of no use to have defences-and we have already spent a large sum upon defence works-unles s we have the men to man the guns. We find that before Federation, the States which looked after their own defences had, as a whole, much stronger forces available for immediate use in their forts, than the Commonwealth possesses at the present time. One of the strong reasons advanced in favour of Federation was that our common defences could be made much more efficient than would be possible under the States' Administrations. That promise has been carried out so far as the field forces are concerned; but I regret to say that, there are not now so many gunners available to work our guns at a moment's notice as there were prior to Federation. gunners. I had a return made out quite recently, when I was investigating the very point referred to by the honourable member, and I found that with one small exception, there are a sufficient number of permanent and partially paid gunners to provide the necessary reliefs for manning the forts from time to time. ment ; but I should like to know how long it would take for the militia garrison artillery to reach the forts at, sav, Queenscliff? a train to travel from Melbourne to Queenscliff. working order within twenty-four hours ? garrison artillery and have them within the forts between dark and dawn. late. The General Officer Commanding, however, does not hold that view as to the adequateness of the reliefs provided. In his last report he saysThe latest pattern guns are now being placed in position in Sydney; and during the ensuing twelve months similar guns will be placed at Hobart, Adelaide, and Fremantle. The detachments for these guns should be permanent troops. It is also laid down that for these guns there shall be at least two reliefs. The increase in the Estimates now submitted only provides for one relief, so that the barest possible requirements are estimated for. forces, there are two reliefs. Commanding holds that the quick-firing artillery should be worked by permanent soldiers. I do not wish to deal with technical matters; but it appears to me that if we are to have quick-firing artillery of the kind which will prove most useful in repelling a sudden rush, it will be to our interest to keep in the forts such men as will be able to work them at a moment's notice. to Federation. within the past few years the field' and garrison artillery-and the field artillery constitutes a very small proportion of the garrison artillery field artillery. force which is used for field artillery instructional purposes. I find that upon the date of its transfer to the Federation, the Permanent Artillery numbered 1,220 of all ranks. Upon these Estimates provision is made for only 755. Furthermore, I find that the Estimates show a decrease of £ 1 4 0 in the Engineers' vote, which covers the submarine mining engineers. The curious feature in connection with this decrease is that, whereas the amounts it will have to disburse are less, yet the Accounts and Pay Branch gets more for doing it ; consequently, it is not economy in the public estate which has brought about the small reduction in the Engineers' vote. The necessity to keep an adequate permanent force is a matter which has agitated the mind of the chief military adviser to the Government ever since he has been in Australia. The General Officer Commanding, in his report of this year, saysI pointed out last year that the reduction of the Royal Australian Artillery to the existing establishment laid down by the Minister for the Estimates of 1903-4 "" can only be viewed with the most serious apprehension, as the numbers are quite inadequate for the duties required of them. The effective land defence of the naval positions on the one side, and of the commercial centres on the other, is most seriously compromised.",32,Groom I Think That Those Words Contain

The General Officer Commanding proceeds also be paid by each British-owned steamer ento sayIt is impossible to view the military situation in Australiaj in face of the momentous changes taking place in the balance of power in the East, without grave misgivings. The victories of the Japanese arms within the last four months have astounded the whole civilized world by their brilliancy and by their astonishing rapidity. The future and far-reaching results of the war have yet to be felt, but it is safe to predict that the opening up of China will follow as a result which, together with the opening of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, will materially alter the existing political and commercial situation in the Pacific. ing. not hear it. AnyhowI am reading it again. The honourable and learned member is at perfect liberty to read what he likes, and I have an. equal right to quote the General Officer Commanding in support of the arguments I have advanced. He says furtherI t is certain that commercial supremacy in the Pacific will be the aim and ambition of the leading naval and military Powers of the world, and that Australian interests must thereby be seriously compromised, if not imperilled, unless they are effectively secured by a reasonable measure of military defence. In view of the alarming nature of this report-and I take it that it is not unnecessarily alarming, because doubtless it has been drawn up after very careful consideration-it behoves us, as the guardians of the interests of the Commonwealth, to secure ourselves against the dangers referred to. I should like to quote from a leading article which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of Monday last, which bears upon one or two of the statements contained in the report Of the General Officer Commanding as to foreign, powers establishing themselves in the Pacific. The fact that naval bases are being established by these powers is mentioned as an additional argument in support of the necessity for our keeping ourselves in a continual state of preparedness for the purposes of defence. The article from which I am about to quote refers particularly to the fact that the master of the steamer Ysabel had been refused trading rights in the Marshall group. The writer saysGerman steamers are permitted to trade with British-owned islands in the Pacific on payment of ioth November contains the following of a licence fee of ^ IOO per annum, which must telegram from Sydney, which is headed [REPRESENTATIVE'S.] Supply. gaged in the trade. But the German reply to this neighbourly treatment by Great Britain is to levy a prohibitive rate against the British steamer entering a German island group, and to charge vessels flying the Union Jack more than fifty times as much for the privilege of trading with a German possession as Britain charges a vessel flying the German flag for the privilege of entering a British-owned harbour in the South Seas. The incident is significant as a presage of what may be expected to follow when the feverish struggle for trade, which has already brought the European Powers into dangerous juxtaposition in Asia, is extended, as seems inevitable, to the island groups that lie as it were at the backdoor of Australia. The insatiable craving for fresh markets, which shall be the exclusive property of the exploiter, has already led to a terrible war in Eastern Asia, and now the greedy monopolist is at work also in the South Seas. Australian commercial predominance must inevitably be followed by political predominance in all these islands. It is impossible that the trade with an island group should be in the hands of the subjects of one Power, while the political control should be in the hands of another Power. "" The future of Germany,"" observed the Kaiser, in demanding funds for a huge programme of naval construction, is on the water."" Germany, 11 needs a big fleet to support her in enforcing this policy of grabbing trade by any and every means from those who already possess it. That is obvious. The article concludes as follows:The German colonies in Togoland, the Cameroons, South-west Africa, East Africa, and Kiauchau are little more than military settlements. And there is no reason to suppose that the destiny of the German colonies in the Pacific islands will be any different. That is an additional reason why the latest manifestation in the Marshall Islands of what Bismarck called the "" furor Teutonicus"" is to be viewed with apprehension by Australia. Such an unscrupulous effort to secure a trading monopoly contains a significant warning. Commercial expansion connotes political expansion. And the political expansion of Germany in the Pacific means the creation, not of peaceful trading colonies under the German flag, but of military settlements and bases that must in the future be a source of grave anxiety to the people of the Commonwealth. These warnings are repeated not only in the pressfo'utelsewhere, and we should not disregard them. The matter is one of very serious moment, and one which is well worthy of consideration by this Parliament. But that is not all. I have here a statement which will perhaps open the eyes of honourable members still, more to the gravity of the situation as"" it may possibly affect our future trading interests.

Eventually the facts upon the matter to which I have referred. began to dawn upon observing men that Germany Such a division will not affect the general had no base in this part of the world, and the debate upon the Defence Estimates. conclusion arrived at, and now generally held by those interested in island affairs, is that these works are being carried out by the Norddeutscher Lloyd on behalf of the Imperial authorities, who throughout appear lo have taken an active part in all arrangements. The spot is described as an ideal site for a naval coaling base, for the storage of quickfirers and ammunition, and for tlie equipment of German mail steamers as cruisers in the event of war. Simpson's harbour is situated on a kind of peninsula commanded by highlands of volcanic origin, which could be rendered almost impregnable by the mounting of a few guns. In the opinion of an Englishman acquainted with New Britain, there is no question as to the use to which the works are to be put. I have quoted that telegram, not with the idea of awakening antagonism to foreign Powers, because I recognise that they have a perfect right to provide for the protection of their own commerce, and to establish naval ibases so that they may be prepared to take aggressive measures should they be rendered necessary. mending, their foresight and enterprise in establishing bases within striking distance of Australia, it would be little short of criminal upon our part if we did not adopt effective measures to protect our commerce and our shores.

In the first place, I wish to call the attention of the Committee to the amount on the Estimates for Queensland. Every member of the Ministry must be aware of the parlous condition of the finances of that State, and if the Defence Estimates relating to Queensland can be cut down without impairing the efficiency of the forces I think that they should. 1 shall be happy to point out any case in which I consider that the Estimates may be reduced in the interests of that State.

We have also to bear in mind that one of the gun-boats has been put into commission since last year.

I find that every religion is not so represented. France recognises every religion, by contributing equally to a l l ; but, although we recognise all religions as equal, we do not contribute to their support out of State funds. the old ignominy of favouring certain religions exists. the Church of England-to which I allude with' all reverence, and which has covered England with splendid temples-ha s one colonel, one lieutenantcolonel, one major, and seven captains. The Presbyterian Church, to which I have paid my meed of praise for its splendid efforts on Hospital Sunday, has one major and four captains. The Roman Catholic Church has three captains, and the Methodist Church six captains. So that only the Church of England is represented by colonels and lieutenant-colonels. In Victoria, the Church of England is represented by seventeen majors and three captains; the Presbyterians by four majors and one captain; the Roman Catholics by one captain; and the Wesleyans by one major and two captains. I pay my meed of praise to the governing authorities of Victoria, because, although they have not given Victorian chaplains any of the higher ranks, they have brought about a fairer division and a.larger representation than any other State possesses. In Queensland the Church of England is represented by nine captains, and the Presbvterian by one lieutenant-colonel, while the Wesleyans have one captain; the other denominations being unrepresented. Church of England has two captains, and the Methodists one captain. In Western Australia, the Church of England has one lieutenant-colonel and eight captains; the Roman Catholic Church one captain; the 11 F 2 Wesleyans five captains, and the Methodists two captains. In Tasmania, the Church of England has four captains, the Presbyterians two, and the Wesleyans one.

Since Vichave not the slightest doubt that the representatives of all these denominations will pray with equal earnestness, but it is not desirable' that any preference should be shown for any particular denomination.
