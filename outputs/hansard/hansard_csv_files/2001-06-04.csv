In the case of the free-to-air services, no charges are incurred. In the case of the subscription services (CNN, BBC WORLD, Sky News Australia, CNBC and Bloomberg Information Television) the arrangements vary. The Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff pays subscription fees to CNN ($6000 per annum) and CNBC ($1800 per annum). BBC WORLD, Sky News Australia and Bloomberg are provided free of charge to the Parliament. In relation to criteria against which offers of future services might be judged, the Foxtel offer was assessed by DPRS against three: HMS channel availability cost of accepting the (FOXTEL) offer; and the appropriateness of the content for HMS.

312,Mr Speaker,"The answer to the honourThe following answers to questions were circulated: Goods and Services Tax: Company Tax (Question No. 2016) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 October 2000: (1) Is he aware that the ATO deducted company tax payments from GST refunds around 1 September 2000. (2) Is he also aware that this caused some companies to make a “double payment” of company tax as some companies had already paid their company tax when it was due. (3) How many companies had their company tax payment taken from their GST refunds. (4) How many companies has the ATO had to make refunds to as a result of the double payments. (5) What is the total of the extra tax collected by the ATO as a result of the double payments. (6) How long did it take the ATO to refund this money to small businesses. (7) Was interest paid to the affected companies; if so, how much. (8) Did the ATO notify affected companies that it would deduct company tax due from GST refunds; if not, why not. (9) What measures have been taken to prevent this occurring again. able member’s question: (1) Since1 July 1999, the Commissioner has been required by section 8AAZL of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, to apply any payment, credit or surplus on an account against any taxation debt. Similar legislative provisions existed prior to 1 July 1999. Accordingly, the Commissioner was required by the law to apply the business activity statement (BAS) refund to the company income tax instalment liability that was due on 1 September 2000. (2) The Commissioner is aware that some companies had paid the company income tax instalments after their BAS refund was applied to those debts. This overpayment was refunded in cases where there were no other outstanding debts. (3) to (5) Between 16 August 2000 and 4 October 2000, BAS refunds were applied to the income tax instalments of 1,946 companies. Of the 1,946 clients, 610 have had refunds repaid and the remainder have taken advantage of the ATO offsetting their GST credit to cover their company instalment. No extra tax has been collected. (6) Any overpayment was refunded, or offset against other liabilities as soon as possible. The average time taken for all 610 refunds, between the date of the original offset and the repayment, was 28 days. (7) Under the Taxation (Interest on Overpayments and Early Payments) Act 1983, no interest would be payable as a result of the offsetting of the BAS refunds against the company instalment. (8) As this legislation has been in force since 1 July 1999, specific advice to the companies concerned was not considered necessary. (9) This legislation was enacted to enable the more efficient collection of taxation debts, and to prevent taxpayers receiving a refund on one day and having a tax debt payable shortly thereafter. The legislation has now been amended to give the Commissioner a discretion not to offset amounts against a tax debt where the debt is due but not yet payable.",125,Notices

314,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) The lease for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has been granted under section 21 of the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996. It does not contain provisions relating to the development of the site for Sydney West Airport. It is proposed that a sale agreement for Sydney Airport will provide for the new owner to be given a first right of refusal by the Commonwealth to build and operate any second major airport within 100 kilometres of the Sydney Central Business District. (5) The Government has decided to retain ownership of the Badgerys Creek site and to legislate to protect the site from incompatible development in surrounding areas which may prejudice its future use as an airport. The Government will further review Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. No site other than Badgerys Creek is currently being considered for a second major airport. (6) Yes. (7) The airport-lessee companies and the airport management companies for all the airports leased under the provisions of the Airports Act 1996 are listed at Attachment A. (8) There is no intention to repeal Section 16 of the Act at this time. (9) Yes. (a) Section 18 of the Airports Act does not require tenders to be advertised or called for the airport lessee company for KSA or Sydney West Airport. (b) The Government announced its intention, on 29 March 2001, to sell its shares in the airport lessee company for KSA by way of a 100% trade sale in the second half of 2001. There is no airport lessee or airport management company for Sydney West Airport. (10) There is no intention to repeal or amend Section 18 of the Act at this time. (11) There is no requirement for the operator of Sydney Airport to build a second airport in western Sydney; rather it is proposed that the operator of Sydney Airport will be given a first right of refusal to build and operate any such airport. (12) There has been no Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) undertaken on Bankstown Airport. The EIS for the second Sydney airport proposal, which was completed in 1999, was specifically for the Badgerys Creek site. Environment Australia’s Guidelines for this EIS clearly acknowledged that alternative site locations would not be addressed in detail having been the subject of a separate ‘site selection’ EIS in 1985 and subsequent Government decisions (except for the Holsworthy site which had been the subject of more recent study).

(2) How many Tasmanian recipients of DVA pensions have had to pay $400 to undergo a driving assessment in the last three years. (3) On what basis does his Department consider this service to be a non-medical service. (4) Based on current figures, what would be the anticipated cost to the Commonwealth per annum to reimburse DVA pensioners in Tasmania for this cost. (5) Does the Commonwealth propose to take action to address this problem. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) and (3) Under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA), the Repatriation Commission is required to provide treatment services and rehabilitation services in accordance with the Act. The Repatriation Commission is assisted in the administration of the VEA by officers from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). The treatment services provided under PartV of the VEA can include driving skills assessments. However, the VEA provides that DVA is only able to pay for driving skills assessments if the beneficiary is suffering from a medical condition that is warcaused and the medical condition gives rise to the need for the driving skills assessment. In addition, under Part VIA of the VEA, DVA is also required to provide rehabilitation services to assist specified classes of veterans to find employment and to continue in employment. Part of an appropriate rehabilitation program can include a driving skills assessment. If the above circumstances exist, then DVA is able to meet the costs of the driving skills assessments. However, unless the above legislative criteria are met, then there is currently no legal authority enabling DVA to meet the costs of driving skills assessments provided by “Rehabilitation Tasmania” to pensioners and beneficiaries in receipt of pensions, benefits or allowances under the VEA. (2) DVA records do not disclose the number of DVA pensioners that have paid for driving skills assessments in Tasmania. Due to the fact that DVA can only fund driving assessments for pensioners with a war-caused medical need, DVA does not record the number of DVA pensioners with nonwar caused medical needs who may have been required to pay for their driving skills assessments. (3) There are no records of the number of DVA pensioners with a need for a modified vehicle which in turn would require, as a pre-requisite, a driving skills assessment. (4) There is currently no proposal to alter the VEA to widen the range of DVA pensioners who would be eligible for a funded driving skills assessment. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Sale (Question No. 2374) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 26 February 2001: (1) Has the Government announced that it intends to sell Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport separately from the other Sydney basin airports; if so, has he obtained advice that the sale is entirely consistent with the Airports Act 1996. (2) Is the intention of Division3 of the Airports Act 1996 to provide that a second airport called Sydney West Airport will be commercially leased to the purchaser or lessee of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport thus ensuring that Sydney West Airport is purchased and built. (3) Further to his media statement ‘Appointment of advisers to conduct the Sydney airports scoping study’ released on 18 January 2001, has the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing, in providing their initial advice on the sale of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, sought advice from the appointed advisers, Salmon Smith Barney and Freehills, on whether the lease of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport must include provisions to lease Sydney West Airport to the same corporate entity or subsidiary. (1) Yes, the Government has obtained advice from its advisers, Salomon Smith Barney and Freehills, confirming that the proposed sale is consistent with the Airports Act 1996. (2) I am advised that the intention of Part2 Division3 of the Airports Act 1996 is that, if an airport lease is granted for Sydney West Airport, the airport lessee companies for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport be wholly owned subsidiaries of the same holding company.

Stage2 151 applicants were selected and then subjected to closer scrutiny by the Assistant Secretary, Youth Bureau and the Director, Voices of Youth to decrease the listing further. Consideration was given to selecting applicants who have a variety of education, employment and life experiences; a diversity of experience in relation to community activity and involvement; reside in varied locations across Australia (urban, rural, remote); and disparate profiles from similar geographical locations.

Environment: Carbon Dioxide Emissions (Question No. 2524) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 5 April 2001: (1) Is the Minister aware of a report in The Sydney Morning Herald of 3 April 2001 that Cabinet is said to have decided to support the stand taken by the US against the Kyoto Protocol while the Minister is reported as saying that he is in favour of supporting the protocol; if so, will the Government support the Kyoto protocol; if not, why not. (2) In terms of the Kyoto protocol what is the estimated cost per kilogram of carbon dioxide reduction from the electric power industry when measures such as increased energy efficiency of domestic, commercial and industrial equipment are taken into consideration. (3) What effect would a program of supporting the installation of domestic solar hot water heaters nationwide have on carbon dioxide emissions if the level of use of such solar hot water heaters reached that (approximately 50%) found in the Northern Territory. (4) Considering that electricity generators are responsible for nearly 50% of Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions, what measures does the Government have in place to reduce the consumption of electricity. (5) What measures does the Government have in place to increase the energy efficiency of Australia’s coal fired power stations. (6) What area of solar photo-voltaic or solar thermal collectors would be required to replace all of Australia’s existing fossil fuelled electric power stations. (7) What would be the cost of such a conversion. (8) Is the Minister able to provide a comprehensive list of economic sectors, ranging from agriculture, transport, energy supply, housing, food production, mining and all other sectors that each contribute more than five percent of Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions together with a breakdown of the costs and potential savings that would result if measures were taken to reduce Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions below the levels of 1990. (9) Have reputable economic analysts shown that significant savings are possible if measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are taken on a case by case basis rather than taking the worse case and claiming that case to represent the whole economy. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Prime Minister wrote to the President of the United States on this matter on 11 April 2001. He stated that Australia remains committed to dealing effectively with climate change and that the Government would continue to implement its program of domestic policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Government indicated when signing the Protocol in April 1998 that possible future ratification of the Protocol was dependent upon satisfactory outcomes on four key outstanding issues: sinks, compliance, the flexibility mechanisms and the involvement of developing countries. Australia has consistently argued that an effective international framework to address climate change needs to be economically manageable and include the participation of developing countries. Any international framework to address climate change will, if it is to be effective, need to incorporate the participation of all major emitters, including the United States. (2) There are a range of costs for abating greenhouse gas emissions from electricity supply and consumption, depending upon the measures adopted and the context in which they are used. Experience through programs such as the Greenhouse Challenge shows that there are a variety of costeffective measures available. For example, analysis carried out by the Australian Greenhouse Office on the National Appliance and Equipment Energy Efficiency Program indicates that labelling and energy efficiency standards for some appliances and equipment can deliver savings of greenhouse gas emissions at a net community benefit of up to $31 a tonne. (3) The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that in 1999 there were 7.2 million hot water systems installed in dwellings in Australia. If solar hot water systems were installed in 50% of the houses across Australia, around 6.5 million additional tonnes of carbon dioxide would be abated each year. (4) The Australian government has developed a range of measures to improve energy efficiency and hence reduce consumption of electricity. These include: Agreement for the development of standards for the energy efficiency of buildings, Joint government and industry initiatives that encourage benchmarking and best practice within the building industry, The National Appliance and Equipment Energy Efficiency Program, The Greenhouse Challenge program, and The Energy Efficiency Best Practice program. (5) In order to improve the efficiency of Australia’s power stations the Government introduced new standards for power generators on 1 July 2000. Generator Efficiency Standards work to increase the efficiency of energy production from fossil fuels. (6) Australia's annual generation of electricity from fossil fuel sources in 1999 was estimated as 170,000 gigawatt hours (GWh). To generate 170,000 GWh per year from solar photovoltaic panels would require an area in the order of 850 square kilometers (not including the energy storage systems). To generate the same amount of energy from solar thermal collectors, an area in the order of 300 square kilometres of solar thermal collectors would be required (in addition to the area taken up by the generation equipment). (7) With current solar photovoltaic technology the costs would be in the order of $1,000 billion, not including the energy storage systems required to deliver useable power to consumers. Using solar thermal systems, which are not yet fully commercial, the cost would be in the order of $200 billion excluding the generating equipment and storage systems. These estimates do not include the cost of the land that would be required for either system.",132,Attachment A Airport Lessee And Airport Management Companies
319,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following an(8) According to the 1999 National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, Energy Industries (41.2%), Transport (16.1%), Livestock (13.7%) and Manufacturing Industries and Construction (11.3%) each contributed more than 5% of Australia’s carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. on a greenhouse gas emissions target of 108% of 1990 levels. The ABARE analysis estimates that real GNP will grow by around 1% less than the 40% growth otherwise expected between now and 2010. Corresponding impacts have been reported for a range of industries. However, there is no current analysis of the industry costs or benefits of taking action to reduce Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 levels. (9) Studies based on ‘bottom up’ style partial analyses often identify potential emissions measures with net savings, based in many instances on the adoption of new technologies. Reflecting the existence of these opportunities, a range of measures with net savings already has been implemented by the Commonwealth, such as the Greenhouse Challenge Program and Minimum Energy Performance Standards. The Commonwealth also provides funding for large-scale cost-effective emission abatement projects through the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. Bottom up models can tend to understate the economy-wide impacts resulting from the diversion of investment required to implement new technologies in an accelerated timeframe. ‘Top down’ economic models can provide additional information helping to inform the economy-wide costs of taking greenhouse action. Both modelling approaches are valuable in evaluating optimal greenhouse policy responses.",134,Attachment A Airport Lessee And Airport Management Companies
