Ment Of The Minister Of Home Affairs The Other Day That Certain Papers On The File Relating To The Chinn Case Are Private, I Ask Which Of Those Papers He Regards As Private, And What Are His Reasons For Doing So? Will The Honourable Gentleman Ask For A Report From The Permanent Head Of The Department In Connexion With The Matter, And Lay It On Tbe Table ? Has Been Nonsense Enough About This Busi","ness in the House. answer,I ask the Ministeri f he thinks it fair to make a serious imputation against some officer or officers in his Department, and to refuse to give-them an opportunity to be heard in their defence? the question, I should like to ask the honourable member if he can give-me any evidence as to how private and confidential letters got on to a public file? Too much outside interference with public officials prethink that he is bringing with him more vents the carrying, out of business activities on business lines. ister of Trade and Customs kindly say when the lighthouses now under the control of the Hobart Marine Board are likely to be taken over by the Commonwealth? mander Brewis has visited all the lighthouses, and finished his inquiries concerning their condition, the remuneration of the employees there, and the other matters on which he is reporting, all the lighthouses of Australia will be transferred to Commonwealth control. the Postmaster-Generali f his attention has been drawn to the following statement in the monthly share register of Messrs. Joseph.Palmer and Sons: Automatic telephone shares (5s. paid) arc quoted about 9s. The system has'peen installed at Geelong, we believe with success, though little has yet been published; some good parcelsof shares have been bought on Melbourne account. We regard the shares as a good speculation. Is it true that an automatic installation has been made at Geelong; and, if so, has the installation.had the suCcesS'lascribed to it? been drawn to the statement. The Geelong exchange is being subjected to tests by ofBcers of the Department, but their report has not yet been presented to me. surer is bringing from London a gentleman to control the printing of the Commonwealth notes, and that he is also importing lithographers? Will the right honourable gentleman give consideration to the fact that we have men here who: could do the work ? brought here to take charge of our note printing, and to produce, the plates from which the notes will be printed. He is a qualified man, and a statement of his attainments will be laid on the table.

Does this mean that public servants who act as chairmen of boards of reference will be paid fees in addition to their salaries, and two travelling allowances ?",14,Setup

26,Mr Sinclair,"I do not think the new system, in order to do away with duplication, we require that every person over twenty-one years of age shall sign his or her name to a card. Cards so signed are placed in a cabinet in the office in the capital city in each State so that the signature of any elector claiming new enrolment may be compared and duplication prevented. Unless these cards are signed we shall not be able to identify, when necessary, the signatures of persons who wish to record their votes while away from their own electorates. Our desire is to see that these cards are signed. of Home Affairs whether it is correct, as I understood him to say, that the Department is going to prosecute people for nonenrolment "" just for the f u n of the thing "" ? clined to be enrolled. I do not think that Does he think it f u n for a working man or working woman to lose a day's work in order to attend a police court to answer a charge of refusing to be enrolled? able friend is mistaken. In some cases when the police called on certain persons they declined to sign the printed cards that had been left with them, and they laughed at the police. We propose now to see whether or not the law of the Commonwealth is to be observed.

(2) The Department staying action for three months in connection with the preparation of the Bond and Maintenance Agreement.

The above delays cover the period 21st January, 1910, to the r6th September, 1911.

62,Mr Thomas (Barrier,"Minister of[3.2] I move That, in the opinion of this House, legislation but I would draw the attention of the honshould be introduced to provide a system of pensions to the members of the Defence Forces, and that the resolution be communicated to the Senate, with a request for its concurrence. I have no desire, and it would not be very pleasant for me, to attempt to make this an annual motion, because that sort of persistence does not always reap the reward that it, perhaps, deserves; nor do I wish in any way to harass the Government by persisting in this matter with a view of getting them to do something in this direction, especially when I feel that their opinions on the matter ought to coincide with mine. I am aware that the Government last year-and I have reason to believe that their opinion is still the same-sai d that they did not intend to take any action to provide pensions for the Defence Forces until a general system of pensions for the whole of those employed by the Commonwealth Government had been considered. That is very good as far as it goes. I am quite in accord with the view that the rest of the Public Service deserve pensions after serving for many years, and that when they reach the age at which they have to retire many of them are not in the position to maintain themselves, and are too old to take up any other occupation. But I am also aware that that principle can be extended much further, and that it can be claimed that the whole of the community deserve pensions much larger than we are giving at present under our old-age pensions scheme. If , therefore, any exception is taken to the fact that I have included only the defence forces in the motion, my reply is that we could go further still in the direction I have just mentioned. I do not wish to go again over the ground I covered last year, or enumerate again the many reasons why pensions should be granted to members of the defence forces, because I think those reasons are still fresh in honourable members' minds, ancl it is patent to everybody that they are unanswerable. The defence forces are on a somewhat different plane from the rest of the community, with the exception of the police force. The members of the defence force and the police are men whose very vocations make their lives altogether different from that of the ordinary citizen. They are liable at any time to be called out in the defence of their country. in the case of those who have been trained, orable member to the fact that my motion is sufficiently wide to embrace the whole of the Defence Forces, permanent or militia, and that is my desire and intention. They are liable to be called out for the defence of their country at any time, and there is no doubt the permanent men will be the first called out, and constitute the first line of defence. I wish to include also in the motion those who are compulsorily enrolled. I endeavoured last year to describe to the House the pitfalls into which other nations had fallen through not being prepared for cases of this character. The most flagrant case was that of the United States of America. By blundering and not being prepared with a pension scheme, the authorities of that country caused the taxpayer to be mulcted in millions and millions of dollars. A faulty system of pensions was brought about, but if the country had been prepared with a proper scheme it would probably not have been necessary to expend one-third of the money that was expended. I am simply asking the present Government to make the necessary preparations. A private member's Bill will not meet the case at all. It is necessary to induce the Government to bring in a B ill , and I am asking the present Government to do so. We are at the initiatory stage of a proper defence system, and it is very evident that the Government, either because of information received from the Imperial authorities, or through their own far-seeingdiscernment, believe there is a possibility of hostilities in the somewhat near future between the British Empire and some other Power. I think that* our extraordinary preparations for defence warrant me incoming to that conclusion. In fairness to that section of the community who are in the Defence Forces, whether regulars or compulsorily enrolled, we ought to be prepared for the contingencies that always occur^ when hostilities begin. It seems peculiar that, while we are making greatpreparations in enrolling men ancl providing munitions of war, clothing, and horseflesh, we are making none whatever for the men to whom death or injuries mav occur during a war, and I think flesh and blood ought to be considered first. This is all the more peculiar in view of the fact that the military calling is not the means of living",19,Liams
63,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),,20,Defence Forces Pensions
64,Mr Riley,S o is every man.,20,Defence Forces Pensions
65,Mr Mathews,"T h a t is so, especiallyof the men who are compulsorily enrolled, or who are volunteers. Their work is in the outside world, and can take advantage of the opportunities which occur to improve their position. The members of our regular forces, whether naval or military, have not these advantages for providing for their old age, and, unfortunately, as I showed in detail last year by placing the list of salaries on record, they are paid at lower rates, comparatively, than are persons of the same rank of life outside the service. They are paid less, and have none of the opportunities for improving their position that occur to persons outside the service, and they are retired at an age earlier than that at which ordinary public servants are retired. A soldier is not much good after he has reached the age of fifty or fifty-five, or, at least, a younger man would probably be more useful in war time. We should be foolish, therefore, to keep in the service men who had reached an age at which they were less useful than younger men would be. I admit the need for retiring the men of the Defence Forces at a certain age. But we must not forget that they have to retire early, and that they are taken into the service before they have been able to learn any trade. During their period of service they are paid at low rates, have no opportunities while serving for improving their position, and must retire early, and, to my mind, it is inhuman for us to make no provision for the period when they will be thrown on their own resources. 1 do not take the attitude that it is only those who support the motion who are capable of humane feelings in this .matter. memfjer propose to apply his scheme to all the compulsorv trainees? honourable member was of opinion that my motion did not meet the case, and I agreed to alter it.

He and I were reared in a position of life in which the need for such pensions was made very apparent. I have made the motion as comprehensive as possible, so that the whole of the Defence Forces may be covered, but, of course, the permanent men will have to be treated differently from the compulsory trainees and the volunteers or the militia. In respect to casualties received in service, however, I think that every man who is disabled permanently should be pensioned. There seems to be an impression abroad that hostilities are not far off, and it is as important to make provision for alleviating the distress war must cause as to make preparations to resist attack. The foolishness of the United States in not providing a pension fund in advance has cost that country an immense amount of money. Excepting those in the ranks, the non-commissioned officers in our service receive less pay than those of similar grades in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States, and everywhere, except in Australia, some provision such as I suggest is made for the members of the Defence Forces. 1 do not believe in thumping my chest, and saying, "" I am an Australian, and Australia leads the world,"" but I am proud of my country none the less, and wish her to be as civilized as the rest of the world. In this matter she is lagging behind. I . feel strongly that something should be done with a Labour Government in power, because the party with which I am associated has always shown a desire to help those least able to help themselves. Let me now point out another difference between the men of our Defence Forces and the ordinary public servants. Parliament has provided that public servants of the Commonwealth may go before the Arbitration Court, and make such representations as they please in regard to rates of wages, conditions, of employment, skill required of them, dangerous character of their occupation, cost of living, and so forth, with a view to getting their remuneration increased, or their conditions improved. But the members of the Defence Forces cannot do this. They are justified, therefore, in coming toParliament for redress. Mr J. H .

Those who have followed the speeches and actions of Mr Winston Churchill during the last few years must know that he is determined that something shall be done in this direction; and surely we, too, ought to consider this question, so that men who occupy what is really a unique position shall receive better treatment. my own side of the House, in conclusion, to bear in mind the fact that the members of our permanent Defence Forces cannot resort, as other men can do, to the Courts to secure the redress of their grievances. The National Parliament is the only Court to which fhey can appeal to redress their wrongs, and to place them' in this regard on a footing with, the permanent Defence Forces of other civilized countries. I give the honourable member, credit for having submitted this motion, but I certainly do not think that finality will be reached by bringing forward such a proposal again and again in the name of a private member. If the Government are sincere in their desire to grant pensions to the permanent forces of Australia they have only to come down with a measure to give effect to such a scheme. In the absence of any such proposal we must assume that they are opposed to a pension system for the Defence Forces. I hope that they will seriously consider this question, and either submit to the Parliament a pension scheme, or endeavour to propose something in the nature of a contributory superannuation fund. I for one would not agree to a contributory scheme being adopted until the I have heard honourable mempresent rates of pay in connection with our permanent forces had been increased. The payment of the men is not sufficient to enable them under existing conditions to conI do not tribute to a superannuation f u n d ; but if we cannot secure for them a pension scheme, then some arrangement might be made to increase their pay, and at the same time to bring into operation a contributory superannuation fund. It is absolutely essential to the efficiency of our permanent forces that there should be some encouragement Every for long service ancl some inducement for the best material amongst the young men of Australia to join the Army or the Navy. At present there is none. I know many Eveni n a country estimable young men who would like to join the military force, but who say that under existing circumstances "" it is not worth the candle ""-that the life of a man in the permanent forces is wasted. That is practically true. the world when that time has arrived. opposite think that a man's life is practically wasted in the military forces why have they supported the great scheme of I ask ' honourable members on compulsory service, for the introduction of which they take credit? good job for the world when the defence forces have nothing to do. armaments and live in peace it would be well. amongst ourselves, must less amongst nations. are compelled to make provision for our own protection, so long must we make theyery best possible provision, and to do that it is essential that we should give every encouragement to our permanent forces. I think that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, in submitting this motion, suffered from a little confusion of mind.

As a matter of fact, the niotion simply provides for a scheme of pensions to apply to the permanent forces, so that when members of the permanent forces arrive at the age of retirement they may demand a pension as a right. want to go into details. the House to affirm the general principle. to deal for the present only with our permanent forces, because'it is necessary that we should make those forces as efficient as possible. It is our desire that they shall be an example to the great citizen army that we hope to build up. We wish them to be the nucleus of our great citizen army, ancl to be able to draw from them thoroughly trained instructors. Unless we have the best material and plenty of it in our permanent forces our defence scheme will fail in this respect; and. therefore, it is essential that they should be kept up to their f u l l strength. A t the present time, however, great difficulty is experienced in inducing desirable young men to join, because most of them realize that they can do much better for themselves in civil occupations. for Melbourne Ports pointed out, more encouragement should be given to our permanent forces, both officers and men. The pay they receive is less than that in any other part of the world. actual amount paid in England may be less, but living there is cheaper, and there are concessions which make the pay here actually lowerthan it is, not only fn England, but in any part of the British Empire or the United States. We pride ourselves in Australia on the fact that the wages paid here are as high as or higher than in any other part of the world. as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports says, that men employed in civil vocations in Australia always have the right of appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court for the settlement of wages and conditions; and that is a privilege not enjoyed by the members of our present permanent, forces, whose only tribunal is Parliament. well advised if they were to introduce a pension or a superannuation scheme, with provision for increase in the rates of pay; for, unless the two go together, I could not agree to any proposal made. -case of the trainees for the Navy, there is a -deferred pay scheme; and no doubt our naval men are paid better than are the men in the military branch of the. Defence Forces. The pay given to the lads when they first join is such that they can afford to contribute under the deferred pay scheme; and I , for one, cannot see why better conditions should prevail in the Navy than in the Army. We ought to do I simply wish everything in our power to make compulsory training a success; and, personally, I have, from the platform in I think it would be well many parts of New South Wales, exhorted both lads and parents to cheerfully put up with any little inconvenience that may be caused by the new system. It would be lamentable if the plan for the creation of our great citizen army should turn out to be a failure; but I can see that there is some danger from the fact that we are unable to secure sufficient qualified instructors. Personally, I prefer a straight out pension scheme to any contributory or superannuation scheme. We know that every other nation in the world has a system of defence pensions; and this is mainly because men who spend their lives in the Army are on a different footing from almost every other section of the community. A member 'of the permanent forces has to devote the whole of his time As the honourable member to his duties; and the training and knowledge he receives are of practically no value in civil life -A man, through no fault of his own, may have to leave the Army when he is practically in the prime The of life, and he finds himself utterly at a loss to know what to do for his own support ; he is outstripped in the race of life owing to his ignorance of everything but military matters. It is true that some of the artillerymen or submarine miners might be able to do pick and shovel work, but the bulk of the military men find themselves utterly at a loss. It is true, A master gunner, for instance, has to undergo .a most severe training, and, in order to pass the many stiff examinations, has to devote much more than eight hours a day to study. I undertake to say that there is not an honourable member, including myself, who would be able to answer a single question on some of the examination papers I have seen; indeed, the stiffest The Government would be examinations in the world are those in the military service, especially those relating to gunnery. Such a man as I have instanced is, however, absolutely unfitted to compete in commercial or industrial life. OfI n the course, it may be asked why civilians, who have to leave their situations, should not also be given pensions; but such men are",23,Defence Forces Pensions
88,Mr Mathews,1 said that I did not,24,Defence Forces Pensions
89,Mr Ryrie,"able to find other situations, whereas a military man is fitted for nothing but a military life. down with a pension scheme, it would doubtless be passed; and I can only take it that if they do not do so, they are unfavorable to such a proposal. orable member is fair in making such an assertion. that if a pension scheme were made a Government measure, it would be passed. At all events, I hope something will be done, because encouragement of the kind would have a most beneficial effect on the permanent forces. The cost would not be such a great deal, seeing that we have not many permanent men; at any rate, we can well afford to pay pensions to those on whom we may have to depend to defend our hearths and homes from foreign aggression. [3.53] -This is no new question. Similar proposals were made last session and the session before; and the question has been fairly well debated by various honourable members, including the honourable member for Maranoa. When the matter was under discussion on a previous occasion, a scheme of pensions was suggested as the result of a conference' representing the forces of all the States. That scheme, I understand, was submitted for the consideration of the Minister of Defence; and the honourable member for Maranoa strongly urged the Government the lines suggested by fhe Conference. Nothing so far as I can learn has been done in the matter since that time. This, however, is a question which the House is not in a position to determine in the absence of a definite B ill . tially a question for the Government. Action should lie initiated by the Minister of Defence in die form of a direct proposal to bs submitted to the House. It is all very well for us to occupy even private members' time in discussing more or less academic motions which have no binding force when passed upon the Government of the day, but these opportunities for discussion only allow the Government to know what is in the minds of private members who have no administrative power themselves. Such motions can at most be only taken by the Government as a guide -to the opinions of the members of the House. If honourable members on the Ministerial, as well as on the Opposition, side of the House are favorable to a scheme of pen-, sions such as is proposed in the motion, I If tlie Government were to come can see no obstacle to the Government laying a measure definitely before the House, when it could be discussed with some promise of practical results. If this motion is carried, it will amount to no more than an expression of the opinion of the members of the House. It will not carry the House one jot further forward with regard to a pension scheme. there will be a moral obligation on the Government to give effect to it. "" moral obligation "" part of it is a matter of Ministerial opinion. Ministers often take the view that such a motion in no sense commits the Government to the adoption of a policy. We must remember that the Government of the clay are saddled with the responsibility for financing the scheme, and must, therefore, thresh the matter out in a much more thorough manner among themselves, and with their officers, than we, as private members of the House, can hope to do in the time at our disposal. financial aspect of it before helping to commit the House to it? lize that the financial aspect of it will assume very large dimensions, but I can see other directions in which expenditure is being lightly undertaken with far less justito submit proposals on fication. However, that is a matter for Ministerial consultation and action. It rests with them to make it part of their policy if they believe in it, and to bring down some practical measure for the consideration of the House. There may, of course, It is essenbe some practical outcome from this debate, but none of us can say that there will be, because the Government are dumb upon the motion. They preserve the cold silence of the grave. The subject certainly ought to occupy the serious attention of the Government, and some steps should be taken to investigate the scheme which has been put into the hands of many honourable members, although I do not think it has been laid officially before the House. I have a copy of it among my papers, and it seems to me that, with certain emendations, it is worthy of serious consideration. In fact, at the time it was brought forward it was promised serious consideration by one of the Ministers in this House. I think the",24,Defence Forces Pensions

Some years ago the honorahle member for Parramatta, when Minister of Defence, informed me in the House, in answer to representations on this very question, that the Government of which he was a member proposed to take the whole question of pensions into their immediate consideration.

No provision is made against it, and the whole question of pensions ought to be comprehensively gone into. life, or was permanently injured, his relatives would be compensated. it, and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is asking that provision in that direction should be made, as well as provision for an ordinary pension for the man who has practically surrendered his capacity to earn his own living by subordinating self to his regiment and regimental idea, when he passes out of his sphere of physical usefulness into the declining is not in the same happy period of his days.

131,S ° A Motion Similar Dr. Maloney,"As has been the case inhowever, is an argument, riot against pensions per se, but against a defective system. It is an argument in favour of a wise and intelligently thought-out scheme. The more I think of this matter, the more it seems to me that an insurance scheme would be better than a free pension scheme. ber mean that the members of the forces should pay the insurance? their pay should be so adjusted as to enable them to do so. I know what is at the back of such a question as that just 'put by the honourable member. the reply that the honourable member suggests an increase in salaries to meet the conthrow up their hats for him. tribution: to a pension fund ? that the Permanent Forces should be paid sufficient to provide for a reasonable wage or salary for the work they do, plus their retiring allowance. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has eloquently pointed out this afternoon, the case of the military or naval officer is not on all-fours with that of the ordinary employ^ outside. He has to devote himself to a particular class of work, and the more he specializes the more he becomes unfitted, in some respects, to betake himself to other duties. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member wants to treat him as other men are treated ? be sure that when he has given his best services to the defence of his country he will not be turned out to the cold mercies of a cold world. I want him to have something substantial on leaving the Service. When I put that view of the case to the honourable member another member of his party says "" Why should not every one be treated in the same way? "" "" W h y not ? "" I have already stated that I am in favour of every one receiving a reasonable retiring allowance after it has been provided for, and my desire is that a scheme shall be evolved to enable that to be done. But the moment the honourable member for Melbourne began to frame a scheme of that sort he would find the nimble little gentleman beside him denouncing him as being opposed to the present old-age pension scheme. Mr J. H . CATTS member, perhaps, would not denounce a member of his own party for doing something to which he would take exception if it were done by an honourable member on this side of the House. Honourable members opposite cannot attach much importance to this question, or they would not allow the Government to refrain from saying one word, good, bad, or indifferent, in regard to it . HadI not risen to rpeak. the consideration of this motion would have been adjourned in the usual way; the people would have thrown up their hats for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and there the matter would have ended. Mr J. H . CATTS -And now, according to the honourable member, the people will do my duty, and if the people choose to throw up their hats for the honourable member they are at liberty to do so. Whenever this proposal has been brought before the House during the last two years I have endeavoured to obtain from the Government a definite statement as to their intention. orable member make a definite statement of his intentions regarding this matter when he was in office? orable members opposite have learned their little lesson very well in caucus. Every one of them, as soon as he enters the I wish him to Chamber, asks, "" What did the honourable member do when he was in office? "" l t is really time that they stopped trifling with tlie matter in this way. What we did is immaterial to the issue. We did not have an opportunity to carry out the Kitchener scheme. We secured it for this Government, and they are. not carrying it through in this particular , as well as in other particulars, which could be mentioned if they were relevant to the motion before the Chair. The obligation is upon the Government to do something in regard to this proposal, rather than to talk about it, as they have done during the last two years. It is true, as has been stated, that there is a disinclination to turn men out of the Service to beggary. Only last year, specially created billets were found for three retired officers; and, in my opinion, the position is degrading 16 those men. There are other officers, however, of equal status and ability, and longer service, for whom no No . positions have been f o u n d ; and I should",29,Stilts | ° ™> T Be S Bh Ati N

143,Mr Josep H Cook,"No doubt honlike to know why there should be this discrimination. Of the three officers, one was from ""Victoria, one from South Australia, and one from Queensland ; and the positions they were given enable tliem to earn about ^£300 a year; but, as I say, there are others with equal claims who have not been treated even in this belated way. favouritism ought not to be attributable to a Government who profess to deal out even-handed justice; but they are trying to escape from their obligation to bring down a pensions scheme. I do not blame the Government for looking after the three officers, for such a step was only humane. created for them? member the technical designations, but one of them is Inspector of Ordnance. ley, Colonel Lee, and Colonel Lyster. In my opinion, it is not proper that these men, who have been years in command, should be taken from their high positions, and placed in subordinate posts in their own Department. of useful occupation for the declining years of these gentlemen, I should try to secure positions for them in some other Department, and not make them submit to the present rather degrading arrangement. I know that these officers do not like the position in which they are placed; and none of us would. not think tliat the Government are to be commended for giving the officers these positions ? only humane to find them positions; my complaint is that the same has not been done in other cases. There is an officer in New South Wales who retired about the same time with longer service, and not a farthing, nor a position, has been found for him. mention his name? honourable member privately; he knows the officer very well. Something must be done to get rid of those anomalies, even as a matter of practical administration. We never can have an efficient force, either military or naval, until a system of retiring allowances is provided; and I think the firmer basis would be that of a superannuation allowance. This was a point on which Lord Kitchener laid special emphasis. I often discussed the matter with him when he was here; and his idea was that there should be a system of compulsory deductions, or, in other words, a system of insurance or superannuation. Such pay? just pay in order to enable the men to make this provision, and let the schemework itself out in the future. means a readjustment of pay in all ranks to meet the extra expenditure? Having no particulars before me, I can I do not reonly lay down the principle. The pay to officers and men of all ranks should be such as to adequately remunerate them for their services, and give them something to retire on. The details must be left to those who work out the scheme; but the principle is a sound one, and the more it is extended, as a matter of Government policy and administration, the better it will be for all concerned. In a matter which is supreme HadI to provide a haven and vital to the nation's safety, it is above all, necessary that some such scheme as that suggested should be carried out at the earliest possible moment; and the proper time would appear to me to be when the new defence policy, both naval and military, is being put into operation. When I am taunted, as I have been a dozen times by honourable members opposite, about what I did do or did not do as Minister of Defence, I reply that it was my intention, had I been permitted to carry out the scheme, which, with the aid of my Government, I succeeded in getting formulated, to I said it was adopt the recommendations of LordK it chener in their entirety, so far as concerns the allowances to men of all ranks. Even now, the men are not being paid according to Lord Kitchener's recommendations. I believe that the rankers are not being so paid; and there is no more pressing subject of inquiry than the pay of our W ill the honourable member Army and Navy, as compared with the pay of the forces in other parts of the Empire. I shall tell the I believe that many of the men in the Service are now underpaid; and I may say that, as Minister, I tried to adjust some of the cases which came under my notice. I increased the pay of a number of men, and, in the case of others, I re, arranged the classification, with the result of providing increased pay. That, however, was only desultory or tentative action;",30,Stilts | ° ™> T Be S Bh Ati N

155,Mr Joseph Cook,"It all depends.something more scientific and thorough is needed, and it should surely have been done at this time of day, after two more years of this so-called up-to-date Administration. As a matter of fact, however, the treatment of this question is becoming more casual in the House. Honourable members opposite now take very little interest in the matter; and this motion would have gone through to-day without one word from the Minister, had I not risen. I do not know whether the Minister will say anything here, or what he will say in caucus; but the least he can do is to favour honourable members on this side with some statement as to the mind of the Government on this important question. am absolutely against any system of pensions other than the old-age pension, die invalid pension, and, possibly, a child pension in the future. The State of Victoria affords one of the most infamous pages in the history of pensions that the world can show. Some years ago I had a return prepared, which can now be consulted in the Library, showing that this little State of Victoria paid more in Public Service pensions than all the rest of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. New South Wales, with 300,000 more in population at that time, paid infinitely less siderably to our defence expenditure. to its retired public servants. should be decided as to military and naval pensions until the question has been submitted to the people by way of referendum. I am far from feeling any enmity to the soldier; but if I am asked which troops I most admire, I point to those of the Emperor Hadrian, who not only led tlie disciplined legions of Rome, but taught them trades, and caused them, in their spare time, to cover the earth with palaces, and with temples to every religion, the remains of some of whicli are to-day the admiratiion of the artist. If this motion is persisted in I shall certainly submit an amendment that any scheme of pensions shall not come into force until it has been made the subject of a referendum. In Australia we have the most munificent of all pension systems for the old people, and if it is desired to increase those pensions, by all means let us do so; but our soldiers are paid more per unit than are the soldiers of any nation in the world. Adams, in his book on Switzerland, in dealing with the cost per unit of the European soldiers, shows that England heads the list with £ 6 4 , while in Switzerland the cost is only £7. A t the same time, that great authority states that England, with all her vast expenditure, could riot do what the small federated States of Switzerland, with their three different languages, can do-namely , mobilize 250,000 men within seven days. England might be able to effect such a mobilization now, but she could not do so when that statement was made by a man who had been a soldier, and knew what he was writing about. Then, again, our officers are highly paid. The Commanderin-Chief of the Swiss army, in time of actual warfare, when lie commands 250,000 men, receives only £ 2 a day; and yet one officer who was sent from England to command the Forces of Victoria alone, received £ 1 , 5 0 0 per annum. receives .£1,250 per annum. Moltke, when in command of over 500,000 German soldiers, received only £ 1 , 5 0 0 per annum, though, of course, we know that attached to the salary there was a. retiring allowance. The honourable member who introduced the motion must have sympathy with the soldier, because, if I am not mistaken, he, in his early years in England, heard the tap of the drum; but we must not forget that such a. scheme will add conNothing Would any honourable member care to go outside and advocate a pension or a retiring allowance for any special section of the community? It may be said that soldiers follow a very unhealthy and dangerous occupation; but the history of the world shows that the occupations of those in the great army of labour are 50 per cent, more dangerous. For instance, a shunter on the railways follows one of the most dangerous of employments. Let honourable members read Oliver's Diseases of Occupation, and compare the death rates given there with those of a soldier's calling. A soldier's life, after a l l , is a healthy one, because on his health depends the efficiency of the regiment or the army to do the necessary work. Is it not possible for members of the Permanent Forces, who put in so many hours of training, to learn a trade or calling? It would not take them as many hours as the Emperor Hadrian made his soldiers put in. I shall vote against any pension for a class or a party.

159,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes) [5.4],"sailors, not on any grounds of sentiment, but because the soldier and the sailor enter a service which may at any time involve great risks to life, or bodily injury, although that might not occur to them for years, and also because it is a recognised principle that die payment of the soldier and sailor can never be equal to that of an ordinary worker in the usual occupations of life. The strongest fact that can be cited with regard to the motion is the following paragraph in Lord Kitchener's report upon our Military ForcesI f men of the right stamp are to be attracted to the corps, the pay of each rank must be good; and in this connection it must be remembered that the circumstances of an officer's services prevent, and rightly so, his participation in commercial ventures. For the Staff Corps to be successful, its officers, must concentrate a.11 their system, guaranteeing each man against energies on their profession, and their pay should, therefore, be sufficient, not only for their keep while serving, but also to insure to them a competence when retired. In view of these conditions, I recommend rates of pay shown in Table IV., with the proviso that in each rank a compulsory deduction should be made sufficient to assure an adequate provision for maintenance on retirement. I know from my experience of the debates in this House, and in the New South Wales Parliament, that there is, and always has been on the part of the Labour party, a strong prejudice .against anything in the .shape of pensions; but I think that if that were analyzed carefully it .would be found that there was a sort of general belief that the pension was something in addition to the pay. Honourable members will notice that Lord Kitchener points out that the soldier, whether an oflicer or a man-and the same thing applies to the sailor-As precluded from taking part in any other occupation. I am referring only to those who give their services to the country for purely military and naval purposes, so that they cannot, as an area officer can sometimes do, proceed' with their ordinary occupations and treat their military service as an addition. I am assuming that the pensions which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports proposes are intended for the regular permanent soldiers and sailors. If , as Lord Kitchener points out, the precaution were taken, after fixing on a reasonable remuneration for their services, of making a compulsory deduction, enabling the Government to invest that money in an insurance fund in order to give the members of the Forces a pension, they would practically be paying the pensions themselves. It would be merely putting into practice that system of compulsory insurance which, I believe, the Labour party Mr Bruce Smith. favour, following the lines of the law which has been placed on the statute-book of the legislation ? that that which I am advocating is so. dividualist. to discuss other questions with the honourable member in the Library at any time. The members of the Labour party may not like to be reminded of an inconsistency in their policy, but it is fair to state that, whereas they are in favour of an insurance poverty, want, and various other vicissitudes of life, they are here opposing, and always have opposed, a system of pensions, which is practically identical with a system of insurance, as recommended by the great officer whose advice we are endeavouring to carry out to the letter in other respects. I could quite understand the Labour party laying down the rule that they were against pensions, if the pensions were to be in addition to the pay; but, as proposed by Lord Kitchener, the pay is to be "" good,"" and the pensions are to be the result of a compulsory deduction from that regular ""good"" pay. Surely it is a fair thing that the Government should adopt that advice. Lord Kitchener was invited to make a complete set of proposals for the constitution of an army, and we cannot do better than adopt the scheme he gave us. The honourable member for Melbourne claimed that many other classes of this community are as much entitled to pensions as are soldiers. I agree with him-. Here, as in other countries, there are cases of women, who have brought up their families respectably against the most adverse circumstances against terrible "" o d d s "" ; no one knows what their sufferings have been. Such women are often morally better entitled to the Victoria Cross than are soldiers who have accidentally fallen into circumstances, as some of them have admitted, in which their human nature drove them to the performance of deeds which were afterwards recognised as "" acts of bravery."" However, we are not now on that subject. The honourable member referred to the Red Sea, to the Emperor Hadrian, and to the payment of soldiers hundreds of years ago.",33,Stilts | ° ™> T Be S Bh Ati N

I contend, however, that soldiers and sailors are not so well paid as those who follow the trades which they would probably follow were they not in the Defence Forces. It may be objected that they do not work hard, but, on the other hand, it must be remembered that they give the whole of their time to the service of the Government, and engage not to enter upon any other occupation; that is,, of course, the permanent men. I am not dealing with the area officers, who are in the nature of militia men. Lord Kitchener advised us to give "" good "" pay in order to get good men. A few months ago it was very difficult to obtain men for these services, because wages were so much higher outside. How can we get men if we do not make the services attractive ? try observation. The honourable member may be so philosophical that he would dispense with war, but fortunately the people of the country, who read the signs of the times, recognise that in order to be»safe they must, however peaceably disposed, be prepared for war. the honourable member would be wise if he tried to put his views into practice, seeing that all the world is of an opposite opinion. The onus is thrown on us, if we ignore Lord Kitchener's sound advice, of giving good reasons for doing so. He counselled the giving of "" good^' pay, and the making of a deduction for a fund to [47]2 provide against retirement. I do not see that we can take part of his advice and reject another part. Of course, if the Government are luke-warm, evasion can be understood; but if we intend to seriously provide for the defence of Australia, and of the Empire, we must make these services attractive. At the present time they are not attractive. Most of us recognise that to be healthy and to enjoy long life we must be continually active, mentally are the sources of vitality. An occupation which, in times of peace, at least, is not strenuous, lacks attraction for many men, and we must make it attractive to secure the men we need. The honourable member for Melbourne, with his usual philanthropic feeling, drifted into a discussion of the dangers that beset child-life. I sympathize with many of his views, though I do not regard them as apropos of the subjects to which he applies them. He spoke of the large number of children who die at early ages, but I would remind him that those who die cannot need 'pensions, while the survivors come lo be able to look after themselves. I hope that we shall not blow hot and cold in this matter. To obtain a strong service we should adopt, not only Lord Kitchener's methods of administration and training, but also his advice in regard to pay and pensions, making the pay ""good"" and deducting from it sums which will create a fund to provide for their retirement. While I have the best feeling for those in our defence services, I would point out that no party has a right to pledge the country to a pension system without consulting the people, and this question was not raised at the elections. I shall, therefore, support the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne. Since this Government took office, the pay of the rank and file has been increased by is. a day, namely, from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. These men are fed, clothed, and sheltered, it being estimated that they receive the equivalent of 8s. a day. Outside the service I do not think there are many working men who, after paying the expense of maintaining their families, have nothing like 24s. 6d. a week clear, and Parliament must consider them.

173,Mr Riley (South Sydney) [5.21],"men died rapidly because of the dangerous nature of the work on which they were employed. They contracted what was known as sewer consumption, and died when quite young. They were really greater heroes than soldiers are, because they were fighting against disease, and engaged on work which has made the city healthier. But -there was no outcry for a pension for them, or for their wives and children, although hundreds of families lost their breadwinners. The coal miners, too, take their lives in their hands every day, to supply the coal which keeps our industrial machinery in operation. Their work is not clean, easy, safe, or regular, but they do not receive pensions. Soldiers have a clean job, some cases lead a gentleman's life. If this pension scheme is to be inaugurated there must be some discrimination. availed myself of an opportunity to look at a return placed upon the table of the House on the motion of the honourable member for North Sydney, and was astounded at the number of large salaries which it showed were being paid to military omcers in this country. A t the M i l i tary College at Duntroon, where we have eighty-four cadets, there are no less than twelve men receiving salaries ranging from £ 9 0 0 to £ 3 5 0 per annum. One receives a salary of £ 4 5 0 per annum as a professor of physical culture, and three or four others receive £ 3 5 0 a year for giving instruction in physical culture in different parts of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, every school teacher in our public schools is compelled to give such instruction in the ordinary course of his every-day work. I am sure that the people will be surprised to learn the great expense which our military system involves, and that they will not tolerate an all-round pensions scheme. are excessive, that fact has nothing to do with the claim of others for consideration. the Military College are to increase enormously in numbers. the cost of our military system has been enormously increased. At the present time our cost of defence is about 23s. per head of the population. we are third on the list of the nations of many things that we were told, a few years the world. Our naval and military expenago, we could not do. I should like to diture per head of the population exceeds remind the House that we have inaugurated that of Germany and England, and it is still growing; so that we have a right to be very careful in dealing with this matter. of men who are already in the service. honourable member was present when I mentioned that since the present Government came into office the rank and file have received an increase of is. per day, so that their pay is now equivalent, having regard to the standard of .living, to about 8s. per day. They receive 24s. 6d. per week, in addition to food, shelter, and clothing. I do not say that that is too high a rate of pay, or that it is enough. My contention is that we should pay the members of our are not hard worked, and in Defence Forces a sufficient salary, and allow them to provide for their own pensions, the same as all other workers have I to do. We have already declared, and properly so, I think, that pensions shall not be payable to our Judges, and we have no system of pensions for the Public Service. It seems to me that the adoption of this proposal would be the thin edge of the wedge to the introduction of a system of Public Service pensions, which, I believe, the people would not tolerate. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne is a democratic one. He says, in effect, "" Let the people decide this matter."" Let us submit the question to a referendum, and let the people determine whether or not there shall be a pensions system in connection with our permanent Defence Forces. The policy of the British Empire to-day is that of short service, and I believe that that is the best system. Why should a man be called upon to make sacrifices by spending most of his life either on board ship or in barracks, where he can have none of the comforts of domestic or home life ? As a Parliament, we ought not to encourage that sort of life. A man who is compelled to spend years in barracks, or on board ship, is not in a position to perform the proper functions of citizenship. Men should not be required to I recognise that. undergo long periods of service. WA n d the cadets at should adopt the system of short service, and allow our men, at the expiration of that service, to go out into the world and We must recollect that assist in increasing the industrial wealth of. the country.",35,Stilts | ° ™> T Be S Bh Ati N

I hope that every man in the community will be trained and drilled, so that we shall never have a standing army. We ought all to be trained to defend our country, and then we shall never be afraid of any military caste or power controlling us on any particular occasion. I should hesitate to vote to bring about a system of pensions for the Defence Forces, because I believe the people have not been consulted. We shall do right in referring the matter to the people, and if they decide that such a system ought to be inaugurated, then, undoubtedly, we must give effect to their will. The reasons that have been put forward by -honourable members opposite against the humanitarian scheme which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports desires this House to recognise have occasioned me considerable surprise. We have had the honourable member for Melbourne, in the first place, holding out as a fit example for this country to follow the slave-driving methods of a Roman Emperor, concerning whom history has told us sumcient, I think, to make us desire not to pursue the lines f o l lowed by him in getting his work carried out. The honourable member has also given us the example of certain European countries, which pay their officers a miserable pitoutside; but I hold that no such comparison tance, and the rank and file of their defence forces practically nothing whatever. told us that these were the examples which we ought to follow in endeavouring to build up our Permanent Forces, and to secure the fullest measure of efficiency. It is certainly not possible to secure the necessary efficiency in certain branches of the Service by the methods which the honourable member for South Sydney has just suggested. The honourable member has stated that one reason why he is opposed to the payment of pensions to'Ihe members of our permanent Defence Forces is that he believes in a system of short service, and thinks that we should never have a standing army. Surely the honourable member knows that the short service conditions of which he spoke do not apply in the Old Country to the particular I know that we shall branches of the service in which we have permanent men. in certain branches of the service. It takes many years to train men in certain branches in which only highly-trained men are of any use. This scheme is designed to benefit, not only the rank and file, but officers whom it is absolutely necessary that we should have-highly-traine d men on whose education we are now spending large sums of money in order to give them that grounding in military science which is abso-, Iutely necessary if we are to have any efficiency in our Forces. The honourable member for South Sydney also declared that this question had never been before the country. I submit .that it has been. Honourable members of the Opposition, and also, I believe, honourable members 'opposite, went to the country pledged to carry out Lord Kitchener's scheme AN Honorable MEMBER No ! members opposite did. I have Heardi t stated a good many times that they were pledged to it, and I maintain that a system of pensions for our Permanent Forces is an integral part of Lord Kitchener's scheme. It is one of the matters on which that great soldier expressed a very decided opinion. He declared that it was absolutely necessary that we should have some definite scheme of retiring allowances for our Permanent Forcesi f we were to secure the right class of men. Honourable members opposite have sought to draw comparisons between the members of our Permanent Force and people who are working can. be made. I fully admit that there . He are many walks of life in which men are exposed to great dangers, and that it is possible that greater sacrifices for the country are often made by persons outside than are made by men in the Military Forces. That, liowever, has nothing to do with this case. Each case must be considered on its own peculiar merits. The members of our Permanent Forces, whether they are called upon to do active service or not, are always liable to active service, and to all the risks that it entails.

192,Mr Poynton (Grey) [5.48],"The depernicious effects of lead poisoning. Of course, it may be said that these men undertake this work voluntarily but, at the same time, they are doing an important part of the work of production hi this country. The same may be said of coal miners, who, .on occasion, are exposed to dreadful disaster while doing good service to the community. A vast number of gold miners are incapacitated by miners' complaint; and it is difficult to see why they ought not to be taken into consideration in any pension scheme. opens up something like a Lloyd-George insurance scheme.

A walk through the BrokenH ill Cemetery would show at what a very early age many miners died some years ago. I admit that greater sanitary precautions are now taken, and that improvements have been made in the working of the mines; but there were per-sonal friends of my own, all fine types of men, who, after a short time in the mines, became physical wrecks. died, some of them, incapacitated for any exertion, lingering long before their release.

' arguments against the motion appear to be entirely of a negative nature. that there are numbers of men who follow dangerous occupations, and to whom no -consideration is given in their later years, and that, therefore, no consideration should ibe given to the members of our Defence Forces. That argument does not appeal to me. Outside employee's should, of course, receive proper consideration, and that can be obtained by means of some scheme of national insurance to which they could contribute out of wages decreed by the industrial Courts. Members of the Defence Forces, however, are on different ground; they are the Government's own employees, and to pay them a higher wage to enable them to contribute to an annuity appears to me to be a round-about method. They are the particular servants of the Government, and they ought to be paid a wage to enable them to live decently and comfortably, and In fact, the whole discussion then given a pension as part of the contract. These men are our first line of defence, and they practically devote their lives to the country; and, under the circumstances, they COOK Does Lloyddeserve special consideration, or, at any rate, as much consideration as is claimed for those who follow other dangerous ocI do not know. cupations. There is something of the heroic about the members of our MilitaryI t does not. and Naval Forces, and that fact probably tends to mould public opinion, though I am not particularly affected by that aspect of the question. Regarding the motion as a practical business proposal, I think the Government have an obligation cast upon them to secure a competence in their old age to the men who give the best of their lives to the service and defence of the country. When they are retired they are practically disqualified for other forms of occupation. They know practically nothing of the world, for it has taken almost a lifetime Many of them for them to become effective soldiers. These special facts demand special attention, and I intend to vote for the motion. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [5.56] . -Howeve r much some of us may be inMy sympathy clined to support a national system of insurance, on which our old-age pensions scheme might be engrafted, and which would make the old-age pension a much larger amount than it is now, and to urge I am not prepared to vote for the that it should be introduced at the earliest possible opportunity, if we attempt now to merge the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports into such a system, it will be tantamount to shelving it altoing a word to interfere with the old-age It is said pension system as it exists now.

197,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [5.52],"The gether. I make that reference without saythe ios. a week which we now give him. T agree with the honourable member for Macquarie that the members of the Defence Forces ought to be, and must be, treated as a special body, apart altogether from the general mass of workers. I hope to see introduced a system of compulsory national insurance, not only for old-age, but for unemployment also, and covering every person in the community, but the proposal ot the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is for something entirely different. It applies to a body of men who are prohibited by their very occupation from taking part in any other work which would give them a sufficient remuneration to make proper provision for their old-age. Tf we are io make our Defence Forces a reality, we can only do it by telling our young men that, if they enter the Army or Navy, and give the best years of their lives to their country's service, hold themselves in readiness to be called out when necessary, and always to form the first line of our defence, the Government and the people of Australia will not allow them to be turned out to starve like worn-out bullocks, or to go to the workhouse, or receive an old-age pension. I have always advocated the establishment of a general system of compulsory national insurance for the whole of the people of Australia, hut it is our duty now to make special provision for our Defence Forces. We ought to have done it when we introduced our first Defence Bill. was one of those who said then that a pension system should be inaugurated with it. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie that to increase the pay and stop the increase to form a pensions fund is only a round-about way of doing the thing. It is simply hypocrisy to say "" We are not prepared to introduce a system of pensions, but we will grant you a pension by giving you an increased wage, taking the increase from you, and returning it to you afterwards."" This is a matter in which the Government ought to take the lead. It is impossible for any private member to bring in a scheme and carry it into operation. The Government, who are responsible for the finances of the country and for the management of the Defence Forces, have it as their duty, and it should be their privilege, as it certainly is their responsithe debate. bility, to take the lead. I shall vote for the motion, because I believe the Government should take the question into consideration at the earliest opportunity. Those Hr. who enter our Army and Navy should know that, after giving the best years of their lives to the service, they will not be left to the mercy of a cold world in their old age. With the Navy this is especially necessary, because we note, with regret, a considerable hesitancy on the part of the young men of Australia to enter it. A large proportion of the men on our warships are not Australian born, and there is not a great desire among Australians generally to take to a seafaring life. It will be found that a considerable proportion of those who work around our coasts are British born, and that a large percentage of the remainder are foreigners. We shall never have a real Australian Navy until it is manned by Australians, and if it is to be manned by Australians they must be given some encouragement, such as is proposed in the motion. That there is a difficulty in manning the few ships we now have with our own people is not a very hopeful sign, but when we remember that there is a much easier and more remunerative life ashore, it is scarcely to be wondered at that the young men of Australia do not rush for berths in our Navy. In addition to that, they know that no provision is made for our sailors in their old age, and that the rates of pay are not sufficient to enable them to make proper provision for themselves. I ask those honourable members who favour pensions for the Defence Forces not to cloud I the project with a general system, of national insurance, because, by so doing, they will only be shelving the matter once more. This is a line of life that is totally apart from that of the ordinary worker, and, therefore, should receive special consideration from Parliament. I hope the Government will accept the motion, and at the earliest opportunity submit to the House a proposal on the lines laid down by the mover.

Clause 2Section2 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting therefrom the words "" material to the subject-matter of the inquiry,"" and inserting in their stead the words "" which he is required by the summons to produce.' 1 clause raises a fairly important matter concerning which I desire to ascertain the view of the Attorney-General. I take it that this amendment of the principal Act is proing, one of the pleas entered is said to be that the matter on which the witness has been summoned is not material to the issue* The question is whether, if we make this amendment, a witness will be able to refuse to attend on a summons on the ground that the evidence he is asked to give is not material to the matter being inquired into. I am convinced that under clause 6 of this Bill a witness arrested could not set up, as a defence, that the matter on which he was summoned had no relation to the subject matter of the inquiry, or was not material to the issue. It seems to me, however, to be an extraordinary proposal that a police magistrate shall have power to issue a war : rant to arrest a man who has not been tendered his expenses, who may be 200 or 300 miles away from the place of inquiry, and may be unable to give any evidence material to the inquiry. Proposed new section 6 (B) provides that if any person served with a summons to attend a Royal Commission fails to attend, the President or Chairman may issue a summons for his apprehension, and he is also' to be liable to the penalties for non-attendance upon the summons. The arrest of the witness is not to purge any offence that he has committed. The .effect of this provision is that such a man may plead, if he is not arrested, and does not attend, that the matter upon which",41,Tobacco Trust Royal Commission

WhatI said last night, and what I hold now, is that no Commission is entitled to put a question outside the subject-matter of the inquiry. When we come to clause 4 of the Bil l I shall be prepared to move an amendAre we to understand that, alment which will, I think, meet the honourable member's objection, although I do not think it will make any alteration in the liability of a witness. It will set forth in a kind of declaratory way what the effect of the amendment in the Act will be. I ask the Attorney-General to consider the f u l l effect of this clause. The Governor General has power to appoint a Commission and the Chairman of that Commissionhas power, under the present Act, by writing under his hand, to summon any person to produce any books, documents, or writings in his custody or control material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. Under proposed new section 6 ( F ) a Royal Commission will have power to inspect any documents, books, or writings produced before it, and may retain them for such reasonable period as it thinks fit. It may also make copies of or take extracts from them. To some extent, under the Act as it stands, a Commission may have that power now by implication. When a summons goes out it w ill , under the B ill , be in a general form asking the witness to produce any books, documents, and so forth, and these may be inspected and extracts taken. At present, a witness is asked to produce only such documents as are material to the subject-matter of the issue. When the witness produces the books and documents under the general summons, they will be in the custody of the Commission, who will have f u l l power over them; and we must remember that the witness will not be represented by a solicitor or counsel to advise him as to his particular rights and duties. T would remind honourable members opposite that, when we give an extreme power like this, it may some time get into the hands of an enemy, and be used against them.

Royal Commissions is relevant to the Bill. An authority quoted last night lays it down that they are fair subjects for parliamentary criticism. ready at work, consisting of members from both sides, but with a majority from one side, and a Chairman in each case from one side. as to the line of argument the honourable member is now following. to Commissions which have been appointed, and his remarks, I submit, are not relevant to the clause under discussion. East Sydney has not realized that the measure deals with the powers of Royal Commissions, and the honourable member for Parramatta was using, to illustrate his argument, the undoubted fact that inquiries instituted by Parliament in the shape of Commissions are often of a political nature. The honourable member for Parramatta is quite in order in referring to Royal Commissions and their composition on a measure which relates to the powers of Royal Commissions generally. the point of order raised by the honourable member for East Sydney, that tlie matter introduced by the honourable member for Parramatta is quite extraneous to the discussion of clause 2. he knew at one time of a Royal Commission which had been appointed, perhaps no exception could be taken; but his references to Royal Commissions now in existence are, to say the least of it, uncalled for. There are occasions when Royal Commissions have a preponderance of members from one side of the House, but that preponderance is from the side which is numerically the strongei. no fault of the Government that the Opposition side of the House is not more strongly represented, because there was a difficulty in finding any member of another place who would accept a seat on the Commission. 1 have my own ideas of the reasons that actuated honourable senators in refusing to act.

Here are two Commissions alvernment in England lays it down that ""The composition of a Royal Commission is a fair subject for parliamentary criticism.""

The question raised I rise to a point of order by this clause is-What power ought to be given to Royal Commissions? and the honHe is referring orable member for Parramatta submits that the amount of power that we give to a Commission must be considered in connection with the personnel of that Commission.

It has been the rule In one particular instance, it is ever since I have been here, and 1 am not reflecting on it, that whatever Government have been in power have generally appointed the Chai rman of the Commission.

It was protested by the Opposition that this was a flagrant violation of the freedom of parliamentary .discussion, and an abrogation of the responsibility of Ministers for parliamentary criticism. It was pointed out that the powers given by the Act of 1902 would enable the Commissioners to call upon the members of the House to give evidence, under penalty, and that such action, logically, was a denial of the privilege of free definite offences against the laws of the speech. Honourable members are wrong when they accuse me of attacking Royal Commissions.

Honourable members urge that these powers should not be given to persons who have no legal training, and who have been appointed for party considerations, because they are likely to be abused. In answer to this, I repeat what I said last night about the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill introduced by the honourable member for Darling Downs in 1:908. That Bill provided that any person who did not answer a question, or did not produce books or documents when called upon to do so by any Select Committee, would be liable to two years' imprisonment. The criticism directed against his Bill was almost identical with that used against the present Bill. The honourable member for Wentworth, speaking upon the Bill, made practically the same objections as he has against this Bill, and repeated what the honourable member for Parramatta has just saidperson who has been dragged before a Parliamentary Committee"" to the bull-ring,"" the Treasurer would say-woul d regard it as unimportant to be sentenced to two years' imprisonment for refusing to answer a question. The honourable member for Flinders saidIt gives to a Committee responsible only in a political sense to this House, larger powers than are intrusted to the ordinary legal tribunals appointed to try criminals charged with country. Those were the criticisms directed against the measure introduced by the honourable member who, to-night, is leading the attack against a provision of an exactly similar character, though the penalties in this case are not half so drastic as those in his Bill. It must be remembered, too, that the drastic penalties of the honourable member's Bill related to proceedings by Select Committees. I ask honourable members, "" Whicli is the more responsible and reliable body, a Select Committee or a Royal Commission ? "" I have had eighteen years' parliamentary experience, and have never known inquiries of first importance intrusted to, and completed by, a Select Committee. However an inquiry may have originated, when it has become important the Committee has been made a Royal Commission. Therefore, the arguments against the proposal to entrust Royal Commissions with these powers apply with ten times as much force to a proposal to entrust them to Select Committees. I cannot understand the present attitude of the honourable member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Bendigo. On the former occasion the honourable member for Bendigo saidA joint committee of both Houses has reported to-day that, in conducting inquiries intended to vindicate the honour of Parliament, its action has been absolutely paralyzed by the absence of power to administer oaths and compel witnesses to answer questions. quiry. must be relevant.

A Commission to inquire into a harvester case would be limited to that subject; a Tariff Commission would be similarly limited. And to use the honourable member's own wordsQuestions within the scope of that inquiry would be lawful. Let us apply this to the present case. This is a proposal to compel witnesses before a Royal Commission of inquiry to answer questions that are relevant and lawful . Witnesses need not answer questions that are irrelevant and unlawful. I have offered to move an amendment which makes that clear. When the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill was under discussion, part of the present Opposition was supporting the Government of the day, and that section supported the measure, while the other section denounced it. To-night we have a similar state of affairs-honorabl e members who formerly supported the proposal are now denouncing it , for no better reason than that ing his business, which ought to remain for which the Opposition of that day denounced the Bill of the Deakin Government-that it is brought in by the Government of the dav. Nothing that honourable gentlemen have said touches the point, which is this: that Commissioners are limited by the nature and terms of their commission. They cannot ask unlawful or irrelevant questions. Witnesses are safeguarded by section 6 of the Act. The questions asked must touch the subject-matter of the inquiry, and the same safeguard will be given in regard to demands for the production of books and documents by the amendment which I propose to make. Under these circumstances, opposition becomes factious, and I hope it will cease. The Attorney-General argues that we should not object to this clause because there was a similar provision in the Parliamentary Witnesses B ill . Apnarently he would have it thought that Parliament has already enacted a provision such as the Government now asks us to consent to. As a matter of fact, the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill never became law, and no proposition such as that of the this House. In my opinion, clause 2 goes altogether too far. The Royal Commissions Act empowers the Chairman of a Commission to summon a person to give evidence, and to produce books which are All Commissions are material to the subject-matter of the inquiry. It is proposed to amend the Act by substituting for this provision the words "" which he is required by the summons to produce."" That means that a Royal Commission may require a witness to produce any books for which it calls. Under a later clause, a Commission will have power to make such extracts as it thinks fit from those books, whether they are material to the inquiry or not. That is an unnecessary power to give to any body of men, especially a scratch lot such as usually constitute a Royal Commission. Commissions are selected in a haphazard fashion, and whilst those acting upon them, may do their best, according to their lights, they may be very fallible. They are interested in the subject of their inquiry, and some of them may be tempted to unduly press a witness so that, instead of confining their questions to matters material to the issue, they may elicit private information that ought never to be disclosed. A witness might be compelled to disclose private matters concernsecret, and such a disclosure might result in his. financial ruin. We have to-day industries which a few years ago were in a very critical condition, and if those conducting them had been called upon at that time to make public their actual financial position they might not have been able to secure that assistance by means of which they have succeeded in building up what are now substantial enterprises. It is altogether wrong that we should empower men, who may not be capable of judging what they really require as evidence, to draw from a witness all sorts of information merely because they think, perhaps, that he is hedging. Why does not the Attorney-General so amend the clause as to provide that nothing shall be taken from books produced before a Commission that is not material to the issue, and that irrelevant questions shall not be asked. has not heard the amendment which the Attorney-General proposes to move. while I have been in the Chamber; but I am glad to learn that he does propose to '",47,Royal Commissions Bill

They seem to think that since the Chairman of a Royal Commission is always appointed by the Government of the day, he will naturally be in sympathy with that Government. Are we to assume that they object to this clause because they see the writing on the wall, and believe that all future Commissions are going to be appointed by their opponents? It seems to me that, in the near future, in order that justice may be done in connection with many of our industries and commercial undertakings, it will be necessary to appoint Royal Commissions to inquire into them, and that, unless some such power as this is given, the object of such Commissions will be frustrated. It is interesting to hear honourable members opposite talk about legal training. If there is one profession more than another in which men are trained with a bias, it is that of the law. Throughout the whole of his professional career, a lawyer or barrister has to take sides. Then, again, it has been urged that Royal Commissions are likely to put irrelevant questions to witnesses. Surely politicians who are required by Mr Speaker, or the Chairman of Committees, to observe relevancy when speaking in this Chamber, ought to be competent, as members of Royal Commissions, to determine what is relevant to their inquiry. I cannot conceive of a Royal Commission prying into matters that are irrelevant to its inquiry. I would ask the Opposition whether it is not a fact that the proceedings of Commissions are usually open to the press. I do not object to the pleasantries in which the honourable member for Parramatta has indulged in regard to his visit to a Commission over which I have the honour to preside; but if any grossly irrelevant quesdispensable. I am bound to say that half tions had been put to any one, I think that the honourable member would have had the right to castigate us in this House. posed to examine private books, could it not direct that that examination should take place in private? thing to prevent the Chairman of a Royal -Commission from acting as a Judge would do in obtaining evidence in a Court of law. The Chairman of a Commission is supposed to possess a little common sense. The fact that a man is a Judge does not necessarily mean that he has a monopoly of common sense. Surely honourable members, after fighting for years on the floor of this House, or in any other Parliament, ought to have some knowledge of the due fitness of things, especially when they, are making inquiries. Too much stress has been laid on the contention that politicians do not properly appreciate the meaning of relevancy. A member of a Royal Commission would hesitate to do anything that would subject him to hostile criticism either in Parliament or in the press. I repeat that this clause is vital to the measure, but I admit at the same time that the amendment foreshadowed by the Attorney-General is a reasonable one, and I think that it should be regarded as a sufficient safeguard by those who fear that the clause as it stands is too drastic. I am willing to admit that the amendment which the Attorney-General has intimated his willingness to move cuts away at least half the-ground from the objections that were raised last night. Our complaint last night was that the Attorney General proposed under this clause to omit from section 2 of the principal Act words limiting the President or Chairman of a Royal Commission to questions material to the subject-matter of the inquiry, and to insert in their stead words which provided that if the Chairman or President merely ""required"" a question to be answered, it must be answered. The legal members on this side of the House pointed out that in every Court of law materiality, or, in other words, the fact of a question put to a witness being material to the issue, is a sine qua non. I have never heard of a Court in a British community in which materiality was not inof the fight I put up last night was against the proposal to substitute the requirements of the Commission for the materiality of questions asked. If the Attorney-General is prepared now to require that all questions must be material to the issue laid down in the Commission itself, a large part of my objections is gone. But the proposal of the Attorney-General to insert the words he has indicated seems to me to lead us into greater difficulty. Clause2 of the Bill provides that the words "" material to the",48,Royal Commissions Bill

These words are the safeguard, the bulwark, by which witnesses could resist a question and take a Commission before the Court, as is being done now; and it is now proposed to provide that all that is necessary is that the Chairman shall "" require"" the question to be answered. It has been pointed out that if all that is necessary is that the Chairman shall require a question to be answered, whether material or not, it will open the door to endless trouble and endless irregularities on the part of a possibly partisan Chairmen. The Attorney-General says he is now willing to impose the condition that questions shall be "" material;"" but, if that be so, why is he not prepared to leave in the principal Act the words ""material to the subject-matter of the inquiry "" ? that. that the principle the Attorney-General placed before the Committee is a perfectly good one; but if he is willing that all questions shall be material, why not leave in the words ? The Attorney-General has told us that in the case of prosecutions he shall do so, but he knows as well as I do that one of the objects of this alteration is to prevent witnesses from raising, as a point before a magistrate or a Judge, the admissibility of a question because it is not material. and is going to make it general in its application, he will, by-and-by, have the same difficulty that faces him now. Attorney-General propose to make this qualification of materiality a general one, or is he going to limit it to a particular kind of offence under the Act? intend to apply the qualification of materiality to one part of the Act, or to the whole of the Act? apply it to the whole, why cannot he leave in those words? Attorney-General's argument was the analogy he drew between a Select Committee of this House and a Royal Commission. A Royal Commission may be appointed, which is not made up of members of Parliament, to inquire into some trade, calling, or industry, and it may be presided over by a stranger outside who is supposed to be an expert on the subject of inquiry. Chairman would not have the same liability to subsequent criticism as to his conduct in the management of the Commission as would a member of Parliament. A member of. a Select Committee of this House would know very well that if he misconducted himself as Chairman of the Committee, he would have afterwards to face his fellow members, and subject himself to the criticism of this House; and this would be a very considerable check. If , on the other hand, a Royal Commission is made up of people who are interested in a particular industry, the Chairman might very easily abuse his power to ask questions which were not relevant, and thus obtain the information he desired, trusting to the forgetfulness of the public in regard to his misconduct. I do not wish to elaborate' the point; but if the Attorney-General recognises the right of a witness to refuse to answer a question which is not material, why not, I repeat, leave in the words "" material to the subject-matter of the inI have already explained quiry "" ? It is of no use taking them out of the original Act and putting them into a new B ill . ber not think that the Attorney-General's amendment will cover that objection ? that the suggested amendment cuts away a great deal of the criticism offered last night; but, so far as I understand, the Attorney General proposes to leave the clause as it stands, while introducing words to provide that questions must be material as a basis for a prosecution. The honourable member If he introduces this qualification, for Riverina made some observations which led me to suppose that he thought we could trust to the President of a Royal CommisDoes the sion to limit himself to material questions. bound by his oath to limit the scope of the inquiry ? he may, under this clause, ask questions that are not material, seeing that the qualiI f he proposes to fication is being struck out of the Act.

The only difference is that, whereas now, under such circumstances, the Crown has to prove that the books are material, the witness under the Bill will have to prove that they are not material. That applies equally through the Act. member, referring to my analogy between the Parliamentaiy Witnesses Bill and this Bill, drew a distinction to the disadvantage of Royal Commissions by pointing out that members of Parliament are responsible persons, while those outside who might be appointed to Royal Commissions are not responsible. to me entirely destructive of the line of .argument resorted to this evening, by which it was sought to show that politicians, of all men, are the least reliable or fit lo take -responsible positions. But on the merits -of the objection I submit it is not sound. Nothing can remove a Royal Commission away from the cognisance and power of Parliament. A Royal Commission has to be issued by the Crown, and the Crown has its representatives in this House, who must stand or f a l l , not -only by the report, but by every act of the Commissions. Ministers have, at any moment, at their command the power to dissolve a Royal Commission, and if they decline to exercise that power in a proper case, they are responsible and can be punished. read the clause first, I thought the difficulty of the Attorney-General was this-and I The believe it was his difficulty, but he is attempting now to cure things which are not difficult-that when a witness is summoned he ought to come. If he has an objection on the ground that his evidence is not material, he ought to put that objection in Court. That is the practice in Courts of justice, and I think it is fair. It is not"" for the witness to pre-judge whether what he has to say is relevant or not. It is whereas right enough for the Attorney-General to cure that difficulty. The amendment which the Attorney-General foreshadows in clause The amendment proposed will 4 has already been brought in under our criticism, which, therefore, has been perfectly justified. The position now is this : If the person summoned does not attend to give evidence, he can, if sued, plead A witness now, under section 2 of some reasonable excuse. That reasonable excuse is no longer as to the materiality of the matter upon which he is asked to give evidence, but he may say that the train broke down, or offer some other excuse which would be acceptable to the simple people who sit in Courts of justice. If he does attend, and is asked a question under section 6 of the Act, that question must touch the subject-matter of the inquiry; but if I am quite satisfied. he brings in his books, he can no longer object to allowing them to go in as evidence. less the amendment which the Attorney General foreshadows is made. The qualification of "" touching the subject-matter of While that is very true, it seems the inquiry "" applies only to questions; but if he is in Court, and the books are there, he can no longer plead that the books are not material, because that qualification is taken out, and there is nothing in section 6 to say that the books themselves must touch the subject-matter of the inquiry. That is the point of our criticism, and the justification for our criticism is that the amendment which the Attorney-General has proposed will remove that imperfection from the B ill .

Strictly speaking, therefore, it would not be proper to describe as an inquiry into any power of the Commonwealth what, as a matter of fact, might be an inquiry into some question the solution of which might lead to the enlargement of our powers. Sof ar as the meaning of "" reasonable excuse"" is concerned, we know that the only reasonable excuse to which a Court of law listens is physical disability. some accident or illness, or physical detention by another person, from attending the Court, he has a reasonable excuse; but it is not a reasonable excuse to say that the tribunal is not to one's liking.

Leahy. I simply wish to draw attention to one constitutional matter connected with the clause. There is the express declaration that the Crown may do certain things. There is a sort of implied recognition of a practice that has been objected to at Home, namely, the appointment of Commissions without a resolution of Parliament. trol the appointment of Commissions. In many cases, in the Old Country, a Commission has been appointed by the Executive, and in Western Australia, as recently as 1910, one was appointed by the Executive for its own purposes. Such appointments have been challenged as practically a usurpation of the privilege of Parliament. Keith, in his Responsible Government in the Dominions, draws attention to some of these cases. He mentions that, in a Canadian case, a Commission was objected to on the ground that its issue was an improper interference with the privileges of Parliament. I ask the Attorney-General to think over the question whether we should not insert a provision to the effect that the Executive shall not appoint _ a Commission merely on an Order in Council, but that Commissions shall be appointed as machinery for carrying into effect a resolution of Parliament. It is generally on an Address to the Crown that a Commission should be appointed. The Commission should deal with a matter of public interest, and the expediency of its appointment should be discussed on the floor of the House. I am afraid that the proper etiquette may not be altogether respected, and that the obligation on the Executive, that Commissions should not be appointed except on the suggestion of a House of Parliament, may be ignored by reason of the terms of this provision. If a man is prevented by ber mean that Commissions may be appointed without consulting the Executive? General takes his powers In this matter from the Constitution.

Under the Acts Interpretation Act, the Governor General means the Governor General in Council, and one of the questions at issue in the Court case to which reference has been made is whether a Commission was issued by the Governor General in Council. Commissions is independent of the Statute. neither have I asserted it . The matter is at present sub judice. The powers of the Governor General are exercised under the Constitution, and that being so, it may not be necessary for the appointment to be by Order in Council. It is the English Acts Interpretation Act of 1889 which must be applied to the interpretation of the Constitution. If the Governor General alone can make an appointment under the terms of the Constitution, it would not be necessary for the appointment to be by Order in Council. The point to which I am directing attention is that we may be giving sanction to an objectionable practice which is growing up in the Old Country, and in Canada, and has been resorted to in Western Australia, and, perhaps, in some of the other States, namely, that of issuing Commissions without a resolution of a House of Parliament.

There ought to be a method by which an honest objection of a legal nature could be tested without having a conviction recorded against a witness. I would call the attention of the Attorney-General to the procedure which is laid down in section 10 of the New Zealand Act of 1908(1.) The Commission may refer any disputed point of law arising in the course of an inquiry to the Supreme Court for decision, and for this purpose may either conclude the inquiry subject to such decision, or may at any stage of the inquiry adjourn it until after such decision has been given. (2.) The question shall be in the form of a special case to be drawn up by the parties (if any) to the inquiry, and, if the parties do not agree, or if there are no parties, to be settled not. by the Commission. (3.) The decision of the Supreme Court shall be final and binding upon all parties to the inquiry and upon the Commission. If we had some procedure by which any disputed point of law which the Chairman of a Commission felt was honestly raised could be referred for summary decision by a Supreme Court or High Court Judge who happened to be near at hand, the whole difficulty would be settled.* At the same time, I recognise that ultimately there must be power to deal with a witness who, after a decision has been given by a Court, persists in refusing to produce his books to the Commission. I believe that the Attorney General desires these Commissions to be simply Commissions for the investigation of truth, and generally for the investigation of public matters. As a rule, most persons are willing and eager to go before a Commission and give all the evidence they can on a matter of public interest. Cases of resistance are not very frequent. If there is a persistent refusal without a question of law being raised, there must be some procedure laid down, and some penalty fixed; but I ask the Attorney-General to seriously consider the advisability of having an intermediate method of getting a summary decision on a bond fide dispute. I also ask him to consider whether £500 is not an excessive penalty. It will apply to the rich and the poor alike. In Queensland and New South Wales the fine is £ 2 0 , while in New Zealand the penalty is a fine not exceeding £ 2 0 . I ask the Attorney General to consider whether, in making this heavy penalty to apply to every case, he is not really altering the scope and purpose of the executive acts of a Commission. The Government are, by this Bill, practically establishing new tribunals, and safeguarding them by all sorts of exceptionally heavy penalties. Tlie tendency in barbaric times was towards the infliction of extreme penalty; but the whole tendency of modern legislation is towards the imposition of moderate penalties, for the purpose of deterring persons from the commission of crime, rather than with the object of inflicting vindictive punishment. I think the Attorney-General would enable justice to be done under this clause if he adopted an amendment on the lines of the New Zealand precedent to which I have referred. ney-General) [10.1] -First of all, the honourable gentleman complains that the penalty is too high. I say that it is A magistrate or Judge may make the penalty just what he pleases. It is a reflection upon our Courts to say that, because a maximum penalty of £500 is provided, that penalty will, in every case, be imposed. I take the case of the innocent struggling farmer referred to, and suppose that he has committed, quite inadvertently, a very mild and venial offence. He is taken before a magistrate, and, if he shows clearly that his offence was inadvertent, no one will suggest that any magistrate would impose the maximum penalty. Honourable members may tell me of the many powers the Commission has, and how these may be abused. Judges have great power, too; but we all know very well that Judges do not do unreasonable things. I submit that Judges will not do anything but justice, even under this Bill, and so will not impose heavy penalties for trivial or inadvertent offences. The honourable member for Darling Downs has suggested that a point of law might arise, but I do not know how that could be. A witness, for instance, raises a perfectly bond fide objection to produce certain evidence. He says to the Chairman of the Commission, "" I do not agree with you that the evidence is relevant."" The Chairman says that it ris, and there is an honest difference of opinion. But it is not a difference of opinion on a point of law. Surely a question of relevancy is a question of fact ? What else is it ? If a question of law could arise, I should be quite willing that the Chairman should state a case, if he is capable of doing so, or that the matter should be referred to the Attorney-General for him to state a case; but",56,Royal Commissions Bill

I inserted the word "" disclosure "" for the purpose of making it cover extracts from books or documents. mean that if a witness gave an answer to a question that answer could not be used against him subsequently in any criminal or civil proceedings. But a witness might say to a Commission, "" I am bound to give you this evidence, but it is of a peculiarly confidential nature, and I ask you not to make it public.

Is there such a provision in any other Royal Commissions Act? Royal Commissions Acts, the clauses axe different from these. But, irrespective of that consideration, I am asking the Attorney-General to deal with this suggestion on its merits.

Such a suggestion is, in my opinion, absurd. If it is not proposed that we should go to that length, then the Act as it stands is amply sufficient, because, as I have already said, the President or Chairman may now, if he chooses, prevent the publication of any evidence. I have said over and over again that this Bill does not increase the scope of inquiry, but merely enables Royal Commissions to be made effective, so that when there is anything to inquire into, a Commission may be able to make the inquiry, and not sit down and look at it. We are all reasonable men here; and we are not to suppose that the Chairman of a Royal Commission will be other than prepared to I listen to any suggestions put forward. gest that in proposed section 6 there should be inserted after the word ""summons"" the words "" after having been paid, or tendered, a reasonable sum for expenses.""

The suggestion is that the payment shall be made in advance; and, while there are circumstances in which that might properly be done, it would, in my opinion, be fatal to the usefulness and effectiveness of the measure if it were compulsory in every case. If a man lives in Carlton, and is summoned to appear at the Court in Lonsdale-street, is it suggested that, before Act the Governor General may make reguwe can expect him to attend, he must be given a 3d. tram ticket? That, of course, is carrying the argument to an absurdity ; but nevertheless a witness would be legally entitled to the tram ticket or to refuse to attend, and there are many persons who would take all sorts of points of this kind. witnesses at a distance are called to appear I assure the honourable member that section 8 of the Act will. be given effect to j and that is as far as we ought to be asked to go. provisions in the Act and in the Bill are all right, so far as they go, but we may have the case of a witness who is not possessed of means to reach the place where a Royal Commission is sitting. The Attorney-General has referred to the fact that a witness may require to be handed a tram fare; but I may tell him, as a matter of practice, that I never heard of a subpoena being served unaccompanied by the payment of at least is., and no one connected with a Court would think of handing a subpoena without tendering sufficient to bring the witness to the hearing. I do not press the matter, but I think the suggestion a reasonable one. If a witness is entitled to be paid the money afterwards, he might as well be paid or tendered it before he starts. [10.28] I hope the honourable member for Gippsland will press bis very reasonable amendment. The Attorney-General is going, to extremes when he cites the case of a man who lives up the street and requires a tram fare. Why does the honourable gentleman not take a reasonable view, and have tegard to the man without means who has to travel a considerable distance? case there is nothing derogatory in the Department offering a tram fare, which would safeguard a man who is bond fide in want of money. the proposed section 6G are sufficient. there in the suggestion of the honourable member for Gippsland? have to come from a distance, I say they shall be tendered their expenses. When they live near at hand, they ought not to be. how the honourable member can guarantee it unless it is put in the Bill. General) [10.31] -Unde r section 8 of the lations "" prescribing the scale of allowances to be paid to any witness summoned under this Act for his travelling expenses and maintenance while absent from his usual place of abode."" I say that in cases where before a Royal Commission, when they so desire they shall have their travelling expenses tendered to them before they come. will not be punished because they do not attend on subpoena if their travelling expenses are not tendered. We have power to provide for that, and I make that statement publicly; but I am not going to make a general rule with regard to all witnesses. As a general rule witnesses do not come from great distances to the Commission. The Commission goes to them. A Commission travels from place to place. The Navigation Commission went to the witnesses all round Australia; the witnesses did not come to us. If we summoned a man from Perth to Melbourne, it would be most unfair not to give him his fare before he started; but when I go to Perth to examine him, it would be absurd to tender him his expenses just because he lived at the other end of the city, and had to travel a few hundred yards. the honourable member for Gippsland says, the universal practice in regard to the service of subpoenas of all kinds is to tender the conduct-money with the subpoena. It is immaterial whether it is a very large or very small sum. I cannot agree with the Attorney-General that in cases where the witness is close at hand he ought not to have In any his conduct-money in the usual way. We generally give a witness a shilling with his subpoena. Honourable members opposite seem to think that sub-clause 1 of clause 6G is not sufficient to insure the tendering",59,Royal Commissions Bill

He has told us that he wishes witnesses to be paid their expenses of attendance, and 1 think he expects those expenses to be tendered when the summons is served. If there is a danger of any one being penalized for not attending before a Royal Commission when his expenses have not been paid in advance to enable him to attend, I hope the risk will be removed. --The honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Batman have said that there is an implied undertaking that a witness shall have his expenses given to him as a matter of course; but if the amendment is a desirable one it ought to go in, because, otherwise, the Chairman can issue his warrant and have the witness arrested, and break into his house for the purpose. It is all very well to tell a man, after a warrant has been issued, and he has sustained the ignominy of practically being taken prisoner by the Chairman, that he is entitled to his expenses when he gives his evidence. member for Gippsland wants to imppse upon the Commission the obligation to tender the witness his expenses when he is subpoenaed to attend, and that otherwise he shall not be bound to give his evidence.

The Attorney-General has his eye on the big corporations ; I am thinking of the small man who may be recalcitrant, and for whom these penalties are altogether too severe. It would not injure a big corporation to fine it a sum exceeding £500 and not more than £1,000, though its members would not like to go to gaol, but to a small man such a fine would mean the taking away of all his worldly possessions, although the offence might be due to a sheer fit of wrong-headedness in an otherwise worthy citizen.

But occasionally, persons do so act, and this I understand that the honourable ought not to be allowed. If they offend against sections 5 or 6 of tbe Act, they may be fined is., or any amount up to £500, at the discretion of the Court. A second offence would be a deliberate flouting of the law, and the community's efforts to obtain information cannot thus be made impotent. I do not think that these offences will be committed a second time. No Court is likely to impose a heavy penalty for the first offence. We know that there are rich men in this country who would sooner pay £ 5 0 a day than attend before a Royal Commission, but a fine ranging up to £1,000 is calculated to give the boldest pause. For the first offence there is a maximum penalty, but no minimum, and for the second and subsequent offences the penalty is properly much more severe.",60,Royal Commissions Bill

404,The Honourable Member For Parra,"Mr. JOSEPH COOK -It has not; but,Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Proposed new section (F), which is embodied in. this clause, empowers a Royal Commission to inspect documents, books, or writings produced before it, and to take extracts from them. Whilst we should empower Royal Commissions to obtain all necessary information, we should also endeavour to give those who may be summoned before them an assurance that they will be protected, as far as possible, so that they will have confidence in the conduct of inquiries. I move That after the words "" copies of "" in profore the Committee some time ago I framed posed new section 6F the words "" such matter as an amendment which reads as followsis relevant to the inquiry"" be inserted. that amendment. Amendment agreed to. [10.58] I move That the word "" appearing,"" in proposed new section 60, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" summoned to appear."" If this amendment be agreed to, a man who has been summoned to appear before a Royal Commission will be paid a reasonable sum for the expenses of his attendance; whereas, under the clause as it stands, a man might not receive his expenses for some time. what I am prepared to do, and I think my proposal is perfectly fair. able gentleman is prepared to do what he says he is, why should he not agree to this amendment ? ply to those cases which I have mentioned, and not to all others. no case that is not genuine. of persons who may appear. duce the proceedings to a farce. ought to be tendered if it is only 5d. member say that a man who travels on a penny section should have a penny sent to him ? has to be' sent to the man. We are told by practising attorneys, that it is the rule to send a' shilling to a person when he is served with a subpoena. then. I have been served with many subpoenas, but not once have I received anything with them. I think that there is a middle course which can be followed. I understand that the Attorney-General wants, when a summons is issued, to compel the witness to come, and that the honourable member for Parramatta wants to justify the witness in not coming until he gets his expenses paid. When I heard the honourable member for Gippsland put his contention beAny witness appearing before a Royal Commission shall be entitled to be paid a reasonable sum for the expenses of his attendance before giving evidence, in accordance with the prescribed scale. to come a distance; he wants his conduct money. ready to meet that case. If this amendment were adopted a man could go to the Commission with the most perfect confidence that he would not be called upon to give evidence until his expenses had been tendered to him. It is a middle course. It recognises the force of the summons, and when he attended he need not give his evidence until his expensps were tendered. I submit the suggestion as an alternative. would point out to the -Attorney-General that a witness may be a man without sufficient money to pay his travelling fare. Pie may, for instance, have to come hundreds of miles. In such a case a. man should be tendered his travelling expenses. hag publicly promised that the man shall have his travelling expenses. Attorney-General put a provision to that effect in the Bill? What is the good of a public promise in a Court of law? A Court cannot take notice of what he said here, but must be governed by the Act. Again, suppose that a man is summoned to attend from a great distance, and his evidence is not wanted. Is he to net nothing simply because he was not called as a witness? This matter deserves better treatment than it is receiving. The Attorney-General ought to pay a little more attention to the wants of the witnesses who will be summoned to appear before",62,Royal Commissions Bill

424,Mr Atkinson,"Why does not the Royal Commissions, because in many cases they will be in necessitous circumstances. A little more consideration from a professed humanitarian like the honourable gentleman would be more to the credit of the House. [ n . 6 ] will see the force of the argument which has been put forward. It must be patent to everybody that many witnesses will be summoned to attend before Royal Commissions whose evidence may not be taken, and who really may not have the wherewithal to come from any great distance. has already explained that their expenses will be paid. Attorney-General has essayed to explain many things to his own satisfaction, but those explanations, unfortunately, do not coincide with the facts and provisions of the Bill. There is no getting away from the clause itself. If it is passed a witness will have to appear before the Commission before he can claim any expenses. What the amendment proposes is that he shall be tendered his expenses before he comes, because in many cases men of insufficient means may be summoned to attend. Are persons whose evidence is not wanted when they appear to go without their expenses? What the amendment seeks to provide for is that any person who is summoned to appear before a Royal Commission shall be tendered his expenses before he appears. surely a reasonable proposal. The amendment would be but a very slight alteration of the clause, but it would mean a great deal to a man who may not have the means to attend the Commission after he has been subpoenaed. amendment would secure a witness being tendered his expenses with the subpoena. that might be so, he would be entitled subsequently to receive his expenses, and as the clause stands he would not. This point must have escaped the notice of the Attorney-General. gentleman does not desire to inflict such an injustice upon a man who may not have the means to attend a Royal Commission from a distance at his own expense. [n.12] I ask leave to amend my amendment by inserting the words proposed before the word "" appearing,"" so that the clause will read, "" Any witness summoned to appear or appearing before a Royal Commission,"" and so on. If only the words "" summoned to appear "" were used there would be no provision made for the tendering of expenses to those who appeared when summoned, and I wish to I hope that the Attorney-General include both.
