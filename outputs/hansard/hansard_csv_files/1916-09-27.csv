In Committee: Clause1 (Short title). Minister and Attorney-General) [3.47] The Bill has been introduced to lighten the formal work of the Attorney-General by enabling the Solicitor-General to do certain things that now only the Minister at the head of the Department can do. It permits the Secretary to tbe Department of the Attorney-General to sign, as Solicitor-General, a number of documents which can now be signed only by the Attorney-General. In the States such work is done by the Solicitor-General, and not by the Attorney-General. The Solicitor General will have no authority to sign auything, or to do anything, unless it has been specially delegated to him by the Attorney-General. He cannot delegate such authority to any one else. mere formal work of the Attorney General is too heavy, and there is no reason ter with it. this office knows the position of affairs, and knows, too, that the work of the Department is increasing. The Department has at present to deal with a number of matters-the regulation of the trade in metals, wheat, and many other commodities-whic h in normal times do not come within its sphere. will declare the policy of the Government in every case, and the Solicitor-General will give effect to it . Thus Ministerial discretion will remain, and Ministerial responsibility will not be lessened. The Government will be as much responsible for every act done by the Solicitor-General as if it had been done by the Attorney General, but important business will not be delayed because the Attorney-General cannot be got to sign his name to some formal paper. [8.52] -We are in the anomalous position of having to discuss a Bill of which we have not a copy, and about which we know only what has been told to us in the explanation of the Attorney-General. The right honourable gentleman says that he proposes .to give to our Solicitor-General General of the States; but my recollection is that the Solicitors-General of the States are Cabinet Ministers. until recently, and in Tasmania, Western Australia, and New Zealand, the Solicitor General is an official, and not a member ot Parliament. to what is proposed; but the Attorney General might have given us a sketch of. the duties which are to devolve on the Solicitor-General.

Mr David Hall, when he left this Parliament, was taken into the New South Wales Government as Solicitor-General. Whether that is the case generally in the rest of the StatesI do not know.

WhatI say is that the work of the Department is such that it is impossible for me to do it and also to attend to the business of the Prime Minister's Department. I therefore require somebody to do those formal things which do not require, and should not require, the attention of the Minister. able gentleman is now putting the matter on a personal ground. now that he is unable to perform the work of his two offices as it ought to be performed. But, surely, the remedy for that is to altogether divest himself of one of the offices. As to the Prime Ministership, I apprehend that he is not likely to relinquish that. I do not know what law members the Prime Minister has in his party. man! are lots of possibilities; and relief may come in many ways. I certainly agree not, according to ""the dictum of the Prime with the right honourable gentleman that, if he has to perform the functions of Prime Minister of Australia as I think they ought to be performed, he ought not to hold any other office. of course. judgment, after having filled the office myself. I know that the Prime Minister has quite enough to do in looking after the rest of the Departments in, shall I say, a supervisory way, as a kind of referee, without having to administer a difficult and delicate Department himself. I suggest that, instead of delegating duties as proposed, the Prime Minister should, if However, we possible, relieve himself of one of these great Departments. This would be better than delegating the duties to a non-political official. Is the Prime Minister acting as Minister of Trade and Customs also? am considering my qualifications for the post, but I have great hesitation in recommending to His Excellency the Governor General a person so unfit for the post as myself. Possibly a night's sleep may give me enough courage to do so! not the Bill, it seems to me that all we can do at the present time is to trust the Prime Minister. I hope we are doing right; but, personally, I do not very much appreciate the proposal to delegate important functions, especially in these war days, to any person, no matter how qualified or eminent he may be, who has not some direct responsibilities to this House. the matter further. If the Committee does not like to adopt the measure, I shall withdraw it. I have put it forward, but if there is going to be any talk about it, I shall withdraw it. liament, I hope, and it is not for the right honourable gentleman to say what he is going to do with the measure.

What he is asking, I take it , is simply the delegation of ordinary administrative duties, such as the filing of bills in prosecutions, matters connected with patents and trade marks, and other ordinary duties.

122,Mr Higgs (Capricornia,"Treasurer )I propose to make a statement showing the actual receipts and expenditure for the financial year ended 30th June, 1916, and the estimated receipts and expenditure for the financial year ended 30th June, 1917, as follows: Receipts. Customs Excise. Customs and Excise. Last year we received from these sources the sum of £16,944,941. A t the end of this financial year we shall, I believe, have received about £16,750,000. Post Office The estimated increase of about £400,000 in Postal revenue is expected, namely, from the revenue derived as the result of increased telephone rates, the greater use. of the cable services due to the war, and the continued heavy postings to the troops abroad. Land Tax The anticipated decrease of about £100,000 in Land Tax revenue is partly due to transfers from the taxable to the non-taxable area, partly to transfers within the taxable field by former large owners to several and smaller owners who would still be taxable, but at a lower rate. Probate and Succession Duties Income Tax The anticipated decrease in Income Tax revenue of £680,000 is mainly due to refunds which will have to be made owing to decisions of the High Court, partly to drought in some of the States, and partly to less profitable trade. Some buinesss men report that trade was not so profitable in 1915-16 as in 1914-15 owing to increased expenses arising out of war conditions. Coinage Silver currency expansion is due partly to the quantity of silver soldiers take away with them, and partly, no doubt, to the prosperous trade which is the result of the expenditure in Australia of wax loan moneys. Defence-Military The estimated Defence revenue (Military) of £200,000 is made up of amounts received for foodstuffs, & c , sapplied to other Dominions in previous financial year, and of fines, deficiencies in equipment, sales of stores and obsolete material.

Brought forward Defence-Nava l This estimated £730,000 from the Navy includes earnings of trading vessels (enemy ships-no t our Commonwealth line). Balances of Defence Trust Accounts transferred to Revenue This item comprises balances of moneys advanced by Parliament for tlie working of various defence trust accounts, which are repaid to revenue at the end of each financial year. Patents Trade Marks, Copyrights and Designs Quarantine Lighthouses and Light Dues Capital Territory Northern Territory This estimated £27,240 for 1916-17 includes land and income tax, territorial revenue, and miscellaneous receipts. Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta Railway To a large extent, this item includes book entries for the carriage of material used in the construction of the railway. Port Augusta-Oodnadatt a Railway This item of £1,700 is wholly made up of receipts from wharfage at Port Augusta. Darwin-Katherin e Rive r Railway This estimated amount of receipts for 1916-17 includes fares and freights earned on the railway. Repayment of States' Proportion of Pensions Contributions of Officers towards Pensions under State Acts. . Miscellaneous Receipts Miscellaneous receipts include interest on Commonwealth moneys at fixed deposit in the Commonwealth Bank; interest paid by States on moneys borrowed in London for them by the Commonwealth; interest derived from short-dated loans in London; fees under the Immigration Restriction Act and the CommerceA c t ; sales of Commonwealth property, &c.

Brought forward SugarA crisis in the sugar industry in Queensland having arisen owing to Judge Dickson's award in a dispute as to wages, some exception is taken to the Government making any profit out of the management of the sugar business, but it must be remembered that, in order to supply the public with sugar at 3£d. per lb., plus extra cost of delivery in remote districts, the Government prices entailed a loss of £2 per ton on foreign sugar imported. Asi t will be necessary daring the war to again import foreign sugar to make up for the deficiency in the Australian production, war prices for foreign sugar may be so high that a loss of even more than £2 per ton may have to be met out of the profits on Australian home-grown sugar. None can say until the war is over whether there will be a profit or a loss on the Government dealings in sugar. The Government have been asked to settle the trouble in Queensland by increasing the price of sugar to the general public, but the Government are not disposed to do this. When the Government undertook to pay £18 per ton for raw sugar they believed, and still believe, that prioe should permit of every one engaged in the industry up to and including the raw sugar stage receiving a reasonable return for capital and labour. If Judge Dickson's decisions are inequitable, some means should be found for reviewing the award. Tho Government have been asked to invite the InterState Commission to inquire into and report upon the crisis, and are willing to do so, providing that the agreements entered into between the. Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the MiUaquin Sugar Refining Company are not to come imder review. Funds Accumulated in previous Year for Invalid and Old-i Pensions This sum of £3,000,000 was brought forward from last year's revenue to relieve the pressure on the revenue this year. Proposed Entertainments Tax (say, half-year) This tax will amount to $d. on a ticket costing 3d.; I d . for a tioket costing 6d.; and I d . for each additional Od. or part thereof. Proposed War-time Profits Tax for 1915-16 The Government propose to take 60 per cent, of the profits for the year 1916-16, allowing an exemption of £200 and a profit standard of 6 per cent, and 7 per cent. Proposed War-time Profits Tax for 1916-17 The Government propose to allow a profit standard of 7 and 8 per cent, for this year and an exemption of £200, but propose to take all the war profits over this sum.

Brought forward Proposed 25 per cent, increased Income Tax The Government are of opinion that an increase of 25 per cent, in the Income Tax is justifiable during this year of the war. It is proposed to reduce the exemption to the sum of £100, and to call upon all persons receiving an income of £100 and up to £200 inclusive to pay income tax at a flat rate of £1. The exemption allowed in the case of children will be raised from £13 to £26 for each child under 16 years of age. Married men and single men with dependants will also be exempted up to £156. Total Revenue Levy on Wealth for Repatriation Fund-First of three yearly instalments, say The Repatriation Fund is for the assistance and benefit of Australian soldiers and their dependants, and is administered by Trustees as they in their discretion think fit. The levy will amount to 1£ per cent, on all estates, real and personal, of the value of £500 and over. The levy may be paid in three equal yearly instalments, or the contributor may pay cash, in which latter case he will be entitled to a rebate or discount calculated on the basis of war loan interest for the period covered by the prepayment.

Brought forward Department of Defence-Military-continued. The amount stated in the Estimates 1916-17, Department of Defence, Military, namely, £73,670,616, is arrived at by taking the round number of £71,000,000 for Expeditionary Forces, and the balance £2,670,616 as ordinary Military expenditure, although this sum includes some items (payment of censors and staff, internment of enemy subjects, &a), which is purely war expenditure. It is impossible in a brief statement of receipts and expenditure to show the whole of the Naval and Military items under two heads, for the reason that other Departments of State incur Naval and Military expenditure which is included in the totals appearing opposite the said Departments. For example, the Treasury Department pays War Pensions, insurance premiums of public servants who have joined the Expeditionary Forces, interest on transferred properties, both Military and Naval. The Trade and Customs Department purchases commodities for other Governments in connection with the war, and expends money in connection with Prize Courts, & c, &c. The Home Affairs Department pays rents for Military and Naval buildings. This Department also incurs Defence expenditure in connection with furnishing, repairing and maintenance of buildings, and the construction of certain capital works, such as drill halls, ordnance stores, &c. I propose when making the Budget Statement, to set .forth the whole of the details of Defence expenditure, including expenditure consequent on the war. Department of the Navy.. This expenditure includes transport of troops, £6,000,000; trading vessels carrying cargo to various ports, £700,000; maintenance of our own warships, £900,000; citizen naval forces, £138,000; manning war ships, £780,000, & c , &c. Department of Trade and Customs Department of Home Affairs Home Affairs Estimates show an increase of £230,000 over last year's actual expenditure. This increase includes expenses connected with working extra mileage of Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway (£65,000); Referendum (£80,000); Census and Statistics (£38,000), increase due to proposed transfer of State Statistical Staffs.

Brought forward New Works for all Departments .. The item, New Works, as estimated, shows an increase of £1,507,373 over last year's actual expenditure. The increase is mainly due to New Works under the Naval and Military Departments, which account for £1,140,000 of the increase, the works referred to being erection of drill halls, ordnance stores, additions to Cordite Factory, Harness Factory, Clothing Factory, Lithgow Small Arms Factory, Barracks, Land Purchases, Arsenal, Naval Bases, Naval Drill Halls, Boatsheds, and Wireless Telegraph Stations. Included in tbe New Works estimate is the sum of £150,000 for the Federal Capital. The Government are of opinion that for the present the expenditure on the Federal Capital should be estimated at a minimum. To stop all expenditure in connection with the Capital would be unwise. About £856,613 has been spent up to the present, and certain constructional works arc necessary to enhance our revenue from the Territory. Transportation to the centre of the city would require 4 miles of railway, and another 11 miles is required to the northern boundary of the Territory. The construction of this railway line would entitle the Commonwealth to an extension through to Yass by the State Government of New South Wales in accordance with the Seat of Government Act. These railway facilities would enable Commonwealth lands to be leased at higher rentals, and land settlement would thereby be encouraged in the Territory. Moreover, land which is now used for pastoral purposes would then probably be used for agricultural and residential purposes. Capital Works (paid from Loan in 1915-16) This item includes estimates for construction of a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, £1,400,000; Acquisition of land in Federal Capital Territory, £100,000; Purchase of land and erection of buildings in London, £173,000 ; Construction of Railway, Pine Creek, Katherine River, and southwards, £70,000 ; Purchase of land for Post and Telegraph purposes, £70,000 : Construction of Conduits and laying wires underground, £392,790; machinery, & c , Cockatoo Island, £65,000-Total, £2,270,790. The Government has been adversely criticised for continuing the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway. The contention of an influential public journal is that "" while we have been at war for two years, more than three and a quarter million pounds have been spent on a work which might have beon postponed."" The Government are of opinion that the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway has never been regarded by Parliament as a commercial enterprise. It is looked upon as a railway for defence purposes to be constructed as speedily as possible. Apart from the unwisdom of throwing railway men out of employment, the Government would regard as financially unsound any proposal to delay the construction of a line upon which so much money had been spent at the outbreak of war.

It will be seen that after providing £3,000,000 in 1915-16 for the payment of Old-age and Invalid Pensions, in the succeeding year we were still enabled to meet War expenditure to the amount of £3,563,076 out of Revenue. In 1916-17 the amount of War expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue is estimated to be £6,343,499, but it must be remembered that this is made possible by taking into Revenue the £3,000,000 for the payment of Old-age and Invalid Pensions previously referred to.

I do not intend to enter into a discussion of or to criticise the statement which the Treasurer has laid before us. I have listened to the honourable gentleman with attention, but, of course, I am not at the present moment in a position to deal with the facts and figures submitted. I rose w i th the object of making some special observations on a subject which I consider of importance. I have to leave for Western Australia to-morrow, and therefore I take this the only opportunity of saying the few words I wish to say*. should, I think, be said at the earliest possible moment after the debate that has already taken place on the means necessary to be taken to finance the present war. I wish specially to deal with what I consider very unfounded statements -statement s which might be characterized by a much stronger term, and which, in any case, may be described as venemous-that have been made by several honourable members and by Labour unionists all over Australia, to the effect that those who are reputed to be f a i r l y well off have not contributed as they should to the expense of the war; in fact, that those people have failed in their duty during this crisis. I feel it to be m y duty, in the interest of truth and justice, to refute that statement, and to prove that those disparaging assertions, made not only in this House, but throughout Australia, are without foundation, and that those who make them must be either ignorant of what has been going on, or have some ulterior and improper motive in making them. I am of opinion-and I think that the statement of tlie Treasurer, when investigated, will bear me out-that by careful and wise administration this Commonwealth can do its duty to the Empire, and maintain its solvency in this great crisis without any anarchical, revolutionary, or devious methods of finance. I am glad to think -thoug h I have not had an opportunity of sufficiently looking into the matter-that thrown aside, and treated with contempt, the anarchical, revolutionary, and devious methods proposed. All that is necessary at the present time to enable us to do our duty to ourselves and the Empire is that we should be devoted to duty, determined, and strong of purpose, and see to it that there is capable and careful administration. Assuming those conditions, I see no difficulty that we cannot overcome in carrying the war to a successful termination. I was very much pained the other day at the remarks which the honourable member for Hunter thought fit to address to the House. A f t e r several years' knowledge of that gentleman, I had come to the conclusion that he was level-headed, careful, and fair-minded; and, therefore, WhatI desire to say I was the more pained-in fact, shockedto hear the opinions he then expressed. His suggestions were pure and unadulterated confiscation, and it is time that his spurious ideas should be repudiated and refuted. anarchical, do you? Sir JOHN FORREST I should say his proposals are quite anarchical. The honourable member said, and I shall only quote a few words in order to show to what I am referringI am of opinion that, at a time like this, all. income in excess of necessary living expenditure should go into the public exchequer for financing the war. Every man and woman should have sufficient to keep the wolf from the door, but over and above what is necessary to provide each household with the necessaries of life all private income should be paid to the Government during the progress of the war. able member assents, though I thought that, perhaps, he would say his remarks were made offhand, and without due consideration. in which we can prevent the burden being placed on the poorer people. to that spurious cry in a moment, for it is a spurious cry, and the honourable member must know it . How would such an anarchical proposal meet the case ? No one knows better than the honourable member that the industrial wage earners cannot spare much, if anything, from their weekly wage. What, then, is he driving the Government have at? who have over a living wage. say so?",14,Supply Work San D Buildings Bill No 2 1916 17 Financi Al Statement

130,Sir John Forrest,"Then why vot.able member seems to think that no one but himself and his colleagues have any sympathy for the people w i th small means whom they assume to specially represent in this House, but whom they do not represent. say, knows very well that the industrial workers livin g on their weekly wage cannot spare much, if anything. why the honourable member did not say so? honourable member means is that those -who have hitherto been paying, and who ;are paying now, shall continue to provide all that is necessary? I wished to conscript wealth. honourable member meant, and what he -.should have said, was that those who are paying now w ill have to continue to pay until the end, and to pay a great deal more than they already have. I cannot understand what is the cause of the honourable member's anxiety in this matter, unless it is that some of his friends, or those whom he represents, or in whom he is interested, are paying too much. Does he realize what he is proposing ? Does he mean that the bond-holders of the States and of the Commonwealth and all public contractors should not be paid, that all civil servants of every grade are to be paid a uniform minimum wage of, say, £ 3 per week, and that employers should dispense with all their employees, domestic or industrial ? to be dispensed with in that way, how are they to be kept? honourable member would set up a large Boup kitchen for the purpose of supplying their daily needs. I am sorry that the honourable member has fastened himself to such a scheme. based on confiscation and repudiation, and would bring ruin to our credit. In fact, it is so foolish that it is not worth even considering Furthermore, there is not the slightest necessity for such heroic and anarchical methods. It is difficult to understand how the honourable member came to give us the benefit of his ideas as to what should be dono. He must know that the war I did say so. expenditure is being financed by the very people whom he wishes to completely ruin . His surprising question, "" What sacrifice is wealth going to make to meet the requirements of the nation?"" might b© very pertinent if it were not entirely opposed to facts. The plain The honourable member, as I answer to it is the fact that the war taxation already levied and being levied is financing the war. In the financial year 1915-16, the Commonwealth derived fro m war income tax £3,934,000, war probate duties £626,000, increased land tax for war purposes £200,000, and increased Customs and Excise duties levied for war purposes £2,000,000; or a total of £6,760,000. That sum is sufficient to pay interest at 5 per cent. on £135,000,000; whereas from such figures as I have been able to gather the war expenditure during the year 1915-16 was about £41,000,000, and the interest and sinking f u n d paid was £2,000,000. If the taxation that was specially voted for war revenue, namely, income tax and probate duties, which realized £4,560,000, was set aside for war purposes, the provision to the end of the year was very satisfactory. Ample provision has been thus far made to finance our war loans and war expenditure by the special taxation already authorized. If more money is required for the current financial year it must be obtained. The Treasurer has just placed befor© us a scheme by which he seeks to obtain all he will need for this year for the purpose of financing the war. In my opinion, the expenditure on ordinary services during a time of war should not be greater than what it was prior to the war. We already had a very large If all employees are expenditure in 1913-14, and if we had determined not to spend more during the I suppose that the war than we spent on the ordinary services in that year we would have been acting as a prudent and wise people. In our private affairs, in time of diffiI t is a scheme culty, we would take care to l i m it our expenditure to an amount which would not be more than what it was before our difficulties arose. I am not sure that the Government have done this. If the Government allows the ordinary expenditure to increase during a period of war, difficulty, and danger, it will be monstrous and reckless procedure on their part. No words are strong enough to condemn such action. Surely during this terrible war we should not be called upon to spend more",29,During 1913 14 1914 15 1915 16 And The Estimate For 1916 17

Hunter, as also other honourable members opposite, complain of what others are doing, it is not an unfair retort to ask what those whom he thinks he specially represents are doing, and why he should attack those whom he does not pretend even to represent without telling us what those whom he does represent have done, or propose to do. masses of the people have not felt the burden of the war unduly; they have not paid anything directly towards the war expenditure. member to refute that statement. him point out where the masses of the pe&ple have been unduly burdened, or where they have contributed anything material directly towards the war expenditure.

On the other hand, they are asked, "" What are you going to do?"" I may tell honourable members what they intend to do. They intend to obey the law and to do their best in the direction of financing the large expenditure that is now proceeding. If the honourable member for Hunter had his way he would kill the goose that lays the golden egg. While I rejoice that the masses have When the honourable member for not suffered during the war, I regret that during these years of difficulty and danger there has been so much industrial unrest. From the last publication issued by Mr Knibbs, I find that during two years of war there have been 695 industrial disputes, and a loss of wages amounting to about £900,000. Those who choose to strike and thereby Fortunately the lose money cannot be in any great difficulty; otherwise they would not do it .

This young and resourceful nation will be in desperate need if ever it finds it necessary to resort to compulsory loans, without interest, to pay for its share in the expenses of the war. A more just appreciation of the realities of life would show that the man who invests £500 A r e we in a Government loan . . . . is just as much entitled to a return for his money as the man who prefers investing £500 in house When one does well or tries to property. An appreciation of these simple facts will prevent much confusion of thought and the spreading of foolish notions. That is a proper and reasonable statement. Every one will agree that in this new and undeveloped country the lighter the burdens that are placed on the people, by taxation or otherwise, the better.

I should like to say, iii conclusion, that, in my opinion, the way to finance this war is to continue the plan that has so far been adopted-that is, to raise the money required by loan, and to provide by taxation sufficient to pay interest and sinking fund on our borrowings. I should say that 1 per cent, is a quite sufficient sinking fund for a counsary, that he should be compelled to go, it try like this. No devious methods are either necessary or justifiable. I can only hope that we shall hear no more statements in this chamber that those who have, or are supposed to have, wealth are not contributing to the cost of this war.

It is very evident that the right honourable to member for Swan addressed the Coma considerable mittee with the one object of replying to cases the property-owner is receiving more the remarks made by me in connection in additional rent than he is paying in with the Referendum Bill, for beyond the income tax? If that is Happening who criticisms directed against my arguments, really pays the income tax ? he shed very little light on the proposals which have emanated from the Treasurer. to. able gentleman also stated that he hoped that in future I will be a little more generous than I have been to the class of people whom he represents.

In this, the greatest crisis in the history of the nation, when we are saying that every able-bodied man should be prepared to go to the front, and, if necesis fair, having regard to the great additional cost to be incurred, that all people should realize that they have a burden to shoulder. We have no right to take up the attitude that, whilst one man should risk his life-tha n which nothing is more sacred-the right honourable member and I should remain at home and not pay all we possibly can towards the national cost of prosecuting the war to a finish.

The right honourable member for Swan would have us believe that the masses of the people are not paying this additional taxation. I answer him, in connection with this latest endeavour on the part of the Government to meet the financial situation, that unless the Government are very careful and introduce machinery to prevent traders from in creasing their prices, the new taxation will be passed on to the shoulders of the people. I hope the Government w ill take steps to see that prices are not increased in that way, and then the right honourable gentleman may be able to claim that his friends are paying the taxation. Sir proposal you made last week? that all income, over and above an amount that could be termed sufficient for a fair living for each individual should be paid into the Treasury for the purpose of financing the war. Without having the assistance of the Treasury officials, I informed honourable members on that occasion that the war expenditure during 1916-17 would probably run to over £74,000.000, and I find that the Treasurer now £73,670,616. The cost of the war is in creasing by leaps and bounds every year, and how are we to meet it if we do not get the money from some source? 1913-14 the expenditure of the Commonwealth was £25,412,231 ; in 1914-15, £40,269.702; in 1915-16, £91,052,632; and for the year 1916-17, £127,836,291. If the war continues for any length of time our expenditure will be still greater. We have to face the position. WhatI propose, and what I would carry into 1 effect if I could, even though I might be considered an anarchist and a fool, is I was referring to that the Government should take all income over and above £400 a year. ThereL e t the right honare households which could be kept comfortably on, perhaps, £200 a year; but when the breadwinner has to do a great deal of travelling, his personal expenses are possibly as great as would be sufficient to keep an ordinary family. Every case, however, would be met were an expenditure of £400 allowed. It is admitted that the country needs for the prosecution of the war the "" l as t shilling,"" about which we have heard so much talk. are talking That being so, it is surely not too much to ask every person to pay to the State all I am stating absothat he earns above £400 a year. the Commonwealth is growing so rapidly that the Government will need all that it can get, and more. I have given serious consideration to this matter for some weeks past, and believe that I am discharging my public duty in putting forward the suggestion that I have made. In no other way can you prevent those whom the country is trying to tax directly from passing on their taxation by increasing the cost of living to the poorer members of the community.

When we have the Treasurer prefacing his statement by an intimation to the country that he is already in funds to the extent of £17,000,000, I think my honourable friend will see that all his heroic, Spartan-like proposals are just a little previous. Does my honourable friend propose that everybody should pool all the wealth they have got, when it is not needed for the purposes of the war? He must recollect that, of the wealth of Australia, there is very little at the present time out of productive use; and to do what he suggests would be to withdraw the working capital and put it in the hands of the Treasury, and so dislocate, disturb, and destroy the very enterprises of the country which form, in the last resort, our staying power in this war. it were carried out, would not tend to the efficient conduct of the war, for it would remove the very props which are underneath the whole burden of the war, and which are necessary to its successf u l prosecution. It would be far better to drop this academic kind of thought, and stand up to the burdens as detailed to us-to meet the requirements of the moment from day to day, and as the obligations of the war make necessary. I believe that, when these burdens are proved to be necessary, the people will bear them without complaint. has been the spirit ' of the Empire all through this war; and I do not believe that the burden-bearers Australia are one whit behind, in patriotism, and even in generosity, those in every portion of the Empire and in every other portion of the theatre of war. There are one or two items that might very well be called in question. regret to see that, with all the titanic war obligations towering up, the Treasurer is still increasing expenditure on the ordinary civil administration of the country. The great item of new works ought to be sifted to the bottom. I do not believe that, in a time of war like this, while we are putting £7,000,000 of extra taxation on the people, we ought, at the same time, to increase the expenditure on new works from £2,800,000 to £4,394,000. doubt we could spend another £5,000,000 measures; we or £6,000,000, and still declare that it was for necessary works. I simply say that if , in war time, we go round looking for chances to spend money, we have not yet got into the spirit of the war. Rather should we be going round seeing what we can postpone unti l after the war is over. We have noright to spend millions on anything that can be done without while the war lasts. I come, therefore, to my point that this staggering increase in the item of new works requires more explanation than that furnished by the Treasurer. the fact that the Naval and Military Departments account for £1,140,000 of the increase ? much like to see the details, even of that expenditure. Becausei t relates to the My honourable friend's proposal, if Defence Department on its ordinary normal side, I think it requires sifting as much as any other expenditure. I am not talking of war expenditure, for that cannot be cavilled at so long as we are getting a £ 1 worth for every £ 1 . But it is in regard to expenditure on the ordinary administration of the Defence Department that I say care and vigilance are needed to insure that the money is not wasted there any more than in any other Department. I frankly confess that I should like to see a committee of the House, composed of the best financial That brains, set to work on the problem of finding where this money is going, and how much of the expenditure can be done in without until the war is over. That kind of thing is being done everywhere else; this is the only place, so far as I know, where the Government of the day' feel themselves competent to undertake to supervise ;every ramification and every detail of these huge expenditures. ment, in Canada, are doing the same thing. member will find that in Canada there are several committees at work investigating the finances, item by item, and detail by detail; and something of the kind is badly needed here.

What items does the right honourable member object to i settle the matter quite like that on the floor of the House. I cannot help feeling that there is room for very serious inquiry into many items of the detailed expenditure.

The latter not'only refuses to work himself,, but geneing that, whereas it was originally estirally declines to allow any other person to work in his stead. So far as the sugargrower is concerned, he has simply to suspend operations. He cannot employ other people -. He has to lose the whole of his production for the year, or pay the wageswhich the Court has awarded. But I wish, more particularly, to make a few observations in regard to the Small Arms Factory.; ' In this connection I directed the attention of honourable members the. other evening to certain facts within my own knowledge. I did not like having-to do so, but I had previously made representations on .the matter which were without effect. I read in the Argus to-day that it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the erection-of an arsenal, and that journal gavethe names of those who are to be intrusted with the expenditure upon this work. NowI pointed out some time ago that the construction of an arsenal will cost anything from £2,250,000 to £2,500,000. If we are going to expend this money, we ought to see that full value is obtained for it. Now, although I object to State Socialism, I think that if there is one avenue of manufacture which the Governmentought to control, it is that of the manufacture of munitions. But when we enter' upon this undertaking the nation should get a fair deal. The other night I pointed out that in 1914, 360 rifles from our Small Arms Factory were sent to ""Western Australia, out of which number more than 100 were unfit to be supplied to the troops. Yet those weapons had been sent out of the factory after having been tested, and examined. Since, then I have heard of -several other consignments that were equally bad. I have already related my own experience when I found that the forearms of some' of these rifles snapped like rotten carrots, that tbe bolts were so badly fitted* that the weapons were absolutely unsafe for men to use of these rifles been used by our men at the front? there. And although the Minister for DeRut fence told the people of Bendigo the other day that we were not only supplying our own troops with, rifles, but those of other Dominions also, the statement is not a fact. I also pointed out the other evenmated that these rifles would cost £3 9s.

I have asked the Minister to allow the 1915 report to be published at once. I was anxious to induce the Department to send inspectors to inspect the rifles before these were sent away from the factory. About half-a-dozen, inspectors were sent up there, with the result that hundreds of. rifles ready to be sent out were condemned. They were taken to pieces, and faults were found in every rifle that was examined. The report I have statesThere is a state of chaoswhich is almost beyond imagination. Thousands of component parts have been scrapped. Many hundreds of rifles that were ready to be sent out have been stripped and all found to be defective, with the result that the men employed to assemble the rifles are now engaged in trying to save the best of them. The present condition of affairs is. most deplorable, and demands immediate attention and reform. rifles are fx) undergo certain alterations! . being sent, out for use in Australia.

Only a few parts of that machinery have been placed in position. For the want of shafting, the majority of it still remains to be placed in position.

Here is a reference made to the cost of other vesselsAs another comparison between the cost of work at Cockatoo and elsewhere, the case of the sister launches Gresswell and Jenner was cited to the Committee. The former vessel was built at Cockatoo, the latter by Messrs. Robinson Bros., of Melbourne. The cost of the Oresavxll is given as £12,800, which, again, does not include proportionate charges for interest, depreciation, and supervision, Buch as have to be added by private firms. The Jenner was contracted for at £5,000. We understand that the firm concerned lost about £1,000 on this undertaking. Adding this to the contract price of the Jenner, we find-'that, in the case of the Oresswell, certain alterations were carried out, costing about £500. There was a further addition to the cost through the vessel having to bear an unusual amount of holiday charges. Also that considerable delay was caused by nondelivery of materials. Making due allowance for these, it would -appear that the launch built at Cockatoo cost about double the price of a similar vessel, admitted to be a satisfactory job, constructed at a private yard. Sir JOH N FORREST -What is the answer -to that? .one answer, and that is that the Govern. ment have dismally failed in the adminis-' tration of these works.

ELLIOT JOHNSON -What about tbe awards the men at Cockatoo Island are working under? able members some idea of the way in which tilings are done at Cockatoo Island when they learn what the general manager had to say about the awards in operaI have a report tion there. He said"" HereI am,"" working under fifty-one awards, and new ones keep cropping up every day. How on earth can a man run an establishment of this sort and meet the contending forces of fifty-one different awards?"" Several unions cover one industry. There are two painters' unions. There are three carpenters' unions. The labourers have many unions, and many I repeat that I am awards and conflicting awards. It is absolutely impossible to try to run this island on economio lines, when you have so many conflicting rates of pay and overtime, and all that Tbe -sort of thing, and different rates for night shift. One of the greatest difficulties here is the multiplicity of labourers' unions, necessitating the employment of a much larger number of men than is necessary. One union .allows its members to handle steel and iron, another union only allows its men to handle wood. If I require a labourer to do general carting about the yard, I must have a man of one union to cart the steel and iron, and a member of another union to cart wood. , . . All the painters and dockers insist that they shall cart all wood about, and the iron workers' assistants insist that they shall cart all sf$el and iron about. I have to pay the assistants to one grade 9s.,. though the award rate is only 8s.; I have to pay the shipwrights' assistant, who is a painter and docker, 10s. per day. We should have a uniform rate for labourers, and a man who is a labourer should do ordinary labourers' work. Where we require assistance for a mechanical man, we should get men accustomed to the trade, and get uniformity that way. That is the essence of economy in work of this sort; but as for general carting about, lifting gear, and carting about bars and plates; I have to have two or three unions to do this work. Another instance is that the labourers assisting iron workers are not allowed, according to the painters and dockers, to clear up the work behind them. I must bring in a man of another union to do that. He goes on to sayOnly the other day I had the secretary of a union here who insisted that I must employ builders' labourers on a work that had nothing to do with building, that is, a coffer-dam. Their award is aFederal award, providing for fortyfour hours a week, and if I employed those labourers for forty-eight hours that the other men work, I should have to pay them overtime rates. I could multiply these matters ad. infinitum. I had a fight the other day between certain trades over a temporary gantry. The joiners and shipwrights had a battle royal oyer it as to whether it was joiners' or shipwrights' work. I managed to fix them up. These questions of demarcation lead to endless deputations.

If we found that a contractor was well within or close up to that estimate, we had that work done by contract, but if \se thought that the contractors were putting their heads together to fleece the Government, we did the work by day labour.

280,Mr Gregory,"No, I did not meanexport trade was vested in the Government, the responsible Minister handed over the whole business of exporting molybdenite, wolfram, and the associated alloy metals to Dalgety and Company, who were also paid an extraordinary commission for handling it . General's Department bungled the business in the first place, because-as they did not understand the matter-the y would not allow any molybdenite to be sent out of Australia unless it was 90 per cent, grade. were prepared to accept 80 per cent, grade, but would make a reduction on the price offered for 90 per cent, grade. Large quantities of molybdenite were ready to be sent from Australia just at the time when Great Britain wanted it , perhaps, more than anything else, and this official bungling, in my opinion, was criminal. Prior to the war the cost of sending molybdenite to London was about £ 6 per ton, but when the Government handed the business over to Dalgety and Company, they allowed £ 5 5 16s. 8d. per ton for freight, and gave them the sole right to trade in that metal during the currency of the war. It was only after representations were made by the Imperial Government that a certain person in Sydney, a man who had interested himself very greatly in this trade, was allowed to complete the contracts which he had entered into prior to the war. Now, with regard to the flotation of mining companies, the Treasurer, acting on the advice of this honorary official, might refuse half-a-dozen out of ten propositions, with the result that the four which might be approved of would bear the hall-mark of the Department. In such circumstances, I can quite understand that the clever gentlemen behind such propositions would take advantage of the position, and would say to the public, "" We have taken this proposition to the Department, they have examined every phase of it to see whether it is fair or not; they turned down in numerable other proposals, but have agreed to this, so you can come into it with every confidence."" This is a big responsibility for the Government to take. It is quite possible that the Treasurer will do an in j u r y to the mining industry if he easy to say that what is attempted to be allows this thing to continue. say that every proposal should be placed before the public, but I think I have said enough to indicate the danger of the present position so far as the development of mining is concerned. During the nine years that I was Minister for Minesi n Western Australia, we were informed many times that unscrupulous people had come forward with proposals to deceive investors, and we were asked if we could The Attorneytake action to control them, but we were always confronted with the difficulty that, before doing anything in that direction, the various propositions ought to be examined. If we sent an inspector today, a reef may assay 4 oz. in the face, The British Government but to-morrow f a i l to show values. The difficulty is to prove f r a u d . The danger I see in regard to the Government proposals to control the flotation of mining companies is that the hall-mark of the Department might be placed upon certain propositions. The Minister should allow mining propositions to follow their ordinary course unless he finds that more money is being utilized on such expenditure than is advisable in the interests of the Commonwealth. I urge on the Government the necessity for making public as speedily as possible their proposals for the coming season's wheat pool. Many strictures have been passed on me because I expressed the opinion a few nights ago that the wheat pool would probably prove detrimental to the farmers' interests. In a few weeks another big harvest will be added to the 30,000,000 bags of wheat that are now on hand in the pool, and one cannot help looking forward with misgivings to its future possibilities. I -trust that the Government will make public their proposals in regard to this matter as speedily as possible, so that the producers may know what their position will be. We could almost dub the honourable member for Dampier the Jeremiah from the West. He has been telling a dismal tale for an hour past. His wail in regard to the arsenal, about which he is so often talking, reminds me of the men who a few years ago endeavoured to prevent Australia from establishing her own N a v y ; made all sorts of prophecies about it , and raised all sorts of opposition to Australia doing all she possibly could for herself.

The Canadian troops were armed with that rifle and sent to the front, and complaint was continually made that something was wrong with it . Investigations proved the complaints to be of a trumpery character, and it was shown that the condemnation should have been of the ammunition used rather than of the rifle. I believe that we have overcome the initial difficulties in connection with the manufacture of rifles in Australia, and I trust that the Government will extend their manufacturing operations to many other articles. In order to emphasize the high qualifications of Australian workmen I would remind honourable members that from 600 to 1,000 Australians are working in some of the chief factories engaged in the production of munitions of war in Great Britain, and those who are complaining about the Australian artisans would receive a valuable education if they could go to the Old Country and see what these men are doing there.

I rose this evening mainly for the purpose of answering the continual opposition, to the establishment of an arsenal in. Australia. I hope there will be no more of these protests, but that we shall unite and have the arsenal speedily established on one of the best sites in Australia There is much work that an arsenal can do. I am not speaking only of what can be done from a defence point of view.

Therefore, for peaceful operations alone it is essential that we should have a factory such as I have outlined. Above all, I maintain that one of the first branches of the arsenal to be established must be the steel works, to do all the work that is so necessary in connection with ship building and other industries. established at Newcastle. ber must know that at Newcastle the Broken Hill Proprietary Company is practically undertaking nothing more than the manufacture of steel rails. poses to do. propose to extend its works. It is a thousand pities that we did not have those works established years ago, instead of continuing to send money overseas for thousands of miles of rails. I wish to prevent Australia getting into a state of sleepiness and sloth that will prevent us proceeding with the establishment of these works, even in war time. In Great Britain committees of various kinds have been formed for the purpose of assisting industries already established, and encouraging the establishment of others. We ought to have in Australia committees carrying out investigations of that kind. As far back as October, 1914, when Mr Fisher was Prime Minister, I made a suggestion, on the motion for adjournment, that a committee should be appointed to investigate the possibility of monwealth. I knew then that we should be cut off from many countries that previously supplied us with various commodities; but if Australia will take advantage of this cutting-off and establish industries of its own, the war will not prove as great a curse as it otherwise will be. We ouglft to do what Great Britain and Canada are doing, and whatthat little country in the East is doing, to capture the trade which the Huns once enjoyed.

There are hundreds of cities and towns in Europe to be rebuilt, and in their reconstruction steel will play a very important part. If Australia is not equipped to supply its own requirements in that regard, we shall be obliged to remain in the background for many years. It will be criminal neglect on our part if we do not do everything possible to have steel works established here. In regard to the financial statement, I understand that several of the principal items mentioned by the Treasurer w ill form the subject of separate Bills to be dealt with later. When those Bills come forward we shall have an opportunity of discussing the principles involved. something now ? Do you not know your party wants wealth to be conscripted ? come forward separately, if they are not suitable I shall make my views known. there are items in the Treasurer's proposals with which I do not agree. In many cases the proposals do not go far enough. I believe we could have raised money in ways other than those suggested.

Australia has increased, and I hope w ill continue to do so, and I think that the postal revenue would increase if the letter rate were again made 2d. We may need this increased revenue later, and I think that it should have been provided for almost at the beginning of the war.

In my opinion, the proper way for Australia to meet the extraordinary circumstances of the present time is to look after herself. I should like to see anti-dumping legislation in troduced, so that no goods could come here unless they had been manufactured subject to certain conditions. Unfortunately, we are not establishing industries as we should do. The Prime Minister has appointed a Scientific Investigation Committee, some of whose work is probably very valuable, but. to my mind, we are not taking advantage of the brains that we have in Australia, as we should do, to establish new industries. I should like to see something done immediately. The war has made it necessary to i m pose very heavy taxation, and the burden is likely to become so intolerable that the people w ill ask before long why is Australia the prey of so many taxing agencies. so many State Parliaments? most heavily taxed country in the world. to population, it supports more members of Parliament than any other country.

When Federation A Free Trade idea was established, it was said that the State Parliaments must decrease to such an extent that the moneys thus saved would pay all the expenses of the Federation. Has that been so? On the contrary, the expenditure has gone up by leaps and bounds, and it is time the people looked into the matter, as I hope and trust they w ill . This would be one way of saving considerable sums of money, and avoiding much taxation. When the items come before us, I shall discuss them on their merits. There are some to which I can give my hearty approval, but there are others which I shall do my best to get amended, if not rejected for the substitution of others. I hope that the Government w ill not be spineless or limp in regard to the establishment of an arsenai. In my opinion, they have been too hesitating and halting in the past.

336,Mr Corser (Wide Bay) [9.28],"Ito do well anything they undertake, if they only have the opportunity. In my own electorate some 250 locomotives have been turned out; and wherever these locomotives go-to South Australia, Victoria or elsewhere-the y are pronounced to be the best on the roads. I quite agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong that there are many things that ought to be done to help our industries, and provide more lucrative work here. The honourable member happened to mention that the development in the steel industry is not what it ought to be. In my opinion, the reason for that is that there is not sufficient protection on the manufacture of steel to enable the industry to be carried on successfully. Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, established large steel works for the purpose of turning out steel plant, but they were not able to use those works to their fullest capacity within about 50 per cent. tection we should have a large steel manufacturing industry in this country. As to locomotives, we now manufacture everything here w i th the exception of the tires, which, on account of the low protection it is found better to import. that honourable members on both sides are alive to the fact that, if industries are established with sufficient protection, we can produce everything that can be produced elsewhere. the enormous amount of wool there is in Queensland and Australia generally. Doesi t seem fair that this wool should have to be sent away, w i th freight paid, to be manufactured abroad, and brought back, at the cost of further freight and other charges, when the cloth and other material could be turned out here as well as in any country in the world? I only hope that the day is not f a r distant when we shall have well-equipped factories for the purpose of converting a large portion of our wool into the manufactured article. pliment the Treasurer on at last giving us some information regarding the sugar industry, for the question is a burning one at the present time. honourable gentleman to bear in mind that every month we are losing about one-fourth of the whole output of the season. Up to the present time, the delay caused by the closing down which followed on the Dickson award, means a loss of one-third of the crop. That loss w ill affect not only the people of Queensland, but the [324]-2 people of the rest of Australia and the Treasurer. We have been told distinctly by the Treasurer that the Government price entails a loss of £ 2 per ton on the foreign sugar imported, after taking credit for the profit made on the Queensland sugar. If the industry is killed, or even if the sugar is not manufactured this seasonand if it is, it will haye to be by the 31st December-the Treasurer will find-that, instead of having to import sugar at a loss of £ 2 per ton, he will have to face a loss of nearly £ 5 . That w ill be a serious matter; and I appeal to the Treasurer and the House to take the question into serious consideration. The vast majority of the men affected are indust r i a l workers, who, w i th land obtained on'terms, have started growing in a small way; and they are now facing absolute ruin on account of the award. If we had a little more proThe effect of the imposition of the in creased wages is so great that it is impossible for the industry to live and thrive. When the last MacNaughton award was made, about two years ago, it was considered that it would be difficult for the I feel sure growers, unless they had normal seasons, to make money out of the industry; but when it is remembered that the new award means an increase of practically. 50 per cent, in wages over the rate fixed then, Look, for example, at the effect upon the sugar industry can be seen. Young fellows of eighteen and over are to be paid £5 2s. per week for work that the Judge holds can be well done by young fellows of. that age. The Judge calculated that about for ty men engaged i u the industry came from Tasmania, for t y from Sydney, and twenty from Brisbane. He put down £12 Is. as the cost of a man going"" from Tasmania to Cairns and back to Brisbane. He allowed twenty-one days' travelling and lost time at 13s.'per day, equalling £13 13s. He, deducted twenty-one days' food prodded on board steamer I have to comat 2s. 6d. per day, or £2 12s. 6d., leaving £23 Is. 6d., which is to be a tax upon the industry without the industry receiving a sixpence in return for it . Jle altered the I should like the previous award by abolishing the retention money, the effect of which w ill be that men may work t ill within a fortnight of the termination of the cut, and then leave without completing the harvest to take on some longer job, at great loss to the owner. He regarded the high cost of living as a reason for awarding higher wages to the men, but did not take it .into consideration when fixing the amount which the employer could charge for food provided by him. He ordered that if nine or more men wished it , the employer must provide food, and could deduct for it only 19s. per week. No less than seventy articles of diet are specified in the schedule for the men. It is clear that he did not take into consideration the fact that the higher cost of livin g would f a l l on the employer, because, if the schedule is to be supplied as set down, it cannot be done under 30s. a week per man. Consequently, another l is . must be added to the £5 2s. per week. It is such an extraordinary award that I am not at all surprised at the numerous telegrams I have received from various parts of Queensland telling me that they have shut down, and that there is no prospect of opening again, unless substantial relief is given. The additional cost to the producer is about £7 per ton. He is paid £18 a ton now for raw sugar. Only yesterday I received the following telegram from the Sugar Growers Union at Mackay:About one-third estimated total output of sugar now unable t'o be harvested owing cessation operations for past four weeks. Growers determined stand firm to bitter end, unless satisfactory . settlement sugar crisis secured, livery day now means ruinous loss to Commonwealth and community generally, owing sugar crops deteriorating. I am also informed that the executive committee are quite agreeable to have the matter referred to the Inter-State Commission. in production? harvested this year the loss to Australia w ill be about £5,000,000. over? ought to know that a lot of it stood over from last year on account of the drought. We produced then only 100,000 tons in stead of 260,000. 260,000 tons since Queensland has been Queensland. for the Commonwealth in 1907. I have been connected w it h the sugar industry since the first cane was grown in Australia, and have watched it minutely ever since. When I was in the Queensland Parliament, we calculated, after careful investigation, that when we passed the estimates for the Bobinda and Johnstone River mills those two additional mills would supply Australia with every pound of sugar that would be required in normal seasons. There are millions of acres of land in Queensland just as good as that already under cane, but it is of no use producing a ton more sugar than can be sold within the Commonwealth, because there would be a loss of £ 7 a ton in competing with cane grown in Java at a cost in wages per man of 4d. or 4£d. a day, as against 15s. 6d. a day in Southern Queensland and 17s. a day in Northern Queensland under the Dickson award. the honourable member was making. He said they would lose £5,000,000, and I asked if none of that cane could stand over. owing to the drought preventing the cane being sufficiently large to cut last year, a great deal of it stood over u n t i l this year. If it stands over for another season the cane w ill deteriorate to such an extent that in some cases it w ill be absolutely worthless. marked that during the war it will be again necessary to import foreign sugar to make up for the deficiency in our Australian production, and that war prices for foreign sugars may be so high that a loss of even more than £ 2 per ton may have to be met out of the profits. Now, the less sugar produced in Queensland the more w ill have to be imported, and the more that has to be imported the greater w ill be the loss on the sugar production of Australia. I contend that the loss already is a severe one, because, owing to the war, the Treasurer w ill have to find some hundreds of thousands of pounds more than he otherwise would. The Government have been asked to in .vite the Inter-State Commission to in quire into and report upon the industry, and they are willing to do so provided the agreement that was entered into between the Commonwealth, the Queensland Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Millaquin Sugar Refining Company be not subjected to",50,Moloney Thi S Is The When The War Is Over The Government

A delay of another month will mean that at least one-fourth more of this year's crop cannot to the Treasurer, without the loss of a single day, under the War Precautions Act , to suspend the Dickson award. If he does that, within a few hours .of the notification going forth, the sugar industry will be in f u l l swing again and the 19,000 men engaged in it will be saved from r u in . of overcoming the difficulty ? The Treasurer has stated that the Government are not in favour of increasing the price of sugar to the consumer. We have asked that the profit that has been made on the sugar produced in Queensland shall go to the producer instead of being utilized to defray the cost of importing "" black "" sugars fro m overseas. The honourable gentleman has clearly pointed out that that money is required to minimize the cost of importations from abroad, and to enable the Commonwealth to sell at 3$d. per l b . . There is, therefore, no other means of overcoming this difficulty than that of suspending the Dickson award. I have never been an advocate of cutting down wages when an industry is well able to pay them. But the sugar industry is not able bo pay the rates fixed under that award. I am certain, too, that there are many other industries in the Commonwealth which could not carry a wages bill of £ 5 2s. per man per week of forty-eight hours. A t a time like the present, it behoves us to find as much employment as possible for our people, and to help the families who have sent"" their boys to fight for the Empire, instead of imposing upon them a burden that is too grevious bo be borne. The Government should be sympathetic towards the sugar-growers of Queensland, and should say to them that, in all the circumstances, the Dickson award cannot stand, and must be repealed. must not forget that there are in the community quite a large number of business men, who have to support the sugar-growers practically for twelve months, and whose only chance of getting their accounts settled is when the harvest time comes round. Last year there was very little more than a thir d of the normal harvest; and this year the Thus, business men, as well as cane-growers, are threatened with ruination. If people are not able to secure interest upon their investbe cut this season. I appeal ments, it is scarcely necessary to point out that they will be called upon to pay less income tax than they otherwise would, and the Treasury will consequently suffer.' To-day there is between £11,000,000 and £12,000,000 invested in the sugar industry. ' There are 19,000 men directly interested in it , and many more thousands who are indirectly interested in it . I hope that the Treasurer will be able to tell us that we can save this industry from r u in , and succour the men in it who are suffering so keenly at present. In Bundaberg one firm alone-that of Young's-ha s turned out 200 draught horses because it will not cultivate its fields for next year's crop. The members of that firm say that if the Dickson award is to stand, the sugar industry is of no further use to them, and the sooner they utilize their land in some other way the better. We all know, too, that the possession of such an industry in the northern portion of Queensland has hitherto been regarded as a splendid thing from the stand-point of defence. In that portion of the Commonwealth we have tens of millions of acres of the best land in the world-lan d which will produce magnificent tropical products-and if this industry is to be closed down that area will become a menace instead of a benefit to Australia. If for no other reason, the sugar industry ought not to be permitted to crumble. I am sure that the Treasurer is sympathetically inclined towards those who are engaged in it . not care. so. I trust that he will take immediate steps towards relieving the great disabilities under which they suffer. If nothing out of the way had happened to the industry this year, We Queensland would have produced from 170,000 to 180,000 tons of sugar. If that production is stopped, and the Treasurer has to find the balance of sugar for us, and has to pay £ 4 or £ 5 at least per ton beyond what would enable him to sell at 3^d., the problem w ill be a very serious one for him to solve. I do not blame the",52,Moloney Thi S Is The When The War Is Over The Government

The Judge gave them"" more than they asked for. As a result, he has driven out of the industry the men whom he sought to assist. was a lot of exaggeration about the extravagant claims of the workmen. I must tell them that they should be more just to themselves in future there are men who are not as just as they ought to be. The honourable member's criticism is not fair, because there are many growers in Queensland who have paid good wages to their men from the first, and have never had an appeal against the wages they have paid. Before these awards came into existence many of them were paying higher wages than they are paying now. I personally know of in stances of the kind. I should like honourable members to bear in mind that when a man starts work in the morning at canecutting, should a heavy storm come on and prevent him from continuing his labour, he receives 15s. 6d. per day in the southern parts of Queensland, although he may have done nothing, and 17s. per day in the north. If he works overtime in order to keep the mill going, he must get time and a half,, and if it is necessary that he should work on a Sunday he must get double time. One would not object if our competitors in other parts of the world were producing sugar under similar conditions, but we are up against the use of black labour in every other part of the world in which cane sugar is produced. Honourable members must see how difficult it is for us to grow cane sugar under these conditions in .competition with those growing it with coloured labour. No one would object to tbe wages we are asked to pay if the industry could afford them, but as it cannot afford them, I say it is far better in the interests of every one concerned that fair wages should be paid than that men engaged in the industry should be thrown out of employment. There is now a sorry sight to be seen in Bundaberg in my electorate. Hundreds of men are out of employment, and are receiving assistance for themselves and their families from the Queensland Government. The same condition of affairs exists all the way up the coast. The men thrown out of employment in the sugar industry have appealed to the Minister for Railwaysi n Queensland to start railway works; but he is unable to do so, for the simple reason that there is no money available for the purpose. The very people whom the „ Judge, in making the award, sought to I always knew there assist, are being cruelled in the same way as are the growers of the cane. The Prime Minister, when in London, tried to do something for the sugar industry. He tried to induce the Imperial authorities to take supplies of sugar from portions of the Empire growing cane sugar, instead of importing, as has been done in the past, beet-sugar, on which very heavy bounties are paid, from Germany and other countries. Before the present trouble came upon them, the sugar-growers of Queensland took fresh heart, when they heard of the efforts made by the Prime Minister in the Old Country, and looked forward to an extension of the industry in Northern Queensland. It was felt that, by that extension, numbers of white people might be settled upon the large areas of rich soil which are now, because they are .unoccupied, a menace to the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, the award to which I have referred forbids the hope of any extension of the kind. It has been said that Unification would be of some assistance to us, but let me say that only a Victorian could argue in that way. In the young States of Queensland and Western Australia the people have done a great deal to forward their development and settlement. In Queensland, with its huge territory of 425,000,000 acres, the people have constructed 1,100 miles more of railways than have been constructed in , any other State of the Commonwealth. ber looks up his ABC , I think he will find it is so. member will find that the ABC takes the year 1915 for Queensland and 1914 for the other States. to the time. I left the Queensland Parliament we were spending over £2,000,000 a year in railway construction, and had been doing that for years. It was intended to carry that work on, and a large number of lines of railway are only partially completed, so that in future the comparison, instead of being to our detriment, will",53,Moloney Thi S Is The When The War Is Over The Government

Victoria, on the other hand, has had the benefit of tbe sale of her d o w n lands, and with the proceeds of such sales bas constructed railways and other public works. In Queensland wo have 400,000,000 acres of unalienated Crown lands.
