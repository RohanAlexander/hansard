Section 22 of the Electoral Act is as f o l lows :""22 -(1. ) If either House of Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, as a conState into divisions. "" reconsider the matter, and forthwith propose a fresh distribution, but for that purpose it shall not be necessary to cause the action provided by section 17 of this Act to be taken."" The Senate's resolution is clearly a resolution disapproving of the distribution proposed 'by the Commissioners, and enables the Minister io direct the Commissioners to prepare a fresh -distribution. The Senate, in its resolution, has stated reasons for the disapproval, and has requested the Commissioners to alter the distribution in a certain way. The Commissioners are not bound to comply -with any such request. It is obviously convenient, however, that the Commissioners should be aware, not merely of the bare fact of the disapproval, but of the particular matters disapproved of and the reasons; and the Senate's .resolution appears to be designed to that end. Tn my opinion, the only direction which the Minister should give to the Commissioners is a -direction to propose a fresh distribution. But he should send them, for their information, a copy of the resolution of the Senate, and the debate thereon. .upon notice1.

39,Mr Thomas,"The following infor8. The reason for the higher estimated cost in the case of the Dartmoor-Mumbannar line is as follows:-The Dartmoor-Heywood line is constructed for J of a mile on existing poles, for 7 miles on new poles, for 14! miles on trees, and for 4 miles on fences. The estimate for the Dartmoor-Mumbannar line provides for the line to be erected on new poles for the whole distance, viz., 5 miles 43 chains. It w ill thus be seen that the Dartmoor-Heywood line is a part cheaply constructed line, and the DartmoorMumbannar line is a standard all-pole line.

In recent years, as I pointed out when making the Budget' statement, it has become more urgent than ever that an early opportunity should be given to honourable members to consider and pass the Works and Buildings Estimates, so that the works may be proceeded with. Honourable members have only to look at the aggregate amount set down for these purposes to see that, if we are to make headway as the country desires, we must get an early expression of opinion from this Committee, and from Parliament as a whole, authorizing the various Ministers to proceed with the works outlined in these pages. It is for this reason that the Government have taken the course of bringing these Estimates immediately before the Committee in order to'expedite their passage. Although there is no desire on the part of the Government to restrict the consideration or discussion of any item whatever, it is honourable members as may view the matter in tlie same light as I do, in a suggestion within as short a space of time as possible. to do that on. every measure, now. member for Lang will not object to my making a request. That is all I am doing. I am not here to complain of the Opposition discussing, or criticising, or voting on, these items; but I am sure there is no intention on the part of any honourable member to delay the passage of the Estimates which are necessary to enable the works of the Commonwealth to be carried out. Ministers will be'ready at all times to give all the information they have in their possession regarding the items as they come before the Committee. I move That item No. 1, ^8,500, be agreed to. propose to follow is this: I shall allow Do you mean after the dea general debate on the first item. We shall then deal with the items in the Estimates individually. first question before us is raised by tlie suggestion of the Prime Minister, that the Works Estimates should be taken at this stage of our proceedings. It That course is contrary to the usual practice, and to precedents followed elsewhere. Buti t is a course which has been followed, with good reason I must admit, on more than one occasion, even during the present Parliament.

They are, in many cases, intimately connected with the policy of the Government. The questions which are at issue in this general de'-bate necessarily include the whole of the particular propositions which the Works Estimates are intended to authorize. As a consequence, a debate on the first item of these Estimates, commences the discussion in this House of the whole of the financial proposals of the Government, embraces within it the whole sphere covered by these Works Estimates, most of -them subsidiary, in many cases, to what -may be termed the general policy of the -country. In the remaining instances, they -are subsidiary to, and in harmony with, the particular policy which a Government may 'be seeking to introduce, or to continue. Consequently, upon the first item, the House has free scope in regard to all 'the items which appear in the Estimates. The whole of this volume is open to criti-cism. It must be admitted that on many grounds such questions are capable of being more satisfactorily dealt with when the -enormous expenditure which is entailed by the carrying out of these proposals is -taken into account, together with the discussion of principles. must be at once apparent that no matter what practical advantages there are in getting the Works Estimates, so to speak, -out of the way-gettin g them authorized -havin g the Departments instructed to -proceed with them; whatever practical advantages may accrue from the adoption of that course, there are, notwithstanding, grave disabilities, owing to the fact that by this method of procedure discussion tends to become more speculative than practical.

In several respects we are putting the cart before the horse. In other respects the horse is being put first, and is doing a great deal of useful service. One very important condition as to this debate is the order of procedure which the Prime Minister proposes to follow in regard to the Budget itself. If the Budget is to be postponed until the closing days-and almost the closing hours-of the session, as it was, I think, the year before last, debate upon it must become perfectly superfluous. the Budget debate within a reasonable time. tion of the Prime Minister to proceed with the Budget debate at once? sary introduction of other measures, in order that Parliament may not come to a gap at the close of the Budget debate, I presume that the Prime Minister will postpone the chief items of business until that debate has been disposed of? through, the Budget will be the first, and the continuous business of the House-un less, of course, it has to be interrupted for the transaction of some other necessary business. Otherwise, it moves an objection that would naturally be taken if the practice which was allowed in very exceptional circumstances were permitted to encroach upon the ordinary procedure of Parliament, to the very grave injury of some of the most important interests of this country. That practice would enable the principles upon which the policy of the Government was founded to be discussed only after the works intended to give effect to those principles had been authorized. The Prime Minister's statement does, as far as possible, remove that objection as far as is consistent with the immediate taking in hand of the practical proposals before us. what I have stated. the Prime Minister's word without any question and without a pledge.

We granted him the inquiry with the greatest cordiality, and helped him with it from first to last. If this kind of criticism is going to continue concerning the public works of the Commonwealth, the sooner we have an inquiry the better for all concerned, and especially for the Minister. If day labour can stand oh its own against the contract system, the sooner he demonstrates that to the public the better. That was the issue decided by the Select Committee in New South Wales to which I ' have referred, so far as that work; went. I do not say that it ought to be the issue here; but 1 do say that the Minister is entitled to tell the Committee the precise methods of business that are applied to the construction of these great works. gard to the employment of day labour in their construction. We require to know whether inspectors, for instance, are given sole control over the men employed under them, and are instructed to see that they do pended in that way.

It is as much in the interests of the Government as in the interests of the public that discipline in the carrying out of public works should be put upon a proper footing if we are to continue the construction of public works by day labour. reasons why the undergrounding of telephone and telegraph wires should be carried out by day labour. It is obvious that work like that under the footpaths of a city is carried on under great difficulties. The foundations of buildings have to be considered, and great care must be taken in connection with all sorts of pipes for gas, water, and sewage. There are, in consequence, a great many risks attending work of this kind, and where it is undertaken by contractors they must make provision to guard against such risks. In the circumstances, it may ' be betterI do not say it is-and more economical for the Departments concerned to take the risks and carry out such work themselves. The fullest inquiry should be made into all these matters, and the most complete statements made to the House respecting them. We should not have the Minister of Home Affairs burlesquing the matter by making statements which reflect no credit upon him. After all, the spending of hundreds of thousands of pounds of the people's money is a serious matter, and should be treated seriously, and a full and complete statement of what is taking place should be made to the House. have had no personal charge of work carried out by day labour for a Government, but I have been a keen observer of the way in which such work has been carried out., I believe that the Government Departments receive good value for money exWe should be told, also, tion of the difficulties involved in carrying out some Government works could be given than that mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta.

It is impossible,"" in such cases, for complete specifications to be drawn up before the work is undertaken. The only way in which such work can be carried out effectively and economically is by day labour under the supervision of departmental officers. With respect to the charges which have appeared in the press, honourable members opposite can quite understand that the Contractors' Association make it their business, through the people they have employed, and the journal they run, to condemn the day labour system on every occasion.

The honourable member for Illawarra recently quoted from a publication called Building, which is edited by a Mr Taylor. quite understand that this gentleman must run the publication in the interests of . the Contractors Association. From the front to the last page of it he must do all he possibly can to make the day-labour system appear as bad as possible in the eyes of the public. 'When the conductor of such a publication can stoop so low as to publish an illustration of the residence recently purchased by the Prime Minister and describe in the next issue the house occupied by the Attorney-General, intimating his intention, if possible, to disgain, rather than lose, by extending these cover what kind of houses are occupied by the other members of the Government, it is not difficult to believe that he will pubPost-office, I repeat my hope that something lish anything which may belittle the day labour system. From my experience and knowledge of contracts, I am satisfied that it would be unadvisable to abandon the day labour system in the carrying out of Government works. In view of the extensive works which require to be carried out for the Commonwealth, I think it would be wise to appoint a Works Committee of some kind to report upon some of the big undertakings which confront us. A great deal of information might be obtained as the result of inquiries by honourable members who have a knowledge of such matters. Their reports would give members ' generally greater confidence that the money voted for the Works Department would be expended advantageously. I wish to make a short reference to the condition of affairs in the cause, under our financial system, we canSydney Post-office. I see that on these Estimates a vote of .£500 is put down for works in connection with that building. We might just as well put the money in the gutter, because that amount is ridiculously inadequate to carry out the improvements which require to be made there. The Sydney newspapers have for some time past been directing the attention of the'authoriis taken away from the general Estimates, ties and the public to tlie fact that it is impossible, under existing conditions, for people to be properly served in that post office. 'A boy sent to purchase J £ I worth of stamps has to wait for over an hour before he can be served. Owing to lack of space, the same thing may be said of other branches of the office. I hope that something will shortly be done to relieve the existing congestion. I do not know whether I shall be in order, on these Estimates, in referring to another matter connected with the post-office. I allude to the facilities afforded for the sale of stamps. I have said that a person requiring to purWe can chase £,1 worth of stamps at the Sydney Post-office has to wait for about an hour before he can be served, because of the crowd at the counter. This difficulty might be obviated if more licences were issued for the sale of stamps. There appears to be a desire to save the 2J per oent. commission paid to persons who are given a licence to sell stamps; but if I were Postmaster-General, 1 should issue a great many more of these licences. I believe that the damage to and loss of stamps by persons authorized to sell them would cover the commission, and the Department would facilities for the purchase of stamps by the public. Referring again to the Sydney will be done to remedy the congestion existing there. The building was commenced! about forty years ago, when it was impossible to foresee the growth of Sydney. It isstrange that tbe Government do not provide much better facilities for the transaction of post and telegraph business than exist at present in the Sydney Post-office. I hope that my remarks will have the effect of causing the Government to make some movement, because the longer the delay, the greater the cost, and an opportunity is presented now which, as is known to the Government officials, may not again occur. I am glad that the consideration of these Estimates is being undertaken at once, benot afford to wait until the main Appropriation Bill is passed, half of the year having then elapsed. Although the course now pursued is not quite so regular as we should like if the conditions were different, the Government are, I think, acting wisely in submitting these Estimates at the first opportunity. Doubtless some interest and we are not able to give very much time to these Works Estimates, inasmuch as we are all anxious to see these public works put in hand immediately. The difficulty that presents itself to my mind, as it has doubtless presented itself to others, in considering the Estimates, is that of ascertaining what money there really is in the hands of the Government, how much is being spent, and what balance is likely to remain at the end of the",22,General Post Office That They Should Restrict Their Criticism To
90,Sir John Forrest (Swan) [3.51],"year. This difficulty, as I shall show, is real, and in no sense imaginary. We desire more light from the Treasurer. honourable member. the Treasury are, I know, experienced, capable, and reliable, and we are fortunate in having such men to look after our financial affairs. wanted, and I shall endeavour to give the information. great advantage if there were a balance sheet prepared showing the ordinary revenue and expenditure-money s in hand from all sources, including loan and trust funds-and our liabilities for the year on account of all services, in addition to the amount we propose to expend in the ordinary way. ask? ture from loan funds, trust funds, and such like. we may know how much money the Government have in hand, how much they are going to spend, how they intend to spend it, and what balance they expect at the end of the year. I do not make these suggestions in any unfriendly spirit, but in order that we may have as much information as possible. The estimated expenditure on "" Additions, New Works, and Buildings"" is .£3,985,921. On the construction of the Fleet it is proposed to expend .£1,196,829; but this amount, although it is shown as a charge against revenue, is money already in hand. This is a balance from the Trust Account, and has already been charged as expenditure; it is shown as expenditure again, but, as honourable members will see, it is put right by being included with other moneys in the deduction of ,£2,261,541 from funds accumulated in previous years. The annual votes amount to .£2,789,092, which, together with the special appropriation .for the construction of the Fleet, brings the total to .£3,985,921. under the control of the Department of Home Affairs amounts to .£991,647 ; and of the Postmaster-General, to ,£830,000; and here I may point out that this is not the real amount of money that the Postmaster General is provided with for the year to spend. He has £[429,460 in the Trust Fund as a sort of nest-egg; so that he will be able to expend .£1,259,460. Unless honourable members look closely into these accounts, they will not observe that ,£429,460 is already appropriated and available for the Postmaster-General in the Trust Fund. my Budget-speech. vote under the control of the Treasury is ,£4,400; the Defence Department, £[900,925; and the Department of External Affairs, £[62,120; making a total for the annual votes, as I said before, of £[2,789,092. We all listened with much attention to the Budget-speech, but it is not possible to keep in our minds everything that is said, although, of course, we can refer to the official report; and the accounts on their face show clearly that this I £[429,460 is in a Trust Fund, and available, as well as the £[830,000. I am sorry to say that during the past year a good many sums voted have not been expended. Perhaps this is not easy to avoid, but every effort should be made to expend money on the purposes for which it is voted. There is nothing more unsatisfactory to the people generally than to find money voted for, say, a post-office or a drill-hall, and the work not to be carried out. Post-office buildings are, of course, very necessary, but we find lhat we are asked to re-vote £[74,607 under this head; while, on Defence, the re-votes amount to £[142,792; on Trade and Customs account, £[1,678 ; and on lighthouses, £[2,500. In regard to the lighthouses, not a penny of the money voted last year was spent. In connection with quarantine, ,£18,000 has to be re-voted; while in connection with the Federal Capital and the stores on Darling Island, we have to re-vcte £[39,409. Altogether, last year there was £[278,466 voted, and not spent, although the works are those in which the people generally take great interest. There is another direction in which I desire to see an improvement. I allude to the practice which exists of securing parliamentary votes, and nof spendThe annual vote ing them at all. My former reference was to the practice of inducing Parliament to authorize votes, and not spending the whole of them. Last year thirty-eight distinct separate votes were obtained for public buildings, not including post-offices-vote s amounting to £[51,291,",23,General Post Office That They Should Restrict Their Criticism To

We might spend a hundred times as much as is being spent, and still be doing good. 1 make that statement without at all assenting to the proposition that we should extract a lot of money from the people that we can do without. claiming the wilderness and building up Australia and filling it with desirable people, I do not know how much could not be profitably expended. However, the fact remains that £[88,337 was voted last year upon eighty-seven distinct separate works, not one single penny of which was expended. The Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill was assented to on the 17th November, 1911, seven and a half months before the end of the financial year. contracts were outrageously high. these eighty-seven works was commenced. I do not wish to be too hard on the Department of Home Affairs, because I appreciate the troubles which are experienced by the Minister. I know that sometimes it is difficult to get plans out, to select a site, and to get a work put in hand quickly. But when I hear so much boasting about his Department being a "" business Department,"" and when I am told that a new rtgime has been instituted, so that things are done very differently now from what they used to be, I am justified in calling attention to these matters. ister of Home Affairs did not boast so much about his "" business capacity"" I would not, perhaps, taunt him with the fact that last year votes were obtained for eightyseven works, including forty-nine post offices, and yet not a single penny was spent upon them. If I may be pardoned for being parochial for a moment, I may refer to my own State in this connection. It seems to me that there is room for great -dissatisfaction there, inasmuch as last year ,£28,888 was voted for nine works, including some post-offices, of which only £[8,596 was expended. £[15,200 was voted for four Defence buildings and ten post-offices, but not a single penny was spent. Honourable members vvill realize tliat when the residents in sparselypopulated districts are told that a vote has been agreed to by Parliament for the erection of a post-office or other building in their locality, and when the whole year passes without anything being done, great dissatisfaction is caused. In Western Australia £[37,136 was voted last year for post-offices, but only £[18,254 was spent. Similarly upon defence works £[49,328 was voted, but only £[18,780 was expended. In other words, £[86,464 was voted But in refor these two important services, and o n t y ^37i°34 expended. Roughly speaking, therefore, no less a sum than £[50,000 was unexpended. I hope that the Minister of Home Affairs will take a note of this matter, and insist that when Parliament votes money for specific works they shall be proceeded with as quickly as possible. In olden times we were not in a hurry to put public works in hand, because we used to be short of money; but that is not the case now. There is now plenty of money available.. Every endeavour should be made to have works authorized by Parliament commenced at the earliest possible date. It is proposed to vote several amounts which are to be paid into the Trust Fund: That fund was brought into existence with the best of intentions, and principally to provide for trading accounts. For instance, in the matter of rifles, clothing, &c, a Department receives certain moneys for the goods which it sells. It is quite reasonable that a Department which runs trading accounts should desire that it should be debited with its ordinary expenditure and credited with its ordinary revenue, and that it should be paid for anything which it may manufacture or sell. Notwithstanding this, I think the time has arrived when Parliament and the Treasurer should devote serious attention to this Trust Fund. It is assuming altogether too big dimensions. Although we have the good fortune to possess officers of very great ability in the Treasury, the fund is now getting into a complicated condition.

On the 30th June, 1911, there was £[11,530,306 to the credit of the Trust Fund, and during the year there were receipts to the amount of £[14,103,260. During the year, therefore, there was in the Trust Fund £[25,633,566, while the expenditure was £[10,190,998, leaving as a credit balance on the 30th June last the enormous sum of £ [ i 5 , 4 4 , 5 2 68 majority of these heads on which the Trust Fund is based should be abolished. If they are not, the time will soon come when they will be abolished by the House, and a better system adopted, so that the Parliament will know what the amount in the Treasury is, how much the Government need to spend, and what balance they will have at the end of the year. Take, for instance, the expenditures on old-age pensions and Fleet construction. I cannot see any reason why these items should be included in the Trust Fund. They could just as well be managed without being in the fund. All that the Treasurer wants is a vote for the year, the same as he takes for anything else._ He should let the House know what he is doing, as he does with regard to railways and other works of construction.

This, I When I tell think, shows the difficulty of ascertaining the amount which is really available. It is hidden away in the Trust Fund. One can find the figures by searching the Budget-papers, and I have found them. At the same time. I found the Loan Account; but if I had not made this search I would not have come across it. I was not aware that in the Loan Account there was a credit balance of £[39,525. Take the Small Arms Ammunition Fund. This is a trading account, in which purchases and sales The continually take place. There was an item °f £[ 77>73 on the last Estimates, and 1 I there was a balance of £[28,863 m the Trust Fund, making a total amount of £[206,594 available for last year. I find an item of £[12,600 on these Estimates, an item of £[152,210 on the General Estimates, and, hidden away in the Trust Fund-no t mentioned anywhere in these figures-a balance of £[89,767, so that there is a total amount of £[254,577 available to the Government for smaU arms ammunition. No honourable member could see the position by a mere inspection of the papers-h e would have to ferret out the information. The amount of money which is available is not, I think, shown as clearly as it should be shown. Then, in regard to the Loan Account, unless one searches the Budget figures, he will not find anything about the Loan Account in the Estimates. Seven hundred thousand, pounds have been borrowed, and of that sum £[660,475 have been spent. That is stated at page 65 of the Budget-papers. It is nowhere shown in the Estimates that there was a balance of £[39,525 in the Loan Fund, and that the Treasurer had s P t £[400,000 in the purchase of en land and the erection of a building in London, £[226,000 on the redemption of South Australian Treasury bills in connection with the Northern Territory, and £[34,476 on the South Australian railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta.

Apparently the staff of the Department is not large enough to enable it to carry out all the works for which Parliament votes money. But the Government should see that money rated by Parliament is spent. The time has arrived when we should have a Works Committee and a works policy. What is No estimates of expenditure the use of voting money if it is not to be spent? Last year there was a flourish of trumpets about the proposal to establish a timber-storing shed, and money was voted for the project, but nothing was spent, and this year we are asked to make another vote. We should have some explanation as to why the work is not carried out. Is not the Department capable of acquiring the necessary land, and constructing buildings for this project? If timber had been bought 'and stored, it would now be seasoning in anticipation of its use. I wish to know what the Department intends to do in regard to the Federal Capital. Competitive designs have been received and dealt with, but, apparently, nothing has been done towards planning the city. The Minister told me that plans could not be drawn until sites had been selected. That is Such a statement moonshine. Plans could be drawn for the accommodation above the basement line of the various buildings. The Minister knows what buildings are needed, and what their capacity must be. Such buildings should be planned above the basement line, and when their sites have been chosen, basements can be built up to suit the plans. A large number of immigrants are now coming to the country, and we should give I ask the employment to all that can be employed to push on with necessary works. In Victoria of late a great many artisans have been out of work, and yet the Home Affairs Department has money which it cannot spend. Apparently there are not enough architects and' overseers. I hope that the Minister will enlarge his staff.

In the stamp-selling room, persons stand at the counters five and six deep; the telegraph despatch room is always f u l l , and the telephone cabinets are always occupied, while many persons wait outside to get connexions. It is a scandal that the Government does not give greater conveniences to the public there. What is necessary is to resume land for the enlargement of the building. The alterations that have been made have bettered things a little, but there is still not enough room. I hope that we shall have a statement as to what is to be done. The Minister of Home Affairs told us last year about the brickworks he is going to provide for, but no preparation for the making of bricks has yet taken place. He was also going to provide lime works, cement works, sewerage works, and underground tunnels for telephone wires; but nothing has been done. Indeed, grass is now growing on streets that have been formed. No doubt the Department's inaction is due to the desire to please the Victorian representatives in Parliament. I again appeal to the Prime Minister to say whether, in his opinion, the time has not arrived, seeing that we are spending so much money on buildings and works generally, to form a Public Works Committee in , this House, the Committee to go through the plans, and see that the works are car^ ried out properly.

We want more than the word of the Minister in this matter.

Some honourable members on the other side referred to experiences in New South Wales, but that was a very unfortunate reference, because public inquiry into the question in that State a few years ago established beyond the shadow of a doubt that political interference had come into play, and that works conducted on the day-labour principle were costing 50, 60, and even 100 per cent, more than they ought to cost.

I wish to say asked the honourable member for Adelaide to withdraw the statement objected to, if he made it. as is alleged by the honourable member for Parramatta. is that the reply I am endeavouring to make to the extravagant utterances of the honorabe member for Wakefield is of a character to rile the honourable member for Parramatta, and with the acuteness characteristic of him, the honourable member seeks to create an impression in another direction in order to lessen the severity of the castigation which he knows the honourable member for Wakefield is deserving of. I come now to another feature of the remarks made by the honourable member for Wakefield, to the effect that supervision, in so far as public works are concerned in the Home ""Affairs Department, and under the Government generally, is of such a character that men are not giving an adequate return for the wages paid to them. The honourable member must know that he is making charges engineers, and, in fact, against men in official positions throughout the Public Service. So far as I understand the situation, every officer in the Government service knows well the policy of the Ministry, and that they are expected to get a fair return from all under them in the execution of their duty. If , as alleged by the honourable member for Wakefield, there are public officers who are not properly supervising the work intrusted to them; if there are officers whose supervision ib insufficient to prevent those under them neglecting their work, it is the bounden duty of the honourable member to tell us who those officers are. It is not the duty of any honourable member to rise in his place in this House and make a general charge to the effect is of such a character that loafers and wasters are. continued in the employment of the Government.

Something has been said about some railway tender in South Australia, in regard to which misrepresentations may be made to the public. It was desired to construct a few miles of railway from Tailem Bend to Brown's Well, and, under the legislation of South Australia, it is always necessary to call for public tenders. The Public Works Department of that State sometimes tenders in competition with private contractors, and there have been times when these departmental tenders have justified the Government in accepting them. that very nicely. of course, when the departmental tenders have not been of such a character as to justify their acceptance. I believe that when the honourable member for Wakefield was a member of the South Australian Parliament, tenders by the officers of the Public Works Department were accepted. cently, when a Labour Ministry was in office in the State Parliament, the departmental tender for this particular few miles of railway was refused, and a private one accepted. charge made. solutely incorrect statement. ference between the two tenders? pounds. was 62 £ per cent. The y ought to chaltender, I believe, was £[150,000, while the private tender was £[80,000 or ,£90,000. Honourable members know that when contractors do not desire to undertake a particular piece of work they make their tender so high as to insure its being rejected, though they never neglect to put in a tender. So it is with the Public Works Department. When the DepartO'MALLEY I am going to ment wishes to undertake a work it tenders at a price that it is believed will be accepted; and, in such circumstances, they I have no doubt that invariably obtain a contract, and the work is carried out to the advantage of all concerned. In other circumstances the Department adopts the method of _ outside contractors, and tenders at a price that I should not they know will not be accepted. Works Department's tender is the Departmental estimate of the cost of the work. there is in the statement made by the honourable member for Wakefield, who ought not to seek to make the public believe that the tender of the Public Works Department is abnormally high, because of the necessity of paying high wages, or because, as alleged by him, the Government can get only loafers and wasters to work for them, while private contractors have the services of men out of whom they can knock a greater amount of work.

This is the statement of the Honorary Minister which I took exception to at the time, and it is quite evident he was not aware of what he was sayingPerhaps the time has arrived when honourable members on the opposite side may be given to understand that, while it is their bounden duty to criticise, and while it is their duty to call the attention of the House and the public generally to anything that has been done of a character that ought not to be done, or to any errors of the Ministry, good, bad, or indifTerent, against a Department, it is idle to tell me yet it is not their duty, under cover of Parliamentary privilege to assert that all the persons working in the Home Affairs Department are loafers and wasters.

No such accusation was made, and it ought not to be attributed to the Opposition by the Honorary Minister. not have risen but for the attitude on this side in relation to the utterances of the honourable member, for Wakefield. .some extent I am not with "" my own people "" on the question. I take it that if charges are made against the administration of a Commonwealth Department, it is the duty of the Ministers concerned to at once give attention to the charges. The can deny the fact; any statement made in that newspaper, reflecting on Departmental administration, should not be passed lightly over. I submit that the honourable member for Wakefield did the right thing, and I take exception to the attack to which he has been subjected by honourable members on this side of the chamber, and to the attempt which was made to howl him down. I desire an investigation into the charges which have been preferred against the day labour system by the Argus newspaper. If those charges be correct, let the existing condition of things be remedied at the 1 earliest possible moment, but if the allegations b'e untrue, let us pin that journal down to a deliberate mis-statement of fact. Because a member of the Opposition deems it his duty to take a certain course of action in the public interest, surely it is not for honourable members upon this side of the chamber to attackhim, to repudiate his utterance, and to attempt to howl him down. I say that it is a wrong thing to do. Even the Minister of Home Affairs himself to-day replied to a question in a manner which did not redound to his credit. When a newspaper like the Argus prefers definite charges that it is afflicted with Chinese leprosy. Such an answer does not afford a solution of the problem which we have to face. The Government must see-especiall y when we are attempting to carry out contracts under the day-labour system-that that system is effective, that the inspectors engaged upon them do their duty, or that they go out, and that men who will not do their work go out with them. It is the duty of the Government and of every Minister to answer the charges made by the Argus, and to prove that they are false. If they cannot do that, they stand condemned. enough for me to know that there was a column of matter in the Argus setting out that men engaged on our public works are in the habit of loafing. that statement. repudiate it. From the Labour stand-point, when a great newspaper prefers charges against a public Department, it is the duty of the Government to demonstrate that they are false.

Argus deliberately affirms that men are leaving their work, although they are paid to do it, that they are drunk at their work, that they refuse to do their duty, and that they simply flout their superior officers. If now asked to approve of the expenditure that be so, the position is a very serious one. Certainly a statement of that character ought to be at once inquired into by the Government. Let us investigate the matter, and justify our officers, who, I hope, are discharging their duties effectively, and at the same time let us redeem the men of the odium which will otherwise attach to them. I know that the daily press are accustomed to cast slurs upon the Labour party. They attack the Government because they desire to show that our methods are not in the best interests of this country. But when they make charges it is the duty of the Government to reply to them with such effectiveness as will sweep them off the face of the earth, at least for some time. I think, too, that some inefficiency has been exhibited in carrying out works in the Federal Territory. I am not satisfied when I find that there was an unexpended vote there last year of £[31,000. I am not satisfied that there ought not to be more money on the Estimates for the Federal Territory for the current financial year. I have a very keen suspicion that the Minister of Home Affairs has been subjected to certain Victorian pressure. I am not unaware that at the recent by-election, while sitting in my room, I heard a member of my own party, who entertains a Victorian prejudice-h e calls himself a Nationalist-sa y mentary etiquette to refer to anything that one hears in one's room. sorry I was about to offend. But I am perfectly sure that certain influences have operated with the Minister of Home Affairs. I sincerely trust that the Government will strive to push to completion the buildQueensland. How can the representatives ings in the Federal Capital. The site has been selected, the design of the city has been approved, and the only thing now rec maining is to put the work in hand as soon as possible, and carry it to completion. -Eve r since I have been a member of this Parliament I have been impressed by the fact that time after time Ministers will vote, will dwell upon its extreme urgency, emphasize the necessity which exists for it being at once proceeded with, and yet, at the end of the year, that vote will be found to be unexpended. For works in Tasmania last year £[17,419 was voted, of which only .£4,000 was expended, and we are of £[11,497 °f the original sum. In other words, not 20 per cent, of the vote was expended. Now, either these works are necessary or they are not. If they are not, they ought not to be submitted to Parliament; if they are, they should be proceeded with, and the money should be expended within the financial year. It is not enough to say that the State officers are in fault. I am sure the Minister of Home Affairs will agree with, me when T say that he has one of the most efficient officers in Australia at' the head of the Works Department in Tasmania, and I am satisfied that any delay which has occurred in pushing forward works there does not lie at his door. If there be one thing which stands out more prominently than another in connection with our public works system, it is the absolute necessity which exists for appointing a permanent Public Works Committee to overlook and report on all important public undertakings. appointed long ago. which I have made, I believe that honourable members on both sides of the Chamber, as well as the members of the State Parliament, are unanimous in their testimony that the New South Wales Public Works Committee has proved of inestimable value, in that it has prevented the useless expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds. If a necessity exists for the appointment of such a body in a State, how much more pressing is that necessity in connection with the public works of the Commonwealth ? For instance, honourable membersmay be asked to approve of a vote for a work in Western Australia or in of, say, Tasmania be expected to know what warrant there is for assenting to a public work in Queensland ? We have either to vote for it blindly, or to oppose it blindly.

There is nothing very mysterious about a report in this connection. There are officers in the Department, and any report submitted by them might be substantiated or otherwise by architects and engineers in outside practice who are competent to express an opinion on this matter. in ' this business; matters of this kind are now reduced to an exact science. The officers in the Department can say exactly what a lineal or cubic yard of excavation should cost in a certain description of ground; so they should be able to tell, to is., what a rod of brickwork ought to cost. They ought to know the cost of material. If they do not possess this knowledge, they should not be in their present position. I believe, from my knowledge of the officers, that they know all these things. Not only should the Minister get a report from the officers of his Department, but he should also have their report corroborated by outside persons.

Let honourable members read the statement of the Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, which appears in to-day's newspapers. The honourable member for Wakefield referred to a railway contract, but spoke on hearsay. Let me give a personal experience. I am not hostile to the Government, nor am I hostile to the day-labour system. As a matter of fact, I am in favour of the day-labour system, because I know the results that can be There is no rule-of-thumb obtained from it. . The last work on which I was engaged before I entered this Parliament was a railway contract, in connection with which I acted as an inspector. Tenders were called for 44 miles of railway in Queensland, and the lowest offer was £[98,000. The line was to be carried out under the joint control of three local authorities, which were borrowing from the Government, and they came to the conclusion that it would be cheaper to employ day labour than to accept the lowest tender. The necessary hands were engaged, and supervisors were appointed. It is the supervision that is generally the weak thing about Government works. Where the supervisors are not men of character, work will always cost more than it should cost. 1 In the case to which I refer, the line was constructed by day labour for £[17,000 less than the lowest tender, the minimum wage paid being 8s. a day, though nearly every man on the job was getting ios. a day or over, and, although the specifications required 720 cubic yards ot ballast to the mile, we provided i,coo cubic yards, put in additional bridges, made all the sidings, and built all the stations needed.

In this House we have very few practical men. 1 do not see one on the other side, though, of course, the honourable member for Fremantle, who is away, is a practical man.

With the exceptions I have named, there are no men in this Chamber competent, in my opinion, to form a Works Committee.

Such a body would have to occasionally visit works in progress, No , they have not. arid this often could not be done with par-. liamentary duties to be attended to.

Mr Cullen, the Chief Engineer for Harbors and Rivers in Queensland, made an official report on the matter some time ago, when the local authority asked the State Government for the loan of the money. In this report he said, amongst other things, that, whilst the breakwater might be built by contract, the viaduct, being a much more important work, and it being necessary for it to be perfectly stable and reliable, should be built by day labour.

314,Mr Bamford,"I believe the samefith has stated that he is going to make a comparison between day labour and contract work by letting a contract for a certain length of railway, and building an -equal length by day labour. I am afraid it is impossible to make a comparison in that way, because no two railways are identical. The country is not alike, sleepers are more difficult to get in one place than another; in one place there is more rock that earthwork; and on one line there are more bridges to build than on another. If the Minister of Home Affairs tried to make a similar comparison here between contract work and day labour, he would be in the same position as the Minister for Works in New South Wales. The attempt would be an utter failure, and would give us no real testimony as to the relative merits of the two systems. should like to remind the honourable member for Swan, who spoke about the amount of money that had to be revoted, that last year the Works Estimates came on very late. Jate in the year, and naturally the Works Estimates were considered still later. Consequently, a lot of work was not finished; but there is no necessity whatever for the Department to wait until the Works Estimates are passed to have the plans and specifications prepared. No case is yet on record of any of these Estimates having been "" turned down "" after being submitted to Parliament; and there is no reason why the Department should not anticipate parliamentary approval of them, and be ready to proceed with the works as soon as the money is voted. even earlier; but the Department could anticipate the vote by Parliament. I am entirely opposed to the present system whereby the Minister of Home Affairs has to depend on the State Public Works Departments to have his works supervised and plans and specifications prepared. The time has now arrived for us to have a Works Department of our own. The honourable member for Lang and the honourable member for Franklin will confirm my statement as to what was going on at Thursday Island only recently. Commission was there, a quarantine station was being built, and a jetty was also being built. The oflicer in charge of the work at the quarantine station was an officer of the Public Works Department of Queensland. [62] That man does not care a button for the Minister of Home Affairs. He is in the employ of the State, and when the State is not working in harmony with the Commonwealth, as is the case with Queensland ancl some of the other States, the State authorities would rather back up their own officer, if he were in conflict with the Minister of Home Affairs, than do the reverse. If the Minister of Home Affairs said to this man, "" Your work is not proceeding satisfactorily,"" he would go to his own Department, which would support him on every occasion. I am not making any reflection on the officer at Thursday Island.. He is an efficient officer; but tbe system is very unsatisfactory, and should De superseded at the earliest moment by the establishment of a Federal Public Works Department, in which our own plans and I specifications will be prepared by our own staff, and our own supervision engaged. The officers in it would be responsible to this Parliament, and no State Parliament should have control over them. I hope the Parliament did not meet t ill Minister of Home Affairs will take into consideration the matter of which I have spoken. I have referred to it here before, but am sorry to say that my words of wisdom have fallen unheeded by him. He takes not the slightest notice of them. He goes on his own way, sometimes rejoicing, and sometimes the reverse. The Argus is flogging him just now, and he does not like it.. If he would take advice that has been tendered to him from this side of the House, as well as from outside, he would possibly give less opportunity for these press criticisms. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [6.1] It is evident from these Public WorksI t might be done Estimates, which have been submitted to us to-day, that the Federal Government is rapidly becoming the largest employer of labour in Australia, if indeed it is not so already. Therefore, it is only prudent and wise that we should survey the manner in which many of our public works are being carried out, especially in. reference to labour conditions. I do not intend to import any heat into this discussion. criticism.

318,Mr Fisher,"We wish to heargoing to advocate its universal adoption. Discrimination and great judgment have to be exercised by those responsible in deciding whether a particular work should be done by contract or by day labour. I know as a fact that many private enterprises are at the present time being carried out by day labour. Proprietors have"" found it advisable, owing to the uncertainty of the labour market, to adopt that method. Indeed, they have been forced to do so, because of the high prices which contractors have to submit in tendering for a work in consequence of the uncertainty of the .labour market, and the liability to strikes. But certainly when day labour is resorted to the Federal Govermnent as the employer ought to obtain guarantees and assurances, firstly, that every effort will be made to secure the services of the best men who may be available; secondly, that they shall be paid well ; and, thirdly, that they shall be expected and requiredto do their duty.

I hope that if Ministers have any suspicion that those conditions are not being complied with in connection with Government work some change will be made. given to that effect already. discredit will be brought upon Commonwealth Departments. with the three points which I have mentioned, I would draw attention to this fact: Whilst, with reference to the permanent hands employed by the Federal Government,. there are qualifications which conduce to the employment of the best men available, there is also a large area of employment within the control of the Federal Government as to which there' is no such guarantee. men who are regarded as outside the pale of the permanent Service, and who come within the category of casuals or exempt hands.

Sir JOHN QUICK Public Service Commissioner has nothing to do with the engaging of casual labour. His task is simply to keep a register. It is supposed that in practice men will be able to get a job by registering their names. That practice, if adhered to, would be to some extent a check. But I have ascertained that in actual practice the Post and 'Telegraph Department and the Home Affairs Department bave been in the habit of engaging hands without reference to the Public Service Commissioner. The result is that unfortunate men whose names have been registered for years in the office of the Public Service Commissioner have been lamentably disappointed.

344,Mr Ozanne,"Why, the honourable memsome explanation or refutation of it, if either be possible. The charge made by the honourable member was based upon an article which appeared, not in the Argus, but in a technical periodical called Building, published in Sydney. It is the Sydney contractors' journal. Some time ago, that journal published an article in which complaint was made that workmen employed by the Department of Home Affairs in connection with the Federal Capital were not giving a fair return for tlieir wages, and that things were at sixes and sevens. The Department denied the accuracy of the charge, and then this journal, it appears, took steps to inquire into the accuracy of its first allegation. A man was sent to the Federal ""Capital to watch what was going on, and to take notes, and, after remaining there for seven months, he made a report to Btdlding, which returned to the attack in the article quoted by the honourable member for Wilmot. In tliat article, the following passage occurredWe can now unhesitatingly say, and are prepared to prove, that the day labour system of work at the Federal Capital site is a public scandal. There is no system, but a "" jumbled order of things, disgracing the administration of the Home Affairs Department, and retarding progress generally at the site."" The work is not only snail like, the men are not only at the lowest stage of demoralization as regards honest labour, but the work itself is a disgrace to good construction. That is the charge. I have no personal acquaintance with it, but I heard this statement read, and was somewhat staggered by it. I waited to hear a refutation, or an explanation, from the Department, but none has been given; and, as we have been challenged to give some basis for our complaint, I have read this extract, and invite the Minister to make an explanation. I am not making any personal charge against the Ministei. These things may be going on behind his back. going on. some official, authentic report in explanation of these extraordinary charges.

I should like to know what precautions are taken to secure the best men for the work, and I should like some assurance that men are not appointed because of political opinion or political favouritism. It is quite possible that, if men obtain employment because of political favouritism, they will not be so amenable to discipline as would others who got these appointments as the result of ordinary competitive examination or some test as to qualification. member recognise that he has quoted from a biased source? paper, but I think it would be well to follow up the allegations.

If these things are being perpetrated at the present time, it is no answer to say that they were going on in times past.

I do not think that one Minister, or a Department having its head office in Melbourne, can undertake to carry out the supervision of that great enterprise so far removed as it is from the Seat of Government. I think the time has arrived when we should seriously consider whether the carrying out of the works connected with the Federal Capital ought not to be placed in the hands of an independent Commission. The InterState Commission, when created, might be intrusted with a portion of the responsib i l it y ; but, in any case, we should have some Board or Commission like the Railway Commissioners of the several States to deal with our great public works. It is impossible that the present system should be tolerated mucb longer. for the Minister of Home Affairs to look after these great works, involving the expenditure of millions of money. just now commencing expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital, the transcontinental railway, and Northern Territory, and it would be money well spent to call into existence a Public Works Commission, authorized to supervise these great undertakings, and instructed, as are the Railway Commissioners of the different States, to carry them out on business principles, and as directed by Parliament, to the best advantage, .free from all political influence. Parliament, those charged with carrying it out should be freed from all political influence, dictation, or interference. Minister or member of Parliament should be allowed to send letters, or give instructions, to those intrusted with the carrying out of these great works to put on men who might not be able to pass an examination or test as to their fitness. Such a regulation would relieve members of Parliament and Ministers of a very great deal of trouble. I know, from my own experience in the State Parliament of Victoria, that one of the greatest worries of public life was the difficulty of dealing with a number of deserving persons who were in search of work. orable to do what he could to assist persons residing in his electorate to secure work, and it. might happen in such circumstances that the best men were not always employed in the Government Service. Conditions should be imposed which should secure the employment of the best men available for any work undertaken. This should apply, not only to permanent employees of the Government, but to casual employees also. Every man in Australia should be afforded the opportunity to comply with the necessary test to secure his employment as a permanent or temporary servant of the public, without fear, favour, or affection. If , when we launch these great Commonwealth undertakings, employment upon them is only to be obtained through political influence and favouritism, there will be a carnivalI will not say of political corruption-hu t of errors and disasters which will recoil upon those who are responsible for it .

Under such conditions there can be no reason for the failure of that system. time? I take it that the Minister will make proper inquiries into the charges which have been made by the Argus newspaper. sary information. newspapers can obtain information of sufficient importance to warrant it in making such grave accusations, surely the Minister will experience no difficulty in ascertaining the true position. If his officers report that to that undertaking. If the project wereconditions are not what they ought to be, it will be his dutyto make a change. As far as the great body of men employed in our public Departments are concerned, I hold that they are good men. I do not believe that there is a scintilla of justificaof action is entirely unnecessary. Doestion for the charges which have been hurled against the employees under our' day-labour system. My own opinion is that they spring from political bias. In regard to certain works which are in progress in the Federal Territory, the contractors realize that they have been driven to their last ditch, and consequently they will neglect no opportunity of ridiculing the day-labour system with a view to rendering it unpopular. If the Government do their duty they will have an inquiry conducted into the works which are being carried out by them. There can only be one man responsible for any shortcomings ou the part of the employees, and that is the officer who is in charge of any particular work. If he fails to do his duty he should be dealt with. The officers in charge of our public undertakings should see that fair -value is received for the wages which are paid. If there were anything to justify ail inquiry being made into the methods which are being pursued upon our public works outside of what I have suggested, I should unhesitatingly favour the adoption of that course. Buti f we were to take notice of every statement which is published in the press, and to investigate its truth and falsity, there would be no end to our inquiries. It frequently happens that these statements are made by irresponsible persons. Some honourable members have contended that the time has arrived when we ought to appoint a Public Works Committee upon the lines of the New South Wales Public Works Committee. Personally, I do not think that it has. I fail to> see what works we could remit to such av body. If we are going to refer to a Public"" Works Committee every Commonwealth 1 work which involves an expenditure of more than £20,000, the result will be an endlesswaste of time. The Committee would have to visit various parts of Australia, and the chances are that twelve months wouldelapse before it arrived at a decision in regard to any particular undertaking. InNew South Wales the position is very different. Our engineers and surveyors have already reported upon the transcontinental railway, and a similar remark is applicable to the proposed line from Oodnadatta toPine Creek. We are practically committed referred to a Public Works Committee that body would visit all the State capitals andV the Northern Territory, and its inquiry would probably extend over a period of two years. Such acourse anybody seriously suggest that worksin the Federal Territory, involving am expenditure of more than £20,000, should' be delayed pending the decision of a Public Works Committee ? We have heard a good deal about the cost of day labour ,as compared with the contract system, and yet it is now suggested that we should appoint a. Public Works Committee under which considerable cost would be heaped up without any justification. There is all the differencein the world between the position of New South Wales and that of the Commonwealth. We have to deal only with the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital. Already we have a design for the Federal City, and when once Parliament decides that a public building shall be erected there, we shall merely have to determine its location. If such a'project were remitted to a Public Works Committee delay would be inevitable. It has been urged that under that system we should exercise control over the expenditure. As a matter of fact we should exercise no control whatever. of whether a work was justifiable or not? Nobody will say that the public buildingsin the Federal Territory are not necessary. We know that most of them are required' within a certain time. I take it that the design of the Capital City which has been, approved will assist us to decide where-",47,Moloney Th E Govern Ask Parliament To Authorize A Particular

If such a body were appointed, it would have no control whatever over the expenditure, because it would merely recommend whether it was desirable to undertake a public work or not. Parliament would then be called upon to approve or disapprove that work, and if it were approved, the Minister of Home Affairs would have control of it just as he has to-day. I believe that the day-labour system has come to stay, and that any comparison between it and the contract system will work out in its favour. In New South Wales the Railway Commissioner has been carrying out a lot of work by day labour, and up t ill twelve months agoI have not the later figuresi t was conclusively proved that that system was cheaper than was the contract system. The result has been that almost the whole of the railways constructed there have been carried out by means of day labour. using the day-labour system on their own buildings. proper supervision better work is obtained under that system than under the contract system, and without any additional expenditure. The Minister can make the necessary inquiries, and, if he finds any grounds for the statements made from time to time in regard to the system, he should take proper means to have any mistakes or abuses rectified, ancl see that the system is given, a fair and square trial. If he does that, I shall feel quite satisfied as to the result. orable member for Hunter has assumed, I think quite in error, that the discussion initiated by the honourable member for Dalley hinges upon the question of contract versus day labour, but he has introduced quite a new phase, I tliink. able member for Dalley, in commencing this interesting debate the note which sounded throughout this chamber in a very wholesome fashion indeed, and I have to compliment him upon the courage with which he rose to speak in the way he did. the honourable member for Herbert, as well. perience of what it is to stand up in a party, most of them ""hostile in regard to a partiConcular point, and to speak one's opinion freely on a question before the House. The honourable member for Dalley pointed out that this was not an ordinary charge, not a mere casual criticism that appears day by day ancl week by week in an ordinary newspaper, but a much more serious matter. Any honourable member with a sense of proportion must realize that the 'charge which was made in the Argus, and indicated by the honourable member for Dalley, is of a kind which no Government with any regard for its own credit can afford to ignore. It is all very well for the Minister of Home Affairs, in the belief that he has an unbreakable phalanx behind him, to pooh-pooh any inquiries in connection with matters of which he has charge,or to refuse to give information which honourable members are perfectly entitled to get, but it is quite another thing for the Minister to say, "" We are going to take no notice of such charges, and we refuse to see anything in them."" The cliarge indicated here by the honourable member for Dalley is a definite one. We all know-and I think that many honourable members on the other side have an uneasy feeling in this connection-that public Under work under this Government is not' being carried on in the way in which it ought to be. No one can go about with his eyes and ears open without being made aware of the fact that there is a good deal of manipulation of work which is not altogether in the interests of the country. The honourable member for Herbert spoke of the necessity for supervision in carrying out public works. There is no doubt that with day labour effective supervision is required; but something more is wanted. The honourable member pointed out that when he was supervising certain works he was able to say, "" I do not care anything for the Minister or for the Government. I am here in a position which requires me to perform certain duties, and those duties I The honorintend to perform."" Is that the po'sition with regard to the supervision of Commonwealth work at present? Is it not a fact that at least the Minister of Home Affairs goes over the heads of the responsible officers of his Department, and does things without consideration for them, and without consulting them? Is not that a state of affairs likely to bring about a good deal of demoralization? Is it likely that supervisors or inspectors will assert themselves as they should do when they know that perhaps the men can go past them and get the I have had some exear of the Minister in a way which they cannot hope to do, and that they will not",48,Moloney Th E Govern Ask Parliament To Authorize A Particular

That is what we demand, and what the Government. I think, in all reason, ought to concede. In their own interests, they should make an inquiry, because, if they stand up in the attitude of the Minister of Home Affairs, jeering and sneering at any suggestion of -this kind, they may rest assured that a strong suspicion will be created in the public mind that there is something which makes them afraid to grant an inquiry. The best thing they can do, I think, is to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Dalley in the spirit in which it was made, and satisfy the country as to whether these charges are groundless or wellfounded. Almost every year I have had a grumble at a matter to which nearly every honourable member has referred in connection with the Works Estimates, and that is the re-voting of sums. I clo not want to accuse the Government in this respect, because re-voting has been chronic since the inception of Federation. It is rather a defect of the system under which we are working than a thing which could be laid to the charge of any Government. I notice, however, that there is a greater tendency towards re-voting with some of the States The than with others. Apparently in some States the works are carried out much more thoroughly and much more expeditiously than in other States. Western Australia seems to be one of the worse off of the States in this respect. place, as the honourable member will find if he takes the trouble to pay us a visit. I can assure him that we shall be able to satisfy, him that it is one of the most Commonwealth. There is something wrong with the system of carrying out works in Western Australia for which moneys are voted. I want the Government to ascertain if there is a defect which operates to the disadvantage of Western Australia even more than it appears to do in regard to some of the otlier States. have better members. have a greater number of members. I do not know that quantity means .quality, but, no doubt, in politics there is great virtue in numbers. Although we have been told that a grand up-to-date post-office is to be erected in Perth, the sum made available for the work this year is only £5,000. A much larger sum might reasonably have been provided for the year's expenditure. I noticed a short time ago that some of those who have properties on the site of this building were making improvements of a somewhat permanent character. That does not indicate a desire on the part of the Government to hurry on the work. In view of the character of the building, £5,000 is a ridiculously small amount to provide for expenditure upon it in twelve months, ancl I should like some explanation from the Minister as to whether this is all that will be spent during the current financialyear.

To my mind, it is not the duty of the Minister to attend personally to the numerous details connected with such a work as the construction of the transcontinental railway, for instance. A Public Works Committee would attend to a vast amount of detail, and would give to the Parliament more information than is at present obtainable. A great deal of the work of the Imperial Parliament is done by Committees, which supplement the work of Ministers, and enable the Houses to keep in better touch with the multifarious details of a Committee to examine the records ? what I may call sub-administration than is possible under our system. the United States of America. we boggle along very much in the dark regarding public works under construction. The Minister has introduced an innovation of some value in a circular that he issues to members monthly. That enables us to keep in touch, in some degree, with what is taking place in his Department, but even he will admit that we get only a vague and general idea from it of the work that is being done. I do not suggest that there should be a great amount of printing, but a Committee would always be in a position to throw a flood of light on any question of construction or expenditure. ister has given us to understand that he has antroduced a system by which we can know exactly how much is spent on every public work.

It is surprising how near an expert can get to the actual cost of a work by estimating it in advance.

Such an estimate ought to be made in connection with every public work. be put on record, and with them statements ' of the actual cost incurred, so that honourable members may know whether the cost of a work has exceeded fhe estimate. I suggest that the information should be made available to honourable members who desire it. obtain any information they desire from the Treasury. that would supervise expenditure would be a good innovation. Although the Prime Minister tells us that we can get from the Treasury all the information we require, I have found it difficult to obtain anything like detailed information regarding many Government works, and, no doubt, other honourable members have been in the same position. I hope that the result of the debate will be improved methods of dealing with public works, and thus a better, more efficient and economical service, together with a system which will enable honourable members to know exactly what is being doneI have been greatly surprised at times at the tone of this debate.

Whenever my request for information has been legitimate and reasonable, it has never been denied or refused by a Minister or by officers. I take it that if other honourable members are prepared to show the same energy, they will be placed in exactly the same position as I am. The day-labour question is not a new matter. It is an old friend, and is often brought up simply for party purposes. It has been raised in connection with nearly every Department that has been run by the State of Victoria. If any State has been subject to criticism on account of it, Victoria, has been, especially in regard to the Newport Workshops. The statement was made over and over again, that, owing to Government supervision and the Government stroke, the action of the Government in taking full charge of the construction of locomotives for the Victorian railways was costing the taxpayers a considerable sum: but investigations made by an independent tribunal 'proved that the locomotives and other machinery were being turned out at the Government workshops at a far cheaper rate than any private individual could possibly do the work for. I regret to have to stale that trie Government of Victoria have been, in recent years, so short-sighted as to permit to sumcient. be sent out of the country a large amount of work which should have teen carried out in our own workshops. The Victorian taxpayers are losing to-day no less than £150,000 through the action of the Government in sending for engines outside of Australia. have been saved if the engines had been made in the Government workshops. kept in the country. be kept in the country as well. The whole thing is a scandal. It arose simply because certain officials have a tendency to discover, all of a sudden, that they require certain things constructed, allow too limited a time for local people to put in a tender, and then make that an excuse for going beyond the bounds of the Commonwealth in.order to get what is wanted. I hope and trust that the present Government will not be guilty of sending out of Australia for machinery and materials that could be made in Australia by our own workmen. gather that some dredges are to be obtained by the Defence Department, I presume, to deepen the approaches to naval bases. I understand-and I hope that the Minister who represents the Minister of Defence in this Chamber will take note of this matter -that in connection with those dredges the officials of the Defence DepartmentI presume the information refers to them-ar e allowing too limited a time for Australian manufacturers to tender for the work of making the dredges in Australia.

If tenderers in other parts of the world are given sufficient time to tender, surely those in Australia are being allowed ter knows that' when questions have been, put in the House on the subject, the invariable reply has been that the ""articles wererequired in a hurry, and that local tendererscould not comply with the conditions. That amount of money could Surely, when we know what is required, we ought to give local makers ample opportunity to put in tenders for the work, and,, what is more, to secure it, and have it done by Australian workmen.

It is true that we must have defence as an insurance against aggression, and for the protection of the lives and property of the citizens of the Commonwealth. But I should lie inclined to lessen the votes for naval and military purposes, if by so doing we could increase the amounts voted for post-offices, the construction of telephone lines, and other services useful to the comniunity. include rifle ranges? able that rifle ranges should be constructed. areas ? acquisition of land for that purpose. It appears to me that the Commonwealth Government are purchasing an enormous amount of property. They are purchasing manoeuvre areas in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania. What with the Northern Territory, the Federal Capital, and the purchases being made in this and other directions, the Commonwealth Government will soon be the owner of an immense amount of land in this country. Another topic that has been introduced in the course of the debate has reference to the appointment of a Public Works Committee. We have a Railways Standing Committee in Victoria, and a Public Works Committee in New South Wales. I am under the impression that like Committees have been appointed by other State Parliaments. ment with the honourable member for Hunter in opposing this idea as far as the Commonwealth is concerned. Having regard to the great extent of Australia, and the fact that the Commonwealth has to carry out works in every part, it appears to me that if we appointed a Committee to look after the 0 public works that are required north, south, east, and west, we should have to give leave of absence for a session or two to its members. They would seldom be here at all. difficulty in regard to public works. It is impossible for one Minister properly to supervise all the branches of the Service whicli are under the control of the Department of Home Affairs. In my opinion, It appears the functions of the Department will have to be divided. The work of the Minister should be shared by some other member of the Government-probabl y by an Honorary Minister. But to appoint a Public Works Committee would be to establish an excrescence on this Parliament. There are too many excrescences in connection with the State Parliaments, and I do not think that we require anything of the kind here. ber think that the Victorian Standing Committee on Railways has been a success? very small patch of Australia. What might be advisable in Victoria, or New South Wales is not even possible in regard to the whole Commonwealth of Australia. in Australia. But a Public Works Committee would be found entirely unworkable when it was sought"" to' apply it to the Commonwealth. At present we are overloading the Minister of Home Affairs. He has practically four Departments under his control. It is absolutely impossible for any one man to look after all these concerns with credit to himself and satisfaction to the country. staff. and his staff can, of course, help him considerably. But, nevertheless, the work is too much for one Minister to do. I am a. stickler for having everything, manufactured in Australia that can possibly be done here. I observe that a number of boats are to be built for the Defence and Customs DepartButI am in agreements. I hope that these vessels will be built in Australia. There are docks and ship-builders in Sydney and Melbourne who can carry out such works as well as they can be done in any part of the world. I trust, therefore, that the Government will not send the work out of the Commonwealth. I must compliment the Minister of Home Affairs on this as on other matters -that , notwithstanding that at times the strongest of pressure has been brought tobear upon him to give orders to foreign Undoubtedly we have arrived at a firms, he has resisted them, and insisted upon locally-made articles being used.

[8.42] -Whil e I sympathize cordially with the Minister of Home Affairs in having to bear the brunt of the attacks in connection with a great deal of the expenditure proposed in the Works Estimates, I would remind him that he is singled out for this distinction because he happens to be the Minister in charge of the Department responsible for the spending of the money on public works. Criticism of the manner in which work is carried on must necessarily lie brought under his notice. But it does not necessarily mean that the attacks are levelled against himself. That will be determined by his own attitude. The object of these*criticisms is to bring matters under the notice of the Government in the hope that works will be carried out in a proper manner in the future. It is also hoped that if a certain section of workers have not been honestly doing a fair day's work, and that as a result of their slackness discredit has been brought upon the administration of the Department, steps will be taken to put an end to that state of affairs. pliment Hunter and the honourable member for Dalley on the speeches they have made in this connection. It is a pleasure to the Opposition to hear such a healthy note being sounded occasionally from the Ministerial side of the House, and it inspires us with the belief that the ultimate regeneration of honourable members opposite may not be regarded as absolutely hopeless. discussion from the Ministerial side seems to have centered largely round the question of day versus contract labour, I may say at once that I have not heard any honourable member on this side of the House championing contract as against day labour, nor do I know that any member of the Opposition has a prejudice against day labour. All that we contend is that in connection with public works that are carried out by day labour, the interests of the' public should be safeguarded by seeing that a fair day's work is given for the pay received out of .the public funds. I am glad that at least some honourable members opposite are in agreement with us in this regard. It is a pleasure to listen to the honourable member for Hunter, because, when he rises to speak, he has generally something sensible to say to the House. As to the charges that have been made by the Argus. I would remind the Committee that it is not the business of tbe Opposition to try to prove them; it is their duty only to bring them under the notice of the Minister, and to ask that he shall look into them if he has not already done so. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Hunter, that the Minister should send his own officers to make a personal investigation of these works and to see that everything is proceeding satisfactorily, ought certainly to be adopted. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the charges are false; but we have to remember that they are not made by an irresponsible journal. The instances cited are so specific in character and so circumstantial in their nature as to suggest that information has been obtained from inside departmental sources, and that they have not been put forward merely as kites flown for the purpose of eliciting information, and on the off chance that something may be wrong. We see in the newspapers day after day letters drawing attention to the same sort of thing, and inviting Ministers to inspect specific works detailed in those letters. In view of all these circumstances there is I must comreasonable ground for an investigation by the honourable member for an unbiased non-political committee if the Minister himself is not prepared to make a personal inquiry. Such an investigation should be made in the interests of honest workmen employed by the Commonwealth. I am not one of those who oppose day labour, nor am I prepared to believe all that contractors are prepared to say about day labourers. We know that As the there is a certain element of self-interest behind a great deal that may be said on that side, but making due allowance for exaggerations that may be prompted by self interest, it seems to me that these statements, made by one of the most responsible newspapers in Australia, are of such a. serious character that they cannot be made light of. Coming from such a source, the least the Government can do to clear the atmosphere, and also to remove any stigma that may rest upon honest workmen, is to appoint a Committee to investigate the charges. If it is found that there are employed in connection with Commonwealth -works men who are not giving a fair return",54,Smith O R Manoeuvre Rich Patch All The Same
453,Mr W. Elliot Johnson (Lang),"for the money they receive, they should be weeded out, and men who will be more honest in their service-an y number of whom, I am sure, may be obtained in this country-shoul d take their places. It is not fair to the great body of good men employed that they should have to suffer in repute through the few whose conduct has been made the subject of such strong press condemnation. That unsatisfactory workmen are employed, if not on Commonwealth works, at least in' connection with State employment, is shown by certain action which has been taken by the Minister of Public Works for New South Wales, and what is happening in connection with State employment may very reasonably be expected to occur in connection with Commonwealth employment, unless proper supervision is enforced by the Minister standing behind his overseers. It is alleged, at all events by a responsible newspaper, that a certain measure of malingering, a certain amount of loafing, of drunkenness, and what is known as the ca'-canny system of working is going on, and it is reasonable to believe that there may be something in these charges. the following extract from an official letter which has been sent by Mr W. J. Hannan, Under-Secretary of Works in New South Wales, on behalf of Mr Griffith., Minister of Public Works, to the executive of different unions in that StateIn a service such as the Public Service of this early stages of development, I may refer Stateand"" Commonwealth"" might very well be substituted for the word "" State""-carrying out large public woiks over an immense area, ancl employing large ancl increasing numbers of men, it must happen in the ordinary course of business that a considerable proportion of these will be found, from some cause or another, unsatisfactory, and be removed from the service. In almost every case the workman so dismissed considers that he has a grievance, which he very properly brings before his union. Up to the present some of the unions have made it a practice, as a matter of course, to support the claim of their member so dismissed without serious investigation. quently happens that a workman is dismissed for carelessness or incompetency, and such workman's cause is championed by his union because he happens to be a good fellow and a good unionist, whereas the Minister requires that he should be a good workman. The following facts are illustrative of the methods to which, in this regard, Mr Griffith takes exception :-The secretarv of a union telephoned to the Department, alleging that two of its members had been paid at a shilling per day below the proper rate. Inquiries were instituted, and papers hunted up. A long correspondence with the officer in charge of the work ensued, with the final result that Ur. W. Elliot Johnson. it was ascertained that one of the two men was never employed on the works and the other had been paid the f u l l rate. It is probable that, counting lengthy interviews between officers of the union and high-salaried officers of this Department, the time involved in making investigations and conducting correspondence, looking up documents and receipts, together with the amount paid for telegrams, the cost to the. State might have been anything up to ^50 for the investigation of what was, after a l l , a "" mare's nest."" That is a fairly strong indictment. that the Minister of Public Works in New South Wales is anxious that public works shall be carried out effectively? tainly it does; but it shows something more, too. It shows that all is not as it should be in connection with State day-labour work, and there is need for Ministerial firmness. That is what is wanted here also. The point is that we have in this official letter the important admission by the Minister that the unions themselves are intervening for the purpose of securing the reinstatement of men who have been dismissed without taking the trouble to investigate such cases. done it with me. a statement made, not by a newspaper or any irresponsible party outside, but by the New South Wales Minister of Works. As a further example of what we may come to if this kind of thing is not checked in the honourable members to the notorious Fitzroy dock scandal ancl to the Prince Alfred hospital scandal in New South Wales. As honourable members are no doubt aware, Royal Commissions had to be appointed to investigate some of these things. I. have before me the evidence taken by a Royal Commission that inquired into the Fitzroy dock scandal, and I warn the Minister of Home Affairs that what happened in that case may occur ih connection with Commonwealth public works if he is not very careful in the administration It freof his Department. We may yet be faced with scandals which may require investigations of a similar character. I quote the followingThe evidence taken before tlie Royal Commission shows that 011 occasions when it has been necessary to reduce hands political influence has been used upon the Superintendents to reinstate men.

I do not say that it is, but we hear references to it on the trams and in the trains, and, in addition, we have had a specific declaration on the subject on the authority of a reputable newspaper, which would not, I think, permit the use of its columns to lightly make unfounded charges of such a serious nature as those contained under the heading of "" The Man on the Job.""

However, honourable members can look up the Commission's report for themselves. The evidence taken by the Commission shows what is possible under the day-labour system if it is not properly supervised. I do not say anything against the system. As a matter of fact, I am a firm believer in it, but with it there should be effective supervision. I realize that inspectors, foremen, and gangers may easily become unpopular by insisting upon men doing a fair day's work. Where there is even a small percentage of the men engaged upon a job who want to loaf, and an inspector, foreman, or ganger insists that they shall do as other men, a fair day's work, for the wages paid them, the malcontents are likely to get such [63] a man "" set,"" to use a popular expression, and to give him a very uncomfortable time by processes which are very well known to my honourable friends opposite. ber tell us, approximately, how many decades old his last quotation was ? only of comparatively recent date.

I believe that the condiI do not say that we tion of things then existing has since been set right, but we do not want to develop that kind of thing in connection with Commonwealth work, and in order to prevent it very inception. We should let it be understood that while the Commonwealth Government are prepared to pay the highest wages for the work they require to be done, they will insist that a fair return shall be given for the money, which has. to come out of the taxpayers' pockets, and largely out of the pockets of the wage-earners themselvesThat must not be forgotten. Any loafing upon a Commonwealth work means a fraud upon fellow-workers, who have to find about 75 per cent, of the taxation out of which this money has to be paid. I pass now to the question of the building which is being erected for tbe Treasury Department in Melbourne. I have raised my voice before against what I consider wholly unwarrantable expenditure on buildings of a permanent character in Melbourne. We are spending huge sums of money, chiefly in Melbourne, which should be spent on permanent buildings of tory. I say that the time is coming when it will be necessary for representatives of New South Wales, no matter on which side they sit, to band themselves together and stand up for the rights of the State under the Federal compact. I believe we shall have the support of some honourable members from the other Statesi f we do so. Far too much money is being spent by the Commonwealtli in Victoria, and particularly in Melbourne. I attribute this largely to the fact that the Federal Parliament meets in Melbourne, and the sooner we get away from the influence of Melbourne, its press, and politicians, and get into the Federal Capital, the better it will be for everybody cpncerned.

Will the documents and records in the Department refute it and other charges? if the Government make no attempt to refute them, they must stand, and we are justified in telling our constituents that these things exist, and that under the cegis of the Labour Government 30 per cent, of the public money is being wasted and squandered because the party in power represent those who are employed J in these works. It is the business of the Government to disprove the charges, and, failing an adequate disproof, we are justified in assuming that they are true. Certainly, that will be my attitude. when he is able to refute an unjust charge is only too ready to do so. It is when a man is not able to refute a charge that he shrinks and shrivels up, and looks ashamed of himself.

I Nothing more damaging has ever come under my notice. That statement is made, not by a nondescript journal, but by a journal of known reputation in Victoria. It deliberately levels a charge against the administration of the Public Departments of the Commonwealth. The position will undoubtedly be grasped by the public of Australia where they see charges of this nature levelled against those in whom they have had confidence and whom they returned to power on 13th April two years ago. They will now say, "" This is a serious thing that has come to pass. The cry of the Labour party at the last election was, ' Give us a trial.' They have had their trial, and this is the way they have justified it . "" have listened with some degree of pleasure to the honourable member for Echuca, because I never thought he had so much of the pugilistic element in his composition as he has shown to-night. He has told the Committee that he disapproves of the expenditure of money in the Northern Territory, but he bases his disagreement on the smallness of the population there, and not on the necessities of the Territory or the danger to Australia of its emptiness. This' large Aus1 tralian "" bases his opposition upon something that he cannot remedy, and refuses to encourage the Government to spend money in order to make the Territory fit for occupation by white men, and so help to remove the danger that is alleged to exist in that part of the continent. I cannot see the logic of his contention. I take it that if there were a large population there, he would be prepared to spend millions, but he knows, as well as I do, that we cannot get a large population into the Northern Territory without spending money. We shall have to watch what is done there in order to see whether the money is spent wisely or not. 1 desire to compliment the Government ori the progressive policy embodied in these' Estimates with regard to the expansion of the telegraphic and telephonic systems, and with regard also to improvements that are to be made to a very large degree in the post-offices of the Commonwealth. I have, never since I have been a member of Parliament, seen Estimates presented which have shown so markedly that the Government had the courage to do the right thing in a proper way. The Postal Department has been starved from the beginning of Federation, and even before, and I am pleased that at last a solid attempt is being made to remove the disabilities that hope the Minister of Home Affairs will see, not only that the money is spent, but that it is spent well, and that the post offices that are to be built are constructed with a due regard to the exigencies of a growing population, and hygienic conditions, while seeing that the internal arrangements are such as to enable economies to be effected in management, and supervision improved. By these means, both the public and the men who serve the public will be made more contented. Any man can spend money, but to spend money wisely requires keen supervision and a keen determination to get the best value for it. Those of us who represent country districts will be delighted to know that, so far as concerns telegraphic and telephonic facilities, although all the money available last year was not spent, largely, I believe, on account of the scarcity of labour, and partly on account of the scarcity of material owing to labour disruptions in other lands, the money is nevertheless there to spend this year, and that we are likely to have sufficient labour in Australia to enable us to fulfil our obligations in that regard. 1 am proud to see that money has been placed on the Estimates, so that it cannot be said that Parliament has not been liberal in respect to giving the Government money to provide facilities in country districts. The telephone is the greatest civilizer at our command. It brings people together who would otherwise be far apart. It is an economizer of time. By its means the man in the back-blocks is brought into close juxtaposition with the man in the city. It is the means of saving money. It is often the means of saving lives. It helps to preserve health. The extension of these facilities in the country is the most useful work which the Government can take in hand, as every telephone line that we construct adds to the comfort, the welfare, and the happiness oi the community. I am in the happy position o* being able to acknowledge that this Goveianient are doing things more rapidly than they have ever before been done by any Government in Australia-Stat e or Federal.

But we certainly do need some kind of supervisory body or Committee of inquiry. If we had had such a Committee, many of the things which have been done in the Commonwealth would have been avoided, and money would have been saved. Take the money that was spent in the alteration of the Mail Branch at the Sydney General Post Office. That money would never have been expended if evidence had been taken beforehand as to the wisdom of the proposed alteration. The discomfort that has been caused to the men employed would have been avoided, and the disorganization that has resulted would not have happened. cannot go on, it seems to me. is a lack of originality on the part of our permanent officers that is injurious to the Commonwealth.

They are unable to comply with the conditions which the people require to-day. to initiate a policy. posed to know how to improve existing conditions, and unless they are competent to meet the requirements of the country they are not fit for their positions.

No matter whether it lae in the Public Works Department, the Postal Department, or even the Defence Department, we find a lack of originality all along the line. of their duties as though they were mere automata, instead of reasoning beings. are kept down. The trouble is that men have risen more because of seniority than by merit. The system of seniority which undoubtedly prevails has resulted in the putting of round pegs into square holes until we have practically everything filled with that which does not fit. There is in vogue a system under which, just as a man has obtained a thorough hold of the work of his Department, and is able to give to it some of his own individuality, his seniority entitles him to be appointed to a vacancy in another branch, of which he [<54] knows nothing. He goes from a branch of the Service for which he is most fitted to another branch of whose work he knows nothing. There he has again to learn his work from juniors; and so the system goes on. Under it, men are placed, not where they will give the best service, but in positions mapped out for them under the principle of promotion by seniority which is largely controlling our Service, and controlling it in the most injudicious and injurious manner. This has prevented progress throughout the Service. Under such a system we have men who are constantly learning their business instead of teaching others. The standard of the highest man is below what it ought to be, and as every man under him has to keep below it, the whole standard of the Service is reduced. I am pleased to be able to compliment the Government on having made a start in New South Wales, at all events, to take Federal works out of the hands of State officers, and to establish an independent Commonwealth Works Department in that State. That is a step in the right direction. Whether it should extend throughout the States, I am not in a position to say, but I certainly think it is a proper course to follow, seeing that the Public Works Department of New South Wales has proved, in a general sense, that it has no sympathy with the work that it has had to perform for the Federation. Federal works are with it a secondary consideration. If the State requires the services of the officers of the Department, Federal works must be set aside. otherwise. for the Commonwealth-se e what delay it involves Then, again, for want of time, Men move in the performance proper thought cannot always be given by State officers to Federal works, and plans that are ill-digested and inappropriate are often thrown down to the Commonwealth Government as the best that can be done for them. works cost more money. tion of buildings that are ill-adapted for the purposes for_ which they are required.
