0,"House Of Representatives. Friday, 26 March, 19s0. Took The Chair At 11 A.m., And Read Prayers. Mr J, H. Catts (Cook) [11.1]","I rise to a question of privilege. Last night, Whether honourable members agree or disafter (he adjournment of the debate on the War Gratuity Bill, I asked for, und obtained, the leave of the House to give a notice of motion for to-day. Before doing.so, I had consulted Mr Speaker as to whether I should be in order at that stage in asking for leave to give notice for to-day, and he informed me that I would be in order. ""Vy""hen the adjournment of the debate had been carried, be therefore called on me, and, having obtained leave, I gave notice that I would move to-day for an instruction to the Committee on the Bill. But after I had read out my notice of motion, MT . Speaker ruled it out of order. I now put it to honourable members that, when an honourable member gives notice of motion, it is not for Mr Speaker to rule the motion out of order. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) has, time after time, given notice of motions affecting matters which he thinks ought to be discussed, and those notices have gone on to the business paper. If Mr Speaker had ruled any of the motions out of order when notice was given of them, and had declared that they would not be put on the notice-paper would have been a TOW. But Mr Speaker ber wishes to divert attention to them has not done that. MrJ . H . CATTS Mr Speaker has honourable members on his side. not the right to decide, at the time when notice is given of it, whether a motion is what the honourable member's grievance is. or is not in order; the proper time at which to say that it is not in order, should able member desires that his' followers if not be so, is when it has been called on shall vote on the motion of privilege on for discussion. Mr Speaker could' say, party grounds, and not pay regard to its when my motion was called on, that it substantial merits. He was present last was out of order, and could not be disnight when I obtained leave to give cussed, and the House would then have notice of motion, and when I gave such the right?' to dissent from that ruling if notice. it thought fit. But MT. Speaker has no right to rule out a motion when notice of the intention to move it has been given, and before it has been moved. By reason of what occurred, I propose to move-r That, in the opinion of this House, Mr Speaker has infringed the privileges of honourable members under the Standing Orders byruling out of order a notice of motion given openly in the House after leave of the House had been obtained, and before such notice had been moved, thus preventing auch notice coming before the House. agree with the motion of which I gave notice is altogether beside the question. WhatI am asking them to decide is whether the ruling out of order of motions when notice has been given of them, and before they are called on for discussion, is to become the established practice of this House. The whirligig of time brings changes. Honourable members opposite may very shortly be sitting on this side of the Chamber. I have seen these lightning changes occur in this Parliament within the space of a few hours. No matter where an honourable member sits, and no matter how humble may be bis position in the House, he has, as the representative of an electoral division, certain Tights and privileges, and these should be jealously guarded by honourable members at laTge. out what disability you are under. Mr J. H . CATTS -That is not the question. The right honourable member is very anxious to side-track the discussion. He Bhowed last night that he did not wish a vote to be taken on my proposals. That would not suit him, and it would not suit the Government. But those proposals are not now under diswith a view to influencing some of the Mr J. H . CATTS -The right honor-",19,Setup

The proper time at which to say whether it was in order or not was when it came before the House. Then, on my rising to move it , Mr Speaker might interrupt me and say that 'the motion was not in order. That would be a perfectly regular course to take. prin t before ruled out of order. MrJ . H .

Mr J. H . CATTS The r e are many ways in which time might be saved. The honourable member has given notice of motions in regard to which time could be saved by wiping them off the notice paper without consideration. Honourable members, however, possess certain rights. Standing order 251 requires thatAn instruction to a Committee of the whole requires notice, and can only be moved before first going into Committee on any question. I knew that the House would probably go into Committee on the War GratuityB ill to-day, and that, therefore, my only chance of moving an instruction to the Committee was by giving. notice of my motion last night. Consequently, I obtained leave and gave notice of my motion, in accordance with the terms of standing order 108, which saysNo member shall, unless it be otherwise specially provided by the Standing Orders, make any motion except in pursuance of notice openly given at a previous sitting and duly entered on the notice-paper. My notice of motion was 'given openly and in the House, and should have been "" duly entered upon the notice-paper."" The motion of which I gave notice was in the following terms: War Gratuity Bill. Instruction to Committeei Thati t be an instruction to the Committee on the Bill to incorporate in the Bill the following:[a) Payment of the war gratuity in cash to(i) soldiers who have lost an eye; (ii) soldiers who have lost an arm or leg; (iii) unemployed soldiers; (iv) Commonwealth employees who are returned soldiers. (B) The undertaking made with the Prime Minister by the State Governments A motion should be in ol Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales for the payment of cash in exchange for the gratuity bonds It is not for Mr for their returned soldier employees. (c) The undertaking made with the Prime Minister by certain banks, insurance companies and other employers for the payment ofcash in He cannot wipe out a notice of exchange for the gratuity bonds of .their returned soldier employees. (d) The issue of gratuity bonds generally, ciple contained in those proposals ? MrJ . H . CATTS -That has nothing to do with the question now before the House. The right honourable member is .again try ing to side track me. The House is not now asked to' consider the merits of the proposals of which I gave notice. My point is that notice was properly given of my motion, that the motion was couched in parliamentary language, and that it should go on the notice-paper to give the House an opportunity to say, unless Mr Speaker interfered on a question of order at the proper time, whether the instruction should be given to the Committee.' the motion ruled out of order? MrJ . H . CATTS It was / u l e d out of order without any reason being given, so far as I heard. Speaker give reasons. MrJ . H . CATTS I have no desire to state things wrongly. If Mr Speaker gave reasons, I did not hear them, as there was some confusion at the time. Whether he gave reasons or not does not matter. My point is that he had no righ t to rule on the subject of the motion at that time. According to May, the",19,Privilege

10,Mr James Page,"I heard Mr908 noticeof motion must be properly drawn. It is stated on page 367 of the 12th edition of May thatNotice is required, not only of an instruction, but of an amendment to an instruction which, if agreed to, would enlarge the scope of the instruction or convert the same into a novel proposition. May says, too-pag e 368-that Debate on a motion for instruction must be strictly relevant thereto, and must not be directed towards the general objects of the Bill to which the instruction relates. If Mr Speaker was of the opinion that the motion of which I gave notice was directed to the general objects of the B ill , and was, therefore, out of order, the time for him to rule it out of order was when it came before the Housef or discussion. May says further thatAn instruction to a Committee of the whole House can only be moved when the Order of the Day for the first sitting of the Committee has been read. This matter does not affect me personally more than it affects every other honourable member of the House; the rights of members generally are concerned. The proper steps were taken by me to obtain leave of the House to move my motion, and thereupon notice was given of it , and an opportunity should, be provided for the moving of it . I contend that Mr Speaker was wrong in ruling the motion out of order immediately after notice of it had been given, instead of waiting u n t i l it had .come properly before the House. Therefore, to safeguard the rights of members generally in regard to motions, I move the motion which I have already read.

The honourable member for Cook( Mr. Catts) certainly did ask leave to give notice of a motion, although such a notice was not regular at that time. The House gave him leave to give notice of a motion, but it did not give leave in respect of any specific notice of motion, because it could not be aware of the character of the notice u n t i l it had been given. No previous intimation had been given to me of the notice of motion, or I would have told the honourable member privately that such >a motion could not be moved understanding order 249. MrJ . H .

Thus, there would still be as many sitting days, but, at the same time, an opportunity would be provided for honourable members who so desired to return to their homes for Easter. moved in pursuance of that understanding. If , at the adjournment on Thursday afternoon next week, it meets with the approval of honourable members, the Gomernment will move for the adjournment of the House until the following Tuesday week, namely, 13 th April. point I desire to make further-and it is one, I think, which honourable members generally will approve-is that we should dispose of the Gratuity Bill during next week's sittings. If that measure is passed there is no good reason why we should not adjourn until 13th April. Gratuity Bill is not carried next week. What does the Prime Minister intend to do then? until it has been passed. in hearty accord with the motion, because I believe that if the House meets on. Tuesmuch of those honourable members who day of next week an opportunity will be afforded for honourable members who reside in the nearer States, at any rate, to get home for Good Friday. By adopting the Prime Minister's proposal the same number of sitting days will be provided as in ordinary circumstances, and these should meet with the convenience of honourable members. With respect to the Gratuity Bill, all honourable members are seized of its importance. They desire to discuss it very fully, and to emphasize various phases of the matter, pointing out the circumstances of men who do not oome within the scope of the Bil l as it now stands. I have already spoken to the f u l l extent of my right, upon the second reading; and I feel strongly that every honourable member should have the same right-for it is a right, and not a privilege. The Treasurer ( Mr Watt) said the Gratuity Bill was one which would require ""leisurely"" discussion in order that honourable members might have ample time to consider it from every aspect. It is only right that our consideration should be unhurried, for we do not want to see the Bill spoiled by the inclusion of anomalies which cannot be amended in another place-seein g that this is a money measure. I agree, therefore, that the House should meet on Tuesday next. I have now Monday? but other honourable members may have made arrangements which would prevent their attendance on Monday. However, if the Bill cannot be passed next week, we should meet on the ordinary sitting days The only of the week following Eastertide. I may say that I was not consulted in this matter, but I suggest that honourable members meet on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of next week. That would suit the convenience of those honourable members who are compelled to travel to their homes by water. right on to-day and .finish the Bill next week ? prepared to agree to that. I do not want to take one hour away from the Government, but I do hot think it is asking too can return to their homes every week-end to regard the circumstances of those others who are unable to spend any of their week-ends at home.

I am prepared to fall in with the proposal of the Prime Minister, but, for the future, I suggest that honourable members living at-a distance receive more consideration. All that is done here seems simply for the convenience of a few honourable members who reside in Sydney and Melbourne. The House ought to meet on Monday, and opportunity afforded to honourable members from a distance to visit their constituencies occasionally. Personally, I had arranged to leave for ""Western Australia on Friday, assuming that we should not meet during Easter week.

Evidently, however, my proposal does not meet with approval. There are several different ideas advanced by honourable members, who may be divided into two classes-thos e who wish to work on Friday and every day, and those who wish to adjourn over Easter. Let those gentlemen move according to their wishes, and a division can be taken; then, whatever honourable members desire, they can have.

Johnson) I have received from the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the Housei n order to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The agreement for the manufacture and sale of Australian wool tops between the Commonwealth Government and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. Last week, when bhe Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) made a statement in the House announcing that he had entered into a contract with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving CompanyL i m i ted for the manufacture of 10,600 bales of Australian wool into wool tops, and the sale of wool tops, I was in my constituency. HadI been present, I would have been afforded the opjportunity of putting forward the view that I now desire to place before the House and the Government. A t the outset let me say that I am not so much concerned in the political aspect of the matter as I am in safeguarding the interests of the Aus[39]2 tralian wool-grower, which, I feel, have Maloney, Dr. not been sufficiently conserved in this Marr, C.

""which came within its province. A f t e r negotiations with the Australian Government, our wool clip was acquired by the British Government, primarily for the purpose of clothing the armies of the Empire in the field, and secondly in order to safeguard Australia's greatest industry. I felt as a wool-grower, and I think 99 per cent, of the growers in Australia w ill say that the Government made what was at the time an excellent sale, and one that has yielded the growers very substantial advantages. People at this late date, with knowledge that comes to us of present conditions, are apt to think that the task was a very easy one, but when war cut off the trade and commerce of this nation with the rest ^)f the world, the Government were faced with a problem of which history affords no parallel. No country, either at war or in peace, ever faced such a problem in the way that this Government and the Governments of the States had to face it . The producers at the. time were concerned only with the f a it h f u l performance of the contract. They did not question it in any respect. They regarded it as excellent, since it enabled the armies of the Empire to be clothed, the industries of this country to be carried on, and', in short, allowed us to conduct a war abroad while at home we had a reign of peace and prosperity. I come now to the terms of the agreement for the acquisition of the Australian wool clip. A flat price of 15£d. per lb. was fixed, with a reservation as to the requirements for Australian users, andwhat is more, a reservation that sufficient wool should be available to keep our own manufacturers going. There are in Australia, roughly speaking, forty-two textile manufacturing plants, and five wool top making establishments. The company interested in the contract under review is the pioneer of the wool tops industry in Australia. We have the remarkable fact that an industry which could not at its",27,Special Adjournment

The honourable member for Grampians has pointed out that the alternative to the wool tops contract was the closing down of these establishments; but we know that the Government had another alternative. Australia has missed the bus for years. nothing to prevent us from half manufacturing our wool by converting it into wool tops; but at present a great .industry is going to waste.

107,Mr Rodgers,"The first contractthe Committee and the company, and I believe that all possible means were exhausted in trying to fix up a new contract. A poundage rate, a percentage basis, and a 6ommission basis were all considered, but the negotiations failed, and Australia was in the regrettable position of having one of its excellent industries thrown idle, the wheels stopped, and the men unemployed'. There appeared then to be no party able to make an arrangement with the company, except the Government, and I give the Government credit for having done a service to the industry, to those engaged in it, and to the wool-growers, by the -action that it took. The question at issue between the Government and', the growers is, what is the correct destination of the profits? The contract covers 10,600 bales of wool, and is to terminate on the 30th June next. We take it that the company has the capacity, to deal with that quantity of wool in the time. The Prime Minister takes the view that, the Government having made a contract with the company, is -entitled to 80 per cent, of the profits arishas been a lot of talk about the millions ing out of it, the balance of 20 per cent, oing to the firm on the terms which he as made public. On behalf of the growers, however, I ask him to reconsider the position, with a view to putting the profits of the Government into the Wool Pool for distribution growers, or, in the alternative, if he cannot see his way to do that, of putting the Australian wool-grower, in,reference to the quantity of wool that is concerned, in the position in which he would have been had that wool been the subject of the contract with"" the Imperial Government. Those are the two courses open, and I submit that it is reasonable that the Prime Minister should adopt one of them. He may ask, am I content that the Imjperial Government shall get its profit, but that the Commonwealth Government shall get uo profit, out of the acquisition of the wool ? To that question my answer, in anticipation, is that the Imperial Government entered into a contract for our wool for what it was worth at the time, and took the risks consequent upon the war, when no one could foresee what the wool would sell for. The Commonwealth Government, however, has undertaken no' financial risk. It has done good service in re-openihg these works, but I do not think it has the right to take any wool out oi the Wool Pool, except at the price Mr Rodgers. which would have to be paid for that wool under ordinary circumstances. I do not propose to deal with such questions as the placing of one manufacturer in a different position from others. I am concerned now more particularly as to the ownership of the wool. In my judgment, the property in the wool belongs to th« growers. They have put a reasonable case, and have said, "" We did not demur to the selling of wool to meet Australian requirements."" does the wool belong to the growers? the right to appropriate wool placed in its hands as trustees for its sale and disposal? If that has been done without the authority of an Act of Parliament, I . for one, am not prepared to stand for it. I do not think that the Government has the right to take wool, make any contracts they like in respect to it, and put the profits arising out of such contracts into the Consolidated Revenue. There that are coming to the wool-growers as surplus profits from the sale of their wool abroad, but so faT not a penny of this money has been received. There may be handsome profits, but no one knows what there will be. To-day, amongst in many parts of the country, the pastoral industry is in a desperate condition; the straits to which it has been put by reason of the drought, which has lasted for over two years, cannot be exaggerated. There are districts which never before were in so bad a condition as they are now. Therefore, I ask the Prime Minister to reconsider the position of the growers under this contract, and to put them in respect of the wool which forms the subject of it in at least as good a position as they would occupy had that wool been sold to the Imperial Government. If he cannot see his way to do that, will he hand over the profits from the wool, less expenses, for distribution among the growers ? ter and Attorney-General) [12.39] -As this debate will lapse at 1 o'clock, I may be permitted to reply to the honourable member at once.

110,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Ministops agreement I had not my file of ' papers before me, and so was unable to <juote from the shorthand report of the Conference, which is the basis of everything that has been done and is being done under the Wool Pool scheme, including the fixing of the price of wool, the allocation of wool for local purposes, and all things incidental to the scheme. As a result of certain negotiations between the British and Commonwealth authorities, a Conference was held at the end of 1916, at which the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), amongst others, was present, to consider a proposal to sell the wool clip of Australia to Britain. After long discussion, it was decided that the Commonwealth Government should offer the whole of the merino and cross bred clip of Australia to the British Goment at a flat rate of Is. 3d. per lb. on greasy wool, and that subject to the acceptance of this offer the Commonwealth Government should acquire the whole clip. It is necessary to emphasize the point that authority was given to this Government to acquire the whole of the wool. It was suggested that the British Government might wish to buy wool from individual growers, but after discussion the proposal was vetoed. As honourable members know, the offer made to the British Government was accepted, and all the wool of Australia passed automatically to the control of the Government, to be dealt with as agreed upon by the Conference. Now, it was specifically decided that the wool necessary for local purposes should be retained in Australia, should be sold to manufacturers at the same price as to Britain, and that this wool should be outside the Pool. Every grower in Australia ' is bound in honour to uphold the 'agreement as a whole arrived at by the Conference, one part as much as any other. The other night the honourable member for Grampians was speaking when I pointed out that there had been no protest by the growers of this country when the British Government sold 450,000 bales of wool at issue prices. What loss that means in money I do not know, but I venture to say that it cannot 'mean less than £10,000,000 or £12,000,000, of which the Australian share would be one-half. The reply of my honourable friend-and I do not say that it was not a good one-wa s that the growers were in honour bound to uphold the agreement. I agree with him, but desire to remind him that they are also bound in honour to uphold that part of the agreement which provides for the sale of wool to Australian manufacturers. In order to make clear the position in regard to manufactured wool, I shall quote from the shorthand report of the Conference to which I have referred. Mr Vicars, who represented what may be called the weavers, as distinguished from the spinners and combers, saidI beg to ask for a little light on one subject, and that is, to what channel will the Australian manufacturers look to get their supplies ? My reply wasThis will apply to your question. I shall make representations to the British Government that the wool required for local manufacturing purposes be not included in this transaction, and that wool which as required for which facilities exist in this country for scouring shall be scoured in this country. I further saidAll wool that is not shipped and made into something-woollen , I suppose, is meant that wool is inside this transaction. Whether wool is greasy 'or scoured, it is wool. In regard to greasy wool, where there are facilities for scouring that wool, what you ask me to d« is to allow that wool to be scoured in Australia, and then you are done with it. From the manufacturers'"" point of view, I shall ask the Government of Britain to regard that wool which is required for manufacturing purposes in Australia not to be included in this transaction. Mr Vicars askedI presume, if the Australian manufacturer wants any of it for his requirements, it will be placed at his disposal for making up here at ther price as fixed on at this Conference? To that I repliedIf there is a question now of there being two> prices, that is, a price to the British Government and a price for local consumption, we must discuss it now. Ifi t is the same price, there is no difficulty. If that is not understood, then we must discuss that now. need to make any difference. Let the price remain the same.

That agreement clearly recognises the right of the Commonwealth to deal with this wool, and to derive all the profits that might be made out of the transaction, less the amount allotted to the manufacturers. It was proposed to adjust the dispute by allowing the company the share of profits I have stated, while as to the future, the company was to manufacture as agents of the Commonwealth Government, and to receive as remuneration a sum of £64,000 per annum, free of wai profits tax, based on a 6,000,000-lb. output of wool tops. Under these heads of agreement, therefore, the Central Wool Committee agreed with the company that all tlie profits other than those retained by the company should go to the Commonwealth. Nothing was to go to the Pool. honourable gentleman claim a share of the profits arising out of the contracts made with the other manufacturers of wool tops? point in a minute. make clear is that every time the Central Wool Committee made, or attempted, to make, an agreement w i th the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Companyi t did so on the basis of allowing the company a certain percentage of the profits, and paying the balance to the Commonwealth. As I shall not be able to complete my remarks by 1 o'clock, which is the hour fixed by the Standing Orders for the termination of this debate, I ask leave to be allowed to continue my remarks for a period beyond that hour, because I think it is important that this matter should be thoroughly granted.') The agreement made by the Central Wool Committee with the other wool top manufacturers rests upon a different basis. The companies, as agents for the Commonwealth, manufactured on a basis of -4£d. per lb., and any balance of profit is to be paid to the Commonwealth. It is true that the agreement includes a clause which provides that an amount equivalent to the percentage dividend paid by the British Government on the whole clipnot on the combing wool alone, mark you -shal l be paid into the Pool. But the right of the Commonwealth to profits is admitted, and, according to figures which have been supplied to me by the chairman of the Central Wool Committee, profits from this source, amounting to £135,688 , have been already paid into, or are available for, tlie Treasury. The position then is quite clear. A t the conference, the principle of only selling to the Imperial Government the surplus lef t after supplying local manufacturers with sufficient raw material to enable, not only the present plant to be kept f u l l y occupied, but to also encourage the extension of manufacture during the war, and provide employment for the people, was specifically recognised. The Conference agreed that the manufacturer was to get his wool at the appraised price, that the Commonwealth should acquire all the wool, and that the wool needed for Australian manufactures was to be excluded from the sale to Britain. No mention was made of paying any of the profits of manufacture into the Pool. That these principles were well settled, I shall come to that and were accepted by the parties' is WhatI want to proved by the facts cited. The agreement made by the Central Wool Committee with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company rested upon the same foundation as does the one recently concluded, namely, that the company was to obtain wool at the appraised price, retaining 33 per cent, of the profits for itself, paying 66 per cent, to the Commonwealth, and nothing to the Pool. Under the proposed agreement which did not operate, the company was to get £64,000 per annum; the balance of the profits was to go to the Commonwealth. Under the agreement with Whiddon Brothers, Yarra threshed out. (Leave Falls, and other spinning companies, by which they work upon a basis of 4£d. per lb., the Pool has a right, in addition to the appraised price, to an amount equivalent to the percentage dividend paid by the British Government on the whole of the clip, but there is recognised also the right of the Commonwealh to profit over and above that amount. A few nights ago the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), taking me at a disadvantage because some of these",33,Adjournment Formal
116,Mr Rodgers,Why does not the right,34,Adjournment Formal
117,Mr Hughes,"matters had passed from my memory, criticised rather severely the arrangement recently made with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, and, as spokesman for the wool-growers, claimed the profits which, according to the agreement, are payable to the Commonwealth. The honourable member was, and is still, a member of the Central Wool Committee. He was a party to the first wool tops agreement, and, speaking in this House on the 18th January, 1918, he said (Hansard, page 3268)I have to say, as regards that, that in all these matters the Central Wool Committee, of whom I am one, and the chairman is Mr J. M. Higgins, takes full and entire responsibility. I know nothing of many things that have been said with regard to the Prime Minister in the course of a recent debate; but I do mittee were responsible. The principles know that the right honourable gentleman has not taken one step in connection with the Central Wool Committee, or with wool tops,' except upon the practically unanimous recommendation of the committee and its chairman, Mr Higgins. If anything wrong has been done, and I assure honourable members that it is perthat what was wrong then must be fectly certain that that is not the. case, then the Central Wool Committee, Mr Higgins, as its chairman, and myself are to blame, and not the Prime Minister. No shadow whatever of any blame in connection with the matter attaches to the Prime Minister. All that was done in this connection was entirely our doing, or that of the chairman, Mr Higgins, whom we all support. That agreement was to allot 33 per cent, of the profits to the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, and 66 per cent, to the Commonwealth. (NowI am criticised because I have made an agreement which allots 20 per cent, of the profits to the company and 80 per cent, -to the Commonwealth. Sitting dent that the principle underlying this agreement is that which was accepted originally by the Conference, and which has, on two occasions at least, received the imprimatur of the Wool Committee. The first agreement differs in no essential, except in the allocation of the profits, with the agreement now tabled. Yet the honourable member for Grampians now condemns the very principle which he formerly commended. It is rather in teresting, in view of his criticisms, to glance at the division list upon the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers); that amendment was, in effect, a condemnation of the first agreement made by the Wool Committee embodying this very principle, under which the profits were allocated on the basis of 33 per cent, to F. W . Hughes and Co., and 66 per cent, to the Commonwealth Government. The honourable member for Wannon has been consistent in his objections to the p r in ciple approved by the Wool Committee. But when he sought support for his views he found very little. In the divisionwere sixteen ""Ayes"" and t h i r t y ""Noes""; aud, figuring prominently among the latter, I find the name of the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett). I emphasize the fact that the honourable gentleman said that for whatever was wrong in the agreement the Wool Comadopted by the Wool Committee are those upon which the present agreement rest, yet the honourable member for Grampians now condemns it . Why? I think honourable members will admit wrong now, and, similarly, that what was right then must be right now. There was a dispute between Mr F.. W. Hughes and the Wool Committee, and the latter were not prepared to renew the agreement upon exactly the samelines; but the second agreement involves, for all practical purposes, the same p r in ciple^-allocatin g to the company £64,000, and leaving to the Commonwealth Government the whole of the residuum of profit. So much for that. I have shown clearly that the principle in this agreement is no new one. It was accepted' by the Wool Committee. Indeed, suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. it emanated from the Wool Committee, and was re-affirmed by that bodyI t becomes quite eviin 1918, and in the wool-top agreements made with' the other companies the same principle is re-affirmed. the principle now, and decline to make a contract on the basis of it . honourable member for Grampians ( Mr. Jowett) has said that, if anything -that was.done was wrong, then it is the Wool' Committee who are responsible, and not the Government or the Prime Minister.

120,Mr Hughes,"Of course, and thethe honourable member for Grampians car. flounder at his leisure. I turn now to deal with the point raised by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers). He claims the whole of the profits. By what process of reasoning he supports such a claim we are not told. If that claim were conceded it would affirm the principle that any Government, other than the Commonwealth, is entitled to some consideration. Government of Great Britain is entitled to half; the Government of the Commonwealth, to nothing. The Government of France is entitled to consideration; the Government -of the Commonwealth, to nothing. The Government of the United States of America is entitled to considerat i o n ; but the Government of the Commonwealth is entitled to nothing. Yet, to the Government of the Commonwealth alone is this agreement due; and, since the Government of the Commonwealth is responsible for the agreement, so does the half-profit arising therefromemanate from the Commonwealth Government. Tothe Government of his own country, however, the honourable member and those behind him would concede nothing, while to Governments of other countries they are willing toconcede at least 50 per cent. I do not think any citizen will contend that that is a sound, proper, or patriotic position. This contract is divided into two parts. The one has relation to the purchaseof the raw material. has been dealt with as directed by the growers themselves at the Conference in 1916. entered into by them, it was acquired by the Government to be disposed of as set out in the agreement. terms of the agreement specifically provided that we should export only the surplus of our raw wool, leaving ample for the requirements of local manufacturers, while another provided that they were to get all the wool they required at the appraised price. member contends that had the wool gone into the Pool, and been sent to GreatB r it a in , the grower would have been entitled to half the profit on the clip, including, of course, those 10,000 bales. I have shown conclusively that under the agreement they have no claim whatever to any profits on wool retained in Australia for local manufacture, yet the honourable member claims all the profits, not only on the sale of the wool, but on the manufacture also. It is tfbvioug that to this latter the Pool can have no claim at all. The agreement related to raw material. This contract is something more than a contract relating to the acquirement of raw material and its purchase at an appraised price. It is a contract for the manufacture and sale The of wool tops. It is an absolutely monstrous suggestion that the profit received from the manufacture of raw wool into wool tops should go to the grower. If the grower has a claim at all-and I shall deal with that in a moment-it is that this wool shall be treated in the same manner as wool sold to GreatB r it a in , namely, to have one-half of the difference between the appraised and the market price. Butf or the honourable member to ask for the whole of the profit on the sale of the raw wool, and also all the profit over 20 per cent, which is earned as a result of the manufacture of this raw wool into' wool tops, is really monstrous. The honourable member does not realize, perhaps, that there is a million pounds' worth of capital invested in this industry. Is not the labourer worthy of his hire? B y what right, then, can any profit made as a result of the manufacture of the raw wool go to any one but the manufacturer? Clearly, then, that suggestion cannot be entertained, and I do not think that any wool-grower w ill That raw material for a moment contend that he and his fellow-producers have any claim to any profit other' than in respect to the rawAs the result of an agreement material. One of the Nowf or the point raised as an alternative by the honourable member. He says: "" We ask that you put us in as good a position as we would have been had you not taken that wool."" While I contend that under the agreement the wool used for local manufacture is wholly outside But the honourable the Pool, I am ready to consider the proposal f a i r l y on its merits. The claim ought to be, and must be, considered. More than that, clearly, the honourable member has no* right to ask for. I am prepared to say now, on behalf of the Government, that I w ill give favorable consideration to the proposal. I want to make my intention perfectly clear. I mean to say that I am prepared to consider whether the grower shall have as tion of the time l i m it.

138,Mr Tudor,"There is another side t oother side. The British Government, in conjunction with the Australian Government, asked F . W . Hughes and Company to increase the price of wool tops to Japan, w i th a view to 'protecting the British manufacturer against the competition of that country, and a condition was that a l l the profit from that increased price should go to the Commonwealth Government. This company was in the habit of buying sheep-skins, with the wool on, direct from the abattoirs, but the Wool Committee stepped in , and said that, notwithstanding that the company bought the live sheep and the skins belonged to the company, the Committee claimed the extra profit on tlie wool taken off the skins. What an absurd position! The result is that the company has been tied up for over two years, and men and women thrown out of employment. have not heard tlie honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) say much about these men and women, but he has said much about tlie "" poor squatters,"" to whom I do not wish any harm, but who. in my opinion, are quite able to bear the burden placed upon them. none of the other companies have been closed up? they have started under the new agreement. We have no right to make any company sign an agreement which they do not wish to sign, and F . W . Hughes and Company were perfectly right in refusing an agreement that did not do them justice.

The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) will substantiate me in what I am now saying, for he has seen this cloth on sale in America as tweed made in Australia and regarded"" as the best in the establishment. The point is that these manufacturers are not called upon to give any extra profit to the Wool Pool. They buy in the open market at a fiat rate,'and any profits they make they keep for themselves. In Australia, boots are manufactured for export, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) w ill admit.

193,Mr Marks (Wentworth) [2.53],"Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League or the Prime Minister who first started the ball rolling is a side issue. I know that this month last year, when I was on the other side of the world, the matter was in the mind of the Prime Minister, but undoubtedly it is the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League that has brought us to the present position. I congratulate the Government on bringing forward such a liberal measure. salt did not leave Australia to go across the f a r oceans and fight on the fields of Palestine, Gallipoli, France, and Belgium for a gratuity. When I was in Paris, at the Hotel Majestic this month last year, I met the Prime Minister and his ablecolleague, the Ministerf or the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook), also Sir Robert Garran, and Mr DeanCj who were doing magnificent work in keeping up Australia's end. I also met a French general, who did not know that I was an Australian, seeing that I was in a British uniform , but said, "" The fighting of the men from Australia was magnificent, particularly at Neuve Chapelle and at the saving of France for the second time at Amiens. France w ill never forget what these men did."" heroic fight in defence and attack for the sake of a gratuity. for one thing only, and that was to fight for the Empire and the flag which we returned men adore, and in particular for Australia and the honour of their women. They fought to keep their women folk free from that awful raping which took place in France and Belgium. I could tell many a story of that, but this is not the time. Commonwealth are paying this gratuity. Certain words in it , which ought to be printed in letters of gold, tell us that it is to be ""a free g if t by the Commonwealth in recognition of honourable services during the Avar with Germany and her Allies."" Before dealing with the naval side of the question, to honourable Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) and gratuity to move an amendment with that end in view. They say if the war had lasted for Mr Marks. a considerable time longer the Government would have had to find the cash. They are quite r i g h t ; but there is a great deal of difference between carrying on a war which is a matter of l if e and' death, and for which we had to get the money, and the saddling of the Commonwealth with a huge debt in the form of a war gratuity, which is not a matter of l if e and death. It is a g if t that the Commonwealth is The"" digger "" and the "" digger "" making to its fighting men. He also complained that men who were sick or were injured while in camp, and were unable to go to the Front, would not participate in the gratuity. My reading of the B ill is that under clause 3, paragraph e ( 2 ) , they w ill , and that under another part of the B ill the dependants of those who died in camp will also receive a gratuity at the rate of Is. per diem. There are other points to which the hon-. orable member referred, and as to which I am quite in agreement with him. I am with honourable members of the Opposition in many statements they have made as to hard cases untouched by the B ill , but there are even harder cases than those to which reference has been made by them. Let me tell the House of a case that has But these men did not put up that been before the Repatriation Department, and which I also brought before the AsThey went away sistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie), but in which no relief can be granted. It is that of a man named W i l son, who lives at Randwick, in my electorate, and who went to one of our camps to enlist. Whilst riding from one h ut to another in the camp his horse rolled on him and ruptured him internally. It is a terrible case. The man has a wife and Clause8 tells us why the several children,, and they are starving. They have one empty room, without fur niture, gas, or heat appliances, which has been placed at their disposal by neighbours, and they have nothing to eat save that which the neighbours are able to supply to them.

I , for one, think that the gratuity should be paid in cash, but I have to be practical,' and ask myself how could we get the necessary money. There are, of course, methods of raising the money. I believe that a big lottery loan would secure what wewant. Again, much as I am opposed to compulsion, I think that it would be a fair thing to make some of the big ""money-bags"" who have not yet subscribed to our war loans contribute. If there is one reason more than another that would justify compulsion, it is this gratuity. I know, of course, that it is difficult to reach these people. Yet with the machinery available to the Government some attempt might have been made. It is scandalous that men of moderate means and working men borrowed money to subscribe to war loans while some men with tens of thousands in the bank did not put up a penny. The Government should have made, them contribute something, and it is not yet too late to do so. I am in hearty accord with the proposal to do a fair thing by the soldiers. I regret that this proposal has been dragged in the mud, both here and in the country, as if the "" digger "" could be bought. The last speaker made it clear 'that the "" digger"" cannot be bought, and we all know that. I think that, as a rule, at the elections the "" digger"" followed the same line of politics as he was following before the war. There are few legitimate soldiers who will not admit that the Government has done well for them. This Ministry did all it couldto assist in the effective prosecution of the war. I do not say that there are not members of the Opposition who did not do the same, but some of them did nothing, and I am astonished that some of these have the cheek to gibe at. men like the last speaker. The sight of his badge ought to make them keep silent. Of course, there are lots of men who are not wearing badges, although they would like to be wearing them; they had calls which kept them from offering their services, and it was at the sacrifice of their personal inclinations that they did not go, but no one has the right to taunt those who did go. The honourable and gallant member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming), who enlisted and went to the Front, is a married man, and probably beyond the age of military service. There was no compulsion on him to enlist, yet he felt the call and went. I know that he quarrelled with the authorities because he was notput into the firing line as quickly as he would have liked.

237,Mr Lazzarini,"The n , why doesEden-Monaro( Mr Chapman) and others have repeatedly taunted the personnel of this side of the Chamber with respect to non-enlistment; he has held that he has a perfect right to ask any individual why he did not enlist. That being so, I have an equal right to ask any person if he is not prepared to sacrifice a part of his wealth, and why he is not ready to accept a levy for the payment of a cash gratuity to the soldiers who saved his wealth for him. Conscription of life may be sought by a referendum, but not conscription of wealth. I defy honourable members opposite to agree to a referendum being taken forthwith upon the question of raising the cash for this gratuity by direct levy upon the wealth of the country. I do not stand for bonds or for forced loans in any circumstances. Any further inflation of the loans which have been entered into by the Commonwealth authorities, any further creation of fictitious wealth by the payment of the gratuity bonds out of fresh loans, can only add still further to the terribly high cost of living. It would become a question within a very few years, in such circumstances, whether the whole of the gratuity had not been effectually taken away from the soldiers by the ever-soaring cost of living. The only way in which to face this matter is to say to the comparatively few holders of the accumulated wealth of this country, "" While our soldiers were fighting in Europe many of their little ones went barefooted because you raised the price of their footwear; the unclothed flesh on the bones of many of these little ones was seen to shiver because you raised the price of their clothing; the stomachs of many of these little dependants of our soldiers went empty because you profiteered upon the prices of foodstuffs.

Where money had been accumuceptable form. At present, we are maklated prior to the war it increased by ing no progress. I regret these exchanges leaps and bounds solely as an outcome of the war. Surelyi t is not too much to ask to-day that those people who made huge additions to their fortunes because of the war should be forced to disgorge a portion in order to provide the returned soldiers with a gratuity in cash. I stand for a cash payment, absolutely and immediately, by means of a direct wealth levy. I do not suggest that the levy should be upon the man who has not made anything, oir that it should be taken from those who have little to give, but that it should be forced from thoseand they are a comparative few-wh o were so callous as to fasten an economic grip upon the throats of their fellow citizens while this country was almost tottering to its fall. Any sacrifice of wealth, either here or in any other country, during the war was made by the class which I represent; it was made by the man who put his shilling or his pound into war funds, and who had no means of getting it back from the pockets of the consumer. People who put up their little sums sacrificed home comforts and many of the necessaries of life. But the big financial institutions, the wealthy wholesale merohants, and the rapidly enriched middlemen, gave their thousand pounds to war funds and took £10,000 away from their fellow citizens by increasing the price of necessary commodities. Wherever possible, they shortened their hands; they paid less wages. They made promises that they would do wonderful things for the men who had volunteered. Very few of those promises were kept. It is now up to this Government, if it is honest in the matter of the gratuity, to provide the soldiers with a free gift from the pockets of those who can thoroughly well afford to pay. are clauses in this Bill which I , as well as other honourable members, wish to see it has been passed, to be as acceptable, both to the returned soldier and to the I made remarks public, as can be possibly devised.

291,Mr Francis ( H E N T Y ) [ 4 . 2 2 ],"I haveI want to know exactly where the difference goes. I do not think that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should get any increase. It has done very well out of the public. Its balance-sheet speaks for itself. It has made huge profits. 1 feel that the grocer ought to receive consideration. We do not desire that the retailer should sell sugar at a loss. But my object is to protect the consumer, and even if I stand alone I propose to do so. If the Minister had answered the question I put to him to-day as to the price we have been paying and the quantity of sugar we have imported into the Commonwealth, the position might have been clearer. Until we obtain that information, or the report is laid on the table so that honourable members-the members of the Government, of course, are specially privileged, and possess this information -ma y have an opportunity of going into the sugar question, particularly as regards the retail price, dissatisfaction will on both sides who made it. That is my prevail. We are not so concerned about the wholesale price, because we realize that the industry must be encouraged. There are lots of things one would like to say. ' should protect the consumer, but the Government should not be asked to stand under the load. Government to stand under the load; but I am satisfied that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should not receive any increase. That is my opinion, but probably those more closely associated with the company may express a different view. company has had a monopoly of the sugar business for years, and we should not, under any conditions, allow it an increased price. I am prepared to do anything possible to enable the consumer to obtain sugar at a reasonable price without penalizing the grocer, who should obtain a legitimate profit. ister for the Navy) [4.27] I have listened very patiently to this diatribe against the Government. It appears that whatever we do is wrong. We are shot at from the corner benches, by members opposite, and also from the benches in front; and I can only bow my head before the storm in the utmost meekness and humility. In regard to the statement made by the Leader of the Country party ( Mr Mcwilliams), wherein he said he would not in future agree to the printing of any document which he had not had time to consider, I may say I hope he may have time to consider his documents. I trust, however, that in his exalted position he will remember that this House is master of its own procedure, and he, like the rest of us, must submit to a decision of the House when that decision has been recorded. In regard to the statement of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), and the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan), I agree with them that every detail of the sugar agreement ought to be published. I believe the more the agreement is investigated, the better it will be for those impression. done. It is all in Hansard now, and the details are available to honourable members. the agreement to a retail price of 6d. per lb.? ment. of the agreement, at any rate. With the Treasury. understand the remark of the honourable member for West Sydney. His statement is perfectly cleaT, but is not in accord with the attitude of his Leader, who has not committed himself to the attitude adopted by the honourable member for West Sydney. He believes that the increase in the cost of growing and producing sugar should be undertaken by the Government on behalf of the people. The honourable member for West Sydney is taking the stand he did during the election, when he advocated dear wheat for the farmer and cheap br^ad for the consumer in the cities.",55,Chapman I T Dustry Has Got B U T I T Seemed To Me That

The Government will take care not to allow the Leader of the Opposition to get away with that part of the agreement which relates to the men working in the field up yonder, and let the Government shoulder the responsibility of making the industry pay for itself. We have not merely to see that the sugar-grower iri Queensland receives an increased price for his sugar, and that the man in the field receives more for his labour, but we have to see that the people who need sugar, and who consume it, are prepared to pay a sufficient price to cover the cost of production. tion.

I said that the retail price every one knows what an intellectual giant the honourable member is, and what intellectual pigmies we are. That can pass without further comment. The interjection of the honourable member for West Sydney is just as specious as many of his other remarks, and I do not know whether it is worthwhile attempting to correct it. It is merely a half truth. However, what the Prime Minister did say was that some of the difference between the 34d. and 6d., but not all, was due to the importation of costly sugar. public want to know. and figures are in Hansard. It is a simple sum in arithmetic, and the honourable member may reckon it up for himself. Let him reckon up how much sugar we have to import at £80 per ton, and how much we shall produce at the lowerrate, and he will have all the information he wants. MeantimeI remind my honourable friend' that only part of the statement is correct-that part of it which relates to the importation of costly sugar as adding to the added cost of the higher rates which it will cost to produce the home-grown sugar. adding the duty of £6 per ton on the imported sugar? duty to be added. Why should the Government do that? Government did before. member knows what his Government did. This is a different Administration altogether.
