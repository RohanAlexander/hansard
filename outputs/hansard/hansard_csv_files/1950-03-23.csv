BEAN AND POLLARD. a serious problem in the procurement of bran and pollard supplies, the shortage of which is affecting the production of eggs, butter and pig meats. As one solution of the difficulty would be to increase Australian sales of flour on the Japanese market, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture represent to the Minister for Trade and Customs that every opportunity should be given to flour exporters to sell flour to Japan? If it is a fact that trade with Japan is conducted under a combined sterling bloc system, will the Minister try to make arrangements for Anstralia to handle its own trade in primary industries direct with Japan? the problem that exists in regard to the currency?

I have since attended that conthe sale of Australian surplus meat of ference, which was designed to ascertain certain categories, including beef in parwhat steps might be taken to stimulate ticular, to the United Kingdom over a Australian export trade in flour. It is period of fifteen years. A price for beef only in this way that the shortage of for the current season was agreed upon bran and pollard can be overcome. Ausand a price for pig meats, which will be tralia deals directly with Japan. The effective till the 30th September next, only problem connected with such trade is was also established. Negotiations are of transactions.

I assure the House that full consideration will he given, in consultation with representatives of the industry, to the desirability of extending the wheat stabilization plan before the term of the present plan expires. Health studied the result of the Gallup poll in relation to the supply of free medicine, which indicates that 43 per cent, of the people want free medicine and that only 15 per cent, of them are opposed to the scheme? Is the Minister's failure to provide this service due to his lack of interest in the people or to instructions that he has received from the British Medical Association? Do his loyalties lie with the British Medical Association or with the people of Australia ? that is being made against me at present is that my loyalties are with the friendly societies instead of with the British Medical Association. The Gallup poll, of course, is worthless as a basis of judgment on this matter because the free medicine, scheme has not yet been fully prepared. How anybody can express an opinion upon an unfinished joh is beyond my comprehension. the public are seriously inconvenienced by being unable to obtain medical attention after the regular visiting hours, and to obtain medicines after the ordinary trading hours for chemists' shops. In view of those circumstances, will the Minister for Health diaouas with the health authorities in New South Wales,. the British Medical Association, and the Pharmaceutical Guild, the possibility of making suitable arrangements in order to cater for the needs of the public at hours outside the normal visiting and trading times, particularly for urgent cases ? that the honourable gentleman has asked that doctors and chemists shall work at hours outside the normal periods in order to provide the convenience to which he has referred.

The honourable member for Dalley will be pleased to learn that he can be sure that the time that this Government will take to implement a satisfactory and suitable medical scheme for improving the health' of the people will not be nearly so long as the last Government took. Health state whether any advice has been received by the Government, either orally or in writing, from the British Medical Association indicating the type of national medical scheme which the association will permit the Government to introduce? Government assumed office it summoned a conference of representatives of the British Medical Association, voluntary health organizations and the Pharmaceutical Guild of Australia. Full and frank discussions followed. The discussions are still being pursued. of cases throughout the Commonwealth of resumptions of property by the Department of the Interior in which settlements have heen delayed, I believe through the neglect of the previous Government, for up to two years or more. The amounts involved in some of those cases are small and it is not practicable economically to approach the High Court for a decision when agreement cannot be reached. Would the Minister for the Interior give consideration to the setting up of some simple form of independent appeal tribunal to facilitate the completion of resumptions where agreement cannot he reached by negotiation? in consultation with the authorities on this question to ascertain whether such a tribunal could be set up. I can assure the honorahle member that -1 am pursuing those investigations. Hong Kong that although millions of Ohinese are facing starvation, the Chinese Communists are exporting flour to Soviet Russia.

If there be such a suggestion I shall have it examined. On the problem presented by the question of the honourable member in relation to the export by China of foodstuffs to Soviet Russia, again I do not know the facts. I can undertake to discuss the problem with my colleague, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, and I shall endeavour to give the honorahle member an answer later. the Minister for External Affairs, although it has some relation to trade and commerce. Has the Minister seen the alarming puhlic statements that Japan is engaged in cut-throat competition for markets on the old pre-war basis of dumping and price cutting; that, textiles and merchandise labelled "" Hong Kong port of origin"" are really made in Japan; and that England has received parcels of these goods including cheaply made shirts at 30s. a dozen, and children's frocks at 3s. 9d. each? How can Japan, with whioh a peace treaty has not yet been arranged, trade on this apparently unrestricted basis? What measures are being taken to protect the Australian worker and manufacturer ? Has the com. bination of Japanese monopoly plus free enterprise created this state of affairs as reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of to-day's date? Despite the fact that the Minister has assured the House that the Zaibatsu has been broken up, will he examine the new evidence that the old Japanese trading system has not been destroyed, but has merely changed its front?

26,Mr Haylen,"I direct a question to the vital matter of trade and relations with Japan? tions of the honourable member relate to matters which I think are properly answerable by a department other than my own. So far as his reference to the Zaibatsu is concerned, I think that if he has a good look at my reply he will agree that I did not say that this organization had been broken up. I indicated that the Government was not satisfied with the extent to which that organization had been dealt with. The honourable member will realize that at the present time, except through the Far Eastern Commission, the Government has no direct control over the manner in which Japan is permitted to trade. So far as the determination of the terms of the peace treaty is concerned, I think that I indicated during the course of my statement on foreign affairs that there should be a working authority set up in London for the purpose of seeking to work out the terms of the peace treaty. I am sure the honourable member is himself aware that the framing of th:peace treaty is beset with many difficulties because of arrangements made before the war came to an end. The Government is resolved to protect the interests of this country. I hope that, as soon as the working committee is set up in Great Britain, we shall have an opportunity to ad vance our views. The honourable member can rest assured that treaty proposals will be submitted to this House before a final determination is made. FLAX. statement by the president of the Victorian Flax-growers Association in evidence before the Tariff Board that uncertainty regarding the continued operation of flax mills controlled hy the Commonwealth was causing growers to limit the areas of flax sown, can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture state the present position in regard to those factories? What assurances can ho give to the growers, and to the persons employed in the factories, whose future is at present uncertain? broadly, is that the last Government sought to dispose of the factories erected during the war for war purposes, ancl invited tenders for their purchase, but none was received. That produced the state of uncertainty to which the honourable member has referred. With the approval of the Prime Minister, I announced that the organizations controlling flax mills could enter into contracts with the growers for the growing of another crop. The growers have been aware of that for the last month or six weeks, and I understand that they are now preparing for sowing the crop. In addition, the representatives of the organized growers, and the representatives of the spinners, have been invited to confer to see whether they ean jointly make a proposal to the Government for taking over the mills under which they would be owned jointly and equally by the flaxgrowers and the spinners.

The warship is being constructed by day labour. The original cost, including stores and armament, was £2,000,000, but the estimated cost now is £2,500,000, an increase of approximately £500,000.

M in is t e r ) l y leave-On Tuesday last the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) asked the following question:I wish to direct a question to the Prime Minister, and in explanation I point out that last Thursday the Minister for the Army read to the House a document which purported to he a Cabinet minute. Having regard to the custom adopted by all previous governments, which seems to me to be a decent and fair practice, I ask the Prime Minister whether he approves of a Minister using secret and confidential documents, or documents which purport to be so, in debates in tlie House? As I was not present at the time of the occurrence of the incident mentioned I indicated that I would look into the matter and that, later this week, I would give an answer to the question of the Leader of the Opposition. The right honourable gentleman, directed my attention to an incident which occurred during the debate on Japanese f38 1 war trials, and invited me to indicate whether I approve of the disclosure of Cabinet documents to the House. This question has previously arisen, notably on the 20th May, 1942, when the honourable member for East Sydney, then Ministerf or Labour and National Service, made reference to a Cabinet submission by his predecessor, the present Minister for Labour and National Service. I felt aggrieved by this procedure when in Opposition. I must adopt a similar attitude as Prime Minister. I have no doubt that it is a sound general principle that submissions made to Cabinet by individual Ministers are confidential to that Cabinet, as are Cabinet communications between Ministers. Having said this, it is proper that I should turn to the events of last Thursday. I had made a statenient to the House which included a clear suggestion that there had been undue delay in bringing Japanese war criminals to trial. In the debate of Thursday last this was challenged. The honourable member for East Sydney, a former Minister, and himself one who, as I have said, had been known to make use of secret Cabinet papers in the course of debate, challenged the Government to make available for the perusal of members of the Opposition all the papers connected with the matter. My colleague, the Ministerf or External Affairs, in the course of his speech, had saidI t is all very well for the honourable member for East Sydney, who is now only a private member to demand the facts. There are certain documents tliat would normally not be produced, but the Crovernment will produce them if the Leader of the Opposition asks it to table them. My colleague then went on to say of the previous GovernmentI t failed to measure up to its responsibilities and it put off the decision from month to month and finally did nothing. The honourable member for Grayndler ( MrD a l y ) , who had originally on behalf of the Opposition taken the adjournment of the debate upon my statement, knowing of this exchange, saidThe previous Government faced up to its responsibility, and was determined not to release any Japanese, civilian or soldier, as",19,Potatoes

He then said, referring to my statementWhat did liis words convey except a suggesconsider that the Government could very tion that the previous Government had been dilatory in the matter? No attempt has been made to substantiate that charge, which has been answered fully and effectively by my colleagues who have taken part in this debate. essential for their convenience. In these circumstances the Minister for the Navy, not unnaturally, took up the challenge. He indicated, quite properly, that the files before him contained cables from, General MacArthur and his staff protesting against the suspected war criminals heing kept in prison without any charge having heen made against them. He referred, again quite properly, to the fact that the previous Government bad had the matter before it as long ago as the 4th May, 1949. So far, so good! He then proceeded to read the precise terms of a ministerial recommendation inade to Cabinet. It is quite clearto me that he was drawn into doing this because of the controversial course the debate had taken-a course not fully disclosed in reality hy Hansard, because there were many interjections.

This understanding by my colleague unquestionably arose from some insufficiently considered expressions of mine and is theref ore one for which I willingly accept responsibility.

Debate resumed from the 22nd March (vide page 1094), on motion by Mr That the following paper be printed:Foreign Policy-Ministeria l Statement, Hth ""March, 1050. Minister for. External Affairs( Mr Spender) has made a very valuable contribution to this House on the subject of world affairs. It may be said to his credit that he virtually circumnavigated the globe in his very helpful statement upon the vexed questions of international relationships. His remarks, and the remarks of other honorahle members during the course of thisdebate, have made it clear that international affairs must be handled on a sane level if we are to secure peace throughout the world. The Minister has indicated that the policy of the present Government is to continueAustralia'? active participation in the affairs of tbe United Nations, to send Ministersabroad from time to time, and to make every effort to maintain, the highest level of friends-hip between this country and the United States of Arierica.

59,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [3.15],"Th efuture -must largely have relation to developments in Asiatic countries. I believe that the members of every party represented in this House are in agreement with the Minister on those points. Om.great difficulty as a people arises from the fact that Australians generally are not internationally minded. That is due in part to our geographical isolation, which prevents our people from making contacts overseas and studying at first hand the -conditions that are well known to those who live in Europe and Asia. One of the first obligations of this Pardeclare that whilst insisting on our liament is to declare in clear and unequivocal tennis the precise attitude of Australia towards other nations and the attitude that we expect other nations to .adopt towards us. Two very important -declarations have heen made since 1941. Both of them can form the basis of proper understanding between all nations of the world, and therefore I consider fchat it as desirable to revive and emphasize them. The first was made in a -remarkable speech hy one of this century's most remarkable men, President Roosevelt, when he delivered to the United States Congress in January, 1941, what is generally described as l i e ""Eour Freedoms Speecli"". On that occasion, he declared that the duty of the United States of America was to pursue a policy in relation to other countries that would give to the peoples of the world freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from fear -and freedom from want. Shortly afterwards, in the same year, President Roosevelt of the United. States and Mr Churchill of England, drew up a document which has been generally referred to as the Atlantic Charter. The eight points of that Charter: laid down in clear and simple language the ideas of those two nations on the objects of the war and the policy to be pursued by the nations fighting for democracy in their relationship with other countries. In the Atlantic 'Charter tliere can has been seen in the history of the gigantic be found the three simple principles that struggles between Christianity and might be enunciated by the people of Mohammedanism. The same thing can Australia, as a guide to all countries on be seen to-day in the cold war between what, this country considers are its rights economic ideologies. and obligations. The first of those three principles can serve as a declaration hy Australia that it believes iu the right of position clear upon the three principles self-government, and non-intervention by that I have suggested. We must declare other countries in its own affairs. The second can indicate that Australia has the right to develop its economic life and its resources without hindrance from people of other lands. The third cam -show that Australia has the right, as a nation, to safety and -security from aggression. Those three principles can ibe laid down as the basic rights of our people amd also the rights of other nations, whether they are our near neighbours >or are geographically far from us. The adoption of those three principles by Australia au-toma-ti&ally -own rights and agreeing that othei' nations should have the same rights, we do not propose to pursue a policy of aggrandizement, territorially or otherwise. If we could develop in Australia .an understanding in the minds of the people of those three principles it would form the basis of the best declaration that could he made to inform the world of exactly where Australia stands. I suggest that the three principles would be readily agreed upon hy every country in the world. Our difficulty is that in our relationship with other nations disturbing factors have occurred. Throughout the history of mankind such factors have been the cause of innumerable wars which have, marred the history of the human race. The element which has caused a groat deal of difficulty in the past, and is still causing it to-day, is the desire of a community for aggrandizement. That occurs from one of tliree causes. The first is territorial expansion, which is so well known that I do not intend to place before the House examples of how it causes war. The second is aggression and aggrandizement that have arisen through dynastic ambitions. The greatest fear of to-day's world, which has also been evidenced in the past, is caused by the third factor, which is the desire of communities to impose their ideas upon other communities who do not want them. That We must therefore make our political that at all times we will resist any possibility of aggrandizement against us as a community, and that tbe forces of oui nation, in conjunction with those of allied nations, will be used to prevent aggrandizement on the part of other9 against those who desire to live their own lives peacefully. While giving recognition to the rights that we desire for ourselves, we should also try to understand the causes behind the actions of other nations. Very often other peoples see problems from a very different angle from ourselves. For instance, it has been said that the English-speaking nations and those of northern Europe are phlegmatic by nature, that the southern European nations are inclined to be volatile, and that to an understanding with the Russians. other nations are characterized by patience and endurance. Therefore, what may be a perfectly clear method of reasoning to one people may be incomprehensible to another. Their reasoning being different, their actions will also be different. The Minister was correct when, in his statement on foreign affairs, he said that a. good deal of the uncertainty in the present-day world arises from the inability on the part of the Western nations to reach any understanding with Russia. I also agree with the statement of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) that the cold war is likely to continue, but that there is little possibility of any physical conflict between Bussia and other countries. A proper understanding of the mode of reasoning of the Russian people would give a clue to the difficulties involved in coming to an understanding with Russia. The Government of Russia follows the Marxian theory of economics, and is convinced beyond any shadow of doubt that the nations working under a capitalist economy must inevitably perish becanse of faults inherent in that system. They are prepared to wage a cold war, and to do everything they can to frustrate attempts Russia and other countries, but they will probably stop short of actual war, because they believe that the economic systems of the countries with whose representatives they are invited to negotiate are bound to collapse before very long. They also believe that the capitalist countries, in an effort to save themselves from destruction, will probably wage war If r . Clarey. on Russia, and for that reason the Russians maintain a large and efficient army. Honourable members may regard that method of reasoning as unreal, but it is the method followed by those who control Russia to-day. They will do nothing to help in the preservation of a state of society which they believe is bound to perish. What is happening in the sphere of international relations, has happened also when other organizations have come in contact with the Russians. For instance, the World Federation of Trade Unions disintegrated because of the inability of the representatives of the western, trade union movements to come The representatives of the workers in Great Britain, Canada, the United States of America, Belgium and other countries could not win the confidence of the representatives of the trade union movement in Russia because matters which were regarded as essential to the western nations were looked upon by the representatives of the Soviet as quite immaterial. The fact is that our beliefs and our methods of reasoning are altogether different from those of the Russians, so that we are unable to achieve that mutual trust which is necessary if we are to work together for the preservation of peace. [Extension of Hme granted.] The Minister for External Affairs referred to the fact that China was now controlled hy a Communist Government. The Minister must, of course, accept facts as they are, hut I suggest that it would he erroneous to assume that China will always remain Communist. Within recent years, an intense spirit of nationalism has developed in Asiatic countries, and the extraordinary thing about this nationalist fervour is that it can unite all sections of the community at understanding between in the fight for national independence, no matter how hostile those sections may be to one another on other issues. Even the Chinese Nationalist Government that has now been replaced by a Communist Governnient has the assistance of the Communist foree3 in achieving national unity. However, ^ the Nationalist Government was a military one, and military governments have always been distasteful to the Chinese, who are essentially a peaceloving people. Therefore, there came about a combination of forces in the oountry which gradually displaced the old Nationalist Government and replaced it by another government. However, tbose who study the history of China, and understand its customs and traditions realize that it would be unwise to dismiss the possibility that, before long, the same forces that achieved national unity will eventually dispose of Communist control in China. I regret that the Minister fbr External Affairs did not mention the work of the International Lahour Office, which has operated for more than 30 years, during which time it has done much to improve economic conditions in many countries. It is the one institution that has survived out of the many created by the League of Nations. regarded as part and parcel of the United Natioiis organization. The Internationa] Labour Organization is an organization which acts under a charter peculiarly its own, and which is based on the belief that an enduring peace can be achieved only on the basi3 of social justice. In the International Labour Organization are brought together representatives of the three factors that constitute the modern state. It consists of representatives of governments, representatives of employers and representatives of workers. The governing body consists of sixteen government representatives, employers and eight representatives of the workers. We have not heard so much iu Australia about the work of the International Labour Organization because working conditions here are immensely superior to those in most other countries, hut the organization has done work of enormous value in improving working conditions in such countries as India, Burma, Indonesia, &c. Indeed, its work cannot he praised too highly. The census taken in India'in 1931 showed that of all the people employed in that country only 11 per cent, were engaged in handcrafts or industries. Seeing that in India most articles are made by hand, it is evident that only a very small proportion of the population is employed in recognized industries. No less than 70 per cent, of the population is engaged in agriculture, but the average income of those so engaged was 48 rupees a year which, at the rate of exchange then prevailing, represented £3 13s. sterling, or £4 l is . Australian, or fifteen dollars in United States of America currency. Those facts enable us to appreciate the tremendous task which confronts the other nations if they are to carry out really and fervently the policy of trying to improve the economic conditions of the people of Asia. I suggest that we in Australia should adopt a policy in which we agree, first, that it is the right of all other countries to have the same capacity and right to self-government as we have; secondly, that all other countries have the same right to economic development as we have; and thirdly, that all other counTo-day, it is tries have the same right to security from aggression that we ask for ourselves. Our best contribution to world peace can be made by indicating to other countries that we believe that they have the right to be protected from the aggrandizement of other nations, and by pursuing a policy that seeks goodwill, understanding and friendliness with the nations close to Australia. I deplore the suggestion that we should enter into defensive pacts. The introduction of non-aggressionpacts between Australia and its neighbours, in which we indicate that we have no aggressive tendencies towards them, and they eight representatives of agree that they have no aggressive tendencies towards us, will help very materially. Complete frankness should be the keynote of our diplomatic relations with other countries. Trickery, or anything that resembles it, should be eliminated from our relations with them. Finally, I suggest that we, as a community, should do as we did at Philadelphia and San Francisco, and agree that we are prepared to meet other nations in order to come to such an understanding about economic conditions as will help them to give their people security in employment, just as we seek that kind of security for our people. Recently, a sub-committee appointed hy the United Nations made a lengthy and valuable' report on full employment, and it was suggested that a conference of nations should he held on that subject. sincerely hope that Australia will he represented at that conference and if an understanding with every other country will assist us to develop and channel our economic progress towards full employment, we should make every endeavour to reach such a basis of agreement. I understand that Australia has surplus stocks of flour. Approximately 22,000 tons of that commodity are held in Western Australia, and if those supplies are not disposed of they will possibly become unfit for human consumption. Excess foodstuffs should be used to assist other countries which, at the present time, are unahle to provide sufficient food for their own people. If we proceed on the lines which I have described; if we indicate our willingness to live in peace with our neighbours; and if we convey to them our willingness to help them culturally, economically and in other respects, we shall make a big contribution to the maintenance of world peace. again, I find myself in agreement with a good deal of what the honorahle membeT for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) has said. It must be evident to the Government and to the Minister for External Affairs( Mr nations throughout the ages until the stage Spender) that the multiplicity of views which have been expressed in this debate indicate that all the knowledge, ideas, and, indeed, brains are not wholly on the Government or the Opposition side of the chamber. The Minister stated that the Government proposes to appoint a foreign affairs committee, and that announcement will be welcomed throughout the country. I hope that when the members of that committee are selected, representation will be given to all political parties in this Parliament, and to all States. represented in the Cabinet? with the position. I realize that I may be accused cf being parochial when I suggest that all States and all parties should be represented on the committee, but I have excellent reasons for doing so. A foreign affairs committee which was not representative of every State could make decisions which might be I detrimental to a State which was not represented on it hecause the members of the committee might not have a proper realization of the f u ll impact of foreign policy. Too much attention might be devoted to one part of Australia, and that might not be in the national interests. I have carefully read the report of the Minister's speech on international affairs, and I believe that the honourable gentleman is following the right lines in laying down Australia's foreign policy. We must determine exactly the course that we desire to take in our relations with other countries. What precisely are our aims? Are we seeking national security, by which I mean security against foreign aggression, or are we seeking national expansion, by which I mean the imperialistic policy of territorial gain? Are we concerned with economic security and that form of economic nationalism which. was the basis of the foreign policy of nearly every nation prior to World War II . ? In the period of which I speak, each nation had the idea that it could live within its own boundaries, and, without suffering any detrimental effects, allow its neighbour to go to grass. Economic necessity has directed the foreign policy of has now been reached at which one power is determined to impose its ideology upon the rest of the world. That power has adopted a policy of imperialism, and territorial gain, regardless of its economic necessity. Australia should base its policy upon its needs, but whatever that line may be, I hope that it will be a continuing policy. The practice of changing our foreign policy when a new government takes office, and literally from Minister to Minister, could lead to pitfalls which could be avoided. Wo all States should follow a definite line. We should ask ourselves to whom we shall go for assistance and what steps we should take to ensure that our foreign policy, whatever it may be, is implemented. Mention has been made in this debate of the United Nations. We should consider what are our prospects of success if we continue to depend solely on that organization. We must analyse the possibilities of other member nations depending solely",21,Spender

62,"Mr Leslie.,","I am quite satisfiedon the United Nations. We should ask ourselves whether they will be prepared to limit their sovereignty and accept without question the ultimate decisions oi such an international body. Without the threat of force in the background, the United Nations is merely a farce. There must be a greater willingness on the part of the nations to accept its decisions. Oan we say that we will accept them if they are against our interests ? Inside our own country we have an institution which is somewhat analogous, in a domestic way, tofcheUnited Nations in the world sphere. I refer to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Yet the arbitration system is being "" hit to leg "" almost every day in the week. We have agreed to accept without question the decisions of the arbitration court, hut when they run counter to our interests. «'e invariably reject them. What prospect, then, is there of success in an interpolicy which could be likened to dangling national body such as the United Nations? We must rely on our own resources, and seek assistance wherever we can obtain it. Last night the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton) told us that we can expect little help from the British Empire in the form of armed assistance should our security he threatened. Our first duty is to make security firm inside our own borders. Our greatest danger to-day comes not from abroad but from within Australia itself. I. do not believe that there is any immediate danger that an attack will be made upon us from outside. While pressure groups attempt to wrest power from the Government, how ca.n we possibly be secure against a force from outside? possibility of achieving uninterrupted production and development in this country, we shall continue to be vulnerable. Our first duty is to provide for our security against those in Australia who would destroy it. As the Government is already accepting its responsibility far guarding our security against attacks from outside, I shall not deal with that aspect of the problem at this stage. Our second duty is to ensure that we are not surrounded by nations that are likely to become aggressive towards us. We can do that only through one avenue-the field of trade. So, our foreign policy must be based upon economic security for ourselves, and, as far as practicable, for others. I am not one of those who subscribe to the. belief that intense nationalism exists in the countries of the far east, the near east or the near north. It is true that in recent times the normal patriotic spirit of the peoples of those countries has been intensified as the result of their desire to rid themselves of economic insecurity, unsatisfactory living conditions and many other factors that fomented discontent among them. They saw adjacent to them a land of abundance while they continued to go without so many of the things which they required. Instead of trying to help them to raise their standards to a level more closely approaching our own, we adopted the a carrot in front of a donkey. Again it was a case of "" haves "" and "" have nots "". That was a national tragedy. In the peoples of those countries there is no intense national spirit, hut there is an intense desire for economic security. It is in the direction of satisfying that desire that we, as a nation which produces in abundance the goods that they require, can play our part. I am very much concerned with that aspect of our foreign policy. Much as has been said during this debate about the Russian menace, I agree that we must do everything possible to stem the tide of Russian aggression. One way in which we can at least help to hold it in check is by assisting the peoples of the Near East to attain ecoWhile there is so little nomic security.

66,Mr Leslie,I have held a gun in arrangement with America concerning,27,Spender
67,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [4.1].,"but also to tbe world. Something has happened which has rendered meaningless tbe terms we hare been using in this debate. New weapons, particularly atomic weapons, have changed the meaning of the old terms connected with foreign affairs. A new conflict would be a world conflict and not a conflict in which there would be any reasonable safety. ""We should be as safe as Britain andAmerica, and no safer. It seems to me that honourable members of this House think that by attending to the problems of the Pacific the safety of Australia will be safeguarded. That is an unrealistic attitude. If there is to Russia a clique is using the idea of combe another war it will be a world war the outcome of which will be final for all people in all parts of the globe. New weapons, particularly atomic weapons, bave introduced the possibility of sudden attack against which traditional forces will provide no protection. The next conflict may be decided in 24 hours. The new weapons carry with them possibilities of complete devastation and destruction which have been lacking in previous conflicts. Therefore, there are new terms in which we must discuss all matters of foreign policy. During the last four years there has been a drift towards war. At the commencement of those four years there was hope. One side had a monopoly of atomic weapons and the United States of America, speaking for that side, had offered to hand over to an international authority the whole of its atomic armaments, provided only that there would be a world-wide force which would ensure that no other nation took advantage of the offer of the United States not to conThe Marxist will not baulk at complete struct atomic armaments secretly in violation of its contract. If that offer had dangers could have heen avoided, hut it was not accepted and we have now drifted to the position where one side has not a monopoly of the new weapons although, for a year or two, it will have a monopoly of quantity. There is still reason to believe that Bussia has still only a few atomic .bombs although it may pretend to have many. Russia is still in what may be described as the "" soft shell"" period. The United States of America has larger stocks of atomic bombs than has Russia. The coming two years will be vital for the whole of humanity. During that time, we must arrange for the control of atomic armaments on an international basis or the world will be destroyed in an atomic war. [Quorum formed.'] All honourable members who. have spoken in this debate have recognized the existing hostility between Russia and America. Some honourable members have attributed this hostility to the idea of communism; some to the idea of a resurgent Russian nationalism. I think that both conceptions are partly right and partly wrong. In munism and the idea of nationalism as a means of obtaining and extending their power. Communism is not merely an idea. Communism is a method. Communism has developed from simple Marxism which was an idea, through Leninism, which is primarily a method of applying that idea. Leninism has developed into Stalinism which teaches that the idea of world revolution taking place spontaneously in various countries must give way to the idea of Russia as the fortress of world revolution, finally extending the revolution by force of arms. Leninism is the method for the practice of Marxism. Stalinism teaches war as the method of implementing Leninism. Atomic weapons are particularly suited to the use of totalitarian power. They are suitable for sudden and treacherous attacksa super Pearl Harbour. They are suitable for use by a fifth column. But that is not their most important attribute, which is, that they wreak complete destruction.' destruction, because it is a tenet of Marxism that communism is only waitbeen accepted all the present ing to be born and will emerge automatically as soon as the capitalist order is destroyed. Therefore, the Communist will not hesitate to destroy the world, believing that from the destruction communism must of necessity emerge supreme. For those reasons, there will be no hope of reaching agreement with Russia once atomic power is completely in Russia's hands. Let us not delude ourselves. Russia would refrain from atomic attack only while it could achieve its ends by other means. Once checked by other means, it would inevitably use its delay while the vital process of atomic atomic force. ber for East Sydney( Mr Ward) says Charter of the United Nations, decisions that we can talk Russia out of war. honourable member for East Sydney, with members, including the concurring votes his undoubted eloquence, could not talk of the five great powers, and, under Article Stalin into adopting a policy of peace.

Under Articles 108 and 109, atomic weapons in Russia, and the second any alteration of the Charter itself is is to avoid war until Russia is ready to subject to the Russian veto, and the strike.

What then arc we to do? Must we calmly continue to acquiesce in this drift towards disaster? We still have a little time, though not much, in which to act. Our remedy must have three features. First, it must provide for the effective control of atomic energy. Secondly, it must be quick, because otherwise it will be useless. Thirdly, it must be international because otherwise it cannot be quick and will not secure acquiescence from our own people or other people in time to prevent disaster. At first sight, it would appear as though we can effect such a remedy only through fhe United Nations. I have already suggested that the United Nations is powerless, but it is not altogether impotent. There is still one flaw in the charter from Russia's point of view. That flaw arises from the operation of Article 27, Avhich provides that, at votes in the Security Council when decisions made under Chapter VI . are in question, a. party to a dispute shall abstain from voting.

Russia could he expelled under Chapter VI . by the General Assembly acting Upon the recommendation of the Security Council. Tf such action were taken quickly, the United Nations would become a workable force free from the Operation of the Bussian veto and would be able for thc first time to contemplate a world-wide scheme of atomic security enforcement, without which We shall assuredly perish in the ""fifties. I know that such a solution is not pleasant. It has implications that arc repugnant, I believe, to every honourable member. Yeti t is the only solution. It 'offers the only way of avording war. The position of China, as a nation which has the right to 'exercise a veto, has an important bearing upon this proposal. It is perfectly clear that Russia is now endeavouring to buttress its own position in the United Nations by getting another permanent vote on its side through the expedient of persuading us to recognize the Communist Government of China. The prime reason for not recognizing that regime seems to me to be that, by so doing, we can prevent it from voting in the United Nations. I know that the solution that I propose would divide the world, but it would be better to divide the world cleanly now than to have our enemies working inside our own organization and rendering abortive every move"" that we make there. I know that the pr&posal involves the possibility of war,, though I do not think that it would lead, to war. However, the question would not. be whether we chose war or not. Anyother course of procedure would involvethe certainty of war. My proposal ate least offers the possibility of avoiding war. It offers, if not certain success, at least a chance of success. From our point of view, the last four years have been four vital years. The previous Government played a large.part in making possible the drift towards inevitable war. Through its representative, who occupied a distinguished posiI n such circumstances, the tion in the United Nations, that Government did more, by its negligence, to make war possible than any other government of this country had ever done. The Evatt policy was not wrong in detail; it was wrong wholly and fundamentally. The United Nations should be built into a formidable force, but the policy of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) was to maintain it as a sham force so as to give a sense of fallacious security to the world and to prevent any real security from being attained. In'1946, 1947 and 1948 the avoidance of future war would have been cjuite easy. At that time the Western democracies held all the important cards. Power was on our side, and a peace plan put forward at that time and hacked by that power would have been successful. To-day fewer of the cards are in our hand although the hand is still a winning one. To-day the chances of avoiding war are definitely less than they were in the locust years of the Gihifley Government. But there is still a chance if we act quickly and resolutely. There will he no chance if the drift continues. AlthoughI have criticized the previous Governnient, these are matters that are too big to be decided on party lines. I hope that honourable members will think that I am not so much criticizing the previous Government or even the previous Minister for External Affairs as trying to suggest a way by which the world can still be saved. This is a little House representing a little people; only 8,000,000 of them. It may be asked what chance have we to do anything in this great world. I believe that we still have a chance. When the storm clouds are gathering, a handful of dust thrown into them will cause a condensation of the droplets, because of tbe tensions that exist in the clouds, and precipitate a storm. That is analogous to the state of affairs in tlie world to-day. A tension existR and some small thing might serve to crystallize it and cause a storm. Therefore, this small House representing this small people can, if it is resolute, still do something to save the world. Mr W. M. BOUEKE (Fawkner) ever, while the United Nations exists we [4.33j -The debate on foreign affairs should continue to support it and hope initiated by the Minister for External that it may be able to extend its influence.

My reaction to those remarks been bewildered and confused by what is to say that it is a pity that the honorwas said. What part are we, as a small country in the Pacific, to play in this able member for Mackellar was not great drama of world affairs? Despite present on the international scene at the the remarks of the honourable member for time so that he could have worked out Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) there seems something better than did President to be fairly general agreement amongst Truman, Mr Churchill and Dr. Evatt. honourable members of this House that I think that all members of this House there are three broad general prinwill admit that our previous Minister for ciples to which we all conform. We all External Affairs raised Australia's presagree that Australia should play its part tige, and held its name high in the in the British Commonwealth of Nations, councils of the world. I suggest that it and that that should be a fundamental wa-s presumptuous of the honourable memprinciple of our policy. We should all ber for Mackellar to condemn him in the try to make stronger the machinery of way in which he did. the British Commonwealth, as was suggested by the late John Curtin. All of Australia's foreign policy-adherenc e honourable members agree that Australia should strengthen its ties with the United States. When the battle of the Coral Sea is recalled, the battle which halted the southward march of the Japanese forces when they swept around the eastern point of New Guinea and were on their way to Port Moresby and Australia, it will he recognized that had it not been for the sea and air power of the United State's the Japanese would have landed in Australia and taken the country. If that had happened perhap# we should not be sitting in this House to-day. There is little doubt that if in the future we are threatened by another invasion, we shall again have to rely upon the strength of a friendly United States to protect us. Therefore, close relations with the United States is a sine qua non of our foreign policy. We all agree that Australia should continue to play its part in the United Nations organization, despite the weakness of that body, and despite the fact that it may crash because of the intransigence of Soviet Busisa. HowI was horrified to hear some of thr I have indicated the general principles to the British Commonwealth, close ties with the United States and adherence to the United Nations--bu t the real problem arises when the attempt is made to work out a detailed foreign policy for this small country. Shall we be concerned with all the problems in all the quarters of the world, or shall we select certain aspects of foreign affairs and concentrate upon them? In determining what part Australia should play in the world we must bear in mind two fundamental principles: First, Australia is not a great power; and, secondly, we have limited resources and a small population. played a conspicuous part, a part out of proportion with our size, in two world wars, has taken us into a leading role in the forum of the world. We are fortunate in having had a figure of the stature and eminence of the former Minister for External Affairs to take advantage of that role. Echoing the sentiments of honourable members in this House. I say that I too hope that tbe present Minister will be able to live up to the reputation of his predecessor, and that he will be able to maintain the prestige of Australia in the high position in which it was placed by that right honourable gentleman. When determining what commitments this country can enter into we must bear in mind that our resources are limited, and that consequently our activity in the sphere of world affairs must also be limited. Another determining factor is our geographical position. It is a very sobering experience for Australians to study a map of that part of the world in which our country is situated. In. our near north are China, Japan and the Philippines. Farther south are Indo-China and Thailand and towards the extremity of the continent of Asia, stretching out like a finger pointing at the heart of Australia, is British Malaya. Adjoining the south-eastern extremity of Asia and extending in the direction of Australia is the series of islands now known as the United States of Indonesia. These appear as so many giant stepping-stones connecting the Asian mainland with Australia. Those steppingstones, if they fall into the hands of an .enemy, can, as we have reason to remember, constitute a terrible threat to Anstralia. The south-eastern extremity of Asia, the islands between that area and the Australian mainland, and Australia itself, provide a dividing line between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Although this country has been spoken of as a Pacific power because the waters of the Pacific wash its eastern shores it is also a power in the Indian Ocean because the waters of that ocean wash its western and north-western shores. The four great former British colonies of India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Burma are the main Indian Ocean powers as far as Australia-is concerned. Our relaThe fact that we have tionship with those countries is very important. I suggest that it is axiomatic that we should consider the geographical area of our near neighbours as that upon which our foreign policy should be concentrated. Concerning the proximity of foreign nations to us, it should be remembered that although New Zealand, which is linked to Australia by the name of ANZAC, has always been regarded as our next-door neighbour, the distance between Sydney and Wellington by air is considerably less than that between Darwin and Djakarta, the capital of the United States of Indonesia and that there are portions of Indonesia which are closer to Australia than Djakarta. Asiatic countries are our nearest neighbours. Moreover, it is in the Asian sphere that the trouble spot of the world is developing in the year 1950. It appears to me, although I Have no expert knowledge about this subject, that Soviet Russia, finding itself no longer able to carry out its aggressive designs in Europe, has now turned its attention elsewhere. China having become Communist the aggressive expansion of B.ussia will spread through South-East Asia. That is of vital significance to us because of the geographical relationship between that part of the world and Australia. In this area French Indo-China w ill be the focus of world attention and the trouble spot of 1950. In Vietnam, the French have set up a kind of a union of States under French control, modelled on the lines of the British Commonwealth. It is, however, an imperfect model. The French have recognized in that region a leader named Bao Dai, but there exists also a rebel authority on the pattern with which we have become familiar in soiaih-eastecn Ewope. It is led by Ho Obi Minh, wbo 1 bas a considerable army. His territoryis adjacent to' China, and he is being 1 supplied from that eountry. It appears that Vietnam maywell becomethe Greece of Asia. Perhaps, in. that area, tbe forces supported by the Western Democracies, and* thosesupported by the Communists-, will clash as they bave clashed in Greece. In the course of this debate, reference has been made to Dutch New Guinea,, an area that is of particular importance to Australia because it is so close to us. It is place when the United States of a part of a. tropical island,, and has vast natural resources which have been practically untouched. The Dutch made no real effort to colonize the area. They had othei' things to do, and they looked upon their part of New Guinea as having no immediate value. Now that the Dutch have gone out. of Indonesia,. Dutch New Guinea has. hit the head-lines hecause of the claims of Indonesia to that territory. There is no need for me toemphasize the point made by previous speakers on both sides, of the House that the Indonesians have, mo real claim to Dutch New Guinea. The only basis of their claim is that, the Dutch at one time ruled in Indonesia, and that they also rule in Dutch New Guinea. Now that the Indonesian have won their independence, they want to get the Dutch right out of the area altogether, and they, regard themselves as heirs to all tha Dutch possessions. I suggest, that it worold he a* good tbing for the world if tbe Dutch, were out, of New Guinea. As long as, they remain, Dutch New Guinea -ill ' be a. focal point for trouble.

BOURKE. -That, is a point which we> might, discuss, later. There is ample historical precedent for the coiwae I suggest. It is worth putting on record that, in 1803, a. somewhat similar transaction took America purchased Louisana from Napoleon. They bought that magnificent area of over 1,000,00.0 square miles in the Mississippi Valley for a mere 15,;000,'000. dollars.. Tbat was, a most remarkable acquisitionof territory for so small an outlay. Tbe United States of America, in 1821,, purchased Florida from Spain, another example of tbe transfer of sovereignty in return fioaa cash consideration.. In 1.848, tbe United States of America purchased a part, of New Mexico, and a part, of California from Mexico'. In 1S67-, tbe United States of Ameiiea purchased! Alaska f&oaani Russia.

71,Mr Ken T Hughes,"That would notgeneralization, but was suggesting that there was a lack of understanding and appreciation of the problems that face the eastern nations in their dealings with the western world. As a preliminary to taking part in world affairs, we should attempt to understand and appreciate the enormous and complex problems that confront our neighbours in the very near north. The problems of the South-East Asian nations fall under three heads. In the first place, the peoples of those countries occupy one of the most thickly populated areas in the world. They number more than a thousand million persons and, despite a very high death rate, despite disease, pestilence, wars and ships to enable people from Asian counfloods, the population is increasing at an enormous rate. One day we shall have to face the problem of where the surplus people are to settle. Secondly, we must recognize that the forces of nationalism are rampant in Asia. We are witnessing what is, perhaps, the most vital and significant fact in the history of the Twentieth Century, the awakening of Asia. Some people fear and hate that fact, and say that we should attempt to frustrate the efforts of the people of Asia to achieve national independence. I believe that we should welcome their awakening as an inevitable occurrence, and try to win the friendship and cooperation of the Asian peoples. That brings me to the third basic fact that Ave should attempt to realize; that is, the grinding poverty and grim misery which are the constant companions of the unfortunate people of so large a part of Asia. Let me give one illustration from India where living standards are so low as to be almost inconceivable to us. It has been calculated that the national income of India is just sufficient to feed two-thirds of the people on the lowest and coarsest and least nutritious diet, with no allowance at all for housing, clothing, or recreation. That is an alarming state of affairs. We may well ask what happens to the other third of the population. The answer seems to be that they do not live; they just die. In India, the expectation of life for the average male is 27 years. In Australia, it is 63 years. A great many Indians die just when they should be in the prime of their youth. Can we do anything to help the people Of Asia to solve their problems? We can do very little to help them in the economic sphere. The task is too great, and it would be beyond our resources to render any effective aid. However, we could give them technical and mechanical assistance, even though it might be only of a token nature. Our own needs are great, but it should bo possible to send experts and technicians to train the people of Asia in improved methods of agriculture. We might also provide some maehinery. We eould help in the organization of medical services, of hospitals, maternity centres, dispensaries, &c. We could provide scholartries to come to Australia to train themselves in Our technical colleges and universities. When they returned to their own countries they would he emissaries of goodwill. They would be living symbols of the help that Australia was offering to their countries. There might also be more contact between Australia and South-East Asia on the level of the people. Contact on government level is necessary, but we should go below that, and get to the people themselves. 1 suggest that we should send abroad commercial ancl sporting delegations. The thought occurs to me that one method that we could employ to let the people of India and Indonesia learn to know and understand the kind of people we are and to come to the conclusion that perhaps we are not so bad after all, would be to send a couple of football teams to those countries. If two teams were selected from the electorate of Fawkner, perhaps the association team of Prahran and the adjoining league team of St. Kilda ball. the game iii which a football is used. umpire.

Therefore, we must do as the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) did, and accept that man as the President of the United States of Indonesia, and also accept his protestations that he is a democrat, until there is proof to the contrary. The honorahle member for Eremantle ( Mr mixed. Perhaps they may be best Beazley), in a well-considered discourse on events in Europe, gave the House many matters for thought. But when he dealt with Burma he said that we must restore stability in that country and omitted the formality of telling us how that should be done. The honourable member for Indi( Mr Bostock) promptly whispered in my ear a thought that had also occurred to me, namely, does he expect us to grow rice in the Biverina as food for the Burmese? That proposition, of course, is utterly impossible. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) delivered a learned and excellent discourse, but he reminded me of the displaced actor who gazed from the "" gods"" upon the stage on which he had recently played a prominent part. Very humanlike, he felt that he would like to he there again. A.ll of us probably would have a similar feeling if we were in the same position. The right honourable gentleman is now on the outside, looking in, and he may have come to realize that his first love has been unfaithful to him, because the United Nations, when it was faced with the real problems of the world, was not any more effective than its predecessor, the League of Nations, had been. To me, those four speeches were ful l of interest, because four of the leading members of the Opposition who made them advocated different policies. BeforeI express my views about Australia's foreign policy, I should like to comment on a statement that was made by the honourable member for St. George( Mr Graham) last week. He said that he could understand an ex-prisoner of war hating and wanting to shoot every Japanese that he found about the place. I want to say definitely that I do not bate the Japanese. I do not hate any man because the pigmentation of his skin is not pink. I have fought shoulder to shoulder with practically every race from Mecca to Mukden. escorted hy a Japanese battle cruiser when the first convoy left Australia in the first world war. One cannot hate in that sense. In fact, my mind goes back to a hospital ship in the Yellow Sea in September, 1945. We were leaving Manchuria, and our thoughts were very summarized in the following lines:Fierce hatreds liave been bred by war, No love is won but at some cost, The peace, the world has sought before. So rarely found-so often lost WiU not be kept by pride and greed, By laziness or endless talk, By sneering at a lesser breed, Or laughing at his ape-like walk. We cannot build anything on a foundation of hatred, and 1 do not believe that any ex-prisoner of war really hates the Japanese. But we have learned a great deal ahout them. I expect that we have learned as much as, or more than, most Western people have learned in the same time about an oriental race. Europeans have great difficulty in understanding orientals, and, therefore, any views that we have are based on the knowledge and understanding that our experiences have brought to us, and not on hatred or any feeling of racial superiority. Those who have been through two wars and escaped more or less unscathed are not seen in the role of sabre rattlers. We who had fought in World WarI . reckoned that we had a fifty-fifty chance when we went to the second world war, and I do not know what our chance would be in a third world war. Of course, none of us desires such a catastrophe to befall the world However, I feel that those experiences give us a greater sense of realism and a better right to talk on subjects of this kind than many other people possess. We realize that, in diplomacy, words must be carefully weighed, yet sometimes we must be frank and firm, particularly when dealing with Eastern races, unless we are to be placed in the position of losing "" face "", which is the greatest crime that is known in the Ear East. Loss of "" face "" is something that a westerner understands sometimes, but nothing like to the same degree as the oriental. We should be firm and frank, as the Minister and other people, including myself, have been, towards Indonesia I was even with respeot to New Guinea, but we should try to be frank without being unnecessarily offensive. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Melbourne, who did excellent work as Minister for Immigration, spoilt a good deal of it by "" bull in the china shop "" diplomacy. I might not have disagreed with some of his ideas, but I disagreed with his methods. Sometimes it is advisable to forget the lesser in order to gain the greater, and, unfortunately, individual actions by the Minister aroused in the Far East, and among the races with whom we desire to be on friendly terms, a great deal of enmity. the press. that the honourable member for Melbourne did not arouse that enmity intentionally, but we all must guard against a repetition of that mistake. In this respect I would appeal for an alteration, not of our immigration policy, but of the name "" White Australia oolicy "", for the simple reason that to supersensitive young nations in the Far East, the adjective "" white "" is offensive, although the immigration policy itself is not offensive to them. Those people believe in "" China for the Chinese "", and "" India for the Indians "", but they do not talk about a ""black India"" or a "" yellow China "". If we do not understand their viewpoint we sometimes rush in where we should tread very lightly. I join with other honourable memhers on both sides of the chamber who have congratulated the Minister for External Affairs on his clear, comprehensive and detailed review of the international situation. thoughtful. It might have been, as the honourable member for Melbourne said, a replay of an old piece. Perhaps some of it was like the speech that the right bonorable member for Barton made in February, 1949, hut the honorahle member for Melbourne knows how statements on international affairs are compiled. ""Whether or not his criticism was just, there was a good deal of original material in the Minister's speech, and the subjects that really mattered were highlighted and put in a perspective where they could not be missed. The points that he brought out differed entirely from the speech that was made by the right honourable member for Barton in 1949. The Minister outlined the short-term policy, and the long term policy, the aims, ideals and objectives, and many honourable members on both sides of the chamber will agree with the views that were expressed by him. I not only agree with the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Hasluck) that there was a note of realism in the statement on foreign affairs, but I go further and say that there was need for considerably more than that. There might be even more realism than the Minister has displayed. We want not one note of realism, but the whole keyboard of the piano of realism played in crescendo. Four years after VP Day-fou r years in which the Labour locusts have eaten so ravenously that not a vestige of the verdure of security remains in Australiawe are still inclined to become fat with luxurious living. We are too inclined to want to go back to the false paradise in which we lived before the last war struck us. Although we want to support the United Nations, to back it up to the hilt and hope that it will succeed, we must realize that there is no difference between the League of Nations with America a non-member and the United Nations with Russia as a member but exercising the power of veto. The right honourable member for Barton expressed that very view in somewhat similar words last week. On the subject of action the Minister's speech was vague, discursive and uncertain. That was only natural for it is very difficult to act, in international affairs. The recent British Oommonwealth Conference at Colombo His speech was studied and was a great success yet the foreign ministers for Britain and France said last week that neither had yet been approached by the Australian Government in relation to the decisions that were taken there. A conference of the big three nations is to be held in London next month. That is to be followed by a conference in Canberra next May. Conference, conference, conference; talk, talk, talk!

[5.32] 1 think all honourable members will pay tribute to the ability with which the honourable member for Chisholm( Mr ber for Chisholm has put forward most Kent Hughes), who has just re-sumed his seat presented his case and to the depth of feeling which characterized his remarks. It is important to note that general agreement has been expressed in this debate on certain basic aspects of our foreign policy and that a thread of understanding has run through practically all speeches. I feel that it will augur well for the ultimate foreign policy of Australia if this understanding can be deepened and brought into continuous play by the appointment of a committee on foreign affairs, on which honourable members may be able to devise means for the development and defence of Australia. Tbe honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley) said that he thought it was a pity that the scope of the Minister's statement, and therefore of this debate, was so wide. He said it was rather difficult in the time at our disposal to bring forward any series of facts which might be of real value. I sympathize with that opinion, but I feel that the Minister would have done less than justice to himself and to this House had he not presented, at the beginning of his ministry, as complete and comprehensive a survey of world affairs as it was possible for him to prewe find that the infiltration of Bussian pare. We .must endeavour to adjust ourcommunism into the East is not so much selves to that circumstance. Whilst it the cause as the occasion of what has is desirable to define specific issues of happened there.

WhilstI agree generally with the. statements placed before the house by the Minister, I find that I cannot extend unqualified approval to what the honourable gentleman has put forward. Bound up with his statement is what has been called the Spender plan, and I have grave doubts about the extent to which that plan is practicable. The honourable memcogent and practical reasons why Australia should not disperse its activities and its man-power and brain-power too widely over the world at this stage of its development, and why we should concentrate on the job at hand, which calls for the exercise of every capacity that we may possess. There is a remarkable difference between the distribution of world power at present and at the commencement of World War II . When World War II . commenced there were at least six great powers-no t all equal, but still great powers-exercisin g a strong influence on the world's affairs. When the war ended there were, unfortunately, but two great powers in the fullest sense of the term; they were the United States of America and Soviet Bussia. That is the position which confronts us at the present time. We might like to believe that Australia can strut on the world's platform with all the appearance of a great power. We might like to believe, if we wish, that the British Commonwealth is as strong as it was after the first world war, but if we are honest we shall face the facts.

Even if the other members of the Commonwealth cannot bring themselves to join wholeheartedly with us, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand can stand solidly together in support of a common policy ou international affairs, a policy that has been lacking during the last four or five years. We must not again neglect such opportunities to strengthen the Empire as were allowed to pass while the previous Government played around with that nebulous body, the United Nations, in whose affairs unity appears to have no part. We can make Australia once more an integral part of a great combination of nations, capable of standing beside the United States of America against the rest of the world, if we devote our energies to the reinforcement of the British 'Commonwealth and place that necessity first in our foreign policy. By reinstating the Commonwealth in its former position, we can establish a balanced condition in the world that will not exist while the United States of America and Soviet Bussia. remain as the only great powers. Balance is life. When balance is destroyed life is destroyed, and when balance in international affairs is destroyed the lives of nations are destroyed with it. The populations of the principal members of the British Commonwealth are as follows:United Kingdom Canada .. 13,200,000 Australia . . South Africa. .\ ew ZealandT .. Approximate total .. 75,000,000 Those figures show that there are two Britishers in the British Isles for every white Britisher elsewhere in the world. But the balance is shifting! The increase of our population by the immigration, not only of Britishers, but also of foreigners who adhere to British culture and customs, deserves from this House a degree of attention that it has not received in the past. I have frequently advocated the establishment of a council of the British Commonwealth consisting of senior Ministers from the respective member countries. The United Kingdom already has a Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. [Extension of time granted.] Every country in the British Commonwealth should have a Minister empowered to concentrate his attention upon matters affecting Commonwealth relations and joint policies. One important duty of a council such as I have in mind could be to deal with Empire tariff problems. I do not suggest the introduction of free trade between the Commonwealth countries; that would not be practical politics. However, the member nations should enjoy that degree of freedom amongst themselves which exists between the Eederal Government of the United States of America and the governments of the States of that great republic, or even between the component States of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Our allies in the United States of America should recognize the faet that the British Commonwealth is just as much a national unit as are the States of the American Union. They are entitled to treat tariff rates and exchange rates within the Commonwealth as matters of their own exclusive concern. There would be some chance of establishing stability in the world if we could secure recognition of that right and establish a common policy for all British nations. Under such a system^ Australia would cease to be merely a* small nation of 8,000,000 people. No .. . 50,000,000 longer could it be regarded as an un.. 8,000.000 official State of the United States of .. .. 2,400,000 America. It would he an integral part 1,800,000 of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I realize that the honourable member for Chisholm was probably speaking in jocular vein when he suggested that Australia should occupy the role of an American State, but this is not the time for joking about such matters We face the greatest crisis in our history. Much as I admire and respect the United States of America, J cannot contemplate with equanimity even a light-hearted suggestion that the British Commonwealth of Nations should be dissolved. I say that while having full regard for the great work that the United States of America did in assisting us during the war and for the magnificent contribution that it has made to world reconstruction since hostilities ended. I sincerely trust that this Government will see its way clear to urge the establishment of a council of Ministers, not merely a committee of High Commissioners, the object of which should be to repair and strengthen the fabric of the British Commonwealth. It may be suggested that it would be unpractical to appoint a Minister for Commonwealth Relations as well as a Minister for External Affairs, but I point out accept the theory that worthwhile objecin reply that the United Kingdom Government has considered it advisable to adopt such a policy. Why, therefore, should we not do likewise? I have spoken critically of the United Nations, but I should not like it to be thought that I wish to witness the disappearance of an organization that may be able to foster a better understanding between the peoples of the world and that may tackle successfully some of the lesser tinue to euppport the United Nations; problems of international relationships. We should consider the situation of the United Nations from a realistic standpoint. birth of the League of Nations and its unfortunate end, and who recall its lamentable history notwithstanding such useful work as it did accomplish, cannot fail to regard with apprehension the claim nations. that has been made that the United Nations can be used as a sort of perambulator in which the nations of the world can be wheeled along to a nursery in which they can learn to be great and good. With the late Sir Thomas Bavin, I was a foundation member of the League of Nations Union in Sydney. LaterI became Minister for Education in New South Wales, and, in that capacity, with the aid of my officers, I pressed for the education of children in the ideals of the technique which has come to be known as League of Nations. At the very time when our children were sending goodwill messages to children in Japan, Germany and Italy, the hard-boiled dictator? in those countries were laughing up their sleeves and preparing the slug vvith which they hoped to knock the world to pieces. I do not want anything like that to happen again. I consider that I, personally, wa9 culpable in aiding the training of children in New South Wales to hold the view that, if people merely wished for peace, they could be assured of peace without having ifr. Drummond. to fight for the ideals upon which peace is based. When World War II . broke out, I was told that innumerable young teachers and others were disloyal to Australia because they would not co-operate in training 'for the defence of the nation. They were not disloyal. The simple truth is that they had been mentally and morally disarmed. Eor ten years or more they had been taught to tives could be achieved by wishful thinking and mental laziness. They were not capable at first of grasping the idea that they must fight in order to preserve their ideals. However, when they did grasp that fact,Australia's stocks rose throughout the world. I do not want such tragic mistakes to be repeated as the result of a tendency to mental inertia and lack of realism in our young people. I trust that Australia will conbut that our people will be told plainly that the organization is merely an aid to the establishment of better international Those of us who witnessed the relationships and that they must display energy and enterprise in dealing with their own problems in the international field if they are to be capable of defending Australia and gaining the respect of other Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. adjourned. Minister) -by leaveMr Speaker, for some time past the Communist leaders on the waterfront have been developing a the "" rolling strike "". Their scheme is to stage a number of strikes, each of them appearing comparatively small in itself, but having in total the cumulative effect of dislocating and delaying shipping generally. This is having most serious consequences, which -are no doubt very gratifying to the Communists who are the enemies of national prosperity, but it is intolerable to the people of Australia who have a vital interest in the continuity of shipping both interstate and to other countries, notably Great Britain, whose economic recovery is",40,Spender
89,Debate (On Motion By Mr Chifley).,,43,Waterfront Employment
90,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Primeso much involved in the prompt loading of cargoes in Australia and also their delivery. In order that honourable members may realize how grave this problem is, I need only tell them that information just received indicates that whereas the total number of freight tons shipped from the Tjnited Kingdom to this country in 1949 was 2,000,000, the estimate for the calendar year I960 is 3.100,000 freight tons, a total which includes not only general cargo but also newsprint, motor vehicles, prefabricated houses, railway stock and cement. Many false excuses are put forward for these rolling strikes, but I can illustrate their nature perfectly from what is now happening on the Queensland waterfront. The system known as "" rotation of hatches"" was introduced as a war-time measure in Sydney in 1943 following pressure from the Waterside Workers Federation and was extended to a few other ports. It has not been applied to any fresh port since 1944. In ports where t.he system does not obtain, a stevedore looks over the gangs which have been picked up for his ship, and, in the interests of efficiency, selects the best gangs for the biggest hatches. The system adopted in Sydney in 1943 is that men are allotted to the hatches of a policy of resorting to direct action to ship commencing from the bow in the order in which they are picked up from the labour roster. For example, of five gangs assigned to a ship from the roster the gang at the top of the list would go to 'Ho. 1 hatch, the second gang to No. 2 hatch, and so on. The Brisbane branch of the Waterside Workers Federation applied in March, 1949, to the Waterside Employment Committee of the Stevedoring Industry Commission for the introduction of rotation of hatches. The application was rejected. The federationwhich, be it remembered, enjoys a monopoly control of labour engagement on the waterfront-the n appealed, to the Stevedoring Industry Commission. Because of the behaviour of the representative of the federation on the commission the commission was abolished by the Chifley Government before the appeal was heard. But under tbe Stevedoring Industry Act 1949, the appeal was automatically continued before the Arbitration Court. The appeal was remitted to the board for a decision on facts. The general secretary of the federation did not seek to adduce any additional facts. The board reported back to the court against the appeal, and on the 20th December, 1949, the court dismissed the appeal. The Waterside Workers Federation could (rave had the matter raised in the court at any time since the 20th December, but it has not done so. It is quite clear that rolling strike tactics were then decided upon as a direct challenge to the decision of the court. I need hardly remind honourable members that the policy of this Government is not to undertake to decide matters which are properly matters for court determination, but to uphold with all the authority at its command whatever decision the court may give. Judge Kirby, the Arbitration Court judge dealing with this matter, said on the 24th February-and I am not talking about last year, but about this yearand he has repeated in court on five subsequent occasions, that the court is available if the Brisbane branch of the Waterside Workers Federation desires to have the decision reviewed. On the 14th March, the general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr Healy, a well-known Communist, said in court that the Brisbane branch's enforce its claim in the teeth of the decision of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court had the support of the whole federation. On the 15th March, Judge Kirby made an order depriving members of the federation in the port of Brisbane of attendance money in the event of certain breaches of the awards or orders. In the course of announcing this decision, he saidThe men in Brisbane, with the support of the federation, have used their collective industrial strength to attempt to enforce by direct action the claim this court had rejected. It has been made clear time and again to the men and to the federation that this court has always -been prepared to consider any further arguments or submissions on the matter if the federation desired to make them in the last few weeks I have more than once appealed that the matter be properly submitted to the court and that direct action should be abandoned. These appeals have failed. Since then, the federation has pursued its chosen tactics. Attendance nioney has been forfeited in many cases and other disabilities have been imposed. It has been necessary periodically to effect dismissals under the authority of the act. In all these matters Communist officebearers have heen instigators and leaders. Tbere can be no doubt in the mind of any reasonable man that the whole business represents a carefully considered, deliberate and damaging attack upon the arbitration system and upon the orderly conduct of Australia's vital shipping industry. At the present time, twelve ships are tied up in the port of Brisbane. It is estimated that by Monday morning 36 ships will be tied up in that port and the position will be chaotic. It is also clear that the present trouble is not isolated. The roUing strike technique operates at one port after another. The Communists have not chosen to make a general tie-up of ships. But they have thought to confound the public and to frustrate government action by dividing a general shipping strike into a series of individual strikes, in total calculated to have the same ultimate effect. The place of attack and also the individual character of cargoes have alike been cunningly selected. Let me illustrate what I mean. Steel is a vitally important commodity for our basic industries, including the building industry. It is in short supply in Australia, largely because of Communist policy on the coal-fields. In Brisbane one ship, Allara, legislation specifically designed to deal has been waiting for a berth for ten days, with 4,000 tons of steel. A further 10,000 tons of steel are arriving on two other ships. The delay in the delivery of this steel does grievous injury to our country. The Hamilton cold stores have already exceeded their normal storage. have about 250,000 boxes of butter in store. The normal intake is 35,000 boxes a week. The storage position is therefore desperate. At the Borthwick Meat Works the storage position is such, and the present intake of meat so substantial, that unless loading is continued the meat works must close by the 6th April. The export of wool is being held up. There are still 25,000 bales not yet shipped from the sale which ended on the 23rd February, though the next sales have already commenced. I said that the effect of this calculated attack upon itr. Menzies. Australia has more than a merely local operation. That is true. As a result of delays occasioned by these unlawful tactics Maloja left behind 10,000 boxes of butter. Three other ships left behind them nearly 5,000 tons of general cargo.. Moreton Bay is a fortnight behind schedule, and is already overdue to load 33,000 cases of pears for the United Kingdom. Denman is instituting a new meat service to Hobart. This ship should have left on the l l t h March, but has not in fact yet finished discharging, and three killings of meat intended for transport by her have had to be disposed of. I could easily go on with a long list of damaging delays, all of them occasioned by a policy of' action which no responsible government could tolerate, and which the exasperated people of Australia would not in any event allow a government to tolerate. Cabinet has given this matter its most earnest consideration. It has decided that if the Communists havedecided once again to fight the Australian people, the Australian people will fight back, and make it clear once and for all that they will not tolerate lawlessness and violent attacks upon the normal processes of peaceful trade and. commerce. We are proposing at an early date to introduce into this Parliament with the Communist enemies once and for all. Buti n the meantime, we shall not allow the position to drift. We propose to use the powers which now exist in Commonwealth legislation to carry thefight to the Communists. We believe that, in so doing, we shall have the support not only of the public generally, but also of the vast majority of trade They unionists who hate communism, and recognize it for what it is, the great enemy of continuous employment, of higb living standards and of that system of impartial arbitration which has meant so much to organized labour throughout almost the entire history of the Commonwealth. Section 30j of the Crimes Act provides that(1.) If at any time the Governor General is of opinion that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States, he may make » Proclamation to that effect, which Proclamation sliall be and remain in operation for the purposes of this section until it is revoked. I have to inform houorable members that this afternoon, upon the advice of the Executive, His Excellency, the Governor General, has made a proclamation, the operative words of which are follows:2fow I , William John McKell, the Governor General aforesaid, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council, am of opinion und do hereby proclaim that tliere exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing and threatening trade and commerce with otlier countries and among the States. The effects of this proclamation are set out in sub-section (2.) of section 3 0 J of the Crimes Act, as follows, and I hope that they wil] be widely noted:(2.) Any person who, during the operation of such proclamation, takes part in or continues, or incites to, urges, aids or encourages the taking part in, or continuance of, a lockout or strike(a) in relation to employment in or in connection with the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States; or (h) in relation to employment in, or in connection with, the provision of any public service by the Commonwealth or by any department or public authority under the Commonwealth, sliall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for any period not exceeding one year, and in addition (if he waa not born in Australia) to deportation by order of the Attorney-General as provided in this act. The people who have inspired this lawless policy, and who are promoting its operation, and who have unfortunately been so placed as to be able to persuade large numbers of decent Australians to follow their advice, are therefore now put on plain notice. terms what can happen to them. Sof a r as the Government is concerned, it w ill exercise its authority under the act w i th vigor and complete determination. As I have had occasion to say before, not only bere but in other places, there ean be no compromise in a connict in which, on one side, are law-abiding, sensible, industrious people; and, on the other, a small group of unscrupulous and determined men who apparently feel no allegiance to this country, who seek to strike down its institutions, and whose ultimate object is to produce a chaotic soil in which their detestable foreign doctrines can take root and grow. It would not be proper for me to as conclude this statement without saying this most earnestly to the great body of Australian unionists: "" Know what you are doing, and in what company you are travelling, and by what people you are being led. Do you in your hearts believe that an active Communist in your union is merely a somewhat radical union leader? If that is all he is, no government has any right to touch him, and you have a perfect right, at your own will, to follow h i m . "" But does any seriously-minded trade unionist believe that that is all the Communist is? Does any honourable member opposite attach such aji innocent character to the Communist'!If lie does, he has little understanding of either communism or of the public temper. The Communists are our enemies because they are against all the things that we stand for-the blessings of religion; the system of parliamentary self-government; justice under the law. It would be the supreme tragedy of Australian industrial history if the trade union movement took its enemies to be its leaders, or made common cause with people who are in every sense, not only strangers, but bitter enemies to the great traditions of Australia's parliamentary and industrial democracy. Debate resumed (vide page 1168). .the Opposition) [8.23] -During this debate, I have heard several eulogistic references to the statement on interThe act states in plain national relations that was delivered by the Ministerf o r External Affairs( Mr. Spender J. I have perused the statement closely, and I confess that I have heen unable to see anything in it of a striking nature. It is true that the statement covers a great deal of ground, and contains lengthy references to international conferences and a Pacific pact, hut those references do not, in the final analysis, mean a thing. It has been claimed, if not in the official statement read by the",43,Waterfront Employment
91,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Leade r ofhonorable gentleman, that a Pacific pact would be more important to Australia than the Atlantic pact. I distant future may hold for us in the way of dangers in the Pacific, it can never be denied that the real storm centre in the world to-day is in Europe. Perhaps, in ten, fifteen or twenty years, some of the dangers we uow envisage as threatening Australia from the north will become realities; but if, in the meantime, Europe has gone over to communism, or to some radical ideology foreign to democracy, it will not did little if anything to ensure that matter much to Australia whether or uot there is in existence a Pacific pact. The real centre of civilization for democratic people all over the world is in Europe, including the United Kingdom, and in the United States of America. The essential thing for the western democracies is to remedy in Europe those evils which have encouraged the growth of communism, and which, in the countries behind the Iron Curtain have produced, according to all the evidence, the police state in various countries. Unless Europe is made secure for democratic governments, there can be no safety for people like ourselves. The people of the United Kingdom, with hostile forces poised so close to them, as would be the case if the rest of Europe were lost to communism, would be in no position to help us or any other democratic nation. I have heard a great deal of talk about communism, and what the Communists have done in Russia and in Central Europe. The fact is that communism has developed in Europe because of conservative action-or past. No one can deny that in most European countries the ordinary people did not receive from governments and from the ruling classes the consideration they deserved. In many European countries, such as Italy, Hungary and Poland, more than two-thirds of the land was held by wealthy absentee landlords. reflected no credit on those who had guided the destinies of such countries in the past. Such a situation constituted a fertile seed bed for the growth of communism. Indeed, it may be said that the seeds of communism were sown by those persons who are now referred to ifr. Chifley. as rightists, and who fought against every attempt to liberalize the laws for With that the benefit of the people. There is now do not agree Whatever the before the Italian legislature a proposal to break up the big estates. Already, the big estates have been broken up by the Communists in what are known as thesatellite countries of Central Europe. In China, too, the big estates have been broken up by the Communist Government and distributed among the peasants. With great regret I point out that the Christian churches, which had the greatest influence in Europe in the past, justice was done to landless farmers, and to the poor sections of the community. They never gave any assistance towards righting the wrongs that should have been righted long ago. As the result of that inactivity, or failure to exert the influence that they could have exerted, communism has crept into Italy, France and all the countries of central Europe. It is only in Holland and Belgium that any real attempt has been made to provide land for the people who so badly need itEurope remains the immediate and! urgent problem of the western democracies, and because the United Kingdom is so closely associated with that work of rehabilitation, and because we are so closely associated with the United Kingdom, it is vital to us that Europe shall be rehabilitated and won back to democratic ideals. Many people in Europe have drifted away from those ideals, and have grasped at straws like the pernicious doctrine of communism. The United States recognizes that fact, inaction-in the and has poured into Europe tens of millions of dollars for the purposes of rehabilitation. The only reward that America can hope to receive for its bounty is the knowledge that it has made a substantial effort to assist the democratic peoples of Europe, and a valuable contribution to the maintenance of world That peace. The strain upon American resources in providing sustenance for the people of Europe is unparalleled in history, and, indeed, the assistance is more generous than the recipients could have visualized in their wildest dreams. I emphasize that fact, because the statement is sometimes made that America has been tardy in dealing with the problems of the Pacific, and in joining with the United Kingdom, Australia and others for the purpose of obtaining a peace settlement with Japan. I hope to deal with that matter later, because we must examine those problems carefully when we speak of tbe danger of the resurgence of Japan. I shall not attempt to deal with the economic difficulties of Europe. Some honourable members, particularly many of those who are new to the Parliament, cousider that the world's problems and our own difficulties can be overcome by increasing production. What is the position ? Secondary production in France to-day is 15 per cent, greater than it was might completely demoralize its economy. before the outbreak of war in 1939, and the production of the agricultural industries of that country is almost equal to the pre-war level, yet production has not solved France's problems. Over-production is now occurring in the United States an outbreak of war in Europe, but of America, but that country has :"">.000,000 unemployed. The American Government is throwing away 15,000,000 bushels of potatoes, and has sufficient eggs and egg products in store to meet that country's demands for the next ten years. The production of cotton in the great and prosperous State of California will be reduced next year to two-thirds of last year's crop. I mention those few facts en'ly for the purpose of showing that an economic problem exists, quite apart from political, military and strategic considerations. The problems of the world cannot be solved hy increasgium is also over-populated. Those three ing production unless the commodities can be properly distributed at remunerative prices, and that arrangement cannot be made under the economic conditions which exist as between the rouble area, the sterling area, and the dollar area. That problem seems, at any rate for the time being, to be incapable of solution. I do not say that in years to come, probably in the distant future, it will not be possible to solve that currency problem, hut until it is solved, Europe cannot be completely rehabilitated, and the people of the United Kingmust, give credit to the United States of dom cannot have a full standard of living. The situation in the Pacific is most important, and we claim that other nations should devote their attention to it, but we should bear in mind that the solution of the problem of Europe is vital to the preservation of civilization. Until that problem has been reasonably solved, we cannot hope to stem what has been called the tide of communism in Europe. I have no doubt that, in a military sense, the Eussian armies are capable of walking across Europe to Calais in a short time, but that action would precipitate a world war, and the Soviet is in no better position than the western democracies to bear the strain of such a conflict. The only country in the world to-day that can afford a war is the United States of America, but a third world war I believe that the prospects of war recede from day to day. The terrible weapons that have been evolved by science are sufficient to terrify any nation, no matter how aggressive it may be. I do not fear I do fear the insidious onwards march of communism there. We must always bear in mind that if the Eussian Army were directed to advance into Western Europe, it would have the assistance of a substantial fifth column in the countries that it intended to overrun. Europe has other great problems, oneof the uiost important of which is overpopulation. Holland, for example, has 4,000,000 people too many, and the population of Italy is increasing at the rate of 200,000 or 300,000 a year. Belcountries, in particular, are confronted with the grave problem of what to do with their excess population, and the less populous countries of the world can offer assistance in that direction. The population of the world has doubled in the last .100 years. I refer to that matter briefly because Australians who think principally of the possibilities of the Asiatic situation in the next ten or fifteen years should not overlook the fact that I have already stressed, which is that the first problem awaiting solution is that of Europe. We America for the form and volume of the aid which it has given, because without that assistance, all hope of saving Europe for democracy would have been lost. Reference-has beeia .made .to the position will not permit me to -do so, and I -desire in China, 'The A^stRaliam Govemmeiffit must decile wihether <or rot it will recognise ""the self-styled People's Government «af China. Many iof -us idesetribe dt as the Oommnamrist -Q-ovexnmeaxt <of China. The problem of that country is not new. I often considered that I should have told the House -long ago about the -real position in China. The facts were known to the late President Roosevelt in 1942, and he sent many envoys, including Mr Donald Nelson, General Marshall, and Mr La Guardia to that country from time to time. caationalist government was completely corrupt. ""When I make that statement, I want it to be understood that I am not referring to the Generalissimo himself, but am speaking of the administration of national affairs in China. That administration was so corrupt that the arms which were sent from the United States of America to assist the National Government, in the war against Japan were sold or given to the Communist armies in China. In fact, communism triumphed in China because of the arms which had been sent to ""that country by the United States of America for the purpose of defending democracy. If time permitted, I could describe to the House what .happened to large quantities of supplies and stores, including >those consigned to Unrra. The Chinese administration Tvas prepared to sell, give away or surrender large quantities of goods which America was providing to assist the Allies -against Japan. There can be no question whatever that the only government on the mainland of China to-day is the so-called People's Government, or the Communist Government. That is the position. The Australian Government ias announced that it is not prepared to recognize that administration, and I can understand that there are many reasons for its decision. The United Kingdom has recognized the Communist government for the :real reason tliat British capital amounting to £300,000,000 is invested in China, and the investors want some authority to which they can make representations or to which representations can be made on their behalf. [Extension of time granted.] I shall not .pursue that line, because time Mr Ohifley. to iteferr to other matters. Oie Anista'alian Government wall inevitably be compelled tro recognize some govierJimienti n China, if only beca.u9e of the fact that there are 4'®O,'O00,;OOO people in that country. I hope that we shaiM not be too pr-oud, in the absence of direct repinesentatioiR, to use the representatives of the United Kingdom oai 'China. Of .course, I realize that <our in-teseBtsi n that -country .are inot on the .same scale as those of Britain. Extensive references have 'been made to The administration of the the spread of communism in Asia, and to the need for a Pacific pact. I express the opmion that the chance of 'getting a Pacific pact on any concrete terms is remote. It is possible to obtain a pact -between Australia and New Zealand, and to have some -understanding with the -United Kingdom, but it is certain that 'Canada and South Africa will not be parties to a Pacific pact.. 'The Minister for External Affairs must know that India Avail not join in any pact while Pandit Nehru and Mr Patel have any influence with the government of that -country. Pandit Nehru is tbe most powerful figure in Asian politics, and, indeed, in the Asian world. The attitude of India Has been made -perfectly clear. We can rest assured that whatever is <done by India will also be done by Pakistan and, perhaps, by Ceylon. I do not need to deal .at .great length with the position in Burma because it was very effectively covered by the honoraible member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley). It is .said that communism is responsible for all that .has -happened in the East, the Ear East and the Pacific Nothing could be further from the truth. The Philippines, which is the only Christian country in the East, was the first to demand, and finally to secure, independence. That country was granted nominal independence in 1946, but the maintenance of its independence is dependent on the United States of America and American investments. The seeds of independence were first sown in the Philippines. It is no secret that Lord Mountbatten went to India, with the approval of the British Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, to settle the differences between that country and Great Britain. Indeed, Lord Mountbatten had no hesitation in saying that what had caused unrest in India was not the activities of the Communists, hut the evergrowing nationalism of the Indian people coupled with the imperative need for an improvement of the economic conditions of that country. In these days a great deal is being said about improving the economic conditions of other countries: but it is being said only after all the damage has been done. Mountbatten would agree that the independence granted to India, Pakistan and finally Ceylon and Burma has emerged from their intense nationalism. These changes were brought about as the result not of the activities, of the Communists but of the upsurge of nationalism. I admit at once that the Communists go wherever there is trouble. They seize every opportunity to fan the flames of discontent and unrest. ""We should not fool ourselves about the position that, exists in Indo-China. France is bleeding itself white in the expenditure of money for the purpose of upholding western civilization in Indo-China; but everybody doubts the capacity of the new-old regime there to rally the people to its support. The existing administration in Indo-China does not inspire a. great deal of confidence. nesia was to extract from that country as It has been reported in the press, whicli I admit is not a very good authority, that. Pandit Nehru has stated that, he regards the existing set-up in Indo-China as hopeless and that unless it can be improved it will be difficult to avoid extending to that country some form of self-government. Consider the position in Malaya. Unless the Chinese aaid the Chinese born in that country reach some satisfactory working arrangement with the Malays, the Chinese population will soon exceed that of the native people. I pay tribute to Mr has said that as the League of Nations, Malcolm MacDonald for the magnificent work that he has done in Malaya in the face of the most extraordinary difficulties. In India, China and Malaya the workers were grossly exploited by those who were anxious to make big profits. Without question that happened in.India, where for many years 600 princes sucked the economic life-blood of the people. Their activities have, to some degree, been curtailed by Pandit Nehru and Mr Patel. A similar state of affairs existed in Pakistan. Unquestionably vested interests took all they could from the people of Malaya and gave them nothing in return. That injustice must be remedied. Let us consider the position that exists in Indonesia. I have been very amused Lord to hear the views recently expressed by the Minister for External Affairs and the Prime Minister on the subject of the Indonesian leaders. To-night I read an extract from a speech that was delivered some time ago by the Prime Minister in which he described Dr. Soekarno as a Communist-Japanese collaborationist. That description was also applied to Mr Sjahrir, and to Mr Hatta, who have been friend's of Pandit Nehru for many years. In his recent speech on international affairs, the Minister for External Affairs described those gentlemen as moderate people of considerable ability; yet, six months ago, both he and the present Prime Minister described them as Communist-Japanese collaborationists! The Labour Government realized that 80,000,000 Indonesians could not continue to be governed by 10,000,000 Europeans whose sole interest in Indomuch wealth as they could get and to give in return as little as possible. Unless Dutch administrative experience can be allied with some measure of Indonesian nationalism., there can be nothing but bloodshed in Indonesia. The Government which I had the honour to lead did not take sides in the dispute between the Dutch and the Indonesians. We realized that that was a matter for the Dutch people, the Indonesians and for the United Nations. The. honourable member for Chisholm( Mr Kent Hughes) without the United States as a member, inevitably failed, so also must the United Nations fail while Bussia continues to exercise the veto. honourable gentleman's extended time has expired.",46,International Affairs

It is surely within the competence of the House to grant the Leader of the Opposition a further extension of time. clearly states that an extension of time shall not exceed one-half of the original period allotted. That Standing Order was thoroughly discussed by the Standing Orders Committee, at whose deliberations the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) was present. There can be no misunderstanding of its purport. Speaker, that is not the point which I desired to make. answered the point of order raised by the honourable member.

I merely desire to conclude my observations on Indonesia. The Labour Government sought to bring about peace and a reasonable degree of harmony in that country. We realized that a revolutionary tendency, which might finally I should like to movelead to the development of communism in that country, would constitute a grave danger to Australia. When I sat on the other side of this Souse, I said that in the long view-lookin g 40 or 50 years ahead-it was essential that we should develop reasonably friendly relations with the people of Indonesia. The Good Offices Committee of the United NationsI rise to order. I did excellent work in bringing about a settlement of the differences between the Dutch and the Indonesians. As I have said, we did not attempt to take sides in the dispute.' We merely tried to bring the parties together under the auspices of the Good Offices Committee. I think that we can reasonably claim that as a result of our initiative the United Nations was able to bring about the degree of harmony that now exists in Indonesia. It has been said that the Goverament of the United States of Indonesia desires to possess Dutch New Guinea. That, surely, is a matter for the Indonesians and the Dutch to settle. Such a claim might well be dealt w it h by the United Nations. It has also been said by some irresponsible persons that the Indonesians want to W it h respect, Mr move into the area of New Guinea that we hold. I should most strongly oppose any such move. We should defend that territory with all our might because of its strategic importance to this country. Lord Mountbatten, Lord Inverchapel, and Lord Kilearn all went to Indonesia at different times and were all of the unanimous opinion that nothing could bring peace to Indonesia except some sort of arrangement which would protect Dutch assets and their income A motion to susearning capacity. When I was in office I always said to the representatives of the Dutch Government that we realized how essentia] it was that Dutch interests in Indonesia should be preserved.

102,Mr Chieley,"mentioned to-night Ln connection with another, hut different, disturbance. That Judge Kirby was able successfully, to mediate in tlie Indonesian dispute, hut has failed to settle a domestic dispute in Australia, demonstrates how extraordinarily difficult the'latter must be. It is a.grave mistake to attribute to the Communists responsibility for all the disturbances that have taken place in the East. On this point Pandit Nehru saidIf anybody thinks he can stop tlie spread of radicalism in Asia by guns, soldiers and ships, hc makes the greatest possible mistake. tie also said that the only thing that can save the East from some form of radicalism is an improvement in the economic conditions of the people. He said that until that was achieved nothing could happen except, perhaps, a worse state of aifairs than existed in the first place. I know we cannot give all the help that we should like to give to these people. They need technical men and, perhaps, plant. They are not so much in need of money. something that will win their spirit. They cannot be won by anything we may write because SO per cent, of these peoples -9 0 per cent, of the population of some of these countries-canno t read or write. It has to be conveyed to these people that the democracies are anxious to help those who have suffered. In the Chinese quarter of Singapore may be observed the terrible, unbelievable conditions under which the Chinese who form SO per cent, of the population of Singapore exist. In the hills round Singapore may be seen the mansions of the millionaires, some of which have been built quite recently. When I was in Singapore I. said to one man, "" This is dreadful"". He said, "" They have never known anything better"". M.y reply to that is that all these people are God's creatures. They may not he able to see eye to eye with us nationally or spiritually, but, they are people of the world. We shoxild give them as much help as we can. They do not want to come into this country. I have spoken to the leaders of these countries and they have stated that they did not want their people to come to this country; their people did come here they 1391 should be accorded the same rights as other citizens. That was what the Prime Minister of Ceylon said to me. That is all that he or Pandit Nehru or the President of Indonesia expects. The Minister for External Affairs says that time is short, but the situation that I have described has existed for hundreds of years. AVe cannot give much assistance because we are only a young country, but what wo ean give in the way of technical' equipment and educational facilities we should give. By giving it we should render a service to ourselves and to humanity. supporting the statement of the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) I should like to congratulate the Minister on his comprehensive and realistic presentation of the Government's foreign policy. It is gratifying to kuow that an all-party committee will be set up to consider foreign affairs. I think that is highly desirable because foreign But we could give them affairs involve problems which are far above party politics. It is also gratifying to know that the Minister intends to keep the public fully informed on foreign affairs. This is a move which is long overdue. A ll too often the public has been left in ignorance of Government policy in foreign affairs. In certain cases, for security reasons, some things must be withheld from the public, but, generally speaking, the people are entitled to know what the Government is doing and what Government policy means. . I was very interested in the philosophy expressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) just now regarding the spread of communism in eastern Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other European countries. He said that it was caused by local conditions. The plain, simple fact is that communism started in those countries because of the presence of the Bussian army which presented the people with a fait accompli. I was also interested in the right honourable gentleman's mention of an alleged statement by Admiral Mountbatten who, he said, blamed nationalism for the spread but they considered that if of communism in India and the Middle East.

I was surprised that the Minister did not mention the Antarctic. There are 5/000,000 square miles of territory in the Antarctic area, and its value for scientific and meteorological research is inestimable. There are tremendous potentialities in the Antarctic for the whaling industry, and if they were exploited, Hobart, which has been recognized for many years as a suitable base for the whaling industry, could be greatly developed. [Quorum formed.] Hobart is only 5,000 miles from the centre of the Antarctic areas. Those area's if not inexhaustible have tremendous mineral possibilities and they also have Considerable value for defence and aviation purposes. As regards defence, the Antarctic at least has a well disciplined army in national service, even if it does consist only of penguins. In 1947 an Australian expedition established a food depot at Heard Island. Australia claims approximately one-half of Antarctica. Erance, New Zealand and Great Britain claim quite considerable areas and there has been a more recent spurious claim entered by Russia. In the Sydney Morning Herald of the l l t h February, 1949, there appeared the following report:The Soviet Union yesterday laid claim to rights in the Antarctic, says Reuter's correspondent in Moscow. It claimed that the Russians discovered the Antarctic. A t a meeting in Leningrad the All Union Geographical Society said that any decision on the control of the Antarctic without the Soviet Union's partici pation would havo no legal force. Russia, it added, had every right to refuse to recognize decisions taken without her assent. On the other hand, the United States of America has adopted the policy of making no claims in the Antarctic and of recognizing none, pending the establishment of ownership by international agreement. An important factor in the development of Autai'Ctica at present is the race between Argentina, Great Britain and Chile. Already, there are eighteen permanent meteorological stations in the Antarctic and su b-Antarctic areas. The full importance of this great area cannot be overstreesed in view of Australia's geographical relationship with it. The fundamentals of foreign policy are It sounded like that world peace, security, co-operation and the establishment of reciprocal trade and the protection of that trade. . If trade agreements cannot be protected by a reasonable show of force they are not of much use. In this connection the Government's intentions regarding military training are as important in our foreign affairs as in our domestic affairs. Australia, being a small, but growing nation, must of necessity look to the bigger nations for protection, and so it is necessary for Australia to work in the very closest co-operation with the United States of America. It is incumbent upon all anti-Communist countries in the Pacific areas tp unite in an alliance against Communist aggression and infiltration in the Pacific areas. In connection with the claim of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) that communism and its aggression have been much overstated, I direct attention to the following report which appeared in the Melbourne Herald of the 20th March:Undercover proposals by Russia to hand back the Kurile Islands to Japan and sign an agreement for a huge trade deal between Red China and Japan are being eagerly discussed by thc Japanese Foreign Office. These offers, made on a "" sounding o u t "" ' basis, are part of a vigorous Soviet pre-peace treaty campaign to outbid the Americans for popular favour in Japan. In the same newspaper on the same day there appeared also the following advice:Don't be fooled by Malaya's use of the word "" bandit"". It is the greatest possible misnomer for the Communist terrorists. I do not wish to read a lot of quotations, but there is also this heading from the same paper issued on the 22nd of this month, ""Vast Aid-Asia Plan to Check Reds "". Hundreds of similar opinions are being expressed in the press to-day and it is quite apparent to any one who has",52,International Affairs
104,Mr Chifley,I did not say that in,53,Malayan Terrorism Is Red Revolt Murder A Nd Outrage By Killer Squads
105,Mr Kekwick,"studied recent Pacific events that Communist aggression is almost on our front doorstep. Industrially we may say it is in the kitchen. Yet, it seems to be the simple duty of Communist organizations in Australia blindly to follow the dictates of Moscow. The plan is very clearly outlined in the International, which saysThe present historical duty of the Communist party is to snatch thc parliamentary mechanism from the ruling classes, to smash them and to destroy them and substitute for tliem new orga:is of proletarian power. Just as it is importaut for Australia to work in the closest possible alliance with the Tjnited States of America, so is it important for the United States of America and other Pacific powers, including Australia, to work in the closest co-operation with Europe. We should promote common interests and engage in mutual assistance. Unfortunately, as the result of the misapplication of bi-lateral trade agreements, countries are often forced to accept commodities that they do not want. For instance, a. country wishing to purchase wheat may be told by the producing country that the wheat will bo supplied if it buy3 some other commodity as well. The purchasing country may object that it does not want the other commodity, but it is informed that, unless it accepts the condition, it will not obtain the wheat that it wants. Naturally, the purchasing country in that transaction applies the same methods if it has the opportunity to enter into some reciprocal trade agreement. Thus, nations are engaging in mutual plunder instead of indulging in mutual help. Russia's influence upon world affairs is the major menace that engages our attention. Is war with the Soviet Union inevitable? That is the question that oppresses the mind of every thoughtful person in the community. If such a war is not inevitable, at any rate it is an ever-present threat that we must always be prepai'ed to meet. Lenin said that the continued existence of the Soviet republics side by side with capitalist countries acceptance of that belief in many quarters has engendered intense class hatred, which bas spread throughout the world. Undoubtedly Russia is making a bid for world dominance. Consequently, we must shape our foreign policy so as to meet any possible act of aggression by Russia. In fact, Russia is already at war, economically and industrially, with the democracies. I remind honourable members -of the recent disastrous coal strike in Australia. Full-page advertisements published in the newspapers at the expense of the taxpayers stated quite clearly that the strike had been inspired by the Communists. I agree with that declaration and so do most, if not all, otlier honourable members. That being so, everybody who took part in the strike was a traitor to Australia hecause he assisted the Russian plan for the destruction of industry and the sabotage of production. The tactics employed under Russia's scheme of expansion have been the same for many years. Communists have infiltrated our unions, and one of their well-known slogans is, "" Every coal mine a fortress for the revolution "". We have had many examples of the practical application of that slogan in recent months. One has only to study an up-todate map of the world in order to appreciate the seriousness of the menace of Russian aggression. -In Europe, the Soviet Union already controls Hungary, Albania, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Czechoslovakia and other southern European countries. Yugoslavia, although not a member of the Cominform, is under the dictatorship of the Communist Tito. The Soviet Union also exercises tremendous influence in Italy, France, Finland, and Greecewhere civil war has just ended but is likely to break out again at any moment. The frightening truth is that there are 16,000,000 members of the Communist party in Europe and that Russia also has gained a strong foothold in Asia and the Pacific region. It exercises considerable influence, if not complete control, in Mongolia, Manchuria, Red China, Malaya, Siam, Burma, India, Pakistan, Afganistan and Indonesia. Bangkok, of .course, is well known as the centre of Russian intrigue in Asia. The was unthinkable. The attitude of Communists in countries not yet under their dominion has been made abundantly clear. I remind honourable members of comrade Sharkey's statement that, if Soviet troops came to Australia in pursuit of an aggressor, the Australian working class would welcome them as they had been welcomed by the liberated people of Europe. That statement was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 12th March, 1949. Another method employed by the Soviet Union in its bid for world domination is to breed racial hatred and in this it has beeu extremely successgigantic pincers movement that wa? ful in India, Pakistan, South Africa, China and Japan. That policy, considered in conjunction with the ' rapidly increasing coloured population of the world, represents a special threat against Pacific region, the tremendous power that Australia. The problem is already worldwide. The world can support only a limited number of human beings. Therefore we are faced with two alternatives: eitlier scientists must gradually increase the food producing capacity of the world, or they must work in the other direction, which, though not desirable in principle may be necessary, and establish scientific methods of limiting populations. the Canadian espionage trials, and we are The plain truth is that the increase of population is rapidly outstripping the world's food producing capacity. That poses a problem that must be dealt with by every country dispassionately and along the m03t modern scientific lines. The world is being wracked by the struggle between socialism and democracy. The Union of Soviet Socialist Eepublics is t.he proper name for Eussia, and the system in operation there is a socialist system. Therefore, for the purpose of this line of argument, the difference between the Communist expansion policy and the socialist expansion policy is negligible. able member opposite will attempt to deny that the Eussian system represents complete socialism! Whether it be called socialism or communism the result is the same. [Extension of time granted.] The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) referred to the United Nations. Unfortunately, the history of the United Nations provides further examples of the ruthlessness of Eussia. That organization has been sabotaged by Russia's abuse of the veto. It has been unable to police its own decisions, and therefore, it has failed as the result of sheer impotence. Although the United Nations is approved of in principle by every honorahle member, the fact is that the organization cannot operate effectively while its membership includes Eussia, whose sole objective is to sabotage it. That the world struggle has taken definite shape is proved by the described by the honourable member for Denison( Mr Townley). When one studies the extent of Eussian penetration through southern Europe and into the Eussia wields to-day becomes abundantly clear. The purpose of its attitude towards the development of atomic weapons is also clear. We still have fresh in our minds the details of the ghastly affair of Dr. Euclis, the greatest and probably the most successful spy in history, who has done more damage to democracy than auy other ten meu have done. We remember aware of the vast spy system that exists in Europe. Russia has become the greatest intriguer of all nations. Its programme of expansion must be stopped if democracy is to survive. Australia's security has heen definitely menaced by recent acts of aggression by Russia, whose foreign policy is essentially global in character. Our future well-being depends upon a vigorous, far-sighted, clear-cut, honest-to-goodness good neighbour policy, strong without ruthlessness, and generous and understanding without appeasement. other honourable members have done, I have listened with a great deal of interest to the various contributions that have been made to this debate on international no honoraffairs. The speeches have been particularly interesting because of the various shades of opinion to which they have given expression. They have represented the clarification of national outlook upon affairs beyond Australia's shores. Even though one may disagree almost entirely with some of the theses that have been propounded, one may at least express the pious hope that something of advantage to the country that we all love will emerge from the discussion. The debate will have been worthwhile if, as the result of it, the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) will be able to gauge the collective mind of this House and to shape",53,Malayan Terrorism Is Red Revolt Murder A Nd Outrage By Killer Squads

108,Mr Cremean (Hoddle) [9.26],"A sthe policy of Australia accordingly. Two factors should be uppermost in our minds when -Ave consider foreign policy. First, we should try to avoid self-delusion and, secondly, we should shun any form of wishful thinking. members have referred to the desirability of Australia working in efficient concert with other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that have interests in South-East Asia and the Pacific region. BecauseI am a realist, I consider that their thoughts on that subject are mainly illusory. Let us consider the situation in its proper perspective. Every realist must be aware that the great republic of India is to-day fully occupied with domestic problems. Its leading statesmen have declared definitely that they do not propose to become embroiled in any major conflict outside India's borders. The prevailing state of mind in the Union of South Africa to-day is the same as that which developed immediately after the signing of the peace of Vereeniging, and the spirit of Kruger lives on in the works and words of Dr. Malan. ""We can expect little co-operation from that direction. Canada is allied geographically, economically and, to some degree, by personal ties with the great United States of America. Consequently those of us who are realists are forced to the conclusion that Australia must establish an independent foreign policy in the knowledge that, in a world of armed titans, it is a small nation and must seek to protect itself by the best means at its disposal. Australia, to me and to every Australian, is a great nation, but in the scheme of the world's affairs it is comparatively small. Whilst Australia's contribution to the advancement' of world affairs in certain spheres has been great, it counts for little when the major policies of the more powerful nations are being considered. The world to-day is divided by conflicting ideologies, and the dominant and positive principle of atheistic communism is threatening to overthrow the free democracies of the world. Against it is ranged the uncertain and vacillating democratic system to which we subscribe. Throughout the modern world all men of goodwill have one clear duty, and that is to express with all their eloquence their belief in the practical value of a sane and sound democracy. Bight through the world's troubles runs a sinister thread. That is the threat of world domination by one power. It has Many honourable been said that world communism is a terrible menace and it is quite obvious to all of us that that menace to the world's freedom originates in the Kremlin. But communism, however, is not the only cause of tbe world's troubles. Another cause is the practice of the leaders of Western civilization of playing at power politics. I shall put before the House three major illustrations to prove that point. It was not communism that sold out th-? Polish people at Yalta. Nor was it communism that signed away at Yalta, through the violation of the Cairo Treaty, whatever prospects of success Chiang Kai-shek ever had. It was not communism that sealed the fate of Mihailovitch and the Chetniks; rather was it the uncertain course pursued by the leaders of the Western world who thought that they could successfully play the game of politics with the tyrant of the Kremlin. As a result of their failure to appreciate the ability of the master strategists of the Soviet States, to-day there is no free Poland, there is a Communist tyrant in power in Yugoslavia, and Australians have reason to bemoan the activities of the "" red "" giant in China. In those three instances it was the playing of power politics by men who had no vision of the future which sealed the fate of the nations that I have referred to, and which paved the way for Communist domination of them. Reference has been made in this debate to the irresponsible exercise of the veto by Russia in the councils of the United Nations. Examples have been cited of the use of the veto, but too little reference has been made to the valuable work that has been done by the United Nations. It seems graceless that so little reference has beeu made to the great work of the former Minister for Externa! Affairs (Dr. Evatt) in the councils of the United Nations. That an Australian should have been chosen to be President of the United Nations General Assembly is to the great credit of Australia. In the fields where it was possible for the United Nations to work, that organization displayed great ability under the leadership of the previous Minister for External Affairs. The failure of the Minister for External Affairs to refer in his statement to the great work that was done by his predecessor was somewhat churlish. I now place on record my humble appreciation, as an Australian, of the valuable work that he has done. I shall not traverse the matters that have disfigured to some extent this debate on foreign affairs, but I shall deal with one particular matter that has been referred to at length, but to one phase of which little attention has been directed. Nationalist China and the rise of Mao Tse-tung. It has been stated in the press by people who are competent to speak with authority that Chiang Kai-shek is not so capable or so trustworthy as he was formerly thought to be. To-day the ex-generalissimo of China is discredited in the minds of those who formerly extolled him as one of the great saviours of liberty. I remind honourable members of the words of Shakespeare in Mark Antony's Funeral OrationBut yesterday, the word of Caesar might Have stood against, the world: now lies he slaved for years in China, endeavouring there, And none so poor to do him reverence. Those words might to-day he applied to Chiang Kai-shek. ""We are told that he is the embodiment of the Chinese desire for "" squeeze "", that he is a grafter and that supporting him has been a mistake. That same man was hailed a few years ago as a champion of democracy. I sometimes wonder whether it is as much Chiang Kai-shek's fault that the Communists are in power in China to-day as it is the fault of those who sold him out at Yalta, by ceding Manchuria to Stalin while the ink was hardly dry on the Cairo Agreement which gave to Nationalist China full territorial rights. It, is a travesty of been macle there is marked evidence of the justice that we should to-day condemn Chiang Kai-shek and say that it is only now that we have discovered his true nature. There is another kind of self delusion, which is that the Chinese Communists are probably in a different category from those who dominate Eussia. I have before me the history of the men who now direct the destinies of China, and if that is any guide to their Mr Cremean. future activities then those activities will be along Communist lines. Mao Tsetung is President of the Chinese Politburo, and is a Moscow-trained Stalinist of undeviating loyalty. Lili-San is Mao Tse-tung's deputy and. his closest friend, and is in exactly the sarae category. LiuShao-Chi was deputy president of the Politburo, an old bolshevic, a Communist, since 1920 and is a frequent visitor to Moscow. Chu-Teh is the commander in chief of the Chinese army, a loyal Stalinist and a friend of Mao Tse-tung. He is in the same category as the other leaders of China. That is the defeat of All the leaders of China could he named and their histories would give an effective answer to the wishful thinkers who contend-that communism in China is merely a national urge, and is entirely different in practice from Russian communism. When speaking about China, a doubt enters my mind, and must enter the minds of all Christians throughout the world, of what will be the attitude of the Chinese Communists towards the Christian missionaries in China. My mind is filled with apprehension about the future of those Christian men and women who have to spread the word of God among the Chinese people. Will they he subjected to the persecution which has distinguished the Communist regime in other countries? We should give some attention to the possibilities of terrorist activities against those humble and holy men and women who to-day serve in the Chinese missions. I shall not reiterate the details about other parts of the world that have been put forward during this debate. I shall not refer to Burma, Malaya and other countries because I have no practical knowledge of theni, nor do I profess to have any. I merely say that in all those countries to which reference has Communist technique. Veitnam was -mentioned as a case in point. Malaya to-day is a simmering welter of bloodshed and horror. That is the usual state of a Communist-menaced country. Some idea of what is happening in Asia can be gained by a perusal of the techniques and objectives advocated by the Comintern in 1928. I propose to quote one particular objective in full. [Extension of time g r a n t e d . ] It is a statement of C o m m u n is t policy in colonial lands, w h i c h was first adopted in 1928, and c o n f i r m e d in 194S. I quote from it as f o l l o w s : The Communist Parties in the imperialist countries must render systematic aid to the colonial revolutionary liberation movement and to the movement of oppressed nationalities generally. The duty of rendering active support to these movements rests primarily upon the workers in the countries upon which the oppressed nations are economically, financially or politically dependent. Parties must openly recognize the right of the colonics to separation, and their right to carry ou propaganda for this .separation, i.e., propaganda in favour of the independence of the colonies from the imperialist State; they must recognize their right of armed defence against imperialism (i.e., the right of rebellion and revolutionary war) and advocate and give active support to this defence by all the means in tlieir power. The Communists are now applying that policy to the maximum of their ability, and its effect upon Australia may be grave. I wish to refer now to the spurious claim by Indonesia to Dutch New Guinea. WhilstI have no positive knowledge of the character of Dr. Soekarno, I indisputably accept thc evidence in regard to his proclivities that was placed before this House by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). Just as we cannot trust collaborators aud fellow-travellers, so we cannot trust the arsuranees of Dr. Soekarno regarding the territorial claim hy Indonesia to Dutch New Guinea. We should look upon New Guinea as the perimeter of Australia's defences. Ethnologically and historically, Dutch New Guinea is no part of Java, and the Indonesians have not even a moral claim to it, despite the statement by tlie Indonesian representative at the meeting of the United Nations yesterday, when he saidIndonesia is firm on its claim for Dutch New Uuinea. Of the population of Dutch New Guinea, other than natives, 204 are Europeansmostly Dutch-20 0 are Japanese, 1,218 are Chinese, and only 500 are Javanese. In the light of those figures, the preposterous claim that Dutch New Guinea should become a part of the United States of Indonesia is shown to be a hollow sham. I trust that either thf Dutch will retain that portion of New Guinea which they now hold, or that it will be administered by Australia under mandate. I believe it to be true, as has been stated, that our hope of safety lies in establishing friendly relations' with the Asiatic countries to the north, insofar as that can he done without sacrificing any principle that is held dear by the AusThe Communist tralian people. However, in the final analysis, our safety depends upon what co-operation and help we can get from the United States of America. In this connection, I quote from a profound article entitled, White Australia and South-East Asia, by D. J. Jackson, who summarizes the position as follows:We owe our survival, under God, to the aid of the United States in tlie recent war, and that we shall be even more dependent on them in the event of another world-conflict involving our security. This does not mean that we are bound to be ""yes-men"" to America on a l l occasions-bu t it docs suggest that it would be wise for us to base our Pacific policy, once for all, on recognition-and unresentful recognition of her dominant role. If we offer our counsels or criticisms, it should be with tact aud not with clamour: and the tone of our responsible leaders towards the United States should he marked at all times by understanding, goodwill and courtesy-regardles s of their ingrained ideological prejudices. I conclude on this note: I trust that, from this debate, and from the welter of opinion that has been expressed, there will emerge a foreign policy which Australia can apply without loss of principle or prestige, and which will make for the development of a happy, contented, safe, prosperous ahd democratic Australia. [9.53] -Some members of the Opposition have suggested that the statement of the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) was too long and too comprehensive. They have claimed that the Minister should have limited his observations to certain defined fields of international affairs. I do not agree. I believe that the first statement of a Minister in a new governinent should be full and comprehensive. I commend the Minister on his very able statement, and upon the points that he made in defending his policy. All honourable members of this House, with the possible exception of the honor-",55,Malayan Terrorism Is Red Revolt Murder A Nd Outrage By Killer Squads
109,Mr Charles Anderson (Hume),"able member for East Sydney( Mr dictator in China is denied that very ""Ward) will realize that there is only one nation in the world to-day that is responsible for the threat of war. The only time since I have been a member of this Parliament that I found myself in agreement with the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) was when he said that the aim of Russian Communists is world revolution. That is the threat that hangs over us all, and it has been the main theme of most of the speeches that have been delivered in the course of this debate. The fall of China has brought the threat of communism much closer to Australia. It has been regarded as a major have in mind. I do not believe that the Russian victory, but it is early yet to understand the full force and effect of what has happened. One thing, however, is certain. The fall of China has been the direct cause of a change of focus in world affairs from the west to the east. Moscow has reached a virtual stalemate in the West, but is now increasing the tempo of its imperialism in the East. The fall of China to the Communists may yet have far-reaching consequences. China is unique among Asiatic countries in that it is the only one that has large groups of nationals in other States. There they retain their national characteristics, influence of communism, the iron curtain and their close associations with their homeland. Those Chinese aliens in other countries, by their industry, invariably have a profound effect on the economy of the countries in which they live. They eould become a channel for the furtherance of Russia's ideals and intrigues, and for the expansion of Russia through China. However, China is a vast country. Many languages are spoken there, and the people in different parts have different customs and different outlooks. China enjoys an ancient civilization which, throughout history, has always absorbed the conqueror. Because of its great size and enormous population, it has often been partitioned into spheres of influence under the control of war lords, who regarded their neighbours with suspicion, and paid doubtful allegiance to a remote control. That tendency has continued right up to the present time, and will make it hard for the Eussians to achieve the same results in the East as they have achieved in the West. In addition, the Mr Charles Anderson. valuable weapon, the radio. Another point is that all educated Chinese still regard the European as a barbarian, and all classes of Chinese have an intense hatred of the "" foreign devil "". We know that the Russians will probably evince in China the same sort of rHthless tactlessness that has marked their activities in other countries. I do not think that their policy will achieve the results they expect with the resilient people of China. Its effect will be to foster national aspirations, rather than to promote the objectives which the Russian? characteristics of the Chinese are such as to make it likely that China will become a satellite state. These factors should be kept in mind when we are attempting to assess the importance of the Communis! victory in China. It may be that in China Russian diplomacy will bog down. However, we cannot afford to . take risks. We must try to protect ourselves by raising in neighbouring States barriers against the spread of communism from China. I am certain that in China, as in other 'countries that have come under the will be rung down. Communism cannot stand the impact of free thought on its regimented subjects. Seeing that it must be a part of our foreign policy to try to influence those Asiatic states that have „ not come under the influence of communism, it i's just as well for us to study the characteristics of the various races that occupy the continent of Asia. All Asiatic races have one common characteristic, namely, a great respect and admiration for power. I use the term ""power"" in its broadest sense, that is, military and economic power,and great riches and resources. When we are framing our foreign policy, we cannot afford to forget that trait. In fact, we should play on it. The Minister indicated that he intended to develop a good neighbourly feeling between Australia and the countries of South-East Asia, a.nd to pursue a vigorous policy of maintaining peace by building a barrier against the advance of communism with economic and commercial aid, technical advice and the like. The importance of defence and of military commitments should not be forgotten. One important passage in the Minister's statement readsA nation's foreign ipolicy must, however, be sense, the last four years have been closely integrated with that of defence, for if the foreign policy which is followed proves incapable of achieving or maintaining peace, the departments of war must take over. That statement is most profound. Armed strength is a potent ally in support of the* foreign policy of a nation. The experience of the last half century has proved that, without any military force, a nation is capable of pursuing only a policy of appeasement. We all know from very bitter and tragic experience where that kind of policy leads. It was a tragedy in Europe, but it would be a far greater tragedy among Asiatic peoples who respect force. I shall now examine the way in w hieh Australia can fulfil the policy that has been propounded by the Minister. What is our military strength? As I have stated, armed strength is a potent ally in support of our foreign policy. ""Unfortunately, modern diplomacy thinks in terms of divisions, battle fleets and air squadrons, and I am afraid that we are completely deficient in those spheres. I do not suggest an armaments race, or commitments that will involve us in local dogfights among Asiatic nations, but I is gravely handicapped because we liave practically no military strength. We should have at least strong home defences, but, unfortunately, they are lacking. Members of the Opposition have expressed fears for the future of Australia in its relations with Asiatic countries, and I hope that they will remember those anxieties when the Government's proposal to reintroduce compulsory military training is being debated. The previous Government was guilty of grave neglect in respect of our defences. It appears to have relied on push-button warfare, the fact that a range for testing guided weapons has been established in central Australia, and a policy of defending Australia to the last American soldier. How, then, can we support our foreign policy? The Minister has suggested granting economic aid and the like to the countries of South-East Asia. That proposal is sound, but the assistance of our industries will he required to enable us to give effect to it. In an industrial tragic for Australia because the production of our heavy industries has lagged. The output of certain light industries, particularly the luxury trade, has almost satisfied the demands of consumers, but the production of the heavy industries is below their capacity. The masses of people whom we are trying to aid are still living in the age of the sickle. If we can advance them to the age of the scythe, we shall have a notable achievement to our credit. Those people require, not luxury goods, but basic goods that they can use for their developmental projects. They need steel, cement, wire, nails, agricultural and T industrial machinery, and tools of the right design and quality. We can supply those requirements.. It is futile to cry over spilt milk. If our heavy industries had been working to capacity in the last four years, we should have satisfied our own requirements, and have had a surplus for export to strengthen our foreign policy. Unfortunately, we are starting from behind "" scratch "" in both a military and an economic sense. Trade on sound business-like lines, that encourage mutual respect between nations is one of the best believe that our foreign policy ways in which to break down insular barriers. To date, that advantage has been denied to us. The point that I originally made was that, in order to win the respect of the Asiatic nations, we must understand their respect for power, but, I regret, we have no substantial military or economic power with which to impress them However, I have confidence in the quality of Australian resources, management and craftsmen. Goodwill and understanding will change the whole character of our industrial setup, and we shall be able rapidly to overtake the lag in production, and even to produce a surplus for export. Other avenues also ean be explored. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) mentioned technical aid, and I believe that we can assist also in the health and medical sphere, because we are producing substantial quantities of valuable drugs. The honourable member for Chisholm( Mr Kent Hughes) emphasized the need for choosing the right kind of people for positions in onr consulates and embassies in eastern countries. Our representatives should understand and have sympathy with the Asiatic races whose standard of living we desire to raise, and whose confidence we wish to win. Many people are available in Australia who understand the east, and I hope that the services of some of them will be secured for our embassies and consulates. The policy that has been enunciated in the Minister's statement does not conflict in any way with the organizations that are now working on behalf of the United Nations. Indeed, I believe that the policy that the honourable gentleman has suggested can be complementary to the work of those organizations. I know from my experience of life that if I want a job done, I should do it myself, because then I should be certain that it had heen done. The Minister used a very apt expression which I should like to repeat. It was thisTlie foreign policy of a country is doubtless u projection of domestic policy into external relations, but it is more than that it is 1 largely a projection of the domestic policies into world politics. The domestic policy that has been forecast by this Government provides a solution of all our internal industrial and defence problems. I am certain that it will he effective, provided the Government receives co-operation inside and outside the Parliament. I should be the last man to say that the Opposition cannot render maximum assistance to it. If full co-operation is given, we shall be able to achieve our objectives and make Australia safe for our children. I consider that the reins of government have now been taken over by a strong administration. But we have no time to lose in taking the action that must be taken. We must build a strong Australia. If we do so, Australia will be able to play a vital part as an. important Pacific power. I believe that the present Government will last for many years. But it has to lay the necessary foundations now, because Australia, unfortunately, suffers from the recurring calamity of an interregnum of Labour rule. was interested in the speech of the honourable member for' Hume( Mr Charles Anderson) hecause of his remarkable efforts in Malaya during the retreat of the Eighth Division, in which my brother took part AlthoughI disagree with most of the views that he advanced tonight, I pay a tribute to him for what he did in those critical days in Malaya. Foreign affairs present an everchanging and an ever-moving picture with which we never seem to catch up. It is like running along a railway station platform to catch a train, only to see it draw out and leave one behind. Affairs that we may be discussing to-night as though they were top-line news may be completely dead by the morning, whilst other matters that we do not consider top-line news to-night may hit the headlines in the morning. That is why we never completely catch up with foreign affairs. I shall discuss three aspects of our foreign policy. In the time allotted to me it is impossible for me to cover all the matters with which the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) dealt in his statement because of their great variety. I shall, however, refer first to the resurgence of nationalism in Asia. The rise of nationalism in Asia is, in effect, un agrarian revolution. It is a revolt against centuries of feudalism, mental darkness, feudal imperialism, misery,-and economic barbarism. The revolution has a counterpart in the European revolution that occurred a century ago. Asia is now going through what Europe went through between 1S48 and 1S50. A crop pf revolutions broke out iu Europe a century ago. They constituted a revolt against monarchies, feudalism, misery, imperialism and economic barbarism. At that time monarchies tottered, and self government was established in country after country in Europe. A new world of ideas was born, which shaped the course of events in Europe for the succeeding century. The Communist manifesto appeared in 1848. It was a revolutionary document that gave impetus to nationalism in Europe. Empires were cut up into self-governing countries. Now the eastern nations are showing the gradual influence of western ideas. They move much more slowly, in every way, than the western countries do, and they have taken a century to reach much the",58,Malayan Terrorism Is Red Revolt Murder A Nd Outrage By Killer Squads
110,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) H 0.11],"Isiiine position of awakening and revolt as Europe reached in 1848. The awakening of the revolt in the East has come. That revolt has started in. Burma, India, Pakistan, Indo-China, Thailand, Malaya, and Indonesia and is already taking definite shape. Imperialism and colonization are dying out in the East. ""New self-governing nations have emerged in Asia, and it is our task, and the task of the United States of America and the United Kingdom, to guide the agrarian revolution in the East into a nationalistic framework rather than let it merge into a Communistic framework. It is essentially an agrarian revolution. It is a fight sored by an American named Dawes, for land upon which food grows. The eastern peoples are fighting for food, for security, and for a voice in their own affairs, which has been denied thein through all the centuries by imperialism and capitalism, with tbeir spheres of influence and their gross exploitation of backward peoples. ""We cannot step around this great resurgence of nationalism in the East, hecause it is to-day the most important factor in that area. What we must do has already been indicated by other honourable members who have spoken in this debate ancl 1. shall not go over the ground again. I emphasize, however, that the awakening that occurred in Europe a century ago is being re-enacted in Asia, witb some slight differences because Europe was industrialized a century ago ancl had a higher standard of living than the greater part of Asia now has. The second matter that I wish to discuss is the conception of two Marshall plans, one for Asia and one for Europe. The Marshal] plan for Europe is already in existence. The war left Europe politically and economically shattered. It wa split into two camps, the Bussians camp and the camp of tbe western democracies. The Marshall plan .was born in order to rebuild the countries of Europe. Its purpose was twofold: first, economic and financial, and. secondly, political. Millions of dollars have been poured into Western European countries such as Germany, France and Luxemburg, in a mighty effort to rebuild them. Politically speaking, Marshall aid to Europe has been a great bulwark against the Communist advance westward. I believe that the political influence of the Marshall plan in Europe is increasing inimportance because thinking men are realizing more and more that one of the best means by which the westward march of communism can be halted is the economic reconstruction of Western Europe. That is what the Marshall plan is doing. The western European countries are using Marshall plan dollars to buy American goods, and so the plan is assisting America's own economy. The Marshall plan is nor. the first example of a plan for the rebuilding of Europe. In 1924, the Dawes plan, which was sponjust as the Marshall plan was sponsored by a man named Marshall, came into being. The purpose of the Dawes plan was identical witb the purpose of the Marshall plan. That purpose was to pour dollars into Germany and ""France to enable them to rebuild their shattered post-war economies. The achievements of the Dawes plan were remarkable. In the space of four years, misery, degradation and unemployment were almost abolished, particularly in Germany. Industry was moving again, the wheels were turning. Germany enjoyed greater prosperity in 1928 than it had enjoyed for half a century, and perhaps greater than it had ever enjoyed. But late 1928 brought the Wall-street crash. I have not time to enter upon a discussion of the causes of that crash, but the results of it included the withdrawal of American credits from Europe. When American dollars were with held from Europe it was as if Europe's life-blood had suddenly been cut off. Chaos and panic immediately followed. Within a short time, 6,000,000 men and women were out of work in Germany and the total number of unemployed in Europe soon reached 13,000,000. The financial and economic depression commenced, not in America, but in Europe, and its results reverberated throughout the world. With the cutting off of the supply of dollars, European countries eould no longer huy American goods. The markets for American goods were lost and vast quantities of goods piled up in American factories and eventually 15,000,000 persons were unemployed in the United States. In the United Kingdom no fewer than 2,500,000 persons were out of employment in the depression which followed in that country. Those were the results of the withdrawal of American credits in Europe, and at that time the Eussians were not in Berlin. ""What of the Marshall Aid plan? If that plan fails within the next three years it is quite conceivable that similar repercussions will again be felt in Europe. Those countries in Western Europe that have not recovered sufficiently to enable them to stand on their own feet will suffer an economic and nnancial collapse. Unemployment and misery will return to the peoples of Western Europe and communism will find a fertile breeding ground once mOre for Eussia is now in control of one-half of Berlin. At the time of the earlier financial and economic crash Eussia was not thought of as a world power. To-day, it stands in the forefront of the powerful nations of the world. That makes imperative the continuance of the Marshall Aid plan as a means of preventing the westward march of Eussia and the resultant economic chaos. Misery and unemployment will be inevitable in Western Europe, if the flow of dollars to Germany and France be suddenly stopped. Unless it was prevented by armed might Bussia could march to the English Channel without firing a shot. The whole continent of Europe would be engulfed in war. For that reason it is essential that the Marshall Aid plan be continued for at least another two or three years. By that time Western Europe should be able to stand on its own feet. The financiers of the United States are now so scared of communism, however, that they are prepared to keep their money circulating in Germany for a longer period than they were under the Dawes plan of twenty years ago. In the East, Euasia is pushing its ideology eastwards hy infiltration and intrigue, and is exploiting the rise of nationalism. The backwardness, poverty, landlordism and financial and economic instability of the East provide the Communists breeding ground. Some aid of the kind given under the Marshall Plan is needed in the East just as much as in the West to enable Eastern countries to stem the Eed tide. The form in which such aid should be provided would, of necessity, affects foreign policy, has been dealt with .Ifr Duthie. differ from that extended to Western countries which are more highly industrialized than are the countries of the East. The United Nations could accept some responsibility for the provision of aid to Asia. American aid could be provided through the United Nations in the form of capital investments, but not with the old colonial motive of exploitation of resources. Financial and technical aid for developmental purposes would have to be supervised by understanding men, preferably appointed by the United Nations. If unscrupulous moneylenders or grcedly capitalists are permitted to invest in eastern countries suspicion and distrust will be aroused among the eastern peoples, who will be driven to pass drastic laws against westerners or, what would be still worse, into sympathy with communism. The tragedy of American aid to China during and since the war furnishes a potent example of what we should avoid in formulating any financial and economic plan for the east, whether it be a Marshall plan or a Spender plan. Unscrupulous ofncials, black markets and waste destroyed the effectiveness of Marshall aid in China. In that country the Marshall plan has not achieved its purpose because China is in the hands of Eussia. Food is the key to the solution of this problem. Hungry people are susceptible to any "" ism "" and will follow any leader who is prepared to offer them land, food and security. Assistance in the form of agricultural machinery, agronomists and other agricultural experts is vital to the development of the foodgrowing potentiality of the East where starvation is so common. Such assistance would enable the economic standards of eastern countries to be lifted. member is developing an economic argument. This debate relates to international relations. WhilstI am willing to listen to odd references to the economic situation in China and other countries as it affects our foreign relations, I remind the honourable member that he must relate his remarks more closely to the subject before the Chair.",61,Malayan Terrorism Is Red Revolt Murder A Nd Outrage By Killer Squads

112,Mr Duthie,"Economics , as itby nearly every honourable member who has taken part in this' debate. Another method by which we can assist to develop Asian countries as a bulwark against communism is through the missions. That aspect of assistance was referred to by Ihe honourable member for Hoddle( Mr sphere Cremean). Mission farm schools could do much to teach the Asiatic people how to produce more food from their Iand. Such a scheme as I envisage could be undertaken in conjunction with the Protestant and Catholic churches which function in Asia. Assistance through a United Nations development bank, financed by loans from all nations, would also help to reduce the fear of the Asiaticin trade and commerce which is flexible people that the United Kingdom, America, Holland or France intends to absorb those eastern countries which it assists.. The Minister for External Affairs touched rock-bottom in practical politics when he stressed, as also did the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), thc necessity for aid to South-West Asia. By whatever name such aid may be called, it is absolutely vital if wo are to stem the surge of Russian communism in South-East Asia. My third point is this: any realistic assessment of international affairs must have regard to t.he diplomatic duel which is now in progress between the East and the West, and the clash of the economic and political ideologies represented by the United States on the ona hand, and Russia on the other, with the United Kingdom steering a middle course between the two extremes. Is the world big enough for capitalistic democracy on the one hand, and materialistic communism on the other? Can that issue he decided without, resort to war? 'Fhe United Nations will never be able to remove that fundamental conflict between those two ideologies, although it can ease, or neutralize them. That conflict is principally political. On the one hand, we have totalitarianism and, on the otber hand, political freedom. On the one hand in this ideological war we liave no free elections, no real freedom of worship, expression or criticism, but arbitrary arrest, the police state and dictatorship; ancl, on the other hand, we have freedom of elections, British justice, free parliament*, free political parties, and freedom of thought, religion, expression and criticism. That ideological war has been going on since the physical war ended on the 15th August, 1945. [Extension of time granted.] In the economic this warfare is between capitalism and communism. Those fundamental differences condition the attitude of Russia and the Western democracies. Can they be reconciled? The answer to that question is "" No"" ; but they can be recognized as two fundamental schools of economic thought existing in one world. These economic ideologies can be confined and controlled enough to operate between nations provided that political differences can be tolerated. Can these two worlds live in one world ? If that is not possible, the alternative is a frightful war of annihilation, an Armmageddon of horror, fire and bacteriological warfare. All of us believe that war is not inevitable if the two-world concept is recognized by the United Nations, and if nations individually are prepared to recognize that the world is big enough for the United States of America-United Kingdom concept and the Bussian concept. But even though the United Nations, or any individual nation, hold that these two ideologies can live together any attempt to bring them together will fail. I do not believe that they can be united in the sense that it will be possible to say that Russia accepts our way of life and our economic and political thought. Realistically, the alternative is to recognize these two worlds within one world. Our problem is to make sure that we stabilize both worlds within one world without resort to war. We can do that, first, by limiting fear; secondly, by evolving peaceable solutions of international disagreements through the United Nations; thirdly, by narrowing the bisr issue? and tensions through the United Nations; and fourthly, by the expansion of trade, Eastern Europe and Asia taking manufactured goods from the Wept and the West drawing its supplier of raw materials from the East. That would have a. stabilizing effect. Fifthly, communism may become nationalistic in various countries and draw away from Russian Communist internationalism. That development has already been evidenced in China, Yugoslavia and Poland, where nationalism is short-circuiting the communism of the Kremlin. Those are current examples of that process. I refer to au article written by John King Pairbank that was published in the Foreign Policy Bulletin of the 19th November, 194S. It readsIn proportion us the Chinese Communists, who havo hitherto gained influence chiefly in agrarian areas, got control over cities and national affairs, we can expect them to face increasing problems. If Chinese conmiiunisni stays closely within Moscow's orbit, it must eventually come in conflict with genuine Chinese patriotism. I suggest that "" nationalism"" can be aptly substituted for patriotism in that context. The article continuedWe have to face up to the fact that the Chinese Communist movement is not only genuinely Communist but also genuinely Chinese. It is obvious that the growth of nationalism in South-East Asia offers an effective means of neutralizing the effect of Kremlin communism. Indo-China, Malaya, and Indonesia will develop their own nationalism even though for a time they may listen to the Communist offer of a new world. The job of the Western nations, is to encourage the nationalist movement in those countries. It can do so by supplying economic and nnancial aid to them and thus preventing Russia from gaining complete domination over them. We cannot do anything to altar the outlook of those countries geographically, hut we can influence them with the democratic ideology of the West. Russia's efforts to exploit nationalist movements has heen due to its fear that this resurgence of national spirit, if left unchecked, will short-circuit Communist domination of Asia and South-East Asia. My sixth point is that by building up the economics of South-East Asian countries tli rough the. operation of an Asian Marshall Aid plan, to which Australia and the United Kingdom as well as the United States of America would contribute, we could raise the econ.ojn.ic standards of these backward' peoples and thus remove the seed bed in ilr. fiutltie. which communism thrives. Next, we should strengthen friendship with tbe Eastern countries through the exchange of students, by cultural movements sponsored by Unesco and through the influence of the churches. My final point is that we should rely upon the force of the Christian religion as distinct frpm the Hebrew, Hindu, Buddhist, Mohammedan and Confucian religions. Within the framework of the Western democracies, Christianity has a tremendous part to play in removing social prejudices, economic barbarism and the. evils of capitalism by emphasizing the middle course between communism and capitalism. That was done at the World Council of Churches that met at Amsterdam in 1948. That council agreed that the economic answer to the world's present problems does not lie in either communism or capitalism but is to be found in a judicious mixture of private ownership and collective ownership through co-operatives and the like. Further. Christianity can help to make our democracy more Christian. It can give to it a moral and spiritual fibre and imbue it with a. willingness to build bridges ancl not barriers between groups and nations. By making democracy Christian, Christianity will help to counter the communism of the Kremlin. We must revive the soul of democracy. Without a resurgence of full-blooded Christianity as sincere and passionate as the Communists believe communism to be, our democracy will not be a match for the Communist ideology. Only a war of annihilation, made more ghastly hy thc hydrogen bomb ancl bacteriological warfare, would result if we tried to save a democracy that was decadent, corrupt and spiritually moribund. Democracy must recover its .soul, or be destroyed. Without moral rearmament among the Western nations, we shall be no match for fanatical communism which the intensity and sincerity of belief of its adherents transforms almost into a religion, although a religion without. God. In the ideological conflict, Christianity has a paramount task to perform. It can remove destructive cynicism,, blighting selfishness and festering hatreds within the minds and hearts of Western peoples, among whom moral and spiritual softness and fiabbiness may easily prove to b'j a more terrible enemy than communism or fascism, If we are morally and spiritually flabby, how can we ever hope to combat the rigid discipline of communism? The gap between material advancement and moral advancement in Western civilization has widened alarmingly. Scientific progress is outstripping moral progress. That gap must be closed, because science is creating a monster that it is not able to control. One expert who is working on the development of the hydrogen bomb has become so afraid of its destructive potentialities that he has resorted to prayer. That was recorded in a newspaper recently. I regard bim as a wise man. Some scientists are becoming glorified murderers, and it is fantastic that our ethics are so twisted that these men can escape punishment whilst an ordinary murderer goes to an electric chair or a hangman's noose. The existence of these two worlds in one world at peace is a possibility if we recognize that the alternative is a holocaust. adjourned. OF REPRESENTATIVES : TIMELIMIT TO That the House do now adjourn. stand that I am not in order in referring to matters that have been discussed in the House to-day. However, I assume that that restriction does not stop me from referring to ideas that have been canvassed prior to this debate. The statenient has been made that the ""Christian churches of Europe have failed "". Such a proposition, made by responsible people at a time like this, should be promptly repudiated. Whatever the faults of the Christian church in Europe may have been in the past, to-day the clergy is paying for them with death, torture and imprisonment. We owe it to the memory of men like Cardinal Mindszenty and Archbishop Stepinac, when such an allegation is made, to point out that to-day, when other defences have failed, the Christian church is the only force that is standing firm in the defence of humanity, spiritual rights and freedom. The Christian church in Europe is the one force that has been proved firm and that has been able to stand against those wbo would attempt to suppress every spark of freedom and those values which we hold dear. That church is standing firm in the face of death, imprisonment and torture, and at least on my own behalf I must repudiate the proposition that it has failed. In my opinion, the Christian church, instead of having failed thc people of Europe, particularly those that have fallen beneath the tyranny thai prevails behind the Iron Curtain, has stood as a firm bulwark against it. I hope that no one is going to ascribe to Christianity the evils of European capitalism. Whatever has happened in the past, let us not make a mockery of men whose mangled bodies have paid tribute to the extent to which they supported the principles for which we mouth our support. Let us not insult their memory by saying that Christianity in Europe has failed. That statement does not renresent my view and I hope tha* it does not represent the view of any substantial section of this community. I desire, Mr Speaker, to say something about your ruling concerning extensions of time. That ruling suggested that an extension of time cannot exceed one-half of the period allotted for the original speech. You will recollect that the situation arose out of a move for the adjournment of the House. Under the old Standing Orders, on a motion for acljournment to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, ten minutes was allotted to a member addressing the House, with an extension, after the Minister first speaking following the submission of the motion, of fifteen minutes, or 50 per cent, longer than the original allotment. The amended Standing Orders were brought down to correct an obvious anomaly. Attention was directed to that anomaly by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), who,",63,Malayan Terrorism Is Red Revolt Murder A Nd Outrage By Killer Squads

It seems clear to me that a second extension of time is within thc rights of honourable members. If that right is not conceded, the only course open to the House is to suspend the Standing Orders. That course was followed to-night. I point out, however, that the provision that relates to the suspension of the Standing Orders does not seem to provide machinery. for use on such an occasion. It readsI n cases of urgent necessity, any standing be nothing but the kind of humbug that or sessional order or orders of the House may be suspended. . . . Whether an extension of time is a case of urgent necessity might he a matter of opinion. The Standing Orders do not appear to me to provide the machinery for the granting of extra time. I think that the intention of the committee was clear, and that, under a literal interpretation of the Standing Orders, the House could agree to two extensions of time exceeding 50 per cent, of the time originally allotted, but that uo automatic extension should provide for more than 50 per cent, of such time.

120,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"pensioners belong to a class of society that has done much for Australia, and it is a wicked shame that they are denied an opportunity to hear clearly. I believe that we should follow the example of the United Kingdom, where hearing aids are provided free of charge to any persons who want them, regardless of their means. I direct the attention of the House to section 14 of the ""National Health Serviee Aot 1948, which reads as follows:The Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, arrange for or undertake the manufacture, for the purposes of a national health service, of medical and dental supplies, which there are many beaches. I have appliances and equipment, including visual aids and hearing aids. In my opinion, the Government should take advantage of the provisions of that section to manufacture hearing aids and to provide them free of charge to age pensioners who cannot obtain them from any other source because of their lack of means. I hope that the Government will treat tliis matter in the spirit in which I bave raised it. I have raised it not in a party political spirit, but merely in an attempt to obtain something for old people in the evening of their lives who are suffering from the disability of being unable to participate in ordinary conversations. desire to refer to the life-saving clubs of hoa ring aids for the aged deaf.

They stand condemned because of their lack of interest in the welfare of Australian citizens who are oppressed by poverty. I hope that the Government will decide to treat the situation of pensioners as a non-party matter and will provide them with the means of sustaining life in reasonable comfort. It will gain a great nieasure of support from this side of the House for its social services projects if it accedes to my request. The Labour Government provided reasonable allowances for pensioners, lnvt rising costs during the last six months have made it impossible for those people to live on a decent standard with the present rate of pension. Although you, Mr Speaker, occupy an exalted position in this House and have made a promise that you will not take nart in debates or attend caucus meetings, I am sure that you acknowledge your responsibility, in common with that of every other honourable member, to provide for the welfare of our pensioners. Labour and National Serviee and Minister for Immigration) [11.10] I should not have risen but for some extraordinary remarks that were made hy the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Minogue). No member of this. Parliament, nor indeed any party, has a monopoly of sympathy and regard for the situation of the age pensioners of this country. I believe that every government, right from the earliest days of federation, has sought to do what it regarded as a, fair and ' reasonable thing for our age and invalid pensioners. The story has-been one of progressive improvement of the rates of allowances made available to them. I do not claim that we have done all that we could desire to do. I hope that during the life of this Parliament more will be clone, and that all parties will agree, as the honourable member has suggested, to approach this matter on a non-party footing in order to see whether we can improve the lot of pensioners. The honourable member referred to agepensioners as people who are starving and destitute, and without proper accommodation. I remind honorahle memhers that he represents an electorate in the very populous and prosperous State of New South Wales. I therefore consider that I should remind him of one or two facts which may have escaped his notice. If what he said is correct, it is a terrible indictment, first of the Labour Government that held office in the federal sphere for the last eight years> and. secondly of the Labour Government of New South Wales, which has held office for a like period. Those years have been marked by some of the most prosperous conditions that this country has ever known. Whilst many age pensioners may undoubtedly be feeling the effectsas we all are-of the rising cost of living, and may be living in far less comfort than we would desire that they should enjoy, on the other hand the general standards of our age pensioners have been raised appreciably as a result of legislation which I concede quite frankly and gladly, was enacted by our predecessors in office. The amount of permissible income that they may earn without affecting their pension was raised, and other concessions were granted to them. It is a mistake to refer to age and invalid pensioners as people who are entirely isolated and destitute. Nearly all of them have friends in addition to their own children, their own kith and kin, and these gladly assist them to improve their lot. Whilst there are unfortunate individuals to be found in any community, with perhaps no close relatives or friends who are able to assist them, undoubtedly the general prosperity of full employment, which is reflected in the swollen savings hank and trading bank deposits, has ameliorated the lot of the elderly and invalided members of our community. I do not consider that the honourable member presented a true and accurate picture of the position. If he did, it is an indictment, not only of this Government, but also of its predecessor in office. pensioners who are unable to earn anything are badly off. life of this Parliament we shall he able",69,Speeches Hearin G Ams Sur F Life Saving Clubs Pensions

However, I refuse to accept that as the situation, and I immediately throw back to the honourable member for West Sydney the observation that if it is, it is an indictment not only of his own colleagues in this Parliament but also of those in the Parliament of New South Wales. tory) [11.15] I do not wish to catapult myself into this argument unduly, because I have spokon about this subject before. However, I take this opportunity to inform the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Minogue) that I am an Independent, not a Government member, as he stated. I agree with the contention of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) that both sides of this House are indictable for the unhappy lot of the age and invalid pensioners to-day. Eight years ago, when a Labour Government, led by the late John Curtin, was in power, I made representations that the rate of age and invalid pensions should be raised to £2 10s. a week. That suggestion was definitely rejected. Almost without exception, every year since-throug h the Advisory Council, of which I was a memberI have advocated an increase of the amount of pension payable to these people, to enable them to have purchasing power commensurate with their needs. Many of them are invalids who require special care, food and accommodation. I know that to be a fact, because I have treated many of them professionally in the Australian Capital Territory. I have also treated many who live in areas contiguous to the Australian Capital Territory. I say unhesitatingly that the attitude of all policent., who had nothing to live on apart, tical parties towards the invalid and age pensioners leaves very much to be desired. I should support a proposal for an immediate increase of the age and invalid pensions to no less than £3 10s. a week. T shall remind the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) of a few facts. I do not want to go through the whole history of age pensions in this country. It is sufficient to say that if there had not been an organized Labour party there would never have been sueh a thing as age pensions legislation in the Federal Parliament. It was the price which the Deakin Government paid to be kept in power when it was threatened by t.he Reid free-traders in the early days of this federation. King O'Malley came in as an Independent, and then joined the Labour party. He was one of the first movers for age pensions. The history of age pensions is not a very happy one. I remember that in 1940 the Menzies Government had to he almost extinguished politically before it would agree to give age pensioners an increase of ls. a week in the budget of that year. From the time the Curtin Government took office in 1941 until the Chifley Government ceased to hold office in 1949, the Australian Labour party increased age pensions by over 100 per cent., from £1 ls. a week to £2 2s. 6d. a week. The last rise to the age and invalid pensioners of this country that Lahour enacted, without opposition from honourable members who now occupy the Government benchesy amounted to 5s. a week. Labour also did many other things to ameliorate their lot. It established the 85 per cent, invalidity provision. It also liberalized the means test by increasing the permissible income from £'! a week to £1 10s. a week, and raised the property qualification and the surrender value of insurance policies, so that to-day a married couple, both of whom are age pensioners, can receive a pension of £4 5s. a week with a permissible income of £3 a week in addition, and can live in a home that they own. without suffering any reduction of their pensions. They may also have up to £200 in the bank. Although we did niuch for that section of our people there was a hard core of them, probably SO per from their pension. The problem was to determine what could be done for thorn. As a Government we found that",70,Speeches Hearin G Ams Sur F Life Saving Clubs Pensions

134,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [11.16].,"-.every time we raised the age pension the harpies who own the slum properties of -Sydney and Melbourne-the y are not supporters of the Labour party-too k a portion of the increase by raising rents. A very large number of pensioners who do not want to live in homes, but want to subscribe the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) in order in wearing a hat in the eh amber ? ber is entitled to wear a hat in the House if he cares to do so. made by the honourable member for West Syduey( Mr Minogue) and the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Dr. No t t ) are quite in order. What has happened since the 10th December is a matter for consideration by this Government. It is well known that the cost of living has risen precipitately since that date. Honourable members on the Government side of the House have ascribed that increase to various causes. The Minister for Labouiand National Service recently gave two instances of what he believed had caused the increase -the 40-hour week and the devaluation of the AMA. Whatever the cause may be, it, is the responsibility of this Government to help those people who cannot, help themselves. They should be helped at this present moment, and it is of no use to talk about what some other government should have done. The responsibility lies on the doorstep of this Government, which is expected to do something quickly. In my electorate one person out of every six is an age or an invaled pensioner, and I can assure the House that they are just as good Australians as are any other persons in the comm unity. I. support, the submission of the honourable member for H in d m a rsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) in regard to the provision of hearing aids for age pensioners. Labour and National Service deigned not to notice that recommendation, but it concerns some department of _ the a month ago. Some honourable members Government, and I think that the Minisare still not complying with it , including ter, when dealing with age pensioners, some who occupy the front bench on both might have dealt with that also. The matter of giving aid to the aged and the invalid must be faced it cannot wait until the Budget period, sometime in September. I strongly urge the Government to do something immediately, remembering that every shilling increase of age pensions means an addition of £1,000,000 to I rise to order. I s the annual expenditure of the nation. Eveni n the light of that fact the position must be faced. Honourable members on thk« side of the House, despite what the Ministerf or Labour and National Service has said, have almost a monopoly of interest in the age and invalid pensioners. submissions During the depression, when the Premiers' plan w as introduced, every r member on the non-Labour side of the House voted for the reduction of pensions to 17s. 6d. a week. When the Lyons Government came into power, with no mandate on this matter from the people, it reduced pensions to 15s. a week, thus pauperizing the pensioners and making their families keep them. The Government even took a lien over their property so that when they died the first charge on their assets was a claim by the Taxation Commissioner for a refund of the nioney that had been paid to them a.* a pension. Honourable members on the Government, side of the House have a lot to live down in regard to pension?, and it is of no use their talking about the matter as a non-party one. It has never been a non-party matter, and the age and invalid pensioners w ill get an increase to-day, only according to tlie amount of pressure which the Opposition, as a minority party, can apply.

The honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) raised a point of order, and asked me to give him a considered opinion. I shall give it to him now. In regard to extensions .of time, the old Standing Orders provided257B. . . . witb the consent of a majority of thc House or of the Committee, to be determined without debate, a member may be allowed to continue his speech for periods eacli not exceeding . . . 15 minutes.

'I'hat matter was exhaustively discussed in the Standing Orders Committee, and my ruling, subject to its being overridden by the House, is perfectly correct. The honourable member for Perth then referred to my having put to the House a motion to suspend the Standing Orders so as to allow the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) to have a second extension of time. I have discovered that my ruling on that point was quite wrong and I therefore have to uphold the honourable member's point. The Standing Orders lay down quite clearly that in cases of urgent necessity any standing or sessional order may be suspended. I was not asked to declare on the question of urgent necessity, aud I think that had I been I should not have been able to agree that a matter of urgent necessity was before the House. However, thc matter of urgency is generally one for thc House to determine. The other mistake that I made at that time was that I did not ask for a seconder to the motion. you make, Mr Speaker? as no doubt the honourable meinber also is doing. In the future I shall not accept a motion to grant further extensions 'of time to any honourable member unless the House declares that to do so is a inatter of urgency. the Army and Ministei"" for the Navy)' [11.28] -in reply-Certain honourable members have made various observationsto-night. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) has replied.' to the observations of the the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Minogue) and the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Dr. Nott) about invalid and age pensions. ' I shall make no further comments on that matter except to say that the honourable member for Melbourne tried to convey to the House the impression that when invalid and age pensions were first introduced in 1908, by Sir Littleton Groom of under duress. I suggest that the honourable member should peruse the record of the debates, as I have. He will then learn that the Leader of the Labour party at that time, Mr Andrew Fisher, in a speech to the House in Melbourne, said that he thanked the Liberal Government for doing what be thought could not possibly be done. There is no doubt that the parties opposed to Labour were the first to introduce age pensions in this country. The honorable member displays this late enthusiasm for the cause of the age pensioner only because the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory sawfit to raise the matter recently and every other honourable member opposite has discovered that it is his duty to do the same thing. No good purpose will thereby be served, because sympathy for the age pensioners is not to be found on only one side of the House. Practical sympathy has been evinced and assistance has heen. given also by honourable members who sit on this side of the House. The honourable meniber for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) stressed the need for providing hearing aids for age pensioners who have found .their hearing becoming weaker and weaker.

Finally, I wish to reply to the observations of the honourable meniber for Watson( MrC u r t in ). I regret that such an important matter as the one that he brought forward was raised in the manner that he adopted. He began by saying that Liberal governments had adopted an apathetic attitude to the provision of assistance to life saving clubs.

COAL. tlie honourable member for H u n t e r ( Mr James) asked me questions r e g a r d in g .spontaneous combustion o c c u r r in g in some coal mines. The M in is t e r for F u e l , S h i p p in g and T r a n s p o r t has f u r n is h e d the following information:It is a fact that the Greta seam is liable to spontaneous comhustion. aggravated by the great thickness of these coal deposits militating against the successful extraction of pillar coal under existing hand methods with resultant crush, spontaneous heating and loss of coal. The Joint Coal Board has arranged with the University of Sydney to undertake research work on the question of the development, detection and control of spontaneous combustion on the Maitland-Cessnock-Greta coal-field. Whilsti t may take a period of years before this research is completed, progressive results w ill be made available to the industry as soon as they are obtained. In addition, the board contemplates carrying out experiments in underground power stowage and for this purpose has already had a special study made by its technical officers of the practice in Europe. The board is preparing plans for experimental work on the Maitland-Cessnock-Greta field. The difficulty of securing thc necessary special equipment, however, is a serious draw-back to any early implementation of these experiments. In August, 1948, the board arranged for three overseas mining experts to report, amongst other things, on the question of mechanical pillar extractions on the Maitland-CessnockGreta coal-fields. These gentlemen, Messrs. J. Hunter, of the National Coal Board, Great Britain, H . R. Houston, of the British Ministry of Fuel and Power, and W. M . Merritts, Bureau of Mines, United States of America, reported. inter alia, that "" the risk of spontaneous heating can be reduced by increasing the rate of extraction. This can best bu assured by mechanization "". Thc board and all competent coal-mining engineers are strongly of the opinion that mechanical extraction of pillar coal w i ll appreciably reduce the fire hazard in the mines in this area.
