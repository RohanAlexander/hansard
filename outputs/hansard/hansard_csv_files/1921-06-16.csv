This question is developing into an irregular debate. important matter, Mr Deputy Speaker, and affects our reputation abroad and our immigration scheme most profoundly. I hope honourable members will believe that with our limitations and all the defects we have at present in regard to this organization, we are doing the best we can. We have the whole matter under review. I have already made £1,000 available for the relief of these cases, and Mr Gullett is now at work upon this very problem, and I hope we may soon find, some solution for it . Meanwhile, he is developing his organization. It has been already launched in Victoria with very good prospects, and I see that a similar organization was launched in Sydney last Monday. I had promised to be present, but was unable to leave Melbourne. We are doing all we can to get the organization under way, but the obligation is on the States to undertake responsibility at this end, while we undertake the responsibility in London. If the States will not take the responsibility here we must, and will. In the meantime, I agree that, in our present circumstances, we shall do well to encourage the immigration of domestic servants and nominated immigrants. The latter is the best of all forms of immigration, because when the people arrive here after having been nominated by their friends, there is a place to which they can go and get something to eat until they can shift for themselves. class of immigration is being developed already, and we expect 30,000 or 40,000 new arrivals next year through this medium alone. But that is only a trickle, and we must look to the larger tide of immigration in the immediate future. statement that the immigration organization is not complete, and having regard to the fact that thousands of men are [36S]2 unemployed in the different States, necessitating heavy calls on all the Governments, will the Acting Prime Minister take into consideration the advisability of at once informing the immigration officials abroad that because of the position here immigration activity should be deferred for the time being? the electoral provisions of the Constitution can be amended only by the people themselves, I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, prior to the redistribution of seats in accordance with the new proportions of population in the different States, he will afford the House an opportunity of discussing what is known as the formula for ascertaining the quota, which is pronounced by experts to be altogether ineffective and inequitable. If that is done, I am certain the House will do no injustice to any State. All I am asking for is a fair deal for all the States, so that we may arrive at a formula that will be just to all concerned. city, I was not aware that there was anything occult, complex, or extremely difficult in ascertaining the quota for the electorates throughout the Commonwealth. I should think there would be no trouble about that,.and I ask the honourable member to indicate where the difficulty lies. Minister will inquire of the experts in connection with the Department or the Minister presiding over it, I think he will be told that there are some inequalities in the present system. tainly ask my colleague to make inquiries That at the earliest possible moment. intend to appoint immediately under section 13 of the Electoral Act a Commission for altering .and defining the boundaries of constituencies? interim report upon the census has been made.

I see no objection to doing this. Prime Minister, upon notice1. Did the Government of Queensland formally apply for a loan of £2,000,000 from developing the Burnett Land' Settlement Scheme? 2. If so, upon what date? 3. Has the Commonwealth Government considered the matter and arrived at a definite decision with regard thereto? 4. If. so, has that decision been officially conveyed to the Government of Queensland? respondence and records of conferences I have seen, not only was there no promise made by the Prime Minister of monetary assistance for the development of this Burnett land scheme, but, on the contrary, there was a very definite statement by him that only in connection with the further development of the Murray waters scheme, and the alteration of railway gauges to a uniform gauge, did the Commonwealth propose to give aid to the States in connection with immigration -schemes. Everything else was specifically excluded from the range of that aid. The honourable member will see all this in the following lengthy summary of what -has taken place in connection with the matter:Premiers' Conference, May, 1920. At the Premiers' Conference, held at Melbourne during the month of May, 1920, the following resolutions were carried:Resolved: "" That the proposals of the Prime Minister as follow:Commonwealth to have full control overseas; Agents-General of the several States to form consultative committees in London; Commonwealth to be responsible for, and have control of, all overseas organizations and transport arrangements for bringing immigrants to Australia; Primary object of scheme to be the settlement of immigrants on the lands of Australia; Type of immigrant-preferenc e to be given to British ex-service men, Commonwealth io seek co-operation and assistance of British Government in obtaining right type of immigrant and of passages for same; Commonwealth to assume nnancial responsibility for organization for immigrants from overseas and transport to Australia; The States to be responsible for immigrants from arrival in Australia, and for their settlement on suitable lands and/or employment on public works; States to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth, setting out in definite terms what they bind themselves to do in regard to providing(a) land;",21,Electoral Redistribution

Thc Commonwealth undertakes to assist the States by way of loans for approved land settlement and public works."" Resolved; ""That the Premiers undertake to submit the scheme for consideration by the respective State Cabinets."" The Prime Minister, together with other Commonwealth Ministers, attended the Conference on the 24th May, when the proposals of the Commonwealth Government with regard to immigration were placed before the Conference 5>y Mr Hughes. During the course of the debate, Mr Hughes said"" I must not be held to commit the Commonwealth to that proposal, if it is to be considered as part of the scheme, 'so that the scheme is itself contingent upon it. All that I say is this: That the scheme itself is limited clearly in the most definite way, and is under your control, because you are to say how many men you can Absorb, and what kind of men. Having agreed to that proposal, with that first addendum, if you ask, ' Are you prepared to consider the question of advancing loans for the purpose of this scheme on public works approved by you?' I say, 'We are prepared to consider it ; -but we do not say with regard to public works other than the Murray River and the unification of railway gauge that we will provide the money.' -., In regard to the unification of gauge, we do say that we will provide the money. As far as developmental railways are concerned, I may remark that I shall look very favourably on them, because I do not think we can spend our money in any better way."" Li Premiers' Conference, July, 1920. At a further Conference, held at Melbourne -during the period 16th to 20th July, 1920, between the Commonwealth and State Ministers, the proposals outlined in the first resolution with regard to immigration passed at the former Conference were re-affirmed, and the -Conference decided that a scheme should be drawn up by the Commonwealth and submitted to the State Governments for approval. With regard to thc second addendum to the first, resolution, however, the Prime Minister -stated that the Commonwealth Government -would not undertake to give any assistance except in respect of the Murray River waters scheme and the construction of a uniform'railway gauge throughout Australia. During the debate in connection with this matter, Mr Fihelly asked the Prime Minister what money would be made available for public works ? Mr Hughes replied that the Commonwealth Government was prepared to co-operate in all these public works undertakings to the extent of the mutual resources of the Commonwealth and State, but it could not go beyond that. He stated that the Murray Waters Scheme could be expedited, the Unification of the railway gauges undertaken, also any other public works that might be suggested, and upon which agreement might be arrived at. He also stated that the Commonwealth was .prepared to cooperate to the fullest extent, because immigration was essential to the welfare and safety of Australia. Mr Fihelly then pointed out that Queensland offered exceptional facilities for the settlement of the largest number of immigrants, and added that the Murray Water Scheme did not interest Queensland as a State. He intimated also that the same applied to the Unification of the railway gauges, because that would merely connect Brisbane with the border. Mr Hughes agreed that Queensland and Western Australia offered greater facilities than the other States for the settlement of the largest number of immigrants, but added "" In regard to public works we must cut our coat according to our financial cloth."" Premiers' Conference, November, 1920. At a Premiers' Conference held at the Prime Minister's Office on the 1st November, 1920, Mr Theodore said"" We could absorb straight way a few thousands of immigrants if we had the money tb carry out our proposals. We want assistance financially."" ' Mr Hughes replied"" I do not know to what extent we can do that. You know the state of the moneymarket. I do not know what we can do. You( Mr Theodore) said the Burnett district wants £2,000,000 spent on it. . . . We have got to do something. I have done the best I can. We must carry out that scheme. We cannot settle it now, but this general conversation helps."" ' Mr Fihelly's Inaccuracy. Mr Fihelly, in May, 1921, stated that a promise was given at the July Conference between Federal and State Ministers that money would be advanced by the Commonwealth Government in connection with the Burnett lands. The answer to this assertion is summed up in the explicit statement by the Prime Minister"" that the Commonwealth Government would not undertake to give-any assistance except in respect of the Murray River Water Scheme and the construction of a uniform gauge."" This had reference solely to immigration proposals. Regarding soldier settlement, Mr Fihelly (at the July Conference) asked""What about Queensland's Upper Burnett Tailway proposition?"" To which Senator Millen replied"" That will come out of the £1,000 if the line is agreed to."" -This £1,000 was the amount to be paid in respect of each settler, £625 being secured to the settler himself and the £375 being available to the States for the purpose of providing land. Nothing was said that could be construed into a promise "" that money would be advanced by the Commonwealth Government in connection with the Burnett lands."" On the 15th November, 1920, Mr Theodore wrote to the Prime Minister, stating that the ability of Queensland to absorb any number of immigrants depended upon the opening of further areas of land therein for settlement. He stated that there was a large tract in the Northern Burnett and Callide Valley districts suitable for close occupation, on agricultural areas, of many thousands of selectors, but that about £2,000,000 would be required for railway and road construction to adapt it for such purposes. This work would extend over three or four years, but, in the meantime, 1,500 men would be employed on the construction as soon as money was available. He added that if the Commonwealth Government would grant the State a loan of £2,000,000, to be used for the above purpose only, and to be drawn on as required, the Queensland Government could make a concrete proposal with regard to immigration. The Premier further suggested that Mr employment to returned soldiers in connection Gullett, Director of Immigration, proceed to Queensland and go fully into the matter with the State authorities. In reply to that letter, the Premier of Queensland was informed that Mr Gullett would inspect the areas in question early in the"" year 1921, and, further, that as soon as the report in the matter had been received the request for financial assistance would receive full consideration. Queensland's not Unnatural Desire. Queensland representatives have expressed a not unnatural anxiety to receive some indication tending to justify the hope that undeveloped parts of their richly-endowed State might be made more accessible to new settlers. The Commonwealth Government sincerely desired to formulate some plan ' that could be initiated on practical and financially sound lines. This much was indicated by the Prime Minister at the commencement of the negotiations with the Government of the Northern State. was sent to Queensland to report on the value of the Burnett country as a district for settlement. He carried out this duty, and the report was printed for the information of honourable members This action appears to be accepted ;by some critics as an admission on the part of thc Sir Joseph Cook. Commonwealth Government that it was committed to a scheme involving a loan of £2,000,000 to the Queensland Government. The facts of the case surely demand no elaborate explanation. Queensland asked for £2,000,000 to be used in opening up undeveloped country. Admittedly, this was an admirable objective. But the Commonwealth Government desired to learn full details regarding the advantages to be gained in alloting £2,000,000. This would have been a natural procedure, even had the Commonwealth Government held ample funds for general purposes. But with a Treasury meeting heavy demands pf an abnormal character, finance duly dominated the position. The importance of the opportunity for development in the Burnett district has never been questioned-li t cannot be questioned. But the fact cannot be ignored that Queensland is a State in which established railways cover wide areas of rich country, in which there is ample space open to prospective settlers. The Commonwealth Government regrets that it is not able to comply with the request submitted by the Queensland Government at the present time, as money is not available for the purpose. .

73,Mr Greene (Richmond,"Minister f o rBame, Tlie duty upon the brass .'bolt, however, represents a far greatermeasure, of protection than it does upon.the iron bolt, is. subject to our Customs regulations; because we have to considerthe -value of the metal used' in each instance, and we all know that the value of the metal used in the manufacture, of a brass bolt is very much higher than is the value of the metal used in the manufacture of an iron bolt. The same remark is applicable to the still higher processes of manufacture. In the case of goods from foreign countries, the duty proposed, namely, 45 per cent., would be very high if we added 10 per cent, to it. I cannot see my way to increase the existing impost. If honourable members will look at the item, they will see that the' duty upon .it has been increased from 30 per cent under the 1908 Tariff, to 45 per cent, under this Tariff. In all the circumstances the -duties proposed appear to be sufficient to afford our local manufacturers a reasonable chance of competing successfully with the manufacturers overseas. I know that the industry is almost an entirely new one. Prior to the war its operations were almost of a negligible character, but since then it has made wonderful strides in. many directions, not merely in the manufacture of the articles of which the honourable member for Henty has spoken, but also in the manufacture of locks. Then there is the brass metal, and other metal industries which are being established all over the country. It seems to me that the duties set out in the schedule are quite sufficient to enable our manufacturers to successfully carry on their operations. inember for Henty to accept those duties, because they cover a vast number of articles other than those which he has -enumerated. I regret that the Minister cannot accede to the request of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Francis), although I recognise the difficulty in which he finds himself owing to the general character of this item.

I selected one which was rather to my liking from a colour-point of view, but upon closely examining it I discovered that it had been made in Japan.

That provision enables , us to prescribe, amongst other things, that such goods shall bear the name of their country of origin, and, as a matter of fact, we do so prescribe in so far as the Act enables us to do so.

If anything be .placed upon these goods descriptive of what they are, under our regulations they must also 'bear the brand of the country of their origin. But we cannot insist upon all goods being so marked. However, the Government, have under consideration at the present time a proposal to amend the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act, with a view to making it applicable to all imported goods, and specifying that such goods shall be marked with the name of the country of their origin. Sir [3.80],I am very glad that the Minister for Trade and Customs has intimated the intention of the Government to amend the Act in question. As I interjected when the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) was speaking, I do not think that that Statute applies to the case to which he has referred, and, as. a result, the Australian article has suffered severely. The intention of the Commerce Act was to enlighten the public as to what they were buying, and there is ample room for a substantial extension of it, so as to cover cases .of this kind. I regret, with some of my honourable friends who have addressed the Committee, that the Minister (. Mr Greene)' cannot see his way to give some further assistanco to this industry. He has rightly said that this particular itom, "" Manufactures of 'inetal n.e.i.,"" has a vast range. I admit that' it has, and from that -stand-point h i * argument is. difficult to answer If , however, the honourable gentleman is satisfied-that any department of industry, suoh asthat of brasswaro, covered by the item is entitled to special encouragement, there is nothing to prevent him from breaking up the item and giving to'that department of the industry such, further encouragement as he thinks proper. It is unnecessary torepeat 'the argumonts which have already been advanced, but I would point out to the Minister that when he introduced the satisfied that the brassware industry and' bther like enterprises were entitled to the percentages of protection set out in the schedule. The very object that he had in> fixing these schedule rates was to give1 thom the -encouragement they required. If the value of those duties has since been substantially reduced, then We -who .areenaoting this Tariff legislation at the -present time must toko cognisance of that depreciation. If , when the schedule wasintroduced last year, 35 per cent, wasBTiffioient, a greater percentage must now be necessary; preciation, or. an even greater one, liasbeen going on in other countries. worse for us. A depreciation ih valuesin countries exporting here decreases, very largely, our opportunities, because it imposed. manufacturers here drop their prices. It is time that they did so. wages in the brassware industry goingdown, they have actually increased 20 per oent. since this schedule was presented. That being so, the industry to-day is not getting 25 per cent, by way of protection WhilstI admit the force of the Minister's argument as to the omnium gatherum character of this particularitem, yet there is a means of compassing the difficulty; and if he canaot see his way now to give additional encouragement to the brassware industry, he may, after further investigation, entertain a proposal for an increasod'diify when the Tariff is before another place.",29,Division Vi Metal S And Machinery

100,Mr Watkins (Newcastle) [3.45],"( Mr Blundell), who is at present engaged on a deputation, asked me to refer to this item. According to my information, "" The manufacture of clumps and leads is a different and distinct industry it seems strange that we cannot supply from type founding or casting of type, and in the TJnited Kingdom no typefounder makes his own clumps or leads."" I hear also that the whole of the typemaking industry is in the hands of a trethin strap of lead not quite type high, mendous American Trust, which is not only dealing with the type-makers of England by getting them into their fold, but is also beginning to deal with the Australian industry. If that is so, the request of the Australian manufacturers for an increase in the general rate, where noticed that the leading article of a it does not strike at anything British, is newspaper is usually printed in larger very modest. During the debates on this schedule those who desire to create Australian industries have said that they would rather have trusts here than out-* side, because they could deal with them here; but in this case, if the facts subalso be easy to manufacture, because all mitted are correct, an Australian industry is in imminent danger of being crushed by a Trust over which we have no control. you trust no Trust? the Minister's amendment is dealt with, it would be a fair concession for him to agree to an increase of 10 per cent, in, the general rate on articles manufactured in Australia. an increase. that these are the raw material of the printer. that clumps are the raw material for the linotype and other machines? material. leads are used in the linotype. into the question more fully after the amendment is dealt with. -The statement ma'de iby the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) places the whole question in quite a new light. best to make their trade in many lines as world-wide as possible. It would be remarkable to me if we could not manufacture these articles in a big lead-producing country like this. We produce the lead and antimony .in Australia, and the demand for the commoner articles used in the printing trade. A clump is merely a piece of lead made to various sizes, while a lead may be described as a which is usually placed between the lines of type, although the linotype machine puts what is known as a ""beard"" upon each line, thus dispensing with the need for this separate piece of lead between the lines. Honorably members (may have type, with more space between the lines, due to the insertion of the lead referred to. All circular printing, book printing, and work of that nature is treated in much the same way. Metal furniture should that is required is a mould into which the lead is poured, and afterwards cut off into the lengths required. The operation is so simple that it is evident the manufacturers here have not entered into the business more extensively because of the danger to be apprehended from American competition. This, I think, must be the reason for the request for a further protection. I can understand the Minister's disappointment at this request, because I presume that eighteen months ago -jus t prior to the introduction of the It must be remembered Tariff-the manufacturers suggested what they thought would be a fair duty, and evidently they came to the conclusion that 22£ per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per ' cent, would be sufficient protection against the American Combine. But conditions have so altered since then that this protection has in some measure been I do not think clumps and wiped out. I am anxious that the raw material for these articles should be turned into the finished product in Australia, because our printing houses use thousands of tons of lead material in the shape of clumps, furniture, leads, and quads every year. We obtain a good deal of our requirements from Great Britain; but it seems strange that we should have The Americans are doing their to send the raw material 12,000 miles by sea to England, and bring the finished product back to Australia.",31,Robert Best Kooyong Makes Them Better Able To Pay The Duties

If spaces can be manufactured here, it is strange that clumps cannot also be made. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. is my intention to move to amend the item by increasing the British duty to 35 per cent. Those engaged in this industry in Australia have had a big struggle against a great deal of opposition, particularly from the American manufacturers, who are employing their well-known methods to destroy the local industry in order that they may have a clear run of the market. The Australian manufacturers are selling their type at prices considerably less than those at which we have been able to purchase outside. I can speak from experience, because I have been associated with the co-operative movement in my own State, and I know that we have been able to get almost everything we required at reasonable wrices. There is a'gentleman in Australia acting as foreign and In ter-State correspondent for one concern was that has not the welfare of the Australian industry at heart. This organization has issued a circular in which it invites the trade to endeavour to secure a considerable reduction in the existing duties on this item. This shows that even in Australia itself there are those who are endeavouring, in connection with this partion of the duties by which it is protected. After setting out the need for a reduction of duties, and dealing with the question of the serious injury to the import trade which the local industry represents, the circular to which I refer readsShould the foregoing meet with your views, it is suggested that you might see fit to place the matter before the member for your Division in the House of Bepresentatives and the senators representing your State, asking that the old duty be re-established without preference, which, after all, only serves to hamper the importation of the best and not the worse classes of new type designs. Apart from any communication you may make to your political representatives, I should esteem it a favour if you would give me your views on this matter at your early convenience, for the confidential information of my principals. That circular is signed by T. D. Chataway, who, I understand, at one time occupied the position of a member of the Senate. That is the kind of opposition which the local industry has to meet. I have said that prices in Australia are less than the prices of English and American imports at the present moment; but a circular has been issued by a representative of one of the American firms in Australia in which the statement is made that they are prepared to sell type at a 50 ner cent, reduction cn present prices. The firm carrying on the industry in Australia pays all the wages they are called upon to pay; and I may inform the Committee that 55 per cent, of the selling cost of type is paid in wages which are spent in Australia. In spite of this, the local industry is called upon to enter into competition with American firms that are prepared to agree to a reduction of 50 per cent. on tt present selling prices in this country. I mention, further, that everything used in the production of type locally is of Australian manufacture. Here, again, the local industry is placed at a very great disadvantage in connection with the cost of the material it must use. In the",32,Robert Best Kooyong Makes Them Better Able To Pay The Duties

On this item, as on nearly every other that has been discussed, honourable members who are opposed to the proposed duty haye compared present prices with pre-war prices.

Again, the State Governments are spending enormous sums of money to combat the rabbit pest.

Every honourable member is aware of the. grave injury done by these rodents, and the placing of a heavy duty on an article that helps to keep them in subjection is absurd.

During the last few minutes I have heard views expressed by honourable members opposite wbich indicate that they are not fully seized with the serious nature of the devastation caused by rabbits. The inference has been made that the existence of large numbers of rabbits is beneficial because they supply food and skins. I admit that when rabbits are trapped or shot their carcasses may be used for food and their skin for fur, or for the raw material used in 'hat making. This to some extent is a mitigation of what is otherwise a terrible affliction upon the Commonwealth. But this fact provides the strongest possible argument in favour of the removal of a duty which may result in making it unpayable to trap rabbits. ""We cannot exterminate the rabbits, but there is an enormous advantage in trapping them, and thus securing the carcasses and the skins, as against adopting the purely destructive policy of poisoning them. the best means of .preventing the spread of said. rabbits? which members of the Country party are the strongest advocates, is a. most excellent preventive' against the spread of rabbits, or any other pest; but the rabbit question has a most important bearing upon closer settlement, especially upon the settlement of soldiers on country lands. On one large estate I visited a few years ago in search of grass for sheep during a drought period I saw enormous numbers of rabbits. There was a sufficient amount of grass, but I remarked to my manager, when I decided to put my sheep there, that I felt confident we could not keep them there for more than three or four months. The rabbits on the property were very numerous, because at that time it did not pay to trap them exhaustively. This estate was subsequently bought for. the settlement of soldiers. It was exceedingly them. But I am also anxious to assist valuable land, with a good rainfall, and the prospects were favorable, save in one respect, the prevalence of rabbits. Last week I inquired as to the progress made by the soldiers who had bought the land, paying a price which would not have been unreasonable if therehad been no rabbits. I was informed that they were not doing too well, and when I asked if they had got rid of the rabbits, the reply was, "" No; they are the trouble.'* In regard to the duty upon rabbit traps^ I ask the Minister to make some concession upon the British rate of duty. I know that he is prepared to make someconcession in regard to the general rate,, but the proposed duty of 20 per cent. on. British-made traps is too high. The discussion on this item has made it apparent that the imposition of heavy duties on rabbit traps is a very serious matter toall engaged in the farming a>id grazingindustry.

Eveni f it means remaining here late, I shall not neglect my duty by allowing this item to pass without raising' a strong protest against such high duties. I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision in view of the cogent arguments which have been adduced. of the Committee. [Quorum formed.] pared to agree to a British rate of 15 per cent.? people in the country producing foodstuffs are not even paying expenses, and it is the duty of the Government to protect their interests. The cost of erecting wire netting fences on small areas of from, say, 200 to 800 acres, is more per acre than on larger areas. I would now point out that any extra cost of rabbit traps, or of rabbit trapping, must fall much more heavily upon small landowners than upon the owners of large estates, The owner of, say, 10,000 acres in one solid block will have comparatively little difficulty in protecting his property from rabbits by erecting a wire-netting fence all round it. But the smaller the area the greater the cost per acre incurred in wire netting. Consequently, a large number of settlers on small holdings cannot afford to protect their properties by completely enclosing them with rabbit-proof netting, because it adds to the cost per acre of the land. Therefore, they have almost entirely to rely upon trapping. I have already detained the. Committee longer than I intended, and. I now make a final appeal to the Minister to amend the rates in the direction I have suggested. difficult to know, in following the arguments of the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), whether he is speak: ing as representative of the disappearing constituency of Grampians or as a prospective candidate for"" some metropolitan seat. I do not care, personally, whether The bulk of the rabbits trapped the matter at issue is rabbit traps, or not. With me, the question is, "" Is this article,, necessary as it is for use in Australia, to be made.in this country, or not? "" Does the honourable member for Grampians desire the importation ofrabbit traps from overseas ? dp not care where they come from. agreement on the part of honourable members opposite. One wants rabbit traps, cheap, and does not care who makes them. made easily in Australia, and that they would be of a quality which would defy competition; and, moreover, that Australian makers could cater for the demand with the help of a 10 per cent. duty. things ought to be turned out in Australia as easily as anywhere else, and there is no reason why they should not be made here to cater completely for Australian requirements. But, if honourable members desire rabbit traps to be made in Australia, let them agree to a duty which will permit these things to be turned out here, and overthrow foreign competition. If an honourable member were to say that there should be no duty at all, I could appreciate his view-point; but, when he advocates a duty as low as 10 per cent., it is obvious that he does not favour a Protective Tariff, but wants a revenue Tariff. He wants to impose so low a duty that it will not protect the Australian manufacturer, but will encourage the importation of foreign products-which , however, will be required tp pay a heavy revenue tax.

' I consider that the Minister has gone far enough, and I hope he will not, either now or upon any occasion, agree to less than a rate of 20 per cent. For a duty less than that is not protective, but is merely revenue productive. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr while assisting to rid their neighbourhood Anstey) has apparently missed a most important point. It is involved in the consideration of what is the least expensive method of destroying rabbits. Poisoning and the trap are the means most commonly employed. But poisoning is the most wasteful. It not only destroys the rabbit as an asset after its destruction, but it is destructive to the natural life of the bush generally. The use of the poison cart has cost Australia hundreds of thousands of pounds, if not millions. Australia that much. lot of people consider the poison cart the best and most effective means of coping with the pest. the easiest. trouble. the only really effective way. ing is the most effective way; but if effecThere is a prominent resident of Meltiveness is the sole objective, the best method of all is to poison the water. That settles the rabbit, but everything else also, at the same time. The poison cart 'has been the means of almost exterminating bird life in parts of Australia. It has had the effect of tremendously increasing the blowfly pest, and dt has added to our troubles with grasshoppers. There are many factors wbich operate in upsetting fche balance of nature; but nothing has been so ruthless in that direction as the poison cart. By its use not only is the carcass of the rabbit itself wasted, but the balance of nature becomes seriously disturbed, if not locally overthrown ;and that balance is the only certain safeguard of the man on the land. The trap may not be as destructive as poison; but it does not destroy the'natural enemies of the rabbit and the various other pests which burden the producer. Tbe rabbit trap is the small man's weapon. Netting, which is becoming ever more expensive, is the means adopted by the large holder for ridding his land of rabbits. Not only is the trap the main asset of the small holder in keeping down the pest, but it is the means adopted by thousands of children throughout Australia of bringing in a little pocket-money of rabbits; and it is similarly the means of providing employment for large numbers of men in the off seasons. The poison cart takes away the opportunity for young people to make a little money, and for the working man in the country to make a living during the dull periods. If .the Minister insists upon the rates set forth in the schedule he will be conferring undue advantage upon the poison cart. It is highly necessary that we should, as far as possible, restore the balance of nature. An old resident of New .South Wales, who has been writing to the papers for many years upon this subject, has established a sanctuary on his own extensive property in an effort to restore the depleted bird life and native fauna. He will not permita poison cart anywhere near his run, yet, I am told, he is the least troubled by rabbits among all the landowners in his district. If all holders were to follow the advice and example of Mr Abbott, they would not be troubled with the vermin and other pests which so handicap the man on the land to-day. bourne who has also long given consideration to the subject of the restoration of the balance of nature. He has practically spent his life in working out problems having to do with the extermination of rabbits and the like, and he is bitterly opposed to the poison cart. In the matter under discussion there is not only involved the question of the rates of duty to be fixed upon rabbit traps, but there is this additional consideration:",39,Robert Best Kooyong Makes Them Better Able To Pay The Duties

If the Minister intends to accept or move an amendment, I hope it will be in the direction of according greater preference to Britain. In the course of the Tariff de'bate I have already urged more generous measures of preference towards the TJnited Kingdom, and I have suggested that, if necessary, the duties in respect of foreign products should be increased. With its wide variety of climatic conditions, the Empire is capable of becoming self-supporting. never can be, self-supporting. No single country, indeed, which sets out in that direction can become anything but a failure. week, when debating the duties upon wire netting, I spoke of the devastation caused by rabbits in the north-west of Tasmania .and parts of Victoria. I do not propose to repeat those remarks, but I earnestly ask the Minister to accede to a reduction in the rates of duty upon rabbit traps. Of what importance is an industry-if it can be so called-engage d in the manufacture of rabbit traps compared with the welfare of agriculture and grazing throughout Australia? I fear that the Minister and many honourable members do not realize the menace of the rabbit pest. Had their experience been such as mine, they would perceive how Teally trivial is the question whether or not rabbit traps can be or should be profitably made in Australia. The cry of honourable members is, "" Give Australian industry a chance."" I say, "" Give Australian pioneers a chance, and do not talk about the manufacturer every time you speak of Australia."" I said, by interjection just now; that I did not care where rabbit traps came from so long as we got them cheap. I repeat that with all seriousness. What does it matter who makes the weapon with which we fight and try to overcome the menacing rabbit pest? I do not care whether the rabbit trap which I use to save my holding is made in Japan, or in Germany, or in some other world, in fact. It is our chief weapon of offence against Australia's worse scourge. In many parts, the man on the land is faced with ruin. We must use the trap, and the poison cart, and wire netting, too. We have already put on wire netting a very high duty, which was not justified in any sense. I am now offering my little plea against a further increase on the other weapon which we must use for the destruction of rabbits. I ask the Minister to give favorable consideration to our request. I have supported him on every occasion when those on the Opposition benches have asked him for an increase, and I do expect him to give some consideration to the people for whom I am speaking. Trade and Customs) [5.21] I am sorry that I cannot see my way clear to agree to my honourable friend's request. I have heard a number of debates which had some amusing and some annoying features, but to-day I have heard statements about which I can say that I really do not know whether they annoy or amuse me most. Any honourable member who has had experience of what happens under practical trapping conditions knows f u l l well the net result on the number of rabbits in this country. that last year. 16,000 rabbits were trapped on one sheep run, of less acreage than that number, at any rate. 16,000 acres off which 16,000 rabbits are trapped in a year is infested country. trapped more than that in a week in a place half that size. fested country far more would be trapped. Everybody knows that in most instances the rabbit trapper's idea is not to get rid of the rabbits entirely, but to keep them going. * make it a permanent industry? itself is not much good as a means of getting rid of the pest. We have had experience in Australia regarding the industry of manufacturing rabbit traps. The effect of making this duty 10 per cent, would simply be to turn it into a revenue duty, and the industry would go out of existence.",40,Robert Best Kooyong Makes Them Better Able To Pay The Duties

204,Mr Greene,"No; but trapping bybe simply a revenue duty ? Tbe trap is the simplest thing in the world to make. mittee an instance of what happened under the old 10 per cent. Tariff. I have received a letter from a man who is now manufacturing rabbit traps, in which he .saysWithout a duty local manufacture is impossible except for just a month or two as at present, while there is a dearth of imported traps. My reason for making this assertion is based on the experience of a few years ago. At that time a local factory was established, but the venture was disastoous, because makers abroad dumped traps into Australia at a price which made it quite impossible for the Australian firm to compete, and when it had been defeated* prices were, of course, raised. raised much before the war. -experience we have had, we cannot agree to reduce this duty if we have any real desire to see Australia put in a position to protect itself in all circumstances. I cannot believe that a duty of 20 per cent, can result in any increase in the price of rabbit traps, with several makers manufacturing in this country. The duty is moderate. I am prepared to take out dog traps, and to make the foreign duty 30 per cent. that. it. In making that offer I am meeting the Committee in a reasonable way, and at the same time keeping faith with the manufacturers who came to our rescue at a time when we were practically helpless. cent., which operated some years ago, did not apply to British traps? been a duty on British traps? stances, a duty of 10 per cent, would be reasonable. The Minister's reply to the common-sense arguments that have been used has been simply a repetition of the answers he has given all through the piece to reasonable demands made by reasonable members. We have given him a very fair go so far as the Tariff is concerned. Everywhere outside one can hear it said that the people are going protection mad. I am a Protectionist, but many of the items to which the Committee have agreed represent, not protection at all, but extreme prohibition. An instance of that is the duty of 45 per cent, on a reaper and.' binder, which is one of the most useful necessities that a man can have on a' farm; and another instance is the duty of 68s. British, S4s. intermediate, and 105s. general, per ton on wire-netting. The TEMPORARY CHAIRM AN ( Mr Atkinson) -Order! I must ask the honourable member to direct his re: marks to the item before the Committee. which I refer are closely connected with, this item, which puts an almost prohibitive duty on imported traps. Rabbit traps were -manufactured here for years in the past, and sold for a paltry 8s. 6d. per dozen, and even then the makers made money. They are the implements of trade for hundreds of people, who have made a' very fine living at trapping. In 1917-18, the exports of rabbits, taking eight rabbits to the sheep, were equal, to 3,288,579 sheep. That shows what a good industry it is to the trapper. We must also remember the losses suffered by the man on the land through the destruction caused by rabbits. Hundreds of people throughout the ""Commonwealth who are now idle could be well employed in trapping rabbits. Trappers have made up to £6, £8, and £10 per week. A good trapper can manage about 100 traps. The lifetime of a trap is only about one 10 per season, taking into account losses and other causes. Of the two industries, the manufacture of traps, which the Minister is so anxious to foster, and the destruction of the rabbit pest, the latter is far greater, and of much greater importance, and employs many more hands. If we handicap the man on the land in the way proposed, the population of our capital cities will increase in a still greater ratio than it has done in the past. The penalizing effects of the imposts which we are placing on wire netting and rabbit traps will make it practically impossible for any person to live in the outlying parts adjacent to rabbit-infested country.

All through the piece the amusing argument has been put forward that these excessive duties are going to reduce prices. been my experience in the past, nor do I think it has been the experience of many other members. I am convinced, speaking on behalf of the man on the land in particular, that by imposing penalizing duties of the kind now before us, we shall do the country tenfold more harm than good.

I can sympathize with the desire of men out of work. I do not say that of the man on the land that the cost of the Corner party believe in that sort of agricultural machinery and implementsthing.

If local competition were destroyed, farmersand others who use rabbit traps would bein. the hands of the importers, who could enter into a Combine to regulate prices, and charge what they pleased. It israther curious that honourable members of That has not the Country party should be putting up a strenuous fight on this relatively unimportant item, seeing that far more important items were allowed by them to go» through yesterday, notwithstanding that they were of great moment to the primary producers.

Undoubtedly it is erratic, because the vermin are at times more troublesome than at others; I hope we shall do someand there is no reason why we should endeavour to establish a permanent industry which is subject to such erratic conditions. There is no getting away from the fact that this increased duty will rabbit traps. manufacturer who seeks this duty of 20 per cent, says that it is essential, because he cannot cope with the existing competition. I am proud to admit that the I invite the honourable duties imposed to encourage a good many industries in Australia have ultimately led to reduced prices; but, according to the expert who asked the Minister to imThe process is as simple as pose this duty it is impossible to establish a successful and continuous industry I prefer to of rabbit trap making.

I will fight this item to the last ditch, and, if it is. passed, I will do my best to bring about its rejection by another place.

I think that the most ardent Protectionist, without any sacrifice of principle, can heartily the duty which it is proposed to levy upon adopt the view that no obstacle should be thrown in the way of obtaining,, in the cheapest and most effective form, the materials necessary for coping with these pests. We need traps for trapping rabbits and dingoes, arsenic to deal with the prickly pear, and chemical dips for dealing with the tick and other evils. All these should be obtainable in the speediest and cheapest way. We are all familiar with the historical advice that a man should not argue with "" the master of fifty legions,"" and it may be well for us not to refuse the bargain which has been offered us by the Minister( Mr Greene), who is, after all, the master of the situation, since he is in charge of the Tariff.

I am strongly in favour of having rabbit traps made in Australia, but I. do not think that the imposition of a duty is necessary to secure that result. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) has shown that this is one of those simple industries whioh do not require the assistance of any duty whatever. If a duty of 20 per cent, be imposed upon rabbit traps, it will most certainly increase their price to our rabbit trappers. the rabbit? is one of the most injurious in Australia.

While I admit that the dingo is a pest, the injury he does to Australia does not represent a hundredth part of the injury done by the rabbit. The dingo is not nearly so bad a pest a* even the prickly pear. I say this although I know that many people are to-day being driven off their holdings, and thousands of acres that used to be devoted to the rearing of sheep are -now devoted to the rearing of cattle because of the ravages af the dingo. If we leave things to natural law we shall be able to cope with the rabbit pest; but when men bring along the poison cart, and so disturb the balance of nature, it is difficult to say what will be the ultimate result. I am opposed to this duty because, in my view, it may mean all the difference between the destruction, of rabbits by trapping and their destruction by the use of poison, which is one of the most dangerous means that could be adopted.

(2) Linseed and castor, per gallon, British, 9d.; intermediate, Is.; general, Is. The manufacturers of both linseed and castor oils are experiencing great difficulty in carrying on at present. The position of linseed-oil manufacturers in particular is somewhat difficult owing to the fact that in England, which is the chief competitor, the product is the cake and the by-product the oil, whereas in Australia the oil is the product and the cake the by-product. In England, the cake commands a much higher price than in Australia; and, as 3 tons of linseed produces 2 tons of cake and 1 ton of oil, and as the manufacturers obtain the raw material from the same market as we do, namely, India, they are in a better position to compete in the Australian market in connection with the production pf oil. As far as I am able to judge from a number of letters from manufacturers of paints and varnishes, no material objection will be raised to increasing the duty on linseed oil. I think that 4d. more on the general Tariff, and 3d. more on the British Tariff will give the local manufacturers a reasonable opportunity of carrying on their business. The rearrangement of duty on 'castor oil is necessary in order to put the manufacturers in a more satisfactory position. take it that the Minister( Mr Greene) has gone carefully into this question, and I am glad to know that some alteration has been made in the item, because in many parts of Australia, and particularly my State, manufacturers are obtaining from local plants oils which are gradually taking the place of the imported article. In Western Australia, one big firm engaged in the manufacture of methylalcohol is obtaining a valuable oil by-product from the blackboy tree. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to.

401,Mr Fleming,"It keeps the woolof improving the wool; but in nearly all cases dipping is resorted to for the twofold purpose of keeping the animals clean and improving the wool at the same time. I have not had much experience with cattle dips, but have been told by quite a number, who have used them that most of the Australian dips are too severe. killed the other day. I do not think it was an Australian dip that did that. I think it was an imported dip. from what I bave seen and heard, that if the honourable member inquires closely into the case he will find that it was some ter, advised, no doubt, by people not praccrudely manufactured Australian dip. Some of our dips are very good, but they have not yet come up to the standard of the best imported. The primary producer has quite enough burden to carry without having to pay more for his dips. We have imposed upon him additional expense for all his improvements in the way of his fencing wire, galvanized iron, aud things of that kind. We have added to the cost of all his implements and increased to a remarkable degree the cost of his fencing. We have even this evening put an additional charge on his rabbit traps and other appliances for keeping down pests. It seems to me that we have put quite enough, and far too much, upon the primary production of this country. I do ask the Minister( Mr Greene) to give the man on the land some consideration in connection with dips. I know that one or two firms have been using the whole of their strength and influence in order to get their industry bolstered up. me yet. that any one has been bribed. I know the honourable member is only joking; but some people take up a remark of that sort seriously. So far as my experience has gone in connection with the Tariff, the finger of scorn cannot be pointed at any one on either side of the House. I believe this schedule is being put through with absolutely clean hands. -I urge the Minister not to jeopardize further this tremendous wool-growing industry of ours for the sake of minor industries. We have already added enormously to the burden of the wool producer. Every man is aware that, with the charges imposed on the wool grower even before the passage of this Tariff, it does not pay to grow wool at present prices. That is rather a serious statement to make; but every man interested in wool-growing will, I think, agree with me that, at the average price of wool as fixed here a little while ago. in connection with the Bawra scheme, it would not pay to grow wool. Since we put that arrangement through this House a number of additional burdens have been imposed, and now along comes the Ministically interested in wool^growing, but directly interested in sheep dip, to impose another burden which will reduce the quality of our fine merino wool. It would not matter so much for Australia, as a whole, if the effect of this impost was likely to be reflected only in the poorer qualities of wool. It would certainly be very important to the individual wool-growers, but this matter goes even further than that, because while the man who grows inferior wool will have it still further lessened in value, the high class wool, for which Australia has become famous all over tbe world, will be apt also to receive a check. We cannot afford to do anything which w ill in any way lessen the value of our high-class clip. That is the one thing above all others for which Australia has made a name. would cost per sheep? hand. member think it would be more than a farthing? of sheep used to cost over I d . per head, but nowadays it would probably cost nearer 3d. I do not know what this charge will amount to. the man who has to dip from 20,000 to 35,000 sheep begins to consider the consequences. Very often the sheep are dipped more than once in a year. In fact, the dip is used in",59,Dbugs And Chemicals A Wool Grower Has Been That Our Austra

411,Mr Fleming,"Even if that is so,many cases throughout the whole course of the. year, more particularly to keep away the flies. I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter and reduce the duty to. 10 per cent. British, leaving the intermediate at SO per cent., and putting the general Tariff up, if he likes, to 40 per oent. or 50 per cent., because the only dips that really matter to us-the only ones whioh we consider completely outolasa onr own-ar e the British. I have already urged on more than one occasion, and will continue to urge, that we should give as much preference as possible to the Old Country; but in this oase it is not so much a question of preference to G-reat Britain as that we want to maintain the standard for which we are notedeverywhere, as the producers of the greatest quantity of first class wool that the world handles. propose to urge the Minister( Mr in Australia. It is not as if we Greene) to increase the duty on this item. doubtless aware that during the war pressure was brought to bear to increase the production of dips within Australia, and encouragement waB given to certain firms to expect protection if they supplied the quantity required for Australian Wool-groweTs, &o. This promise brought William Cooper and nephews from England to establish their industry in Australia. mise? was a direct promise, because that could be given only bythis Parliament, but there was anunderstanding, as there was in regard to a number of matters during war time. Tbe undertaking was that, as far as the Government were concerned, if the local manufacturers met the requirement of the Commonwealth they would be encouraged. There are now in Australia no fewer than twelve manufacturers of dips. I do not care what any honourable member says to the contraryIhave .known dips ever since the first cattle tick was brought into Australiano dip has given more' satisfaction for cattle than the Royal rattle dip. It is absolutely adequate. Nothing better has been introduced from overseas. I can [370]2 also assure the Committee that Victor Leggo's cattle dip and sheep dip ' are equal to anything that has been imported. nature conservative. If they bave had their clothes made by a certain tailor, they think no other tailor can make them as well That has been the case in connection with dips. From practical experience I am sure that this industry deserves to be encouraged in order that, no matter what happens, the best quality of dip may be produced here for the requirements of this great continent. A large quantity of the material used in dip making is imported. We have increased the duties on that considerably, and if woare to protect the industry at all we must increase the duty on' this item; otherwise, the oversea manufacturer will be able to compete unfairly with us were at the mercy of one or two Honourable members are firms, because already twelve firms are, I believe, established in the Commonwealth who can meet, and are meeting, all our requirements. Many honourable members consider Thomas' a good dip, and that article is manufactured here. Some time ago there was on outcry against the Ministry for preventing the importation of Cooper's dip, but Coopers have now established works here, and make a dip of the same quality as that which they used to send here from overseas. It must not be forgotten that .the bulk of the materials used for the manufacture of sheep dip are dutiable at high rates; and I hope the Minister will increase the protection on dip by at .least 5 per cent, to make up for that. reduce the rates on the raw material. dealt with the duties on the raw material. I do not occupy time in this chamber unduly, but I consider it my duty, on matters of vital importance, such as this, to speak strongly. Doubtless the Minister haa been approached by other's in reeard to this matter, and I hope that he will see his way to give adequate protection. Progress reported.
