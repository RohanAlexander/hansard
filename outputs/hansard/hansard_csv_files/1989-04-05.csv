In fact, both the -PI and the implicit price deflator I had discussions with the bus and coach ov-r the last six years. What had happened association prior to the legislation. It asked was that the implicit price deflator had been whether we would amend the legislation to ahead of the CPI for only two of those years. make it clear that State governments· were Over a period it is usual for them to tend to required to do that. I was not prepared to balance. out. Of course, they are doing that do that. We were not instructing the States this year; the implicit price deflator is ahead how much they should have used for those of the CPI. It was sensible on my part to purposes nor the purposes for which they resist that pressure and to use the implicit could have used it. We made it perfectly price deflator as the index for the level of clear in this legislation that the States could funding. I expect the implicit price deflator use that even, say, for interchange arrangeto come in at around 10 per cent, maybe a ments that were being used by private bus little below. It means that the increase in the operators, and even if they were just being level of funding in nominal terms to mainused exclusively by private bus operators. tain the real value will be about $120m next There is no restriction being imposed by us; year. That represents an increase of about the States can decide that themselves. What $30m to $35m over what it would have been I undertook to do and did was to put it into had I used the CPI. We are better off as a the notes of administration, so that it is there result of using the implicit price deflator and spells out clearly and emphasises to the instead of the CPI for that indexing. States that if they want to use some of that for any sort of joint facilities, such as bus be somewhere between 7 per cent and 8 per would be free to do so. The industry has cent. accepted that as well. There were a number of reasons why. the The question of the percentage of fuel beer tax was reduced. The honourable memexcise that is going back into roads has been ber for Richmond correctly indicated that canvassed before. I know that the claim has that brought about a reduction in excise of been made that it is only 20 per cent. But about $400m. One of the reasons for that everyone knows that the rest of fuel excise was that the Government was hopeful that makes it possible for us, in turn, to provide it would get a reduction which would feed something up to $13m in untied grants to more directly into the CPI in order to help the States and about $650m in untied grants it achieve its general type of macro-economic to local government. They. in turn can,. and objectives. In 1988 we deregulated the oil clearly do, use those funds in turn to assist industry as well. The indexation of the crude them with their road funding.

The replacement of claimed that when we put. those together, that by fuel excise when it was falling was that represents a direct hypothecation of fuel abandoned in 1988. As a result of that there excise going back into roads. It would be was a loss to revenue from the taxing of oil ridiculous for me to do that. As the honourof around $270m.
