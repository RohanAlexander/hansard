Bearing in mind that this is a most dreadful drought that we are having in Australia currently, I think that for the future the government will certainly need to look at drought proofing measures and taxation benefits that may be applicable to the farming community to enable it to take a lot of the preventative measures that are required to ensure that a property remains viable during what we are seeing as an extreme drought throughout Australia. Instances of these measures are on-farm water storage, on-farm grain storage and land improvements to overcome any degradation of the land that might occur as a result of the drought. I know that the landcare program has been especially effective in my electorate, areas of which have been amongst the leaders in landcare measures. They certainly have put those programs to very effective use. The government will need to look at putting in place funding arrangements and taxation benefits that will in fact drought proof a lot of properties throughout Australia. In approaching this matter of drought relief in a bipartisan manner, there is a need for permanent provisions by the government-irrespective of who happens to be in government-for drought, so that people know precisely what their benefits are and know, before they get into a situation of extreme drought, that there will be assistance, cooperation and guidelines firmly in place that can be brought into play if such a drought should occur.",113,Committees This Proposal Has Been Prepared And Is Being

231,Mr Reid (Bendigo) (10.01 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I acknowledge the government's1466 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 I particularly recall the situation in Victoria, when we went through a disastrous drought in 1982, and the ramifications of that and of the Ash Wednesday fires. After the fires had subsided and the extent of the damage had been assessed, the Victorian state government at the time embarked on a wide ranging program of counterdisaster measures which they put in place through legislation. Those provisions have remained in place since that time. People need to know that, if they are affected by drought or by fire, there are guidelines to assist them in understanding what relief will be made available by the government. We need to ensure that there is an understanding by people in the rural community and by other people affected by natural disasters that there is something there to assist them in each particular case. It is absolutely vital that we ensure that people in the rural community are looked after in cases of drought, because they are one of the major export earners in Australia and they produce a lot of Australia's wealth. We have a very good reputation for the cleanliness of our agricultural product, and that reputation has spread throughout the world. People acknowledge that food produced in Australia by our rural community is in fact clean: it is acceptable worldwide, and Australia has an extremely good food production reputation. If the proper drought relief measures are not in place, we are in serious danger of losing many of our good farmers. There has been a movement away from rural pursuits in recent years where young people have chosen to leave the farm and take up other careers. The average age of people farming in Australia has increased. We are in danger of losing even more young people from the farming community as a result of the ravages of this drought, which extends throughout Queensland and New South Wales, ancl now southerly down into Victoria. The fact that drought affects everyone is borne out by what happened during the 1982 drought. Drought affects the farmers who are producing the food, it affects small business around the towns which support the rural communities, and it ultimately flows on to large business throughout capital cities. That was never more evident than during the 1982 drought. I am sure that in Queensland and New South Wales people would also be feeling the impact now in the small business communities, and it would be flowing on into Sydney and Brisbane. Farms are not producing anything. The land is ravaged by the weather and is degraded as a result, and a lot of the topsoil is lost. People are placed in a situation where they have to face up to the elements and the deterioration of their farm property. For financial or physical reasons many of them are forced to give up and leave the farm. We have lost many good farmers as a result. Just the same, in small towns the mainstays of those communities-the small businesses-are affected. They provide goods and services to the farming community and are unable to withstand the economic and social trauma that is handed down through the deterioration of the farming pursuits. People lose their economic and social viability in those towns and they leave. Then, because of the declining population, government services are withdrawn. Many small towns are shrinking as a result of the impact of the drought we are going through now. Those effects flow on to larger cities. Following the 1982 drought Melbourne was inundated with people who had left rural communities ancl had gone to Melbourne seeking employment. There is an impact on the economic activity in capital city areas because most of the manufacturers are based in the metropolitan area. Some of the large agricultural manufacturing enterprises are operating in those areas and they are seriously affected. Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1467 I want to touch on the relationship between the present drought and the difficulties that we are experiencing, and the need to put something permanently in place that will provide guidelines for the rural community in this great time of need. There are a number of parallels between our policy and the government's policy. I want to enumerate some of those. The parallels between the two policies include the provision of immediate farm family income support. This is absolutely vital. The coalition makes provision for support through a revamped farm household support scheme and the suspension of the assets test on welfare payments, the government via its new drought relief payment. There is also improved access to Austudy for children from farm families in drought areas by exempting them from the on-farm assets test for this benefit. One thing that would exacerbate the tragedy of a drought would be if children, through economic necessity, were withdrawn from their studies. Further parallels involve greater flexibility and increased funding under the rural adjustment scheme for farmers experiencing drought in exceptional circumstances and the provision of assistance through the rural adjustment scheme for up to 12 months after the drought breaks. This is important because the ramifications of the drought go on, even after it has rained, because of the deterioration of the land. A lot of the topsoil, a lot of trees and a lot of native grasses are lost when it does rain, particularly if there is a heavy downpour. We need to be able to rehabilitate the land and to make sure that the land becomes viable in the future. I am certainly not condemning what the government has done. I think that it has met some of the concerns of the rural community but I am concerned that the package did nothing for small business operators in many of those drought areas because their cash flow has been absolutely decimated. We can understand that people in the farming community are going through this dreadful time when they do not have any income. There is additional pressure on small business operators who are providing them with goods and services to sustain them on the farm in the hope that the rural seasons will improve. I would have thought that the government could have looked at providing some form of package to small business in many of those rural areas where they are servicing the farming community. Many of those small businesses will be facing a dreadful time at the moment because, whilst the income support to the families is very much welcomed, it will only be enough to sustain those families. There will not be much left after that to provide for additional services and goods from small businesses in the area and, of course, that will affect their viability. I do have some very serious concerns about the impact of the drought on small business. A solution could have been achieved by returning severe or exceptional drought to the natural disaster relief arrangements and that would have given small business and farmers access to long-term concessional loans. I know that a loan still has to be paid back but, if it were a reasonably attractive loan on a long-term basis, interest repayments would be easier for those small businesses and it might help some of them to overcome the effects of the drought. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to speak both before and after the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) made his announcement and I do welcome the provisions that have been made. I do not believe that drought relief should be a political issue between parties. I think that what we should be trying to do is to arrive at a bipartisan position where there are strong guidelines in place. Farmers should know what the rules of 1468 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 the game are if a drought descends upon them. They should know that there is provision on an ongoing basis to help them not only for the drought period but also for a period of time after the drought so that they can rehabilitate the land and get it back into full production again. I think the government should now be looking at providing long-term benefits to the farming community, particularly to farmers who want to try to drought proof their property or to make provisions for it. I know the honourable member for Lyons( Mr Adams) would appreciate that. Whilst Tasmania is not in the grip of this drought, there are some areas that are affected. It is probably not a drought by outback Queensland and outback New South Wales standards but certainly there has been a lower level of production for them. The member would understand that there is a need for an ongoing provision of measures for farmers, particularly in the area of drought proofing of properties. The tax benefits that might be given to farmers allow them to provide a bit of insulation against the ravages of the drought that we are currently going through. I believe the important thing is the need for long-term planning to ensure that farmers are kept on the farm. Farmers are one of the major economic stimulants to the economy and, of course, one of our greatest export earners. Their expertise should not be lost to the Australian community. Amendment Bill (No.2). It has many parts to it and it deals with many amendments to many of the acts dealing with rural industries. I certainly support the government's amendments to the bill, which do some tidying up work. I am opposed to the opposition's amendment, which has now been made redundant by the government's announcement yesterday in relation to assisting rural Australia in dealing with the drought issues. I basically want to support and speak about the wine industry. At the request of the wine industry, the bills allow a levy to be raised so that we can look at marketing, which includes wine promotion, wine export control, the wine label integrity program-which is so important in making sure we have integrity in all of our industries and in quality control-and how we describe Australian wine. These bills work through these issues. There is also the research component. The Wine and Brandy Corporation has a statutory responsibility to coordinate and fund research and development undertaken on behalf of the industry. The government provides matching funds for this expenditure on a dollar for dollar basis. In other words, the government recognises that, although the industry is an expanding one and quite lucrative, there is a great deal of research and development needed to ensure the viability and continuing success of the industry. The bill also ends the exemption that smaller winemakers, those processing less than 10 tonnes of product, had from paying a levy. As non-payers, they had no recognition in the decisions and operations of the corporation and its regulatory functions, nor were they able to seek specific assistance with research that involves the smaller wine grower. In the area where I come from in Tasmania there are small producers on small blocks. They sometimes miss out on the research opportunities from government agricultural departments and state departments. I think they also miss out on the research done in the bigger areas on how we are structuring research in the rural industries. For a small annual fee that constitutes the minimum levy rate, smaller winemakers will have the right to represent their interests at the annual general meetings and to receive services and information from the corporation. Some of the smaller winemakers rely on larger winemakers",115,Representatives Main Committee
232,Mr Adams (Lyons) (10.16 A.m.),"I support the Primary Industries and Energy LegislationThursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1469 to process grapes and to convert them into wine under instructions for a fee. The wine is then returned to the smaller winemaker to market. Under the current legislation, the larger winemaker is seen as the producer and is liable for a levy on the wine. This cost is added to the fee charged to smaller winemakers making them pay for the levy anyway but without being able to attend, debate or vote in the industry's meetings. The act allows all winemakers to participate fully in the decision making of their industry. Many small producers will not be exporters, but the changes to the domestic market directly affect them and it is important for them to have their say. Winemaking is becoming a very important industry in Australia. Annual production of beverage wine is about 450 miIlion lit res, from 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of wine grapes. The gross value of production of wine grapes is approximately $300 million, and the gross value of wine sales is about $1,200 miIlion. Wine grapes are grown in all states of Australia, with South Australia, of course, being the main producing state. There are about 4,000 grape growers supplying about 700 wineries. This industry is a very successful value adding export industry, with exports having grown from 11 million litres-worth $21 million-in 1985-86, to 103 million litres-worth $293 millionin 1992-93, and an estimated $394 miIlion in 1993-94. Export'> now accOlmt for over a quarter of production. The industry has set a target for exports of $1 billion per annum by the year 2000-a very big ask. Our main markets, by volume, are the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Sweden, the United States, Canada and Japan. Figures are now showing that the world wine market is saturated. In 1992, the world wine production of 29.4 billion litres exceeded consumption, which was 23 billion litres. But Australia's position in the cleaner southern hemisphere, Australia's quest for the high quality market and the fact that our wines are fruity and affordable have ensured a firm demand in the world picture. Other countries are a little nervous for their industries, as Australia's wine is beginning to be seen by connoisseurs as being in the premier league. I am sure you would agree with that, Mr Deputy Speaker. Tasmania is benefiting from the interest of wine producers. There are 59 registered wine growers in Tasmania, and there may be a few more growing grapes as a hobby. They are spread all over the state and grow a wide variety of grapes. The Tasmanian industry is relatively young, apart from our veteran wine grower, Claud Alcorso, who started making wine as a hobby after being told that basicaIly he could not grow grapes in Tasmania. He now has a very successful industry. It is surprising that Tasmania was slower than other states to see the potential. I think that people did not realise that our climate is very similar to those of Rome and south-western Spain, where there is plenty of wine grown. But it may also have something to do also with the exceIlent Cascade and Boags beers that have been brewed for over 100 years in Tasmania. Perhaps old habits die hard in Tasmania. However, in 1992-93 Tasmania produced 1,087 tonnes of grapes, half of which were red and half of which were white, giving Tasmania a chance for a nice range of table wines. We are certainly catching up now to some of the levels of the wines of the other states. Although we will probably never get to the same levels of production as exist in other states, because of our size, I think we can continue to produce first class wines and fit into our niche markets. I have noticed that Tasmania's wines have been seen in many mainland shows and are winning prizes across the country. 1470 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 But, as in all primary industries, there are many pitfalls. Unless smaller growers have access to marketing skills and research and development expertise, competition for export markets may soon see a promising industry fail. Levies are seen as an insurance. They are the safeguard to ensure that winemaking prospers, and that Australia is competing in its own right in what has been seen in the past as a European monopoly. The bill also deals with the Farm Household Support Act of 1992 and tidies up some matters in relation to that. The previous speaker, the member for Bendigo( Mr Reid), mentioned the drought issues and did touch on Tasmania. Some parts of my electorate are having a very tough time and, though conditions are not as severe as in western Queensland, where I spent some of my youth, or New South Wales, there are areas around St Marys and on the lower east coast and into the southern midlands of Tasmania which are extremely dry and where production levels are down. So any of the farmers in those areas would possibly have the opportunity of getting the benefit of some of the government's drought relief measures announced yesterday. Mr Tim Fischer-Are there drought declared areas in Tasmania? was very important was the need for a bipartisan approach to the broader picture of drought in terms of sustainability and whole farm management. I know the Farmers Federation in Tasmania is working very hard with its landcare officer to get farmers onto a whole farm management approach, and it has set some very ambitious time spans for that. The idea is to get farmers to look at their water catchment, at what coverage of trees and shrubbage exists within the farm, and to look at the farm as a whole and not one part of it at a time. We really come back to what we call sustainability, in getting agriculture to a sustainable situation. Of course, droughts and downturns in the rural area affect small towns. They have affected some of the areas in my electorate, and any assistance that we can get to some of our people will also sustain those small towns.

The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill makes a number of 'technical' amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Act. Broadly, these amendments will allow better management, focus and control in relation to approved joint venture and consortium, and approved trading houses; give greater promotional focus to certain expenditure; and provide Austrade with the power to introduce and administer a system of accreditation for export grants consultants. Included under the scheme since 1990-91, as single entity claimants, have been groupings of exporters known as approved joint venture and approved consortium. This facility allows exporters to present a group approach to markets where their aggregation of effort can demonstrate advantages over single supplier promotion. The advantage for exporters is that they remain as individuals for all other purposes under the EMDG scheme, including the ability to receive grants in their own right for their other export promotional endeavours. The facility is project based, and is at the discretion of Austrade within the confines of the act, and ministerially approved guidelines. Approved trading houses are individual entities, which, by virtue of their international network and trading expertise, are able to assist the promotion of the product of exporters who lack the funds and ability to undertake EMDG eligible promotion. Currently Austrade has only 30 days in which to make all of the inquiries necessary to a decision whether or not to grant approved joint venture-consortium status, or approved trading house status. This period, in many instances, has proved too short to allow for consideration Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1473 of all the facts. A period of 60 days should overcome this barrier to good decision making whilst, at the same time, not unduly delaying the processing of applications. Given approved status, it is important that the entity may be monitored for adherence to the conditions of approval. The act is deficient in regard to providing Austrade with the power to reconsider approved status in the light of subsequent unsatisfactory performance, or where guidelines have been amended to reOect changed government attitude. This bill rectifies the situation. The general limit to the number of EMD grants receivable by claimants is eight. With the focus of approval for joint venture-consortium being project specific, rather than the broad scope of activity afforded other categories of claimant, and in the light of experience, the control provided by this bill in limiting the life of approved joint venture-consortium to a threeto five-year range is seen as an important administrative control. In lieu of non-claimable accommodation, entertainment and sustenance expenses, the scheme provides an eligible expenditure allowance of $200 per day-maximum of 21 days per overseas trip. Currently, this allowance is assessed on the basis of the prime and principal purpose of the totality of trip, rather than focusing on the actual time devoted to eligible promotional activity. This bill, on the one hand, eliminates the possibility of the scheme supporting overseas vacations and, on the other hand, does not eliminate from grants consideration those exporters who may wish to undertake limited promotional activity whilst overseas primarily for other reasons. Finally, there are a number of consultants who provide a service to EMDG claimants with respect to the preparation and lodgement of claims. In 1992-93, over 50 per cent of claims were lodged through, or with the assistance of, consultants. As part of Austrade's enhancement of EMDG risk management, accreditation will provide a mechanism for improving the accuracy of lodged claims, thereby freeing some investigatory resources for use elsewhere within the scheme. I commend this bill to honourable members. is with some fear and trepidation that I stand to make my first formal maiden speech in this extraordinary chamber, but nevertheless I will overcome this and proceed. I restate my doubts about this chamber and its modus operandi. I do not, in any way, reOect on those who are working hard to make it work. The more fundamental, threshold question is whether it should exist, and whether it should meet concurrent with the House as a whole. These are judgments to be made again, and reviewed further down the track. I welcome the opportunity to address the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1994. Once more, there are amendments to this legislation. It is noteworthy that since 1988 there have been seven amendments to the parent act, and this is the eighth, making this probably one of the most amended pieces of legislation coming before this parliament. At an average of more than one amendment per year over the last few years, I hardly think that the government has grounds for self-congratulation, since I also note that by and large the amendments that have been introduced have been administrative, aimed at tightening up provisions that have been open to abuse. This current round of amendments is of a similar ilk. I might add that members should not be unmindful of the fact that for each and every amending bill to go through the parliament, there is a cost tag of about $1 million-that is,",121,Representatives Main Commiitee
236,Mr Tim Fischer (Farrer,"Leader of the National Party of Australia) (10.40 a.m.)-It1474 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 by dividing the total cost of operation of the federal parliament by the pieces of legislation, amending legislation and acts of parliament that pass in the course of each 12-month period. Therefore, there is an obligation on government to be conscious of a need to approach the whole process of amending legislation on a very sensible basis, and on an efficient basis, so that it is not coming forward constantly with amendments, but so that some effort is made to group those, and to provide that the legislation in its original form is correct in the first place. These constant reviews and changes to the scheme do not really provide a stable and secure environment for exporters. Nevertheless, we are not intending to oppose this amending legislation to this scheme, because it represents access to grants for businesses that might not otherwise qualify, and it does tighten procedures, which, by extension, may well result in savings that can be passed on to other small exporters. It is probably no coincidence that the amendments now before us, which impact upon grants to approved trading houses and approved joint ventures, follow on the heels of the effort of the Australian National Audit Office on the export market development grants scheme-which, I might add, was a scheme found to be wanting. This raises another question: what other shortcomings in the legislation are only revealed by detailed examination. I have said before-and I am not averse to repeating myself-it is time for this piece of legislation to be completely overhauled and for there to be a total redrafting. This should be originated, not in the rarefied environment of Austrade, but in an environment that permits the fullest and widest consultation between the interested parties, as well as with the ANAO. I believe that it is important for this legislation to give more substantive guarantees that it is comprehensive and fulfils the needs of the export sector, while at the same time protecting the tax dollar from improper application. While I am advocating a review of legislation, I would also advocate the need for Austrade itself to be the subject of a total efficiency audit. The McKinsey report on emerging exporters, when it was brought down some time ago, was not a testament to the efficiency of Austrade. It has been 10 years since the practices of Austrade were the subject of scrutiny by the ANAO, and I fail to see why this has not been remedied. In my view, the extent of legislative amendment does nothing to contribute to the confidence of the business community in the overall Austrade act. Indeed, the constant change that has been a feature of this piece of legislation may well contribute to greater business uncertainty. On the issue of registration of consultants, I support the addition of provisions that will more effectively regulate the standard of consultants engaged in the preparation of EMDG claims on behalf of business. A provision such as this is long overdue. It will hopefully speed up the process of claim examination by the department and reduce delays in the delivery of grants. I also welcome the intention of the amendment to tie grants more closely to actual promotional activity being undertaken overseas and to clarify with greater precision the conditions under which the grant will be paid. Again, I make the observation: why was this not previously addressed? I find it extraordinary that it needed an audit by the ANAO to bring about a tightening up on some of these provisions. Had it not been for the audit, I can only assume that this provision and those previously referred to relating to grants would otherwise have continued when clearly they were inappropriate. Why else would the legislation be subject to amendment? Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1475 The fact of the matter is that the government's overall approach to international trade is less than adequate. And while the export market development grants scheme probably offers some assistance to exporters, the government's longer term strategies are floundering. The government's self-congratulation on its trade figures is a sham. We all know what the picture is: imports up, exports down. The minister is not averse to quoting figures on the success of Australia's export drive. But when we analyse the figures a very different picture emerges. The fact is that whilst the government proclaims the Asia-Pacific as Australia's most significant market, in reality our exports are losing market share. Note that I said 'market share'; I did not say 'volume' because one would expect the volume to be increasing, particularly as we are caught in the slipstream of growth that is taking place in the Asian region with the ASEAN economic tigers, north-east Asia and elsewhere. It is clear that our exporters are by degrees sticking in a rut and it is for government to facilitate export. There is more to come. How can the government take any comfort from the recent report of the APEC eminent persons group? Our only claim to fame from the report is that it expresses a direction towards free trade. It is motherhood stuff, pure and simple. Of course, free trade on a sensible basis is a desirable end, but the question is how it is to be achieved. The report sheds no light on that at all, but it certainly does not close the door on some sort of discriminatory trade block. I suggest to the government that it read the small print with all of the aspects of APEC and the APEC eminent persons group report. In the context of our trading effort, a whole lot more effort is required. I remind the chamber that, in the case of Malaysia, our trade has increased in volume-I fully acknowledge that-but it has increased in minuscule proportions to the huge growth in the Malaysian economy. As a consequence our market share of Malaysian trade has fallen by some 10 per cent. In other words, Australia is not cutting the mustard with regard to its actual trade performance in maintaining market share. New Zealand is a case in point. New Zealand is niche market exporting to a great deal of Asia, south Asia, greater Asia and the Middle East, in a way which is taking the fight to our products more than I care to admit. New Zealand has of course done a great deal of industrial relations reform, taxation reform and waterfront reform and is extremely competitive in traditional Australian markets. I acknowledge that New Zealand has been out there securing market share, increasing market share in these dynamic economies of greater Asia and indeed right over in the Middle East. There is always a need to be cautious when giving anecdotal evidence and comment on matters relating to trade. Nevertheless, it has to be said that it is disappointing to walk into supermarket after supermarket in the Middle East to find that it is New Zealand product which is up in lights, New Zealand dairy product which is dominating the shelves and being given the priority. You then have to search for the Australian product around the comer at the bottom of the next shelf in a way which is a matter of very real concern. So there can be no complacency with Australia's trading effort. The coalition does not oppose the amendments before this chamber but I make the point that more work needs to be done with regard to Austrade, with regard to EMDG, and more work needs to be done to ensure that Australia maintains its market share in these growing Asian economies because we have been slipping behind in terms of market share in Indonesia, Malaysia and other Asian countries. 1476 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 Let me make one final point. I recognise that the government has been attempting to bolster its trading efforts to the Asian-Pacific region of the world. I want to remind the government that that ought to be done as an effort additional to all other trading efforts, not in place of them. For example, there is eastern Europe, which I know is of interest to some members as a potential expanded trading area for Australia, southern Europe and the North American markets. We should be opening up markets in South America and the Indian rim, which itself is an area of great potential. I fully support efforts to bolster our trading performance and increase our market share into the Asian countries particularly, the ASEAN countries, northeast Asia, south Asia and India and the Middle East. That should all be additional to our trading efforts in other regions in the world. Australia is a trading nation. By and large, it can be proud of its efforts. It can be proud of the decision taken in 1957 by John McEwen, minister for trade in the government of the day, to jump the gun and open up a trade treaty with Japan. At the time, this was done to the bitter opposition of the RSL but he showed real leadership in putting the framework approach and the facilitation that is government's role with regard to trade between Australia and Japan. This event in the 1950s underpinned huge developments such as Queensland coal, Western Australian iron ore and a raft of other activities and led to Japan being Australia's largest trading partner today. I would add that Australia and Indonesia must not be distracted by those elements which would seek to jeopardise a normal bilateral relationship and a warm bilateral relationship between our two countries. Indonesia is our largest neighbour. It is food for thought that those elements here in Australia which pursue certain agendas-and I respect their right to demonstrate, even their right to demonstrate this day-have led to the circumstance where it is now 19 years since the president of our nearest neighbour has visited this country. That in itself has a spill-over effect on the dynamic of the bilateral relationship and the underpinning of the trading effort of private enterprise in both directions between Australia and Indonesia. I am delighted that the Vice-President of Indonesia is visjting Australia at this time. I believe that, if the President of Indonesia finds himself able to visit Australia after this long gap, that too would be greatly appreciated. WhilstI do not approve for one moment of all that has happened in relation to East Timor over the years, I recognise the circumstances of the viewpoint of the government and the coalition with regard to East Timor overall. I say that Australia and Indonesia must have a strong bilateral relationship underpinned by a wide degree of contact, not just in the political realm-and recently senior ministers visited Canberra-not just in the business realm, with the further development of business council contact between Australia and Indonesia; but also in the cultural realm and right across the spectrum. Our two countries in this comer of the world have much to gain from a purposeful bilateral relationship underpinning expanded trading for the better standard of living of people both in Indonesia and in Australia. The coalition is not then opposed to the amending bill before the House, but I do stand by my comments of concern over the efficiency of Austrade and the need continually to amend its parent legislation. Development Grants Amendment Bill of 1994. This bill makes a number of minor technical amendments, which I will come to later. I would first like to make some comments on the scheme itself. The Export Market Development Grants Act of 1974 contains provisions which govern the method of application and eligibility for grants, a list of claimable export oriented",123,Representatives Main Committee
237,Mr Griffin (Corinella) (10.55 A.m.),"We are here today to debate the Export MarketThursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1477 expenditure, and mechanisms for the review of decisions, the recovery of overpayments and the termination of grant entitlements. The export market development grants or EMDG scheme, which is administered under that act, provides taxable cash grants of up to $250,000 per annum-$500,000 for approved trading houses-and is based primarily on expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets. Provided a person has incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in a grant year, that person will be entitled to a grant. A grant is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000. Claimants who have received eight or more grants are not allowed to receive further grants, and claimants who have received at least two prior grants are subject to a performance test which is assessed against export earners. Eligible expenditure includes such things as up-front marketing costs, travel expenses, special promotional literature and overseas representation. The Australian Trade Commission, Austrade, which administers the EMDG scheme, considers the main benefits of the scheme to include the points that grant funding is guaranteed by legislation, the grant is cash in hand, and the grant directly supports the majority of expenditure categories likely to be incurred by an exporter. The EMDG scheme has been successful. It was a scheme which was first established 20 years ago by the Whit lam Labor government. The results achieved by programs such as EMDG, both in Australia and overseas, prove that governments can forge partnerships of mutual benefit with enterprises and, in doing so, can create jobs and a more positive export environment. In 1992-93, Austrade received 2,473 EMDG claims with a value of $181 million for the 1991-92 grant year. This compared with 2,002 EMDG claims with a value of $143 million for the 1990-91 grant year. Around 96 per cent of the EMDG claims in 1991-92 were processed by Austrade before 30 June 1992. In the 1993 financial year, the EMDG scheme assisted 3,250 enterprises seeking export markets by providing about $195 million in taxable grants. These grants helped reimburse the marketing and promotional expenses of firms which are trading in some of the world's most competitive markets, in particular in Asia. The number of claimants last year was up by 31 per cent on the previous year. This indicates that more Australian companies are taking up the export challenge and looking for export opportunities to expand their businesses. The EMDG scheme has been successful, and this was confirmed recently in an evaluation report entitled 'Helping to meet the export challenge'. As the report shows, most EMDG claimants-some 70 per cent-are small to medium sized firms: those with less than $5 million in turnover a year, exports of less than $1 million, and/or fewer than 26 employees. This is consistent with the findings of the 1993 Australian Manufacturing Council-McKinsey report into manufacturing exporters and the LEK service export study. Both studies report a trend towards smaller, innovative enterprises taking up the call to export. The number of service companies claiming EMDG is growing, and is currently at 45 per cent of all grants; with manufacturers at 37 per cent, traders 15 per cent and primary producers three per cent. However, the McKinsey report also highlighted the fact that there remains a real challenge to further increase the number of Australian manufacturers who are exporting. It is found that up to 90 per cent of Australian manufacturing companies do not export to any significant extent. 1478 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 One of the more pleasing findings of the EMDG evaluation is that enterprises receiving grants have a higher commitment to exporting, in terms of employment and investment in export activities, than non-EMDG participants. On average, about half the employment of EMDG recipients is export-related. EMDG also plays an important role in encouraging recipients to seek out new export markets. Research shows the EMDG claimants actually increase their own spending on export market promotion by more than the value of their grant. This additional spending and activity, according to the evaluation committee, results in more exports. A very important point is that the typical 'mature' EMDG exporter generates additional exports of up to 15 to 25 times the value of the grant received. In other words, for every dollar that EMDG provides to mature exporters, an additional $15 to $25 is generated in export income. This is certainly good news in terms of the balance of payments and, most importantly, in terms of jobs. Important as it is, the EMDG scheme is only one small aspect of a complex array of policies and programs in, for example, education, training and science; macroand micro-economic management; and trade diplomacy and facilitation. The government's basic domestic trade industry strategy has been, and continues to be, to ensure that these policies work together to provide an economic environment that will enable Australian industry to be competitive and to maximise our export performance. The government's white paper on employment and growth, Working Nation, represents the next step. It contains measures to promote research and innovation, to improve access to finance and capital, to encourage investment, to reduce the administrative burden of government regulations, to enhance labour force flexibility and to improve the skills base of the nation. Most of the measures announced in Working Nation will be of particular benefit to small and medium-sized businesses, because that is where the potential for jobs and new growth is greatest. One particular set of issues that I want to mention briefly is aimed at strengthening the integration of trade and industry policy and program delivery. At the policy level, the Board of Industry, Trade and Investment, comprising the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), has been established to coordinate the development of strategies for trade and investment promotion, export facilitation and industry development. One of the government's primary concerns is to ensure that industry development and trade facilitation programs are delivered to industry and business effectively and seamlessly, with the maximum of impact and at the least cost to the taxpayer and the minimum of inconvenience to business. The government also announced in Working Nation the extension of the EMDG scheme for a further five years, thereby providing assistance to, ultimately, about 5,000 exporters a year. Its expansions provide export marketing assistance to single service tourism operators and assistance for offshore marketing activities by providing low interest finance through ITES, the international trade enhancement scheme, for a further four years at $50 million a year. Regarding the amendments themselves that are contained within this bill, the question arises of joint venture and consortia and trading houses, which are limited to a lifespan of three years unless they are renewed. Currently, once approved, a JVC or TH can exist forever, as long as it continues to meet the original eligibility criteria. The three-year lifespan introduces an automatic review every three years to ensure that the JVCs meet changing market and government requirements. Austrade is also able to respond appropriately to any new Thursday,22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1479 considerations that may arise. If the joint venture is continuing to meet the criteria in the guidelines, it would be expected that re-approval would be automatic. JVCs are limited to a maximum of five grants. Currently, they are treated in the same way as independent claimants are, and may claim up to eight grants. JVCs are generally project specific, with a time duration of less than eight years. It was never intended that they be eligible for eight grants, and it is inconsistent with the nature of them, particularly as members are able to claim up to eight grants independently. The joint venture provisions give companies additional access to EMDG. Austrade would expect that, after five years, companies would have had time to develop the capacity to claim as individual claimants. They also believe that to give companies potentially 16 years in the scheme through the operation of the joint venture provisions is excessive. There has also been an extension in the time allowed for Austrade to seek information in relation to an application for an approved JVC or TH status from 30 days to 60 days. Austrade has found that, with the rush of claims at the end of the claim year, the existing 30 days is often not enough time to analyse what information may be needed to assess an application. This extension of time will allow for better decision making. If an application is complete, Austrade will be required to give an answer within 90 days, as is currently the case. If applications are lodged well in advance of the claim, Austrade will be able to deal with the matter more expeditiously. Austrade's experience is that neither of these assumptions can be relied on. The extension of time from 120 days-that is, the existing 30 days plus 90 days-to 150 days, being the extension of 60 plus 90, is a maximum only. It is expected that the vast majority of well prepared applications will be dealt with well within the time limits. Austrade may also apply new ministerial guidelines to existing JVCs and THs. There is currently conflicting legal opinion about whether Austrade can apply new ministerial criteria to an approved JVC or TH and cancel them if they do not comply. This section clarifies the intention and will enable Austrade to ensure that JVCs continue to meet government objectives. The overseas visits allowance is calculated on a daily basis under this new proposal. EMDG currently allows $200 per day as claimable expenses while on an overseas trip that is primarily for business purposes. However, Austrade is obligated to reimburse all the days of a trip where the purpose of the trip is primarily for business promotional purposes, including recreation days, and cannot reimburse business promotional days where that trip was not primarily for business. This amendment will allow Austrade to reimburse those days primarily devoted to business promotion to the exclusion of non-promotional days. There is also a provision for the establishment of a framework for a consultant accreditation scheme. About 50 per cent of EMDG claims are prepared by consultants. Austrade is working with consultants to lift claim preparation standards but considers that a formal legislative scheme may be necessary if consultants are not responsive to cooperative efforts. This is an important part of the government's overall approach to industry policy and to trade policy as a whole. We have here a scheme which facilitates and assists small and medium-sized firms, particularly, to expand and develop export markets overseas, not only to Asia but throughout the world to a number of the locations mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party( Mr Fischer). The scheme has to be seen as part of an overall integrated program by government to assist business. The government does not believe that we can do it all by ourselves and it would be crazy to suggest that that was the case. We have a range of businesses and industries 1480 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 throughout Australia which have the capacity and the potential to expand into international markets throughout the world and to develop a much better trading base for Australia. We have a responsibility, as a government, to assist that. Programs such as the export access program, and the broad changes that have come into effect out of the white paper process, will assist many finns to address these sorts of issues, in terms of their forward planning in investment and markets. The bill helps to finetune this legislation and this scheme to make it even more effective. As I said, it is a scheme that has been expanding regularly over the last few years. It is a scheme which is held in good standing by industry, and it is a scheme which does the job of encouraging export marketing throughout Australia to all over the world. I commend the bill to the House. I note that it has support from both sides of the chamber and I wish it a speedy passage and that the changes have a speedy effect. Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. We believe it makes a number of worthwhile changes to the current act. The purpose of the amendment is to extend the period for consideration for approved joint venture and consortium and approved trading house applications. I will not go through it all because it has pretty well all been said before, but I will pick out a few points from the Auditor-General's report. My colIeague the member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party( Mr Tim Fischer), stated earlier this year that he was concerned that the export scheme was drifting and called for the government to respond promptly. This bill sets in place the mechanisms for that drifting to stop. I come to the issue of the exporters of Australia. We alI understand that the $150 million to $250 miIlion that is involved in this scheme is but a drop in the bucket. When we think of the postwar period and the opportunities for stable trade, I suppose we must all welcome that. When we look at the opportunities in Asia, Europe, the US, South America, India, Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States-the old Russia-and Eastern Europe, I guess it is fair to say that we have only started on this great journey of trade. It is acknowledged, overwhelmingly, that our EMDGs, as a fraction of our total exports are but a fraction of the full sum. It is more a matter of our culture. The percentage of enterprises within Australia which are currently exporting is very small. As I keep saying, we have only just started this journey. My electorate produces something like 50 per cent of South Australia's exports, so all my life I have been aware of the world trade situation. I suppose, as a farmer, one grows up understanding what exports are all about. In terms of incentive and the overalI picture for exports in Australia, I could talk all day about what we could and should do. But we are here today just to talk about the EMDGs. I refer briefly to employment. I complimented the member for Fraser( Mr Langmore) this morning when I saw him at a parliamentary committee meeting. In his book, Work for All, is a commitment that, as a country, we have forgotten how to target. Whilst the member for Fraser and I would differ on how we find jobs for alI Australians, I think he and I would be totally united in that target. I can only say that every piece of energy that I can muster will go into ensuring that this country enables every Australian to have a job. Exports are critical to that and, if anyone saw the former Senator Walsh's comments last night on Lateline, he has got a few pretty good suggestions for us in that area. He suggests that we just let the mining industry get on with the job and we will do ourselves, as a country, a lot of good.",126,Representatives Main Committee
238,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (11.10 A.m.),"Of course, the coalition does support the ExportThursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1481 I have made criticisms before about EMDGs. This is only a small point, I guess, but I think it is important to register it again. We do have a restriction in terms of the definition in the act in that an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets may, provided the person has incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in a grant year, be entitled to a grant and the grant is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000. I think this is very important. I would like to see those amounts lowered so that they may be picked up, and I think they would be picked up. I know many people who are interested in exporting, who would never, particularly in their initial sortie, spend that sort of money. It is a general criticism that I have made in the past and I will continue to make it. I am sure there will be criticisms from the administrators about the difficulty of administering so many claims and all that sort of thing but I cannot emphasise strongly enough that, if we want to be a country that offers full employment, if we want to be a country that maximises opportunity and its potential, then this is small beer to the small person in Australia, to the battlers in Australia who, particularly on their first trip, should be able to be picked up more easily than the current situation provides. I will conclude by simply saying that I welcome the audit office's recommendations, the improved accountability to parliament, the rationalisation of the strategic planning structure, the improved responsiveness, the improved quality of claims and control measures and optimisation of management planning and controls. Of course, Austrade accepts all these recommendations. Working Nation also had a number of changes to the export market development grant scheme and now it has extended the scheme to single service tourism operators to recognise the contribution of tourism to our exports. Of course, that is not before time. It also legislated to extend the export scheme for a further five years. In conclusion, there is nothing more important to this country-to its economic future-than exports. There is nothing more important to the well-being of our place in this region than developing stronger trading links and stronger exporting capacities. We have every reason in the world to do this. The Leader of the National Party spoke about our links with Indonesia. It cannot be overemphasised how important that is. At times, we are tardy in some of our trade dealings with people overseas. I think that is an area where we really need to lift our game. With those few words, I am quite happy to support the bill and I know that it will enhance the ability of Australians to access export markets. Grants Amendment Bill and we have heard a lot of the detail about the bill from previous speakers. I will not waste the time of the committee by going over that detail again. Perhaps it is worth mentioning briefly that this scheme is there to make sure that Australian businesses can get into export markets. It provides them with assistance in a variety of ways. The amounts can be quite significant and there are controls on how the money is spent, how it is accounted for and so on. What this bill is aiming to do is to make some modifications to that basic bill, to give more flexibility in some respects. It also aims to tighten up the rules of accountability and to target better the way that the money is spent. As I said, I am not going to go through all the detailed amendments. I am certainly not going to talk about the number of previous claims because it seems to me that one of the problems with bureaucracy these days is that we worry about the number of claims and the",130,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Nugent (Aston) (1l.l8 A.m.),"We are talking about the Export Market Development1482 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 amount of dollars but we do not perhaps give enough time and attention to whether the scheme is carrying out the objectives for which it was established. Recently, I had the good fortune to be overseas. I looked at a number of things that other countries do and I had the opportunity to talk to Australians in those countries who were trying to do business there. I was able to look at things from a practical, on the ground, point of view. In particular, I spent time in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia within the last two or three months looking at some of those sorts of issues. When an Australian business decides to go overseas, there are a number of problems. People face the language problem, they have got to learn all about the legalities, and quite often they need networks and contacts. They also have to look at the different cultural approach. Those things can take time. For example, just about everybody who has done business in Indonesiaand officials at the Australian embassy-will tell you that if you have not got contacts in the local community you really are not going to get much business done in Indonesia. It does not matter whether you are selling food, vehicles, or any other sort of product. It takes time to establish those contacts and time equates quite often to cost. The cost is, obviously, not just putting out brochures. There is also the cost of the travel, maintaining offices and people, hotel bills, and all those sorts of things. We are talking about cost, time, contacts, and local knowledge that it is so important to have. Unfortunately, too, many of our companies in this country are small, and, because we have had such a highly protected environment for so many years, an awful lot of them are not used to having to get out and compete in the cold, hard world. Many of our bigger companies do have those resources and are well experienced, but a lot of our small to medium-sized enterprises, colloquially known as SMEs, do not have that experience and they need assistance from schemes such as the EMDG scheme and others. One of the most common complaints I have heard from Australian companies is that processing tends to be slow, that there is not enough flexibility, and that we ought to be looking at new ways to help business. The coalition supports this particular bill-there is no question about that-but we would like to see much more being done; not only under this scheme but also under other schemes. The Prime Minister( Mr Keating) and others all agree in principle that Asia is important to this country's future, yet when we talk to people in Singapore and Indonesia all too often they tell us that their orientation is actually north. They are looking at going into China, South-East Asian areas and India. Although they recognise the importance of us to them, and vice versa, in many different ways, their major orientation is not down here. Therefore, we are always going to have a real battle to get ourselves established in those markets. That means that we have to get more of our smaller and medium-sized companies exporting overseas, and it means that we have to provide them with expertise and assistance to do that. I am not so sure that we are innovative enough. We need to look at a number of new options, particularly when we come to dealing with bureaucracy. We have got to look much more at setting up one-stop shop arrangements. In Singapore, for example, where I visited the Economic Development Board, the Institute of Standards and Industrial Research and the National Science and Technology Board, the government gets heavily involved in facilitating the process. It even pays for sending people overseas for training and gets actively involved in stimulating activity to get companies not only developing products, but also getting into overseas markets. The Singaporean government Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1483 is very heavily involved in setting up markets in Indonesia and India-it has big establishments in Bangalore in India-and it is doing similar things in China. Having made that heavy commitment to getting their businesses off the ground overseas, and then their marketing efforts, they apply quite rigorous disciplines in return on the companies, probably much more severe and rigorous disciplines than we do. For example, whereas this scheme is effectively on a dollar for dollar basis up to certain limits, in Singapore the company has to contribute three or four dollars for every dollar of government expenditure. Companies have to payout the money before they can claim it back-it is not a cash in hand activity. Also, in most cases the government will look to take some share of the profits, some form of royalty, or whatever, as a result of successful activity which the government may have sponsored. It seems to me that that probably helps in terms of their providing that revenue base, at a governmental level, for doing further things for other companies. In Indonesia, for example, where I had quite an extensive and good briefing, the embassy were very clear in their view that schemes such as the DIFF scheme were very poorly administered. I remember that two or three years ago, when I was a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, this parliament looked at the boatbuilding industry and particularly at the aluminium boatbuilding industry. We have a very thriving industry for catamarans, luxury launches, ferries and those sorts of things, and we export a lot of those products overseas. The constant refrain that one hears from Australian industry is that there is a lack of adequate financing from government sources, a lack of adequate support in terms of the quality of the Austrade representation, and a lack of adequate help with promotional activity and so on. A lot of those companies are small start-up companies that are going to be very successful but, in their formative stages, they do indeed need much more help and support. It is necessary to help those export industries. The measures that have been proposed in the legislation before the Committee are sensible, and we do support them, but the government does indeed need to look at fresh initiatives and I urge it to do so. discussion of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. The Working Nation statement on 4 May 1994 by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) included a package of measures that were designed to boost Australia's export efforts. The Prime Minister announced that the export market development grants scheme would be extended for five years. Furthermore, in this legislation, the scheme is being expanded to extend eligibility to single service tourism operators and to include departure tax and visa fees as eligible expenditure. Total expenditure under the scheme will expand from $231 million to $290 million in 1997-98. A number of technical amendments are also introduced. Broadly, these allow better management and control of approved joint ventures and consortia and approved trading houses, give a greater promotional focus to payments for overseas travel expenditure, and provide Austrade with the power to introduce and administer the scheme of accreditation for export grants consultants. An important element of the government's policy is to assist individual Australian firms to gain access to export markets and to increase their market share. Many enterprises that are currently exporting or intending to export will benefit by the continuation of the EMDG scheme. To qualify, exporters must have eligible export revenue of less than $25 miIIion in the year of claim and must have incurred $30,000 in eligible expenditure. Many of our small to medium-sized enterprises qualify under these conditions.",131,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Peter Morris (Shortland) (11.26 A.m.),"I am pleased to participate in this1484 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 Grants of 50 per cent of eligible expenditure are available for overseas promotional activities such as market research and development, representation and advertising, for the cost of participating in overseas exhibitions, fares, departure taxes, visa fees, et cetera, and for the cost of bringing agents or buyers to Australia when promotion of export sales is the objective. The grant is aimed at encouraging enterprises to research and develop overseas markets for goods, specified services, industrial rights and know-how which are substantially of Australian origin. The maximum grant is $250,000 each year, and a minimum of $30,000 in eligible expenditure must be incurred first, as the threshold level, as I mentioned earlier, by the claimant company in order to be able to gain assistance under EMDG. I tum briefly to the regional picture of the Hunter, where the three members now in this Committee room, the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Allan Morris), the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Vaile) and I, are all domiciled. With a little bit of stretching and flexibility, that almost includes you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, since you were born there: you are part of our region. More and more firms from the Hunter are seeking world markets for their expertise and products. This is really quite a dramatic change for the smaller to mediumsized enterprises in the Hunter, in that they are taking advantage of the assistance our government is offering. The extension of the EMDG scheme is an important part of that assistance. The scheme is being utilised by regional firms involved in such diverse industries as boatbuilding, packaging, light and heavy engineering, wine and software. I am not suggesting to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that wine and software go together! More and more small to medium enterprises are discovering markets other than their traditional domestic markets. It is so often the problem in regions that firms develop, are comfortable within their own regional market and domestic market, and do not go beyond that region. So the move from a domestic regional market to a national market, and beyond, to an overseas market, is indeed a step that is long overdue. It is something that this legislation will help encourage. The export market development grants scheme increases access and flexibility, which is designed to assist small to medium enterprises in the Hunter region. The government's overseas representation has been reinforced in recent years. A major part of the work of Australia's overseas posts, particularly Austrade, is to assist Australian firms to take advantage of trade and investment opportunities. Australian firms-Hunter firms-are developing new skills, new processes and better products, and they are tapping into markets that they could only dream of in the past. In the Hunter an important partnership between government and industry has resulted in the establishment of the Industry Development Centre at Callaghan ncar the University of Newcastle. The Industry Development Centre provides a one-stop shop or a single contact point to assist exporters and potential exporters to get ready to take on overseas markets. It acts as an encouragement program and helps demystify the culture that one should sell only in one's own domestic market. The IDC also provides a link between industry and commerce and the University of Newcastle. It provides accommodation to the university's consulting and marketing group, relationships with the university's Centre for Industrial Controlled Science. It is promoting the culture that is Hunter: that it will win because it is the best. It has the best price, it delivers Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1485 on time, it has an industrial relations attitude which enables the cost levels and time demands of customers to be met on a competitive basis. This partnership adds to the government's assistance to industry and commerce in many areas. One of these is best practice. The Australian Centre for Best Practice is headquartered in the Hunter for a very good reason; Hunter firms were among the first to realise that to succeed they must get it right the first time. In other words, there had to be quality, consistency in quality, minimisation of rejects and delivery on time. Hunter firms realised that they had to get it right the first time; they had to do it right and do it once. That gives the result that the customer wants and it keeps cost levels down. Hunter firms are benchmarking with and are being benchmarked by leading international firms. The export market development grants scheme provides a most useful tool to all businesses but especially to the small and medium-sized businesses. It enables these firms to explore for themselves the market they believe will benefit their business. The scheme provides financial incentives in the form of taxable cash grants based on eligible expenditure to promote export sales. It focuses on promotional activities-that is, it generally does not assist in the general establishment of business or product development. The grant is a cash grant. The EMDG scheme directly supports many expenditure categories likely to be incurred by an exporter. It is an open access scheme encompassing all goods made in Australia plus a range of services covered in the act. It covers, as I mentioned earlier, industrial property rights and know-how. It provides special provisions to enable joint ventures, industry groups and consortia to expand their activities. It has special provisions to assist first-time claimants. To qualify for the scheme, applicants must be Australian residents and be the owners of eligible goods, services, property rights or know-how. Also, as I mentioned earlier, applicants have to have incurred $30,000 in eligible expenditure within the grant year. Similarly, in that respect, they need to have received fewer than seven previous EMDG grants-except in the case where there is a new market to be tapped or opened up. They need to have eligible export earnings of less than $25 million in the year of claim. Of course, the successful business will utilise the other excellent services provided by Austrade. Austrade is able to provide export counselling to assist a company to get ready to export. It is able to provide counselling on what strategies there are for entering international markets. A business can find specialist help to enable it to take that first step. So in Austrade's 70 overseas posts, experts provide on-the-spot information and assistance. Austrade provides a range of market research and analysis services to help companies assess market conditions and potential for their products. When the company's representative visits a potential market overseas, possibly because of an export market development grant, Austrade can provide help in arranging itineraries and appointment schedules. An Austrade officer can accompany the representative and can assist with advice and communications. The scheme covered by the legislation is administered by Austrade, as are the international trade enhancement schemes. The bill also expands EMDG grants to provide export marketing assistance to single-service tourism operators to recognise the significant contribution of the tourism industry to export growth. Whilst tourism is our largest export earner, it has a lot of potential within the Hunter region; there is a lot to be gained there and a lot to be developed. If anything, tourism in the Hunter is in its infancy stage in that respect. Between 1978 and 1985, members of the tourism industry were eligible to receive EMDG grants. From 1985 to 1987, we changed the name of the scheme to the tourism overseas 1486 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 promotion scheme. In 1987, in Sir Humphrey land, assistance to the scheme was ended in that period of financial stringency. In 1990, the EMDG scheme became available for tourism operators but in a limited way. If an operator provided a single service-for example, an hotel or a car hire or an attraction like Dreamworld-that operator could not qualify. What the bill before us does is recognise the importance of all in the stream of tourism and it restores that assistance to that single service tourism operator. In dealing with that whole service sector, I believe there is a lack of effort in many parts of Australian business and on behalf of the government generally in exploiting the opportunities for service. Service operates both ways: it is a service sector in delivering a product; it is a service sector in bringing in an imported product. It is a two-way process that covers a range of industries and a range of activities that really have not been developed in this nation to anything like the extent they could be. I am looking at the LEK report on services. Page 15 says: Australia's most successful service exports include tourism, which comprises about 60% of service exports ($7.8 billion in 1993) and education, which in 1993 clocked up $1.2 bill ion ... Most of the 28 service industry categories canvassed have a low ratio of exports to domestic sales ... Indeed, only 1.2 % of all Australian service companies are involved in export. This represents only 5% of total services capability. In other words, 95 per cent of Australia's services capability is not involved in export. As I said, it is a two-way process. We do not need to build a coalmine; we do not need to make steel; we do not need to disturb the environment; we do not need to offend our neighbours or residents or anyone else to be in the service sector. That service sector, particularly in relation to transport and what swings off that I will come to that in a few moments-has a massive area for growth within Australia. There has to be a change in the culture in this city; there has to be a change in the culture of what I call ' Sir Humphrey land' which is this place, the people who lead departments, the people who are responsible for government purchases. We can look across this whole services sector to the Bevis report on government purchasing. I am looking at the page of the report dealing with the embedded services and the advice to government purchasing agencies covered in the Commonwealth procurement circular 90/9 of November 1990. That procurement circular tells Commonwealth officers: In complying with Commonwealth policy, and applying the concept of value for money, procurement officers should consider: . the cost of insurance and freight; and . the opportunity for QANTAS, Australian ship owners, local insurers, freight forwarders and other local suppliers to participate in these activities ... By recognising that insurance and freight costs can be significant in their own right, procurement officers may be able to achieve major savings in the cost of overseas procurements or indirect importation of supplies. But the committee found that the simple step of identifying the price of freight and insurance appears not to have been taken in the majority of cases. The frequency of importing product on a free on board basis-f.o.b., whereby the purchaser arranges the freight insurance-does not appear to have been substantially altered. The document goes on to say: In 1991 a survey of Government Business Enterprises and Statutory Marketing Authorities by the Insurance and Freight Working Party identified that, while agencies imp0l1ed 21.4 % of goods on an FOB basis, they exported 36.3% on an FOB basis thus giving overseas suppliers nearly 70% more access to activity. Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1487 In other words, they have got a 'sell f.o.b.' mentality, whereby they leave it to the buyer on the other side of the world to arrange the transport, the insurance and the freight. All of the service sector is just handed over on a platter. There may be some reasons, in some parts of trade, that make it difficult to get on to a cost insurance freight basis, whereby the seller is responsible for arranging cost insurance freight. We get some of that benefit. But there is a vast potential there that is not even being explored, because of the culture in this place. When the government's own agencies-which combine to be one of the largest single purchasers in this nation-do not have that culture, do not follow that thought process and do not follow Commonwealth procurement guidelines, it is a pretty poor model for saying to the private sector, 'We think you should be selling CIF. We think you should be buying free on board.' Take, for example, importing components for reprocessing for the Holden car. We import all of the engines. We do not buy on an f.o.b. basis; we buy on a cost insurance freight basis, where all of the transport, consolidation in the states and insurance is arranged by the seller. The seller gets all of that benefit. We have to change that. If we go to the practice whereby we import products for reprocessing, consolidation or incorporation in products that are subsequently exported, we are losing all of that service sector. But we generally do not even try to get it. Let me give you an example, Mr Deputy Speaker. You will relate to this one. In the debate about coal, the coal unions are saying, quite rightly, that there should be a greater effort on the part of Australian sellers to get a better price. They suggest we do it the Japanese way, and out-organise the Japanese. I use this because it is an easy example. But the Japanese want open market forces to operate in determining the sale price of coal. Open market forces mean you have to have open market access. It is very simple. If there are to be open market forces, there has to be open market access. When we look to the north of Australia, Japan is buying coal on an open market price development process. But on the west coast of Australia, the same Japanese steel mills buy our iron ore. Our marine insurers are competitive, but they cannot get into that market to insure the iron ore, because that marine insurance market is reserved for Japanese insurance companies. Yet the freight is sold similarly. Everything goes out fo.b. If we are looking at growth in service income-growth in invisible exports; that is really what it is-whether it be on imports coming in or on exports going out, in those cases we have to change the culture of Australian companies. But, most of all, in the first place we have got to change the culture of government servants and government agencies. We will move on and look at exports. We export Holden engines. Millions of dollars worth of Holden engines are exported, but the V6, which comes from North America and goes into the Commodore, is consolidated in North America. All of the parts of the components come together and are brought in, as I understand it, on a CIF basis, cost insurance freight. I am pleased to support the legislation. I think that it will do a great deal to help firms in our own Hunter region to improve their efforts abroad. I place particular emphasis on the opportunities in the service sector, and I hope that as time passes, we will be able to persuade more and more Australian firms that, when they are selling an Australian product, they should go to the trouble of saying, 'Have you thought about Australian insurance, have you thought about using Australian freight forwarders, have you thought about using Australian transport? In most of the cases, it involves shipping. There are many markets where we can be 1488 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 competitive. We have to be selective, but we can pick our mark, and if we can do that, then we are going to get a much better result for this country and a much better result on the current account deficit. Perhaps one day we will have a current account surplus. markets for export. That is something that both sides of the House would agree on. It is obviously important for the balance of payments, but it is also important for job and wealth creation. In my electorate of Leichhardt, exports are obviously a very important part of the local economy. The figures that are available-they are 1991 figures-show that the total value of commodities exported overseas from Far North Queensland was $610 million, which was 5.3 per cent of the value of commodities exported from the whole of Queensland, and 1.2 per cent of the value of Australia's merchandise trade. It is obvious that Far North Queensland plays a very big role in Australia's export markets, in potential as well as existing markets. It is interesting that the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Griffiths), the former tourism minister, is here, because tourism is a major export from the far north. It is actually the major export from Far North Queensland now, as the member would be aware, and it is a services export. I totally endorse the comments of the member for Short land ( Mr Peter Morris), who said that the export market and development scheme and other measures will expand into the tourism industry. The scheme is, of course, welcomed by the tourism industry, and by representatives of the tourism industry in my electorate. As I understand it, there were 3,200 claims for EMDG in 1993-94, and an expected payout of about $200 million. I think that is quite significant; it is obviously a scheme which is working. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974, in order to extend the period for consideration of approved joint ventures in consortium applications and approved trading house applications. Other amendments provide for greater scrutiny of grant recipient activities. As members are now aware, the Export Marketing Development Grants Act contains provisions which govern the method of application and eligibility for grants, a list of claimable export oriented expenditure and mechanisms for review of decisions, recovery of overpayments, and termination of grant entitlements. The export marketing development grants scheme, the EMDG scheme, which is administered under the Export Marketing Development Grants Act 1974, provides taxable grants of up to $250,000 per annum and it is based primarily on expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to expand exports of products and overseas markets. Provided that people have incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in a grant year, they will be entitled to a grant. A grant is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000. Claimants who have received eight or more grants are not allowed to received further grants, and claimants who have received at least two prior grants are subject to a performance test which is assessed against export earnings. Eligible expenditure includes such things as up-front marketing costs, travel expenses, special promotional literature and overseas representation. The Australian Trade Commission, Austrade, which administers the EMDG scheme, considers that the main benefits of the scheme include grant funding that is guaranteed by legislation. The grant is cash in hand, and the grant directly supports the majority of expenditure categories likely to be incurred by an exporter.",133,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Dodd (Leichhardt) (11.46 A.m .),"It is obvious that Australia has to develop furtherThursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1489 I have already given the 1992-93 figures. In 1991 there were 2002 EMDG claims to the value of $103 million. Obviously, the scheme is expanding, and becoming more popular and successful. I take the opportunity in this debate to talk about a major export success story in my electorate. I refer to the McKinsey report, Lead local compete global: unlocking the growth potential of Australia s regions, which has received a lot of attention in the House. It was a report for the Office of Regional Development in the Department of Housing and Regional Development. With regard to the Far North Export Group it says: Size is not a binding constraint to export, particularly when small businesses form collaborative networks. In Cairns, for example, business-led networks like the FNEG are forming to increase the international competitiveness of member enterprises. It goes on to say: Results for the group have been impressive. Rapid growth in exports is fuelling expansion in total sales. The FNEG is an association of over 20 companies which provides quality products and services to markets in Papua New Guinea, South-East Asia and the South Pacific. The FNEG was formed as a result of a northern region export promotion program held in Cairns and Townsville in 1992. This program was coordinated by Queensland DBIRD, the Queensland Premier's Department and the Australian Institute of Export. FNEG provides a coordinated central source of information to assist its members to access overseas markets for their products and services. FNEG members took part in two trade missions: one was in 1993 to Papua New Guinea with Austrade assistance, and there was another more recently to the Solomons. The strength of FNEG is that it is simple in structure and remains relevant to local Far North Queensland companies. It is an excellent vehicle for businesses interested in export but unable to allocate adequate time and effort to prepare for export. It provides a central point for coordinating overseas marketing and handling overseas enquiries. It provides marketing information and other matters of interest in a compact and accessible form. This enables local participating businesses to share information, market intelligence and ideas, improve their export performance and share market entry costs which might otherwise be prohibitive to an individual enterprise. The group also improves the ability of members to offer customers a broad range of products through the linkage of complementary power-all this while sharing the cost of market intelligence and R&D. I was please to visit some of the companies involved in this scheme with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Regional Development and Housing( Mr Howe) very recently in Cairns. I know that the minister was impressed with the performance of that group. We visited the premises of Garozzo Agencies, Cairns Steel Fabricators, Shortland Oil Services, Northern Engine Reconditioning and Maunder Electrical Engineering. All the firms that we observed that day playa very vital and vibrant part in the far northern economy. Not only do they provide goods and services to the domestic market of Far North Queensland and other parts of Australia but they are also exporting into South-East Asia and the Pacific. Of course, in Cairns we are uniquely located to serve, in particular, the markets of South East Asia and the South Pacific. Everyone knows about the success of the Cairns airport. With all the planes that are coming in and out of Cairns not only is there capacity for tourism and personal travel but also we are able to export goods to South-East Asia and the South Pacific. 1490 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 All those firms that I mentioned are developing or have developed markets in South-East Asia and the Pacific through the assistance of this group. The FNEG is an obvious success story that the McKinsey report highlights, and I am pleased to highlight it in the parliament today. As I said, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development was very impressed with the group. I would thank especially Mac Thomson, who is the guiding person in this group, for arranging the trip and I thank all those people who gave us hospitality on that day. The thing that impressed me is that on that trip not only were we seeing businesses which were booming but also we were seeing the work force, people involved in manufacturing in my electorate. Of course, a lot of people in my electorate are involved in tourism, but I think it is very important for the future economy of the far north, the future economy of Australia, that we maintain a diversified economy and that there are manufacturing firms still in operation in regions like Far North Queensland. It was very heartening to see. Getting back more particularly to the substance of this bill before the Main Committee, it is interesting that there has been some criticism of the export market development grants scheme and I suppose criticism of the Australian government's policy towards trade. Professor Helen Hughes, who is someone on the free market end of the academic spectrum, has been critical of some of the government's policies. It is interesting to look at the performance of the export market development grants scheme and to see how successful it has been. I am not just saying this because I assert that it is a success story. The government obviously was concerned about some criticism of these sorts of schemes and conducted an evaluation by Price Waterhouse, with an independent econometric analysis by Ron Bewley, who is professor of econometrics and head of the department of economics at the University of New South Wales. The evaluation of the scheme said that it came out on top. Overall, the evaluation concluded that the scheme is effective in assisting Australian business. As I have already said, the success is shown in the fact that in 1993-94 there were 3,200 claims for EMDG grants, with an expected payout of $200 million. That speaks for itself. Businesses in Australia are going out there and applying for these grants. But it is interesting that the report that I referred to said that 70 per cent of these claims were from firms with less than $5 million in turnover, less than $1 million export or fewer than 26 employees. So not only are we assisting business in developing exports, we are assisting small business. I think it is unfortunate that the small business sector in Australia is one sector that does not acknowledge the contribution that this government has made, because in this and other schemes the government does assist small business. That statistical information shows that this scheme in particular not only helps the big end of town, as it were, it also helps small players. When we look at the success story that I have talked about with small business in Cairns and we look at the success story with this scheme all over Australia, it certainly does show that this government is providing the environment and the policies for export. The claimants for the scheme have high levels of commitment to exporting, with exporting accounting for an average 50 per cent of the employment investment. Again, that shows the success of this scheme, that it is not a question of hit and miss. It is not the case that claimants make claims, get some quick money from the government and do not have success stories. The success is shown in that figure, that 50 per cent of that employment investment is going into exporting activity. Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1491 It was very pleasing to see that, in the white paper, Working Nation, the government decided to extend the EMDG scheme for a further five years to extend the eligibility of EMDG grants to an expanded range of services, including single service tourism operators. This is obviously a very important initiative of the government and something that the tourism operators, as I said earlier, have been calling for, for some time. In the white paper, Working Nation, the government is responding to a clear demand from tourism operators and listening to the tourism industry. In conclusion, this scheme and the other schemes that the government has introduced in relation to encouraging exports have been a success. The government is proud of its record in this regard and I am pleased to support this legislation before this chamber. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Motion (by Mr O'Keefe)-by leave-agreed to: That the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Report Debate resumed from 31 May, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. a few words on the report of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee entitled' Access to Justice'. It is an extensive report of some 500 pages. If the volume of the report were equalled by the significance of its content, it would be a weighty documen1 indeed. However, in any area there will inevitably be some matters with which we agree and others with which we disagree and, certainly, on looking through the report, I find that that is the position that I am in here. The concept of examining and identifying the degree to which access to justice is equally available is something that I think has total bipartisan support. It is a matter of very real significance and consequence. I am and have been for a long while concerned about the extent to which the mumbo jumbo, if you like, of the law tends to confuse rather than to reveal. It is also of concern to me that, according to people's social and economic strata in society, the opportunity they have to have their particular cases heard equitably, I believe, is prejudiced. There is also a problem with the legal aid system. This system is provided to give people access to legal advice but it does not always produce people whom I regard as having the same ability to present a case as those who can afford to provide their own counsel and their own legal advisers. This inequity in the system is unfortunate, as it is at the root of the problem of ensuring the equitable hearing of the matter. In this report, there is comment about the extension of legal aid. Obviously, there has to be a way to help people to have access to the law if they are unable to provide for their (')wn legal representation. I welcome the judgment of the High Court that puts an obligation on people receiving legal aid when it goes to that stage of justice. There are still impediments which are not addressed in this report for those who are beyond the economic means test level to receive legal aid, who are contending against litigants who have significant resources.",138,Representatives Main Committee
242,Mr Sinclair (New England) (12.02 P.m.),"I am pleased to have the opportunity to say1492 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 Every member of parliament is aware of any number of cases where people are in a disadvantageous position against a larger corporation or organisation which has a lot of funds and those individuals find themselves disadvantaged. Some years ago, when I first became the Minister for Social Services, Hugh Roberton, who was then the member for the Riverina and was my predecessor in that portfolio, said to me, 'Every time you extend the means t-st, all you do is extend the borders of discontent.' How right that is with legal aid, because the people who are just outside the boundaries of legal aid often are as disadvantaged as the people just below the limit and, in many instances, they are denied the opportunity to pursue their case. That particular area is not adequately picked up in the report. Another recommendation in this report with which I am in disagreement is the question of robing. I know it is anachronistic to wear a wig and a gown and all that jazz, but one thing that does concern me is that there has to be a measure of impartiality in the law. I have been involved as a minister, unfortunately, on a range of occasions when members of the Family Court have been subjected to personal threats. One particular judge was killed. Judges who wear ordinary clothes are seen to be at one with the community. The law is not like that. The law has many inequities but we look towards people who are practising at law as having a professional capability. When surgeons are in an operating theatre, they wear their robes for reasons unrelated to status. They wear them because of hygiene and because of the extent to which they have to divorce themselves from the patient on whom they are operating. To my mind, in the same way, members of the legal profession need to be in some way distinguished from the person for whom they are acting, or whom they are prosecuting. While robing does not give them any greater legal capacity, it does, to a degree, distinguish them from the person they are prosecuting or defending, and there is an advantage in it. While I know all the arguments, and although I am not particularly keen in getting dressed up in my own wig and gown, I still recognise the advantage, in the processing of cases, of being able to wear something that does distinguish a person as being something different and having a different status. Having picked out those two areas of the report, there are a number of other recommendations with which I am in total agreement. For example, I think the idea of encouraging federal courts to develop court charters to specify performance standards is a very good idea. It is a good idea to continue the reform of procedures in both civil and criminal cases. In this respect, I would like to commend the work that has been undertaken by Murray Gleeson, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. There are far too many delays in the legal process. Much of the delay is the result of court procedures. It is not because of the law itself; it is a matter of the way in which the processes require matters to be heard, considered and dealt with. I am sure, if we could expedite the law, that justice would be done in many instances-not only in criminal cases but also in civil cases. As members, many of us find ourselves in an impossible position on occasions with people who are subject to some sort of insurance claim. It is ridiculous that years after an event people are still waiting for the processing of their particular claim. There does need to be a lot more work done. Murray Gleeson is in the state supreme court in New South Wales. The report we are debating today was commissioned by the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice( Mr Kerr) and, as a result, it applies to the Federal Court. It should apply right across the spectrum of justice. There has to be a way by which consideration of matters at a Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1493 civil and criminal level can be expedited. Otherwise, a lot of people are going to be significantly disadvantaged. There is reference in the report to an area my wife Rosemary has been involved in. It is something that is also of interest, that is the use of television in court. There are two aspects to it. The first concerns the taking of evidence from children in child abuse cases. The Chief Magistrate in the Australian Capital Territory has done quite a lot of pioneering work in that respect, and I commend him for it. It is hard to know in what way and to what degree we can establish for children a fair and reasonable opportunity to give evidence without feeling that the strange environment to which they are subject in a courtroom in some way threatens them and means that their evidence is less than credible. Taking evidence from a child is always difficult, and the idea of having evidence taken from a child using a television camera has a great deal to be said for it. It is a process which should be adopted on a wider basis. It has much for which to be commended, and it is a process that we should look at on a wider base. The report refers to a somewhat wider subject, that is the experimental programming for televising court proceedings. I am not a great devotee of the results of television. There is obviously an advantage for all members in having their names and images out there being seen by people who are able to pass judgment on them, but, for the life of me, I do not see that debating within the chamber has benefited as a result. We are debating this in the Main Committee. There are about as many people here as there would be in the House itself, if we were down there. Debate should be a matter of trying to talk about a subject. On many subjects there is a great deal of unanimity across the parliament, but, where there is difference, there should be a genuine opportunity to present and to hear another point of view. When there is a television camera, everything is going out on the television screen, and, more often than not, people are concerned about who is going to be the end viewer. It is not a matter, therefore, of trying to persuade those who are in the room; it is a matter of trying to present a wider image. Television is intrusive and demands that people do things differently. All people need to do is look behind the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) in question time and they will see an array of pretty faces, well dressed in appropriate colours. faces, appropriately dressed, but the interesting point is that with television people are not necessarily looking at the verdict. I guarantee that any of the people here who were looking at television last night cannot remember very much of what was said, but can remember what a person looked like. Think of the people who are on the news. Sure, people who look at Days of Our Lives, or one of the soapies that get you in, get involved with the emotions of the subject, but that is different. Television is intrusive. It demands a different nature of performance, and it does not allow debate. It allows the image to be examined, not the substance, and that concerns me. To go to that extent in court is mad. It is difficult to maintain impartiality in our court process. We have a number of procedures which are designed to ensure there is equity between the two sides of a particular case. Once we go to the stage of having television in court, what we are going to do is have everybody out there passing judgment.",141,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mr Griffiths,That's us.,143,Representatives Main Committee
244,Mr Sinclair,"Of course, Alan. That is the point. I too have behind me an array of pretty1494 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 Without wanting to go into the 0.1. Simpson case, demonstrably there it has all happened. No matter whether 0.1. Simpson is gUilty or innocent, he will never be able to have a fair trial. The result of that will be that when his defence counsel gets up in the court he will be able to say to the judge, 'How is it possible for my client ever to be gauged dispassionately by the members of the jury?' Looking at that case and at the television, and understanding the prejudiced way in which its reporting has been undertaken, there is no doubt that that comment is right. How on earth can a jury, after seeing the whole of the circumstances-all the trivia regarding his matrimonial ethics, matrimonial affairs, the titillation of the third party, and all the rest of it, all displayed in full glory-judge a matter like that dispassionately? Of course, it cannot. That is really the problem. Why on earth do people want an experimental program for televising court proceedings? The idea is bonkers, it does not have any validity, it is intrusive and it will prejudice justice. Anything that prejudices justice, to my mind, ought to be set aside. There are a few other things in the report that are quite good. The idea of presenting a report is good. Another report talked about a program for making criminal legislation clearer and more accessible. Part of the problem is not only making it accessible, but making it understandable. Any legalese is difficult to comprehend, but equally, it needs to be remembered that the simpler we make the law, the more we are going to pass the interpretation of the law over to the courts. We have to find, if we can, a balance between them. We define law in simple every day expressions, and over the years we pick up words and interpret them differently. Unless an explanation is given, the interpretation will depend on judgment of particular words. Again, I think we can prejudice justice. Make law accessible by all means; make law understandable by all means, but please be careful in rewriting law. The one thing in that sense that I would like to see the parliament pick up is a considered program for reviewing, revising and updating legislation. People who go into the parliament will know what we spend a lot of our time doing. If they have a look at the blue, they will see legislation listed. For example, Government Business-Orders of the Day on today's blue lists the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). We get a new bit of paper each day. Usually it will not be as thick as what I have in my hand though sometimes it is much thicker. Every time legislation is amended we get more and more pieces of paper. We get one that is not too thick, one that is quite thick and about 10 others. Then, before we know where we are, we have got a great bundle of legislation, all of which we are supposed to be able to read, digest and understand. We are supposed to know where each amendment comes and how it applies. I do not think that it works. I would like to see the government adopt a program, to be put in place by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I think it would be better than the Attorney-General's Department. I would like to see the Office of Parliamentary Counsel have a designated group of people who are consistently charged with updating legislation. It takes time to do. I know, as minister for shipping and transport in days gone by, that the British merchant shipping act of 1894 was, unbelievably, the piece of legislation applicable to all maritime traffic in Australia, until not so many years ago. That was because trying to rewrite it in the Australian vernacular took so long; it took us about 10 years. Updating legislation is a good idea and I would like to see a few more people do something about it. Thank you for the opportunity to have a bit of a discussion. I have quite enjoyed it. (Time expired) Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 1495 find the comments of the right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair) entirely appropriate, for those of us who enjoyed the practice of the law were, of course, aware of the faults of the law. We all understand that justice is a notion which involves questions of fairness and equity, representation and the right to be heard, yet those of us who have, fortunately or unfortunately, studied jurisprudence know that the philosophical notions of justice are indeed different. In fact, it is true that those of us who have, in our other lives, practised the law-and in my case I spent 10 years as a police officer as well-know that justice is always in the eye of the beholder: no matter what a court or a jury may find in a particular matter, those who are for will find it just if they win, and those who lose will find it unjust. The whole notion of justice is indeed nebulous and very difficult to define. Hence the report which we are taking note of in this chamber today-the access to justice report-has a lot in it which I can both agree and disagree with. Certainly, from what I read of it, here in Australia, I look at the American experience with great fear that we should ever go the same way. There is the example of the 0.1. Simpson trial. It will be almost impossible to find a jury which does not have a firm view on the guilt or innocence of 0.1. Simpson. Even here in Australia, people have made up their minds one way or the other that 0.1. Simpson is guilty or is not gUilty. How in the blazes is a system of justice going to operate when juries have been given so much biased media reporting, before the jury has even been detennined? I would be very fearful of any move in this country that would allow that sort of circumstance to arise. It is true that whilst I, on the government side, am not generally regarded as conservative, when it comes to the practice of law and the administration of justice I am indeed conservative. I am very wary of change for change's sake and very wary of change because the media, the electronic media, or the public generally, want it. I have seen a number of examples in my life where justice, in a philosophical sense, was not applied. One of my early experiences as a lawyer was to defend a person charged with murder. To this day, I do not know whether that person committed the murder or not. It was a rather famous case-R. v. Ratten. Mrs Ratten was shot on 7 May at 1 p.m. in 1970. Even today, many years later, I can still recall the exact time and date on which she was shot. Her husband, Leith Ratten, was charged with that murder. There was no doubt that he killed his wife. The question was whether it was an accident or whether it was premeditated-hence, murder. That case ultimately went to the Privy Council in England and was one of the very last matters that left Australia's jurisprudential system to be detennined by the Privy Council, the English system. I say that because justice is, indeed, a view. People can never say, in difficult cases, that they believe absolutely that a person is guilty or not guilty. Hence our system, rightly or wrongly, says that the Crown needs to carry the burden of proof and that that proof must be beyond all reasonable doubt; and, prior to that, the person must be accepted as innocent of that crime. I will oppose any change to this vehemently and strongly because, even under those pretty rigid rules, there is still potential for error. That is because jurors are human beings. They view people through their own prejudice; they view evidence through their own prejudice, as we all do as human beings. When there are 12 people they can, through their own prejudice, find guilt. However, on a better forensic examination, that guilt sometimes is not there. I speak as someone who has quite often questioned notions of justice. I speak as someone who has charged people with crimes, followed them through the system and seen",143,Representatives Main Committee
245,Mr Cleeland (Mcewen) (12.17 P.m.),"May I say that, as I do on many occasions, I1496 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 them go to gaol. At the same time, as a lawyer, I have defended people who are charged and have, over that period, developed quite different notions of justice and the way our systems work. Without question, I most certainly oppose too much media access to our system. I have concerns about the victims of crime organisations springing up in this country. I would agree entirely that the victim of crime is often the last person in our processes. But people tend to forget that our system of justice is such that the state is the complainant; it is the state, the corporate structure, which is complaining about the conduct of others in criminal matters, not the victim. The victim's redress is in the civil jurisdiction-to seek damages and to seek other forms of remedy against the person who committed the crime. When the state is seen in two areas-not only to be enforcing behaviour through the criminal law but also to be, if you like, punishing in terms of monetary penalty to the victim-the two areas get rather confused and difficult. I know that, particularly in Melbourne and Victoria, the victims of crime organisations are now becoming critical organisations in the sense that they are insisting that governments move in ways in the justice system which I find quite fearful. I suppose I have seen some fundamental changes since I first started practising law in 1970. One of my great worries is the fact that, in Australian law schools today, there are as many undergraduates as there are practising lawyers in Australia. That is a most fearful thought because, since my days of entering practice, the number of practising lawyers has quadrupled. I can only speak of Melbourne and Victoria. Certainly, there is now a lawyer on every street corner in Melbourne and in Victoria. You cannot turn your back without finding a lawyer or a legal practice. Economics teaches us that, the more people there are seeking a source of income from a given field of income, the more prices rise or standards collapse as people are forced into doing things to gain an income source out of a fixed or limited field of income. A constituent who called me last week is the father of a young lady who had gone through a family law breakdown problem, a property settlement in the Family Court. His daughter had just received the bill from the legal firm. It was a complex matter in that the husband's family had a number of corporate structures where assets were rather difficult to trace-maybe deliberately so, maybe not. In any event, it was obviously a fairly complex property settlement. Nevertheless, the Family Court apparently ordered a property settlement of $145,000 to the custodial spouse, the wife, who had three children as well, and sent her a bill for $65,000. I do not find that justice, quite frankly. I have difficulties when, in that type of breakdown, the $145,000 is diminished by a legal bill of $65,000 so that the custodial spouse and the young children involved in that breakdown will undoubtedly be thrown back onto the public purse and seek further assistance because of the high cost of the legal system. There is that very famous case in New South Wales involving a lawyer, Mrs Foreman. I think we have all read about Mrs Foreman's tribulations before the Law Institute of New South Wales on a disciplinary procedure where, on a property settlement of some $540,OOO-again in the Family Court-her legal fees were in excess of the property settlement. Justice which is not affordable is justice which is denied. As a lawyer, I have to sit back and really query where the legal profession is going when with those kinds of legal charges people will be denied rights. My fear even now is that many people are not getting access to our judicial systems because they cannot afford lawyers. Thursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMIITEE 1497 The Kennett government in Victoria, for example, has slashed $10 million from legal aid funding. Taking $10 million dollars from legal aid funding is quite severe. In my years of practice I found it impossible to get legal aid funding for people who were facing criminal charges in magistrates courts. It became increasingly difficult to get legal aid funding for matters in the Family Court. Now in Victoria it is just about the case that people get legal aid funding only for murders or the most severe crimes where prison is the appropriate penalty, and more and more ordinary people are being denied appropriate funding to gain access to justice. As I said, access to justice means ability to pay, ability to fund and ability to get access to the courtrooms. Increasingly in Australia the reality is that people are being denied that right because of financial difficulties. There are some proposals in this report which may assist in reducing the cost of legal representation. There is no doubt the legal profession has been fairly restrictive in the way it has conducted itself over a number of years. For example, in VictoriaI was admitted to practise as a barrister and a solicitor. That is, I had the right as a lawyer to appear before the Supreme Court and Magistrate's Court as a barrister. I also had the right to practise as a solicitor without appearing in courts; in fact, in my own career I appeared as both. When I practised in country areas I donned the garb and appeared in county courts and magisterial courts. When I went back to the city I practised generally only in magistrates courts and as a solicitor. When I was moved to practise in the state of New South Wales, much to my horror, I found that I was not entitled even to be called a barrister and a solicitor. It is a divided profession; that is, the bar is a completely separate legal profession from solicitors. In fact, my title in New South Wales as an admitted practitioner is as an 'attorney proctor and solicitor' of the state of New South Wales. As a Victorian admitted practitioner, when I appeared in the Supreme Court in Sydney to be admitted to practice I was not even referred to as a barrister and a solicitor because the reality that as a lawyer I could be a barrister and a solicitor was not recognised. So New South Wales still has a long way to go in recognising that today all lawyers are graduates from universities. There is no distinction between the legal training of those who call themselves barristers and those who call themselves lawyers, and it is an absolute nonsense to distinguish between people who are qualified in both areas of practice. Those at the bar, of course, say that they are the advocates, they are skilled at verbal appearances. I do not know about that. I am not a practising barristerI know in Victoria. Indeed, I have seen some abysmal performers in terms of advocacy in my career as a lawyer, and I have never understood why they say they are the orally skilled practitioners of the law. I think the rules of QC and junior are really a wank-how else can you describe them. Why should any person in a particular legal matter be forced to pay for the services of a QC and at the same time pay half the fee of the QC to a junior barrister, who inevitably does very little, in my experience, in such a trial? There is no doubt whatsoever that a large number of costs associated with access to justice are due to the antiquated notions of the legal practice in Australia. They are, of course, those which we inherited from the practice in Great Britain. It comes back, I guess, to the view that we in Australia should start to cast off some of those ancient British notions and develop our",145,Representatives Main Committee
246,Mr Bradford,QED.,147,Representatives Main Committee
247,Mr Cleeland,"And yet I would test my oral advocacy skills against many barristers1498 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 own strictly Australian concepts of justice, of court systems, of our adversarial system-which our legal system largely is-and move more towards mediation, towards lowering the cost of dispute resolution. After all, courts are about conflict. Be it in the civil jurisdiction or the criminal jurisdiction, it is a conflict between two people. If you are charged with a crime and the state says, 'You did this', you as the defendant say, 'No, I did not do this', so there is conflict, and we are resolving conflict through the judicial process. In the civil jurisdiction, too, that is really what it is all about. So we can reduce costs very largely by getting some of the archaic and anachronistic procedures we adopted from Britain and look for a mediation process and means of reducing cost and making access more readily available. In summary, there is much to recommend in this report but there is much which, frankly, I would have a great degree of difficulty in accepting. I do so, I just want to say that I trust that this matter wiIl continue to be on the agenda, as there are, I think, a number of members from both sides who stiIl wish to make a contribution in this debate and who for one reason or another are not available. I am particularly aware that the member for Tangney( Mr WiIliams) definitely wants to make a contribution but unfortunately is not available at the moment, so I am pleased to hear that the government is happy to have this debate continued. I cannot help observing, having listened to the previous speaker, the member for McEwen( Mr Cleeland), admitting that he is a conservative on this issue, that there is some self-interest in his conservatism, yet he belongs to a party which claims to be the great, egalitarian Labor Party. I ought to say that I am not a lawyer-I want that on the record firmly-nor am I an expert in these matters. I have hardly read this report, so I have only been sitting in and listening, but I thought I might make a small contribution. I take the point, which I have also heard put elsewhere, that there is concern about the number of people being trained to become lawyers. I guess the concern about that is to do with the resources being wasted in training lawyers who may not get work. I think part of the answer to that, and the member for McEwen surely would be aware of it, is that a lot of people being trained for the law are not going to practise law. being trained in the law, as with those who do economics or commerce or whatever, go into much broader areas of life. drivers, that you need a degree in law to drive a taxi, unless you are getting pulled over by the police every day and you want to be able to argue your case cogently. But the point is that it is now a broad qualification and, like a lot of university qualifications, it is a mind training exercise. I do not know whether we are training too many lawyers in that sense. But I would argue-and I wonder how the member who spoke before me would contest this-that you people in the government have not been averse to attempting to control doctors' fees by interfering directly in the practice of medicine and effectively, de facto, almost nationalising them.",147,Representatives Main Committee

The honourable member has just attempted to argue-and it is a matter of self-preservation, I guess-that there are too many lawyers. The honourable member says in Melbourne that there is one on every comer. I assume he is saying that that is not a good thing. From the point of view of the provision of legal services, he would surely have to acknowledge that that may be a good thing if it puts a brake on the price of legal services. economics in any respect. The legal profession has argued amongst itself about whether or not it should be able to advertise. It seemed to me to some extent self-evident that allowing members of the profession to advertise would also tend to promote competition which we would be committed to on this side of the House. This would therefore force down the price of legal services. To take a medical analogy, if we wanted an orthopaedic surgeon to do a job, that would require a high degree of skill, and there are clearly not a lot of people with those skills because they take many years to acquire. I take it that the same thing would apply if we had a difficult legal case and we needed to be represented by a highly competent lawyer who is skilled in advocacy. The division in the profession makes a lot of sense. There are people who are barristers, who have that particular skill in advocacy. For that reason, I am not sure that the move that seems to be in vogue to disband that differentiation is necessarily going to be productive. I am not necessarily even arguing that barristers' fees are too high. If we want someone with that skill and knowledge, and not many people have the skill or knowledge, obviously the price is affected. In a sense, it is a fairly good market; it is almost a perfect market in terms of availability of knowledge. However, I agree that, on the supply side, it is the same as getting an orthopaedic surgeon. There is obviously a limited number of orthopaedic surgeons; there is a big demand for their services; and the price goes up. It is difficult to increase the supply side. It is difficult to increase the supply side of highly skilled barristers or advocates. I wanted to make that point. As I say, I am arguing as a layman. The average person in the street would surely take the same view, that we really do not have too many lawyers-and I would not necessarily argue this in the same way with my legal friends. The more lawyers there are, the more likely it is that the price of legal services will come down. If. as the honourable member tells me, the price of legal services has gone up at the same time as there are more lawyers, this would run contrary to any law of economics I had ever learned at university. There would be something going on that perhaps the Trade Practices Commission ought to look into because it should not be happening. Allowing lawyers to advertise would also put a brake on prices or charges-however one wants to put it. They are some of issues but, as I say, I am not an expert in these things. I will make a brief comment about legal aid. Once again, having glanced through the report, and I am not speaking as a lawyer but as a member of parliament, it seems to me that there are huge problems with access to legal aid. I do not know that the report solves the problem but I notice it has established one of the three crucial objectives in achieving access to justice: regardless of means, all Australians should have access to legal services. They clearly do not; they just do not.",148,Representatives Main Committee

256,Mr Bradford,"Why have they gone up? That does not comply with the rules of1500 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 September 1994 Of course, one restriction on that access is the cost of the service. Not one week goes by in my office-and I think probably almost every honourable member of parliament would concur; the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Bevis) I am sure would concur-without someone coming to me, needing access to justice. People do not have the funds. Very often they need access to justice because their business has gone broke and they are absolutely destitute. They have not got a cent. The same thing would apply in a family law matter. Often an enormous amount of pressure is applied by the husband who, for one reason or another, has got the family assets; the wife is destitute and needs a lawyer to act for her, but she cannot get legal aid. I take it from reading this report there is a general acknowledgment that there are limits to the amount of money that is available. There are limits to the amount of money that is available to do anything. The problem of governments, I guess, is that it is limited. It is the basic economic problem, if we want to get back to economics, of limited means and unlimited demands or wants. Somehow the system is not serving its purpose. There is a fundamental breakdown here. I see it as a member of parliament. Not a week goes by without my having people in my office who have no access to justice. They have not got any money so they cannot go and hire a lawyer. They need a lawyer. I am no help to them in a legal sense; they need a lawyer. I send them down to the local legal aid office or I contact the local legal aid office. I really know the answer before I phone because those offices have so restricted the sorts of things that they are prepared to fund that I know before asking that they are not going to fund this particular matter. Although there is discussion in this report about the funding, the report states: A recent study by the Law Council indicated that the level of legal aid funding has not diminished in real terms ... That is true, but it also states: However, the Law Council's study also contended that, upon a closer examination of the legal aid system, there has been an effective restriction in funding and tightening of eligibility criteria as a result of a substantial increase in the demands on legal aid services over the same period. It estimated that, to restore funding to a level that would provide legal aid to those who were eligible in the 1987-88 financial year, there would need to be an increase in funding of not less than $50 million per annum. That was in 1987-88. I would imagine it is much worse. The other problem is that this is a partnership, as the report points out, between the Commonwealth and the states. I do not know whether in Queensland the state is actually putting its share up. Somewhere, there is a big gap in the amount of money that is available. So my plea in this particular area, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to do it in the context of this report, is that there should be more funding for legal aid. I do not want the argument from the government 'where is the money going to come from?' amount of money to go around. WhatI am saying to the government is: somewhere there is a big gap in funding. There needs to be access to justice. We all agree with that. I think we all agree it is not available because, as I say, not a week goes by but we find someone who cannot get funding. There are areas where it has been restricted. Legal aid offices do not fund any family law matters any more. It seems to me there is no more crucial area of the law. I do not know whether the member knows or whether it is argued somewhere why that is not the case, but family law is a crucial area for legal aid funding. It is no use having either the",149,Representatives Main Committee

258,Mr Bradford,"That is a tension. I am conceding that is a tension. There is a certainThursday, 22 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1501 husband or the wife coming to us destitute. We have to sit there and listen to them and see them break down in front of us and say, 'You need a lawyer.' They cannot get legal aid. The other concern in Queensland-I do not know whether this is happening everywhere else-is that legal aid offices are not funding what they regard as commercial cases. If people have been wronged by a bank or a supplier and they have gone broke, have not got a cent and are living on the dole or whatever social security is available to them, clearly they cannot afford a lawyer and they need legal aid. Yet in Queensland they are not funding broadly commercial cases. This is right. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Bevis) is also a Queenslander; he knows there is no funding. The contribution I am making to the discussion really gives me the opportunity to highlight the concerns that I, as a member of parliament, have about the legal aid service. It is all right for the government to tell us that there is not enough money to go around for everything but I am making this point to the government today: it is your problem; you are the government. If we were in government, hopefully we would do something to solve the problem. But it is your problem in government to provide more money for legal aid. had not been my intention to enter this debate but it is a bit difficult to listen to some of the comments that have just been made and not provide some response. In terms of the global question of funding that the member for McPherson( Mr Bradford) quite properly raised, there is an area of concern and there is an area of unmet need. There is no doubt about that. Any parliamentarians who have had contact with legal aid offices, community based legal aid services or constituents who go to those services will know only too well that there are quite genuine and proper cases that a reasonable person would want to see funded which are unable to be funded under the current arrangements. Only last week I was looking at the funding figures for community legal aid services in Queensland and, from memory, there has been an increase of nearly 100 per cent in funding over the last five years. That indicates a very substantial growth in the funding that has gone to community based legal services. Notwithstanding that huge Commonwealth increase in that area-sadly, through that five-year period, it has not always been matched by a state government commitment-we still have an unmet need. This is an important question of social justice and, if the law is to work fairly and properly, as it is intended to and as the community expects it to, it is necessary to have access for all on a fair and equitable basis. The problem I have with this debate, when members of the opposition stand to point out the problem that I have also addressed, is that at other times in this parliament when we have had debates about budget outlays and fiscal management, the very same people argue that the government is spending too much money-not too much money by a few million dollars, but too much money by a few thousand million dollars. So at the very same time that those opposite are arguing that we should allocate more money for legal aid, they are also saying we should be cutting $5,000 million from our existing expenditure level. We do not need to do Economics 101 or Law 101 to understand that we cannot cut $5,000 million out of government outlays and then with any credibility stand up and say that we should be spending a few hundred million more onHowever, no matter what the priorities are when the $5,000 million is cut out of the budget,",150,Representatives Main Commitiee

When we wipe out all of the things that the $5,000 million eliminates, and we reorganise the priorities, we are still left with a massive problem. Quite frankly that was the problem that the opposition had at the last election when it took a Fightback package to the people that involved a substantial cut in government outlays. Those opposite have the same problem today: there is no genuine attempt to face the responsibility. government is meeting it. If members of the opposition want to engage the government and the community in a serious debate on these issues, they cannot do it in a half-baked or flippant manner by hopping up in debates of this sort to say, 'Spend more money.' Every time we have a budget debate they say, 'Spend less money.' Tho opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot reconcile the two by talking about money that might have gone to ANL or anywhere else because that is a drop in the bucket against the $5,000 million the opposition says we should stop spending. I find it difficult when those arguments are run by members of the opposition in debates of this sort. a fiction which the member opposite knows and understands, but the opposition has not been able to apply the intellectual rigour, or have the political intestinal fortitude, to come up with the hard answers. Until the opposition does that, that is exactly where it will stay: in opposition. The issue before us is an important one and, as a matter of principle, it is one in which I am sure there is a bipartisan view. It is one which I am confident all members of the parliament believe that we as a government need to take some measures to address so that all members of the Australian community have equal and fair access to the courts of the land. This is an important matter that the government holds high, and it is an important matter which I am sure all members of the parliament hold high. We should proceed through the debate in a constructive way and I think, by and large, that has been the case.
