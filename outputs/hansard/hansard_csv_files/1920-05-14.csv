That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next, at 3 p.m. OIL AGREEMENT BILL. Debate resumed from 11th May (vide That this Bill he now read a second tune. '-Lik e most other honourable members, I desire the discovery of oil in this country. We have done our best to find oil in Papua and in other parts of the Commonwealth, and I still 'have great hopes of success; but, until that success has been obtained, we shall be in the clutches of those who at present supply this community with oil, that is, unless we can make some arrangement which may free us from them. At the present time, the Vacuum Oil Company, and other oil companies, have a complete monopoly of this market. They could, if they liked, stop our supplies; and they could also increase the price of oil. We are entirely dependent upon them. The Government, however, have invited the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to erect refineries here for the treatment of the crude oil which they will import. Personally, I do not object to this arrangement. establish refineries here is a step in the right direction, no matter by whom taken. I would, of course, prefer to see the refineries erected by the Government, but the agreement that we are discussing creates a partnership between the Commonwealth and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; and, ultimately, if we desire to take over these refineries, we shall be able to do so. As we have not yet found oil in this country, crude oil must be imported 1911 . . for treatment. I should like to know 1913 why provision is being made for the re1914 fining of only 200,000 tons of crude oil 1916 . . per annum, seeing that the Common1917 . . 1,600,000 1,270,588 3,842,519 488,619 wealth needs nearly double that quantity. Is the company prepared to eTect reI t will be noted that the capital of the fineries which eventually will be capable company in 1915 had reached £800,000 of wholly supplying our needs ? If it or the Government will do that, I shall be very pleased. The objection has been raised that, by making this agreement, we are playing into the hands of a monopoly. But, even if that be so, the monopoly will not be so dangerous as that which at present exists. We are really entering into a partnership with the British Government and the Anglo-PeTsian Oil Company, and are at worse choosing the lesser of two evils. Having read the evidence given by officials of the Vacuum Oil Company before Boards of Inquiry and the Inter-State Commission, to justify applications for permission to increase the price of oil, I am astonished that some of these men are not now behind the bars of a gaol. According to Judge Edmunds, of New South Wales, they have made statements which are untrue, and have falsified their books. On the last occasion when the Vacuum Oil Company applied for permission to make an increase in the price of kerosene, the Judge said he would not hear the case. His mind was made up that the Vacuum Oil Company had so misled the Court, and so falsified its books, that he would not hear the case at all. He was prejudiced against the concern. When Judge Rolin was appointed to inquire into the matter of kerosene suprjly, he made certain very strong remarks. It is interesting to know how this company has extended its operations and interests. The report of the Inter-State Commission dealing with kerosene, benzine, oils, &c, contains highly entertaining statisI n my opinion, to tics. The Vacuum Oil Company, by the way, has seven-eighths of its interests in America, while only one share is held in Australia. I invite honourable members' to study these figures:Period..

25,Mr Riley (South Sydney) [11.10].,"-whic h was purely a book entry-and that in 1917 the paid-up capital amounted to £1,600,000. According to the remarks of the Judge that, also, was a book entry. The figures above reveal at a glance the enormous profits made by the ""Vacuum Oil Company within a very brief period. While the public was called upon to pay prices which were soaring rapidly higher and higher, this company was piling up enormous returns. It had made its own arrangements, of course, and there was no competition. Since August, 1914, the price of kerosene has risen from 6s. l i d . to 14s. 6d. per case-a n increase of more than 100 per cent. The price of benzine since that same year has risen from 13s. 4d. to 23s. 8d. per case-a n increase representing more than 77 per cent. We are consumers of oil in this country to the extent of about £4,000,000 per annum. Wc can realize what our position will shortly become if we are compelled to continue to pay the increased rates demanded by the monopoly. vouring to bring into the Australian market another competitor. The Vacuum Oil Company has taken good care to pass every risk on to the consumer . During 1915 and 1916, on a capital and reserves averaging £1,500,000, the company made a net profit of £981,000.

Activities will not be carried on in some far part of the world, but within our own borders. We shall have our own representatives upon the directorship, and we shall know everything that is taking place. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) proposes an amendment to insure that the Government shall insist that so many thousand pounds per annum shall be expended in developing our own resources, with the object of securing raw crude oil from some part or another of Australia. I have had the pleasure of visiting STew Guinea for about six weeks, and from what I saw and learned, I should say that tbere are good prospects of commercial oil being discovered there. 1 It does not matter how much money the Government may spend in trying to discover and develop oil prospects nowadays there appears to be some influence at work The.

What is the outcome of the bonus which the Commonwealth pays for the production of crude oil? When the Act came into force, we were hopeful that it would have the effect of relieving the pressure in the matter of Australia's oil requirements. To-day, oil is being produced from shale; but what good is that to the Commonwealth ? position of the shale oil industry under this agreement? which might well be considered by a Select Committee. We are not refining into kerosene the crude oil upon which we pay a bonus to-day; we are not securing any of its by-products. Messrs. John Fell and Company are supplying their crude product to the North Sydney and Sydney Gasworks, and to the Auckland and Christchurch Gasworks. The Commonwealth is paying a bonus to John Fell and Company, but the firm is selling its product to gas companies which could well afford to buy coal for the production of their gas. bonus, we are neglecting to develop our oil resources. oil bonus was very similar to the present position respecting this agreement: we do not know too much about it. is not bavins the effect of developing the Australian oil industry. Before we enter into an agreement to bind the Commonwealth over for fifteen years, and involve ourselves in the outlay of a large sum of money, there should be the fullest possible inquiry. I welcome the agreement itself, and I welcome the prospect of the erection of refineries. I trust, however, that the Government will not object to the appointment of a Select Committee, so that the agreement may be made most acceptable to the people of Australia. The agreement has been very carefully considered by the Government, and, although I am not prepared to accept it precisely as it stands, I do not think there is any necessity for the appointment of a Select Committee. Nobody, who has carefully read the agreement can say that it contains anything to suggest that the ing to trick the Commonwealth Government. I consider that the agreement requires a little tightening up at some points. Rather more definition and clarity are desirable in certain respects; for example, in the matter of insuring that the company shall draw its supplies, if and when available, from Papua, instead of seeking to carry on refining activities with crude oil imported from other parts of the world. In regard to capital, the agreement itself provides that an increase may be made at any time, and that the Commonwealth authority, no matter what changes may take place, shall still retain the balance of interest in the whole concern. I do not think a Select Committee is required to ascertain exactly what capital the business should begin with. In discussing the measure in Committee, the Prime Minister, no doubt, will be able to present such information upon that head as should satisfy honourable members; and necessary amendments can, of course, be made. It must be remembered, however, that whatever amendments may be decided upon must be subMeanwhile, despite the mitted to the Anglo-Persian Company, seeing that it is a partner with the Commonwealth. I do not think there is any reason to suggest mala fides on the part of the company, I am satisfied that it will try to meet lis upon all points. I am very glad that this is an all-British agreement. It is time that the Empire became, in respect of one or two essentials, a little more self-supporting. In Australia, for instance, our iron resources need to be developed. The Government should do what they can to encourage the founding of an iron industry in Australia. The war has taught us that oil is a basic requirement, and we should do the best we can to obtain a proper oil supply within the Commonwealth. I hope that, before long, Australia will be supplying this company with oil, and that we shall have it refined here. Some -people seem to think that the Government have practically handed over to this company the oil business of the Commonwealth. It is suggested that, under this",21,Second Reading

I cannot prophesy what may be the consequences of the agreement, but there is certainly nothing in it to suggest that it will lead to the establishment of a monopoly. It is open to any other company to come along to the Commonwealth with an oil proposition. Australia is opposed to the view of the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr cating oils. Without this company we Atkinson). experts may say. agreement, and am placing my own interpretation, upon it. There is nothing in it to prevem the Government .from helping any other company in Australia that has an oil proposition to submit.

I fail to see why we should prevent any one from doing the very bestto produce oil and refine it in the Commonwealth. So far as I can see, there is nothing in the agreement that would have that effect. There is in the Bill a clause designed to protect the company from dumping. To that I take no exception. Under it, if the Standard Oil Company, or any other concern, enters into unfaii competition with this company, the Government will come to the assistance of the local industry by means of the Customs or other Government agencies that it may need to employ. There is nothing wrong about that. Surely this Parliament will see that the Government protect the people in the matter of the price at which the oil shall be sold. that respect? only with oil, and when I address the HouseI try to confine my remarks to the matter before the Chair. I see no danger in the provisions of the Bill relating to dumping. If this company helps to found the oil industry of Australia, and enables us to supply our own requirements, it will do good service. We must have some source of supply upon which we'may rely, especially in time of war. Apart from the requirements of the Navy, the industrial world is daily increasing its demands for fuel and lubricannot at present supply our own wants. Even now we are in the hands of monoI have read the polies. The companies which supply ua from abroad can make any arrangement they please between themselves. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Biley) has quoted figures showing that in the United States of America petrol, benzine, and other oils have been very much cheaper than in Australia. The prices here are steadily rising, and there seems to be no limit to the price that kerosene may reach. This agreement is of special interest to me, and I have scanned it carefully to see that it leaves the way open to other companies in Australia to secure governmental assistance if they can show that they are able to supply oils at cheaper rates. I am not at all satisfied with the way in which the Navy Department has been treating a Tasmanian oil company. There is in my own electorate a deposit of shale which, according to excellent authority, will produce 40 gallons of oil to the ton. The oil has been proved to be very strong and pure, and suitable for naval purposes. In Papua, we have found a very valuable oil, but it is not suitable for naval purposes. We have been importing oil for the Navy, and have been paying for it from £6 to £7 per ton. The latest figures supplied to me by the Navy Department show that it is now landing oil in Melbourne, in its own oil-tank steamer, at £5 Os. 5d. per ton. I dare say that, if thesefigureswere carefully analyzed, it would be found that the cost is considerably more. Doubtless, no allowance is made for interest on the money invested in the oiltank steamer and for other incidental expenses, which should be included in a",23,Second Reading

39,Mr Atkinson,"This Bill dealsproper business calculation. Tbe company which owns the Tasmanian shale deposits, to which I have referred, has offered the Government a contract for the supply of oil at £4 103. per ton. The Oommonwealth Government did, ,on one occasion, agree with the State Government of Tasmania to accept 8,000 tons of this oil at £3 15s. per ton, but it has not been able to secure a renewal of that agreement even at £4 10s. per ton. Certain objections have been raised by the Navy Department. The company is prepared to try to meet them, and the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) told the Naval Board, in my presence, to prepare a contract and send it to the company in Tasmania, with the object of endeavouring to come to terms. has done nothing. It continues to play with the company and its offer. The deposit of shale is a very large one, and we should do our best to encourage those who wish to develop it. The company are not asking for money. They say that if the Government would enter into a contract with them for the supply of oil, they would be able at once to raise sufficient capital to develop the industry. was Minister for Trade and Customs, did he not make the Tasmanian company an offer? Hr. ATKINSON -Whil e he was Minister, the Tasmania^ Government, which, would have taken over the concern but for the action of the Upper House in rejecting the proposal, had a contract with the Commonwealth to supply 8,000 tons of oil at a certain price. The company, as I have said, is now asking the Government to enter into another contract. It must have some protection. Is it reasonable that it should be expected to go on the market and ask for more capital when, as soon as it started work, it would be open to the Standard Oil Company, or other foreign corporations, to enter into competition with it? The Standard Oil Company could afford to give oil away here for a year or two in order to defeat the local industry. By slightly increasing its prices in other countries it would not be out of pocket. Eveni f it were, it would not mind as long as it succeeded in strangling our industry. If we do mot come to the assistance satisfactory amendments are made in of a local industry such as this, we shall fail in our duty. help the Tasmanian venture. danger in this Bill as long as the Government will do what they ought to do with regard to the Tasmanian company. wealth Government is its only customer.

We have reached a stage in our history when, in order to develop Australian, industries, and so to improve our financial position, we must be prepared to take business risks. Whilei t is our duty to see that the public funds ""are not foolishly expended, we must at the same time display business enterprise, since we need fresh sources of revenue to balance our accounts. Unless we develop the latent resources of Australia,we shall not balance the ledger. We have great possibilities of development-w e have tremendous resources as yet un-. touched-and the war has piled up on us a war debt which, for a population of 5,000,000 to confront, is almost appalling. But, if twenty-five years hence we could show that we had developed Australia's national assets to the extent of £1,000,000,000, our balance-sheet would look very well. The history of industrial expansion in the United. States of America shows that such development is by no means impossible. A coumitry is different from an individual. When an individual dies, his' assets are distributed in accordance with the terms of his will. A country, however, goes on for all time developing its assets, and so adding to the general wealth of the community. The development of our latent resources is our great hope. Our industries must be expanded if the country is to carry a larger population and meet its heavy financial obligations. I shall support the Bill, provided that Committee.

If it were ask' ing for monetary assistance, I should appreciate some shymess on the part of the Government or the Naval Board. As it is, it merely asks the Commonwealth to enter into a contract with it for the supply of oil. It is said that if such a contract were entered into it would be able, within an hour, to raise in Melbourne the necessary capital for the development of its shale deposits. Even if this agreement be adopted the re: finery will not be in operation for about two years. I recollect the management of this Tasmanian shale company saying 'that if the Commonwealth would give a satisfactory contract the company could raise £150,000 immediately, and could be supplying fuel oil to the Navy within twelve months. of oil are sufficient inducement to any company to start work at once. true under ordinary conditions. But if anybody asked the honourable member to take shares in an oil venture iu Australia he would immediately ask what protection the venture would bave against the competition of the Standard Oil Company and other big trusts. Andi f he were told that there was no such protection he would withhold his capital. That is the position of this Tasmanian company, and indeed of every Australian oil venture at the present time. Unless the Government give assistance in the manner I have suggested -they will not be able to found the oil industry in Australia in the face of the terrible competition of big overseas trusts. The Government would take no -monetary risk in giving the contract that is asked for; if the company does not supply oil it will receive no money. If the Government found that by any such contract they were tieing their -hands in regard to the obtaining of oil the contract if at the end of six months fulfil its part of the bargain. The Government have not 'done their duty to this company; they have not made sufficient effort to foster the oil industry in Australia. I hope that the Government will not regard this agreement as representing all that they need to do to foster our oil industry. The agreement is a very good arrangement so far as it goes. But the Government must keep clearly in mind that other people in Australia have oil propositions that are quite worthy of the closest investigation by the Commonwealth. -We are dealing with an exceedingly important question. A scientist said recently, "" We are now passing through the coal and steel age. The immediate future will be the era of oil and cement."" We know what oil means to Australia, because, as has been pointed out by other honourable members, this country has suffered seriously through the operations of a monopoly which, second only to the shipping trust, is the greatest monopoly ih existence. I intend to vote to refer this Bill to a Select Committee, because the one thing needed in dealing with this agreement is expert evidence. will get his expert evidence from the Standard Oil Company and the Vacuum Oil Company. dence I require is not as to the oil, but as to the constitution of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the extent to which Australia is being pledged under this agreement. An interjection made by the Prime Minister when the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) was speaking, shows the serious necessity for further consideration of this agreement. The Prime Minister said that because under this agreement the Commonwealth will hold a majority of the shares it will therefore have the controlling influence. The agreement itself deprives the Commonwealth of that control for the whole period of its operation, because one paragraph readsTliat of the total number of directors of the Refinery Company (including the managing director; if he has a vote), three-sevenths in",25,Second Reading

51,Mr Mcwilliams,"The expert evinumber shall be nominated by and represent the Commonwealth, and four-sevenths shall be nominated by and represent the company.

MrM c WILLIAMS ing at all to do with the point I am now making. This matter must be considered in the light of the agreement itself. If we agree to give the company predominating control it w ill be impossible to alter or escape from that agreement. absurd for the Minister to interject that we can veto the conditions of our agreement. What is the position in regard to Papua? We have known for some years that oil deposits exist in Papua, especially in German New Guinea. About eighteen months ago I introduced to the Minister 'a gentleman who had just returned from New Guinea, and who offered to select an area of land, float a company, and work theoil deposits, paying the Government any f a i r and reasonable royalty that they might care' to impose. was rejected on the ground that the Government intended to retain for themselves the whole of the oil-bearing lands of New Guinea. Then an agreement was entered into between the British and Australian Governments that each should contribute £50,000 towards the cost of prospecting for oi l there. ing operations were placed in the hands of the Anglo-PersianO i l Company, but so f a r the reports to date show that company has not discovered any payable deposits.

The progress of the measure will be expedited, and be made easier by referring it to a Select Committee. port of such a Committee, honourable members would be in an infinitely better position to give consideration to the agreement, which I candidlv admit I do not understand. When I went across to TasmaniaI read it on the boat, and I read it over and over again while I was away. I also referred it to men to whose opinion I defer, but I cannot tell now what will be the position of the company in Tegard to discoveries of oil made by other persons in Australia. That is a point which ought to be cleared up. For the reasons I have advanced I shall vote to refer the B ill to a Select Committee, and I would limit the time the Committee would have for bringing up its report to three weeks.

The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was right in saying that we have reached a new era by reason of the extended use of oil and petrol.

The appointment of a Select Committee could surely do no harm, if it did no good. The telegram to which I refer is from Messrs. John Eell and Company, of Sydney. If men are engaged in an industry, and have expended all their money and energy in developing it , they naturally become anxious when a great company like this is given a practical monopoly, although we are told by the Ministerf o r the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) that it is not a monopoly. It is a fact, however, that they are the only people in Australia who would have a refinery, for no one else is to be allowed to erect one. If crude oil is discovered on any of the Pacific Islands or in Papua outside the ramifications of this company, the oil will have This telegram was sent to the honto be sent elsewhere to be refined. However, the telegram is as follows:Regarding Anglo-Persian oil agreement, we regard it as imperative for the protection of the shale-oil resources of this country that the Bill under discussion should be held up pending a complete investigation. The meaThe telegram sounds a note of sure, if passed, will automatically close the shale-oil industry of the Commonwealth. Shale is our natural source of oil supply, and if closed we will be dependent on oversea sources. To protect these sources, a Navy and fortifications will have to be maintained for all time. Papua is especially vulnerable. Part of this money could be spent to better advantage in protecting and developing our natural resources with white labour. In the event of war with Japan or the United States of America, these' oversea routes cannot be protected, and the whole source of oversea oil supplies for the Commonwealth would be cut off and complete isolation result. It would be criminal to leave the shale-oil industry unprotected, and to place this country in such a position, besides allowing foreign imports to strangle our natural resources. The Scotch shale industry was of vital importance to Great Britain during the late war. Great Britain and United States of America, recognising the necessity of developing their shale resources, According to the are at present giving the question the gravest consideration.

This firm, which is specially interested, asks, for delay in order that there may be further investigation. This is not an industry in its infancy, but one that has been tried. The latter part of the telegram' tells us.that the present output of shale oil could be enormously increased, and surely that is a matter into which a Select Committee could inquire. If this Parliament w ill not protect Australian industries, where are the industries to find protection? The scheme proposed looks very nice on papera scheme to bring crude oil from the Persian Gulf to Fremantle. The gentlemen interested have been busy for some considerable time in the matter.

I would remind honourable members t h a t the House of Commons passed a resolution of thanks to the British Imperial Oil Companyf o r what it d i d during the war. it supplied 80 per cent, of the products that make up TNT., as is stated in a booklet issued by the company, on the cover of which is printed "" The Shell that h it Germany the hardest."" I advise honourable members to read that publication to see what the company has done for the Empire. I know of nothing that it has done detrimental to the interests of Australia. the price of petrol in Australia is tremendously high. tries in which it is lower are those in which cil is produced. Petrol costs more in South Africa and in some of the States of South America than it costs in Australia. costs in Great Britain, where it is not produced. ber supporting a monopoly? amusing interjection to come from a member representing the sugar districts of Queensland, who is the greatest advocate of Australia's greatest monopoly, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. able member rather support an Australian monopoly than an American one? any monopoly. Let those flag-wagging patriots, of which the honourable member is one, listen to this:During the critical year of 1915, "" Shell's "" Portishead Distillery produced approximately 80 per cent, of Britain's total output of toluol, TNT. (trd-nitro-toluol), so extensively used for shells, bombs, and mines. Addressing the Institute of Petroleum Technologists, at their annual dinner some months after the armistice, Sir Frederick W. Black, KC.B., referred to the "" Shell"" group as havthe ing given us that valuable product toluol, from Borneo petroleum, without which we could not have defeated the enemy. Under the agreement companies other than the Anglo-PersianO i l Company will be prevented from trading in Australia. The agreement saysThat the Refinery company shall not enter into or be in any way concerned in or a party to or act in concert with any commercial Trust or Combine, but shall always be and remain an independent British business. The firm of Walkers Limited, in Queensland, can make any machinery that it may be asked for.

Por that reason, I wish to tell the House the facts about the proposal from Tasmania with regard to the supply of shale oil. The price is as stated by the honourable member for Franklin, but he told the House only half the facts. The offer of the company is to supply oil for 90s. per ton, plus the bounty of 45s. per ton, which brings the price up to the figure stated by me, namely, 135s. per ton. The payment of the oil bounty will run out at about the same time as the proposed contract was to begin. The proposal of the Tasmanian company, therefore, means that we should enter into a fresh undertaking to offer a bounty of 45s. per ton for ten years for the production of oil to supplement the price of 90s. per ton at which they are prepared to supply oil. It was specifically provided that, failing the renewal of the bounty, the price was to be 135s. for ten years. state all the facts. Is that not an extension of the existing bounty that is asked for? it is. manian people are not asking for anything that the Commonwealth is not giving now. have said that the oil bounty will cease to be payable at about the time when operations under the contract provided for in the Bill are supposed to begin, and the Tasmanian proposal is, therefore, that the oil bounty shall be renewed for ten years. price of the Tasmanian oil up to the figure I stated-135s . per ton. 195s. now. Sir now on oils we secure for ourselves £5 Os. 5d. per ton. ( Mr Hughes) spoke of a price of 190s. per ton. able member will listen to what I have to say. Both statements are correct. Por oil we are compelled to obtain outside our contracts, we are paying £9 10s. per ton.: I hope that is clear enough. I shall have later on. I am concerned now only as to. the correctness of statements made regarding the offer from Tasmania. It can do the Tasmanian people no good to have the facts incorrectly stated. I wish to guard myself against any statement. I make in connection with these matters being construed as unfriendly to the Tasmanian project. I have shown my friendliness to Tasmania during a period of nineteen years in this House. I think that the Tasmanian project is worth looking into on its merits, but it cannot assist its consideration to state only half the facts. I repeat that the fact is that the price proposed by the company is 135s. per ton for oil supplied into tanks, which the Commonwealth Government are asked to erect on the coast of Tasmania, for tbe' purpose of receiving the oil.

I could quite appreciate that if the Committee could call upon expert evidence; but we have not expert experience and information at our disposal in Australia. It is all very well to say that the Committee could examine commercial men representing oil concerns; but it is not usual for busiance, with business management. If the ness men to go to their mercantile' opponents , to secure technical information. Surely we have in the Ministry and their advisers men who are as good as those whom we could call upon from private commercial sources. Time is the essence of this contract; we have no time to lose. I congratulate the Government upon having entered into the agreement. It should be remembered that it will be two years before the refinery can be completed. Meanwhile, there are prospects of large crude oil supplies being struck in Australian Territories. What will be the value of crude oil discoveries to deal with the product? I know of two companies, working to-day in Queensoil within a brief period. One man interested has told me that he feels sure he will be. able to get oil within the next three months. It is believed that in Queensland alone there is no less an area than 20,000 square miles of oil country. The best encouragement we can give these prospectors is, first to offer to reward them for making a discovery in payable quantities; and, secondly, to re-assure them that, when oil has been discovered, there will be a ready purchaser who will refine it . The buyer to whom they should look to receive the highest value from their supplies should be the Commonwealth refinery. I do not consider the Anglo Persian Oil Company in any degree a foreign concern. Seeing that more than half of its shares are held by the I m perial Government, and that the Commonwealth will hold half of the interests in the refinery to be erected here,, it means that practically three-fourths of the total interests will be in the hands of the British and Commonwealth authorities. We should give the Imperial Government credit for being shrewd. When Some honourable members they entered into an. agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, they knew what they were about. When they appointed to the directorate as their representative a man of such knowledge and experience as Lord Inchcape, who was not a shareholder, they knew what they were doing.

As a result, British firms were able to compete very effectively with Australian manufacturers who were then becoming established. I think I was instrumental in inducing the Government to offer the reward of £10,000 for the discovery of payable oil in the matter of their in Australia, but I believe now that that Australian amount is not sufficient.

There is a general belief that payable oil exists in Western and South Australia and Queensland, and there is every reason, therefore, why refineries should be established without undue delay, so that we may be able to deal with oil when found. I should like to emphasize the fact that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company controls a larger area of oil lands than all the companies in the United States of America, and, therefore, it should be to our advantage to be associated with the corporation commanding such huge supplies of crude o i l , and which, moreover, is not dependent upon any other organization for transport. The agreement also contains a safeguard in that, if the Anglo-Persian Oil Com,pany attempts to charge unfair transport charges, there is nothing to prevent our chartering other vessels for the conveyance of this crude oil to Australia, the price fixed being f.o.b. port of shipment. This means that the oil becomes our property when it is put on board ship, such ship to be named by us, so we are free to choose our own vessels for its conveyance to Australia; but the Anglo-Persian Company undertakes to carry it at a reasonable price. I trust the agreement will be ratified with as little delay as possible, so that, with an adequate supply of fuel oil at reasonable prices guaranteed, our manufacturing industries may be increased and developed satisfactorily. I agree with many other honourable members who have spoken during this debate, that a considerable amount of time might be saved if the agreement is referred to a Select Committee of the House, I have not heard any honorbecause if it is to be taken seriatim the debate is likely to be very protracted. If the agreement is If , however, it is referred to a Committee, and a report is presented to the Housei n three weeks' time, it is quite likely that, w it h the information then available to honourable members, the B ill wil l be agreed to unanimously. In all these great financial transactions we might very well follow the example of the House of Commons, which refers all proposals entailing a considerable expenditure of money to Committees. In connection w i th the Profiteering Act of 1919, Select Committees were appointed, at the instiBritish Cabinet, and as the Profiteering Act dealt with a variety of subjects and industries, on© Committee investigated the shipping side of the problem, and another inquired into the question of oil supplies in Great Britain The latter Committee submitted a brief report, which appears in the London Times, and for the information of honourable members. I shall quote the conclusions arrived at after an exhaustive investigation. The report statedWe find that 1. There is grave danger of a permanent world famine in motor spirit, even at fabulous prices. After analyzing the present and potential oil supplies of the world, the Committee arrived at that very important conclusion. It went on to report that2. The sole remedy for this country is a largely increased production of home and/or Empire produced motor fuel. 3. Power alcohol is the only potentially unlimited source of supply. 4. The Government should use every possible means to foster the production of power alcohol and .place no restriction on the production and use of power alcohol in this country. any investigation as to power alcohol. The matter has already been investigated here. Government thought it worthwhile to investigate these matters, surely we should have an inquiry before we enter into an agreement of this kind. We have had quite recently a concrete illustration of the expedition with which a Committee can report.

208,Mr Fenton,"But since the Britishhas already presented to the House' a progress report of a very valuable character. In order that the House may be supplied with the fullest information, and so placed in a position to arrive at a proper conclusion in regard to this agreement, we should have an inquiry. This proposal for a Select Committee is entirely non-party. that it has emanated from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) should not give to it a party tinge? A Select Committee would be able to analyze the agreement, obtain further information, and report to us within three or four weeks. This agreement will bind us to the company for the next fifteen years. What will be our position at the end of tliat period ? Are we to remain at a stand-still in the matter of the invention and discovery of motor power ? Already we have power alcohol, benzol, and a new product known as natalite competing with petrol. Fifteen years hence, in the matter of power, our position will be very different from what it is to-day. I believe that oil fuel will have competitors that will push it right cut of the market. All over the world chemists and other experts are at work looking for substitutes for petrol, because we are faced with a famine in respect of motive power, and fifteen years certainly seems to be a long time to be bound to one company. The Public Accounts Committee conducted an inquiry into the Papuan oil fields, and examined D r . Wade, who is the only expert representing the Australian Government -It""reported thatThe opinion of one experienced witness was to the effect that the prospects of obtaining oil in Papua are distinctly good. At the same time, he added, "" we have to remember that .oil, being liquid, and able to migrate, its accovered.

The distribution of petrol, and also kerosene, I think, has been made a Government monopoly in France, and is yielding a revenue of something like £2,000,000 per annum.

Why not allow other great o i l concerns to step in ? I admit that we have not made very much progress in Papua during tlie seven years in which we have been engaged in oil development there. We have expended £21,000 on the work, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is going tobenefit by that expenditure, which was largely incurred in clearing the country. We have cleared the way for this company to step in and take advantage of the spade work done by the Commonwealth. As the result of our outlay, it will be able to secure a profitable output sooner than would otherwise have been possible. In that respect alone, we are giving the company a great concession. we giving the' company ? It is merely to be our agent, and Ave shall pay it for the work done.

I know thatBritish parliamentarians are far more susceptible to outside influences than are Australian parliamentarians. reflection to make. member will refer to the history of persons who have taken a prominent part in Imperial politics, he will see that some of them who should have been relegated to obscurity have been appointed to very high positions. Take the Marconi scandals, with which a number of members of the British Cabinet were associated. One of those members, in particular, has since been appointed to one of the highest offices in the TJnited Kingdom. Knowing that the3e things are taking place, the fact that Lord Inchcape represents the British Government in this matter is no inducement to me to vote for this Bill. That gentleman possesses great control, particularly over shipping, and is associated with a body of men who are neither fools nor philanthropists. They are out to make money, and if they can make it by establishing an oil refinery in Australia they will do so. In war time the British Government itself proved to be one of the greatest profiteers in the community. Under this Bill the Anglo Persian Oil Company will supply Australia with only half its annual requirements in the way of products other than fuel oil. It will be two years before we get a drop of oil from the refinery which it is proposed to establish. What will happen to us in the meantime? We shall be dependent upon the very people whom honourable members opposite so vigorously denounce. What happened to Britain? Out of a total of 300,000,000 gallons of oil required by her annually, the American companies have supplied 200,000,000 gallons. In this connection I desire to read a paragraph written by Professor Chester Lloyd Jones, of the University of Wisconsin, in which he saysAt present there can he no doubt that the most important economic development of this sort which has occurred to the south of the United States is in oil resources. The most important among these thus far are those in Mexico, a country which in 1001 produced but 10,345 barrels, which began exports a decade later, and which produced in 1917 55,202,770 barrels, a large share of which went to keep the fires burning in the ships of the Allies in their struggle against Germany. there were shipped from Mexican ports 53,910,863 barrels. From producing practically nothing at the beginning of the war, Mexico has risen to what is probably second place among potential oil producers, for the oil marketed is now limited, not by the capacity of the wells, but by transportation facilities. I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill; and shall support the motion of the Leader of the Opposition to refer the measure to a Select Committee, in order to remove the public suspicion with which this matter is surrounded. Quite contrary to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, the fact that the company with which the Government propose to enter into this agree1 ment is a purely British one carries considerable weight with me. To my mind, especially in the matter of o i l , it is essential that the British Empire shall protect its interests against the great Trusts of the United States. I have no desire to traverse the agreement, which is set out in the schedule to this Bill, and which appears to be, on the whole, a very acceptable one. But I wish to draw special' attention to one remark made by the Prime Minister in discussing the measure. He stated that, in connection with the future oil supplies of Australia, we should put shale upon one side and look only for well oil. Now, there are quite a number of really good shale propositions to be found throughout the Commonwealth. Some of them are of the most promising nature. Upon page 441 of the Official Year Book of the Commonwealth for 1914, I find the following:Production on "" anything like a large scale commenced in 1868, when about 17,000 tons, valued at £48,000, were raised. The production in 1912 amounted to 86,018 tons, valued at £34,770, as compared with 75,104 tons, valued at £36,980, in 1911. Of the total raised in 1012, 40,185 tons were produced in the Northern District, and 45,833 in the Western District. In addition to that there are deposits in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland, any one of which might be well worth developing. Some of them certainly are. The Tear-Book further saysDuring the year ended 30th June, 1913, the Commonwealth Oil Corporation at HartleyI n 1918 Vale, New South Wales, received bounty to the amount of £804 on kerosene, and £882 on",42,Joseph Cook W E Are Paying Of His Speech

That bounty ceased to exist at the end of 1913. tralian O i l Company, which had its works at Murrurundi, was compelled to close down, though a very small additional bonus would have enabled it to continue operations. the Government would be well advised not only to adopt this agreement w i th the Anglo-PersianO i l Company, but to do something in the direction of encouraging shale o i l production in Australia. I know that a good deal of money has been lost, both in Scotland and Australia, in connection with the production of shale oil. ..But that was before o i l was i h such great demand as it is to-day. We must recollect that during the past three or four years the price of that commodity has increased by 200 per cent, or 300 per cent. under former conditions required a good deal of assistance from the State ought not to need very much in the way of financial assistance in the future. I have not the slightest doubt that before many years we shall discover mineral well .oil in Australia.

Under the agreement .we are virtually handing over to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Wheni t ceased the British Ausfor a period of fifteen years the sole right to refine oil in Australia. The term is a very lengthy one, and I cannot recall an agreement of a similar character being arranged for such a number of years. Do honourable members realize that in It seems to me that supporting this Bill they are assisting in establishing a huge monopoly in the Commonwealth? The agreement embodied in the measure does not make any provision for exploring for o i l , but simply 'creates the necessary machinery for erecting a refinery in Australia. The crude oil .to be handled will have to be imported from other countries, and as the arrangement is for refining only, other companies should be given the opportunity of bringing crude oil to Australia. The agreement was drawn up in an atmosphere totally foreign to Australian sentiment, Properties, therefore, which and entirely opposed to the best interests of the Commonwealth. ' Those gentlemen who were responsible for its drafting are doubtless past masters at the work, and when the document was submitted to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy( Sir Jos.eph Cook) they apparently overlooked the fact that they were being influenced by such men as Lord Inchcape. I do not think it can be called an agreement, because such All the o i l experts in this documents usually embody a mutual arrangement between the contracting parties; in this case ali of the benefits are on one side. It would be interesting to know how the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) intends voting on this B ill , because he very critically anaG o o d o i l has been lyzed many clauses in the agreement, and came to the conclusion that practically I do not think much every one would have to be amended in Committee. Why does not the honourable member support the appointment of a Select Committee to enable the fullest Until that possible information to be submitted to this Chamber? When considering a proposal such as this we should know what developments are taking place in oil-producing centres, and what prospects there I are of other corporations entering into a similar arrangement with the Commonwealth. When I was in New Guinea, in 1912, I was informed by men who had been engaged in exploratory work there that tbe principal difficulty in connection The honorable with that field was in finding a means of transport between the oil deposits and the",43,Joseph Cook W E Are Paying Of His Speech

If they consider supplies the agreement a perfect one. w it h which It not be afraid to have it subjected to the it is their intention to sition ( Mr Tudor) has pointed out, becountry in an expenditure under the Iron Bounty Bill, it decided to hear the evidence of experts. Yet here Ministers propose to involve the people of Australia in a big expenditure and create a monopoly for fifteen years in a commodity, which is most essential in our industrial life and for the transporting of our produce. We are very foolish if we agree to do so without a preliminary inquiry. We are ^anxious to do the right thing, but we cannot when the Government are -determined to prevent us from knowing the full details of the step we are asked to take. The Commonwealth has spent £120,920 to date in prospecting for and the production of oil in Papua, and at the last stock-taking in June, 1919, the realizable assets were valued at £24,500. I am quite willing to admit that, when a Government undertakes exploring work of this character, there are losses, and I do not condemn our Government in this respect, but under the agreement with the Anglo Persian Oil Company and the British Government all our iabour and expenditure in Papua is to be handed over to the oil company, and I am told that Lord Inchcape is connected with the concern. If Lord Inchcape were cut up into twenty-five pieces, he could not fill the chair in half the propositions with which he is connected as director. Buti f his name is included in the directorate of any concern, we may be sure that it is one that is out to get an advantage over the people. The Peninsular and Oriental Navigation .Company now propose to establish banks at every comer of the world where their vessels touch, so that they can control monetary transactions as well as shipping, but if Australia allows it to be done here, the people are simpler creatures than I Lave always taken them to be. I maintain that this agreement is not an agreement, because it is not mutual in character, and that the Government have been very unwise in asking the House to agree to it. As I understand that the Prime Minister desires to make a statement, I shall make my protest against this Trust by voting against the Bill, and reserving any remarks I intend to make until the motion to refer the Bill to a Select Committee, is before the House, when I under[89]2 stand full latitude will be given to honourable members to discuss the subject. ter and Attorney-General) [3.38] I shall confine my remarks to dealing with the material points raised during the course of the debate by honourable members who for one reason or another do not .entirely approve of the Bill. I wish to preface what I have to say by repeating in most emphatic and unambiguous language that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has no connection, direct or indirect, with any other great oil company. I have explained that the Burmah Company, which is to all intents and purposes part of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, is in itself a British company. The Anglo-Persian Company has no relation to the .Standard Oil Company, the ""Shell"" group, or any American or foreign company. It is British in essence and origin, and owes its success to British enterprise and capital, and its control is now in the hands of the British Government. Many reasons have been urged by honourable members as to why the agreement should not be ratified. I must confess to a feeling of disappointment at those which have been put forward by some honourable members. Some have urged that if the agreement is ratified it will create a monopoly in this country and place usunder the domination of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but this accusation comes strangely from the lips of men who have been absolutely silent under the complete domination of the Standard Oil Company and the "" Shell"" .group for years and years. As soon as a British company, which is dominated by the British Governmeut, and which is Imperial in essence, offersmaking the Commonwealth a f u l l partner -with it-to erect a refinery in this country, members rise and say that this is a monopoly, and, for their part, they will not agree to it.. The .Shell? Yes. Standard Oil? Yes. But the Anglo-Persian, Great Britain, and . the Commonwealth. ? No. I must confess that their attitude surprises me. What surprised me no less was to hear, for the first time in my life, that moderation was one. of the characteristics of the Standard Gil and Shell Companies, that they had not increased their prices, but had stopped.",44,Joseph Cook W E Are Paying Of His Speech

220,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Minisshort of taking the last penny from the users of petrol/ benzine, lubricating oil, and fuel oil in Australia. We were told, in short, that those companies, which for years had been, as it were, the stalkinghorse of every Democrat, every syndicalist, and every demagogue, like myself, throughout the world, had suddenly become clothed in the shining garments of the philanthropist, and all the hosts of the archangels. As I looked at the reS resentatives of the Shell.and the iStanard Oil in the gallery while these things were being said, I saw their faces shine like the faces of those who had found an abiding place in the bosom of Father Abraham. They surely did not recognise themselves in that description. The fact is that the Standard Oil, the Shell, and other foreign companies have done everything that lay in their power as commercial concerns, which are not immoral, but unmoral, whose only god was profit, and whose only purpose was to wring the last penny out of the consumers of this country, to serve their own purposes at our expense, even to threatening this country with an oil famine. When the Prices Commission declined to increase the price of oil, they said, "" If you do not should be regulated by supply and deincrease the price, you will not have any oil."" the same with the shipping. this, that when it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall become a f u l l partner in a great Imperial concern-becaus e it is Imperial in the best sense of the word, since the British Government is a. f u l l partner in it-w e should refuse to take the opportunity to erect in Australia a refinery which would insure fuel oil for our Navy, without which we aTe undone, and for the British Navy, without whose co-operation we are also undone?

Is it on the American company and the Dutch companies, or on this company which is built on the rock of Britain itself? SoI put these things to one side as being in themselves abundant proof of the excellence of this agreement, since no better arguments can be adduced against it . I take the other points in fhe agreement against which criticism has been directed. It is said that we shall have no guarantee of getting crude oil at a fair price from the Anglo-Persian Company. I said when introducing the Bill that we would get it at a fair and reasonable price. It was pointed out that that was not in the agreement. I have had it put in. If honourable members ask, "" Wiho is to be the judge of a fair and reasonable price ?"" I answer, "" The Commonwealth."" That, I submit, is a full and satisfactory answer. It has also been said, "" The company will make their money out of freights, for which, they will charge us what they like."" My reply was that we would get freight at current rates. . One honourable member laughed at this, as if it was the most unusual thing in the world that prices should be regulated by supply and demand. We have always heard from the Ministerial Corner, in regard to wheat and wool, and from the Opposition Corner in regard to labour, that prices mand, plus whatever pressure can be brought to bear on the market. Is that not the law which governs the world? However, in order to meet this objection, we have had that provision altered, and, if the freights charged by the Anglo-Persian Company for bringing their crude mineral oil are such as we consider unfair, we can get other freights, either our own or anybody else's. I think it was the Leader of the Opposition who said that the effect of the agreement would be that the consumer of oil would be sweated and bled. For all these years honourable members opposite have been silent. While we were under the domination of the Shell and the Standard Oil Companies, they cared nothing about the unfortunate consumer; but now they sweat with terror or apprehension at the prospect of the poor consumer being exploited by this company, in which the Commonwealth itself is to be the dominant partner. But what are the facts? For the first time since oil has been used in Australia, the interests of the consumer will be conserved. No",46,Joseph Cook W E Are Paying Of His Speech

222,Mr Hughes,"Hav e we' come tolonger will he be compelled to pay whatever Standard Oil likes to charge him. I have said that the price will be fair and reasonable. It was contended that there was no guarantee of this, since no provision was made for it in the agreement. In order to meet this objection, I have had such a provision inserted. If I am asked, "" Who is to say what price is fair and reasonable ?"" I say, "" The Commonwealth."" I ask honourable members who are capable of looking at anything that comes out of Judea-o r is it Nazareth? -wit h an unjaundiced eye, what more do they want? Further, the critics of the agreement complain that this company is going to be protected against the competition of the Shell and Standard Oil concerns, the two which I take as being the greatest of the foreign companies, by having a refund of duty on crude oil if those companies, as our competitors, wish to undersell the Anglo-Persian Company and destroy them, foT the purpose of subsequently exploiting .this country and resuming their monopoly of it. It is said "" You are going to give the Anglo Persian Company an unfair advantage."" My answer is this: "" The established policy of this country is Protection. It is a good thing to have the oil refined here, in order to give employment to our people, and to have here supplies of oil, both in its raw and in its refined state. In order to do that, we must protect these industries in Australia by the same means as we employ to protect every other industry."" But we provide that, in order to prevent this company exploiting the people, none of the advantages set out in section 12 to safeguard the company against unfair competition -by foreign companies shall be enforced unless the company sell their finished article at a fair and reasonable price. The. Commonwealth is to say what a fair and reasonable price is. If the company charge more, we l if t the floodgates and allow the foreign oil of the dear friends of the critics of this Bill, the Shell and the Standard Oil Companies, to come in, and they can wallow in it to their heart's content. It is said that we shall have to pay a greater price for crude oil than is necessary. guarantee against this has been inserted in the Bill. But there is also another, and it is this: That in no circumstances is the price to be greater than the price paid by Britain to the Anglo-Persian Company for crude mineral oil. Surely it will be admitted that there is now a complete guarantee. -Honourable members have seen in this measure the shadow of a menace against exploration for oil in this country and in its Territories. They say, "" If we are to get 200,000 tons of crude oil from Persia, the Anglo-Persian experts will not be very keen on finding oil in Papua."" One honourable member said that the effect of this agreement would be to send up the price of Anglo-Persian shares. There is an old story about the three tailors of Tooley-street that might be applied here; but all I will say is that when we speak of a company with £20,000,000 of capital, and remember that all we are asked to consider is a matter of £250,000, suoh a contention may be dismissed without more ado. The best answer to those who fear that the effect of this agreement will be to retard development and the discovery of oil in Australia or in its Territories is the fact that there is an ample market for Anglo-Persian crude oil all over the world. We believe they will do their best to find oil in Papua. It is an I m perial venture, of which the British Government is paying half the cost. But I say, on behalf of the Government, in order to remove all apprehension, that we shall do two things. First, we shall increase the reward offered to those who find oil in payable quantities, either on the mainland or in New Guinea, or in German New Guinea when we begin to explore there, to the sum of £50,000. Then we shall offer every facility to experts, other than the Persian Oil Company's experts, to explore the mainland I mean Australia-Papua, and German New Guinea. Further, we shall do all things within our power to give breadth, scope, and life to a p.olicy which will insure not only the discovery, but the development of oil when discovered in this great country of ours. I think that what I have said COVOTS most, if not all the ground that has been I have already said that one traversed by those who object, for amy reason, to the BiU. It has heen suggested that the B ill should be referred to a -Select Committee.. What is this Select Committee going to do? to compose it? Who inform its mind ? To whom shall it look for inspiration? I speak not at all, of course, of those higher sources that are open to all poor mortals; but to whom below is the Committee to look? What do we know about oil? as a chastened, humble being, and I say that I know nothing about oil. There are those in this Chamber who know everything, about all things, and I leave them to flounder in the wealth of their knowledge. I speak of ordinary men. If I were on such a Select Committee, I sliould have to inform my mind from reports of previous Com-' mittees on the subject, or to listen to evidence from the Anglo-Persian, the Standard, panies. to in f o rm its mind, and it relies principally o'n. the fact that -what is good enough for B r it a in is good enough for the Commonwealth. above all things, that our present circumstances dare not go on as we are; we dare not, in the face of facts-in the face -particularly of the. fact that, without 'fuel oil; our Navy is ' powerless-allo w this country to remaindependent for -supplies of this thing, which is vital alike to our national safety and economic wel-fare, upon foreign companies. For that reason, I uTge the House, to accept this proposal. One other point before I sit down. It is said that .this Bill will mean the death'knell of the shale-oil industry. 'that utterly.

223,Since We Have Estab,"Mr TUDOB (Yarra) [4.10] IWAR GRATUITY BILL (No. 2). Message recommending appropriation reported. The following paper was presented:Lands Acquisition Act-Land acquired under, at North Fitzroy, Victoria, for Defence purposes. That the House, do now adjourn. During the debate on the Oil Agreement Bill, when the honourable member for ing, the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) made an interjection which I apparently contradicted; though mine was not a direct contradiction, because, the Minister and I were looking at the matter from different points of view. The actual offer, by the Tasmanian Oil Company was £4 10s. a ton; hut, as the Minister explained afterwards, the company asked that the Government should continue the present bounty on oil. The honourable gentleman will remember that the company's offer was set aside by his Department. ' Certain figures and facts, however, were put before him, and he stated that he thought that the Naval Board ought to send to the company the terms of an offer which might be accepted. I should like the honourable gentleman to go into that matter again. ber may not now revive a debate which is closed.' that the Minister for the Navy shall look into this matter again. As far hack as October last, he asked the Naval Board to Bend these terms to the company. I understand that something is. being done, but there has bean too much delay. I believe that the company is Teady to make an offer, to which the Department must give the most careful consideration, because it is very anxious 'to develop its property. Sir JOSEPH CoosI shall look into the matter. cording to the press, the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) interjected yesterday, when I wished to ask a question without notice, that I was casting a reflection on St. Xavier's College. I had no intention of doing that, because I have the greatest admiration for that college. In another newspaper it is reported that certain members on the Opposition side of the chamber interjected that I was adopting low-down electioneering tactics. I have no intention of adopting their methods of electioneering. Mr .SPEAKER-The honourable member is now reflecting on certain honourable members, and I ask him not to do that. I said, and I should like them to withdraw their remarks of yesterday. HadI desired to pursue electioneering tactics I had a splendid opportunity last night, of which I did not avail myself. I asked my question because I think it of urgent public importance that disloyalists shall not he given a chance to instil their opinions into the minds of young Australians. .
