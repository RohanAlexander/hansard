(5) How many parents or care-givers of students in the electoral division of Calwell who approached the broker to participate in the program were unable or unwilling to access suitable tuition. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) and (3) Any student in Victoria who was below the year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003, or who was exempt from the year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003, was eligible for the pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative. The Australian Government does not have the data for eligible students at the electorate level. For postcodes in Melbourne’s north-west, 34 parents/caregivers applied for assistance. Of those, 33 students received tuition and 1 student was not able to be matched to a tutor. (2) Of the 34 students who participated in the pilot Initiative in Melbourne’s north-west, 19 students attended State schools and 15 students attended non-government schools.

Macarthur Youth Commitment (Question No. 3399) Mr Hayes asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on 30 March 2006: (1) Is he aware of the success in south-west Sydney of the Macarthur Youth Commitment’s Transition Brokers Programme. (2) Is he aware that 96% of the participants on the programme are either employed, in education or in training. (3) Is he aware that Macarthur Youth Commitment will be required to cease providing services on 30 June 2006 and that this is likely to leave between 500 and 600 ‘at risk’ clients without any support services to make a successful transition from school to work. (4) What is the reason for replacing the Macarthur Youth Commitment Transitions Brokers programme, which is currently assisting more than 700 clients, with the Youth Pathways programme which has a total of 316 funded clients. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) and (2). Yes. Progress reports provided to the Department of Education Science and Training by Macarthur Youth Commitment indicate that the program has contributed to the outcomes quoted. An evaluation of the program which is being conducted by the Macarthur Youth Commitment is scheduled to be completed by the end May 2006. (3) and (4). I am aware that the Macarthur Youth Commitment recently approached the Government for funding to continue their operations post the end of June this year for a further six months. The Australian Government has implemented Career Advice Australia (CAA). This initiative is helping young people make informed decisions about their future. CAA is a part of the Australian Government’s vision that every young person should find and achieve their potential. The expanded role of Local Community Partnerships under CAA will facilitate assistance for all young people aged 13 19, including the “lesser at risk” cohort of students who have historically received general career advice and information-based assistance under the former Jobs Pathway Programme. The services to be facilitated through Local Community Partnerships include: individual transition plans; career advice; structured workplace learning and advice and information on vocational education; and training pathways and opportunities.",145,Questions In Writing
238,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer toThe facilitation of these support services to all secondary students through schools and Local Community Partnerships under CAA has allowed the new Youth Pathways to focus on assisting those young people who are most at risk of disengaging from education. The replacement of the Jobs Pathway Programme with Youth Pathways reflects the Australian Government’s desire to avoid duplication of effort in assistance for young people across jurisdictions. Participant numbers for Youth Pathways were determined based on a number of factors including the programme budget and the cost of delivering the more intensive personalised case management services. The proportional distribution of the 17,000 participant numbers to each Service Region was based on ABS Census data (unemployed 15-to-19 year old early school leavers). This was the most reliable data available to indicate the distribution of the number of at-risk young people and the most equitable basis on which to allocate the funding and business levels in a nationally consistent way. Transition support services for this area will be delivered by a number of organisations that have been contracted following open and competitive tenders and funding applications. Analysis of the assistance historically provided through the former JPP indicates that 42% received general career information/advice; 25% was job search related and 33% was personalised and customised assistance. Many of the students that used to be supported by JPP and the Transition Brokers could be expected to be assisted under the CAA initiative. In addition, young people (16 year olds who have left school) can now receive employment related assistance from Job Network’s Intensive Support Job Search Training and/or Intensive Support Customised Assistance. Job Network services provide more intensive employment based assistance than was available under JPP. While acknowledging the good work that has been done by the Macarthur Youth Commitment, the Government has increased resources through the services in place under the CAA initiative, and the new Youth Pathways for those young Australians who are the most at risk.
