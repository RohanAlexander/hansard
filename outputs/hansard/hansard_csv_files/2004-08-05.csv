There are 127 schools in Australia almost double-a non-government school, where parents pay fees higher than $9,100 even though both schools have the same who can expect a Labor government to cut number of students. Let us take another example. The smallest Catholic school in my electorate, St Joseph’s in Bulahdelah, had 61 students last year and received combined funding of $311,000 from the state and federal governments. In the meantime, Mount Kanwary Public School in Raymond Terrace, which had 62 students last year, received almost double that amount of funding at $559,000. All schools deserve every cent that they get. But, again, we have an example of a government school receiving more funding than a non-government school even though they have about the same number of students. It is very important to put on the record the funding that is going to the schools in my electorate.

151,Mr Wilkie,"As I said before, thisThursday, 5 August 2004 ----Burke Electorate: Train Accident convey to the parliament about a train accident that occurred at 6.15 this morning in Furlong Road, St Albans. It would appear-and I only have preliminary information-that three people were killed when a car and a commuter train collided at a level crossing in St Albans, in Melbourne’s north-west. Emergency services were on the scene very quickly, apparently, because they had been attending a minor car accident near the crossing when the second car was struck by a Melbourne-bound Sprinter train travelling from Kyneton. There is no doubt that some of the passengers on that train would have been constituents of mine in the electorate of Burke. The accident occurred in the newly constituted seat of Gorton, for which I will be a candidate in the next election. This is certainly a tragic set of circumstances. The passengers in the car were not able to get out in time. The 100 or so people on the train were transferred to buses, but there is no clear information as to whether there were any serious injuries to those passengers. I am aware that the railway line has been closed and traffic is being diverted from the area. There have been concerns about this crossing in recent years. There have been fatalities in the past. A passenger waiting at the station was killed, as I recall. We have been looking at ways to prevent any other serious accidents. I am not aware whether this accident had anything to do with the problems associated with that railway crossing. I hope that was not the case and I hope therefore that the authorities examine-I am sure the coroner will examinethe circumstances of this tragic accident. I just wanted to this morning convey my condolences to the families and friends of those that have died. I will be gaining further information to see whether there were further injuries. It was a tragic accident, and I only hope that we can improve that railway crossing. I hope the weaknesses of the system did not in any way cause this awful accident. Employment: Centacare Chermside Ms GAMBARO (Petrie)-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (9.43 a.m.)-I would like to also pass on my condolences to the family and friends of people who perished in that accident. I join with the member for Burke in my sympathies to all concerned. I speak today regarding the Centacare Chermside office, which celebrated their first year in operation last week. I was happy to join in their celebrations because it was a celebration of not only their success but also their being recently granted a 4½-star rating. They have assisted many hundreds of people who have entered the premises looking for work over the past year. One hundred and ninety people have remained in their jobs for at least three months, or in education for one semester, and that was truly a great milestone.

153,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (9.40 A.m.),"I have some bad news I wanted to the top performers. It is important that we acknowledge that, while they may be 11th, they are top of the list in terms of their star rating, their performance and their outcomes. One of the wonderful things that Centacare has done, because of its close alliance to the Mater Children’s Hospital, is to start a great initiative where it will give $50 for every job vacancy that is filled with a fully eligible Job Network job seeker. Through this initiative they hope to raise some $10,000 for the Mater Little Miracle program. What better way for an organisation to help our sick babies and children than by helping to get hundreds of job seekers in the Petrie electorate working. It has been a truly terrific initiative. It is a great initiative because it is getting people working, it is giving staff and job seekers enormous satisfaction and it is helping the community. I congratulate Centacare on that great initiative. Centacare is also at the forefront with its initiation of a free course for single non-custodial parents. This course is to help men in the Petrie electorate, and in the Browns Plains area in south-west Brisbane, who have separated or divorced from their partner. The breakdown of any marriage can be a traumatic time. It is a terribly isolating experience for men-and particularly so when they do not have custody of their children. The federal government’s Child Support Agency will fund Centacare to enable them to support fathers in the Petrie electorate by providing the four-week course for single non-custodial dads. They have also launched a free course for separated fathers who are out of work and in need of professional support and direction. Centacare family and community services and Centacare Employment are piloting the Fathering After Separation program with funding from the federal government’s Child Support Agency. I commend the Centacare organisation for all the wonderful work that they do in the community. I wish them well in the Job Network front and also in their Centacare fathering program. (Time expired) Australian Greens: Employment Policy policy was launched by Senator Bob Brown and me in Wollongong, a part of Australia where the unemployment rate remains around 10 per cent. The policy outlines a commitment to full employment. A key aspect of this commitment is support for the Job Guarantee initiative, which is an initiative of Professor Bill Mitchell of the University of Newcastle and business and union groups in the Hunter region. This initiative will see the federal government become more actively involved in job creation. As the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s July 2004 survey points out: The living standards of Australians are firmly based on jobs. Our prosperity as individuals, and as a nation, is a product of having jobs and creating more of them … From employment flows economic opportunity and social advantage for our community. Conversely, unemployment is the major contributor to poverty and social disadvantage. This is true, but the ACCI has left something out. There are thousands of working poor in Australia at the moment, and much of this has arisen because of the increasing trend towards casualisation of the work force. The recently released ACTU report on how casual work affects employees, households and communities in Australia highlights this problem. The casual rate now stands at a record high of 27.9 per cent, and this is something that we as a country should not be proud of. MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Statements By Members
154,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (9.46 A.m.),"On 20 July, the Australian Greens employmentWhen we talk about jobs and employment, we must talk about a living wage-adequate wages and conditions so that workers can provide themselves and their families with the basic necessities of life, so that they can have financial security, and so that they can go to work and return home safely at the end of the day. The living wage is something which is easily forgotten-meaningfully or otherwise-in material from organisations such as the ACCI and this government. Buried beneath terms such as ‘increased flexibility’, ‘efficiency improvements’, ‘industrial relations reform’, ‘simpler minimum standards’ and ‘decentralisation of the wage fixing system’ are the harsh realities of lower wages, loss of entitlements and increasing casualisation. Casual work is just that: short term and casual-a stopgap, interim measure which is insecure and transitory. Casual employees do not have access to holidays or holiday pay, long service leave, sick leave, sick pay, maternity leave, appropriate superannuation, financial security, wage increases or staff development programs. Last week, I heard the story of Telstra call centre employees in Wollongong. Permanent employees there are paid approximately $20 an hour with conditions, but the casual employees who sit right next to them, and who are doing exactly the same work, are paid $16 an hour. Some of them are being told that they must work 37½ hours a week, and some of them have been doing this for up to three years-with no holidays, et cetera. This is a disgrace. The flexible workplace the Prime Minister is so proud of is becoming more and more exploitative, denigrating and inflexible. Many of these people are now the working poor. They deserve better and this country can provide them with a lot better. We must strive for full employment in Australia, and we are a long way from it at the moment. Murray Electorate: Indigenous Affairs Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.49 a.m.)-In September 1839, Edward Stone Parker, who was an assistant protector under the protectorate system in Victoria, then a colony, wrote to the government of the day about his concerns about the Indigenous people in northern Victoria. Identifying several important issues, he wrote: The first is the rapid occupation of the entire country by settlers, and the consequent attempts made to deprive the aborigines of the natural products of the country and even to exclude them from their native soil. The entire country of the Waverong and the Witourong tribes with scarcely any exception, is now sold or occupied by squatters. A considerable portion of the country ranged by the Jajowrong and Taoungurong tribes is also taken up by sheep and cattle runs. All the available portions of the tracts that remain will speedily be absorbed in like manner by stock. The very spots most valuable to the aborigines for their productiveness-the creeks, watercourses and rivers-are the first to be occupied. It is a common opinion among the settlers that the possession of a squatting licence entitles them to the exclusion of the aborigines from their runs. This was in 1839. It was just some 10 years later that the Dja Dja Wurrung were in the worse situation that Stone Parker described. They had been pushed from their country. Their grinding stones, the evidence of their canoe trees, their scar trees and their kitchen middens were what remained of their life over thousands of generations. A local squatter, John Hunter Kerr, collected three artefacts amongst many others and sent them to a Paris exhibition that ended MAIN COMMITTEE up in the British Museum. These items have recently been loaned back to the Victorian museum. You can understand the Dja Dja Wurrung’s extreme concern that those items do not again disappear from their immediate custodianship. They understand the problem with museums. It is a bit like the situation with the Elgin marbles. The British Museum is afraid that, if it relents on this issue, there might be an unravelling of its policies that have kept indigenous artefacts over a very long time. But this is a situation where the traditional owners of the Boort area in the heart of my electorate have very little left in terms of their ancestors’ material possessions. To them it is a sacred thing. I ask that the Victorian and British governments act very generously and agree to have materials sent back to the British Museum in order that they be repatriated to this country on permanent loan so that the Dja Dja Wurrung peoples can have access to those materials, can look after them and can teach their children and grandchildren what their traditional culture was all about. Good news has come out of this whole process. Mr Paul Haw and the Lodden shire are now talking to the Dja Dja Wurrung about a permanent collection of what materials are still around in other localities, to have them properly interpreted and protected. This is a good outcome, but I ask the Victorian government to be very sensitive, to assist the Dja Dja Wurrung so they do have something of their past, and to do this as speedily as possible.

A pagoda foundation laying ceremony will be held at the temple on Saturday, 7 August 2004. This ceremony marks the commencement of the second stage of the temple’s development. The blessing will be hosted by Venerable Master Hsing Ting, head abbot of the Foguanshan Buddhist order. Spiritual guidance has been provided at the temple by Honourable Master Yi-Lai. The temple is an inspiration to the people of south-east Queensland. Master Yi-Lai, Reverend Chueh-Shan and all the monks at the Chung Tian temple are enriching our understanding of Buddhism. They are making a wonderful contribution to our society, helping to weave a rich tapestry in a multicultural community. Although the Buddhist presence in Queensland goes back a century, it was not until the completion of the Chung Tian temple in 1993 that local Buddhists could deepen their practice in such a serene environment. One of the most endearing features of the temple is the regular attendance of large numbers of children. To them the temple is a place of learning, worship and fun. It is a very happy and joyous environment. Chung Tian means middle heaven. The temple is a little piece of heaven. More than 100,000 people have visited it. Stage2 of the temple will provide additional space for learning, community gathering and dining. It is hoped that the pagoda will be completed in 2005. The style of pagoda being constructed at the Chung Tian temple has been a feature of traditional Buddhist architecture for more than 1,500 years. I wish to commend all members of the Buddha’s Light International Association of Queensland for all their religious and charitable works. I am very sorry that I will not be able to attend the ceremony: as a father of three, I am committed to a major sporting activity involving MAIN COMMITTEE my children. On behalf of the Australian parliament, I extend best wishes and congratulations to all involved in the Chung Tian temple and the Buddha’s Light Association. We are very grateful for your contribution to our society and our nation. Gilmore Electorate: Education Funding derful announcements which have actually made a dream come true. They range from $10 million to the Shoalhaven campus of the University of Wollongong’s medical school; to $660,000 to what was known as a sea lab, which is now the Shoalhaven Marine and Freshwater Centre; to $15,000 to Nowra primary school for reading assistance. Let me talk about the Nowra Public School reading assistance program, for which Brendan Nelson issued $15,000. It will train teachers to use the program in their classrooms and for training more volunteer helpers. The reading assistance program involves the training of parents and community tutors in running reading assistance sessions. Tutors work in teams, supervised by the school’s learning difficulties teacher. They withdraw students in small numbers from classes and provide daily intensive reading tuition which is continued until students reach a satisfactory level. The average length of time a student is on the program is one term. We have excellent public schools in the Gilmore electorate, and I have always taken a great interest in what our students are achieving. One of the activities that I have always looked forward to is the reading sessions, and I have been honoured to be able to take part in that at the Nowra Public School. Having had some involvement in the program, it is obvious that children who find reading difficult do much better in smaller groups and with extra help along the way. Congratulations go to Mr Clive Robertson, the headmaster of Nowra Public School. I welcome the $15,000 that the Australian government has given it. Last week, $10 million was also given to the Shoalhaven campus of the University of Wollongong’s medical school. That has been a dream come true. This is a real solution for the health needs of the Gilmore electorate. Training doctors from our community, in our community, who will stay in our community will protect and secure GP services in our region. Currently, more than three out of every five doctor visits are bulk-billed in Gilmore. There is every indication that this is increasing with our high representation of children and seniors, who attract the $7.50 bulk-billing bonus under Medicare. There is evidence that doctors end up practising not all that far from where they do their training. It has certainly been one of the difficulties in supplying doctors to regional areas like ours. The University of Wollongong has consistently demonstrated that it is ahead of the pack in adopting innovative approaches with a regional focus, using campuses such as the one in the Shoalhaven and the one in Moss Vale. So it makes perfect sense for this government to build on this five-star record by funding this expansion to the program. I wish to congratulate Vice-Chancellor Gerard Sutton. I also wish to thank the Divisions of General Practice and all our GPs, who were totally united in working on this project. I also want to thank Professor Don Iverson, whose dream it was to have a medical school at the Shoalhaven campus in Gilmore, and Canio Fierravanti-Wells from the university. The work that he did was absolutely superb, and it was a pleasure working with him on this innovative, exciting program. MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Statements By Members

Lyons Electorate: No Dole Program in my electorate last week. That event was the Campbell Town District High School ‘No Dole’ launch and charter signing, which was shared with another local district high school, Cressy. Grade 10 students from both schools have undertaken to sign a charter which states: I willingly commit myself to participate in the No Dole Project which aims to place every Grade 10 student in further education, training or employment by 31 March, 2005. The pledge was a most important milestone for the students who have made this commitment and signals that they mean they are serious in choosing and training for a future and rejecting the need to go onto the dole. With community support, they can achieve their goals and dreams. This need to encourage and mentor young people is at the base of Labor’s ‘Learn or Earn-no third way’ program, and programs and places are being funded to ensure that young people get the best of chances. It is not easy, but I know it is possible. I was educated at the Cressy school, and I know that if I had not found work and had the benefit of many mentors at work I might not have had the success I have had in my work and life. I know the value of this sort of help because it worked for me. The No Dole program is an initiative of the Beacon Foundation, whose mission statement is ‘to influence the attitudes and cultures of Australians so that each young person develops an independent will to achieve personal success for themselves and their community’. They are talking about young people being able to find real jobs, dignity and respect, which can be so lacking if support from both the educational environment and the local business community is not there. This is a real commitment by the students, but it is also a commitment by the supporting adults-those in the schools and training establishments, those in local business and those in the community. This is a very significant program. It binds our young people to our communities, and it binds those communities in support of them into the next phase of their lives. The schools are very committed to a direction that encompasses transition programs to college or TAFE, career learning, and personal confidence and presentation assistance and helps to develop a direction for the future and motivation to achieve these goals. Not everyone is set out for an academic career, but there are many jobs that are meaningful and rewarding and do not require you to be an Einstein. One lad has been given the opportunity to work one day a week on a farm while still in the last months of school so that the transition from school to work can be done seamlessly. He starts his working life with a paid job and continues some training that will enhance his skills through this job. This student has improved his school work, his self-esteem has lifted and he has much more confidence in his dealings with the community. It may be a simple idea, but it is surprising how it has escaped the attention of many communities. I am very impressed with both schools’ efforts to ensure that their students have a proper future. They are fostering a family atmosphere where all community members are valued. MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Statements By Members

158,Mr Adams (Lyons) (9.58 A.m.),"I wish to speak of a very important event that occurredThey believe that this ‘learning for life’ program starts with child care and goes through to further education. Further education allows students to continue their studies through VET courses in community services, hospitality and tourism, and small business management, as well as basic subjects such as information technology, English and mathematics. Campbell Town has changed so much over the last few years. It used to be a little country town which people sped through on the way to somewhere else, and now it is a destination in itself. The community have got to work and made Campbell Town a place to be. In fact, they won a national Can Do Community award in 2003, and I reckon they will be up for more awards this year after the viewing of the transit of Venus that took place in June. Campbell Town school was involved in all this too, which is going to ensure that jobs will be created in and around the town that were never there before. Cressy has now got the challenge to do something similar. The school is ready and the community is geared up, so it was with great pleasure that I participated in this terribly important event. I want to take this opportunity to broadcast their success around Australia and to let people know that Campbell Town and Cressy are can-do schools and can-do communities and indeed are leading the way in our can-do state. I wish all the students who have made this commitment the very best success in the future, and I will be there cheering them on all the way. (Time expired) Environment: Plastic Bags Lyons speaks with all the aplomb of a regular Insiders guest. It is very interesting. campaigns-other than, obviously, my own re-election-or agreeing very easily to give up things, but the campaign to give up plastic bags is one campaign that I did not hesitate to sign up to, to take the plunge and to help get rid of this threat to the environment on our planet. My electorate of Canning is a diverse mix of suburbia and semirural and farming land. We enjoy some of Western Australia’s most beautiful semi-wetlands and have a coastline which is home to hundreds of species of native flora and fauna. Our environment is fragile, and plastic bags are the scourge of modern-day living. I am constantly driving around my electorate, and I despair at the sight of plastic bags on the side of the road or caught in fences, knowing the damage that they can cause to livestock that become entangled in them or that eat them. Plastic bags kill an estimated 100,000 marine animals and birds every year. Local and state governments are spending over $200 million annually on picking up litter that includes plastic bags. Imagine what good use that money could be put to if only we could reduce the usage of plastic bags that may only be used for minutes but will obviously be around in the environment as landfill for many hundreds of years. I am not just paying lip-service to this campaign. Even before I signed up to the pledge to say no to plastic bags I undertook my own campaign to bring this message to my electorate by advertising on the reverse of paper shopping dockets. The message was simple. It did not advocate a political line or advertise a political party; it simply said, ‘Don Randall says no to plastic bags.’ I had been using this message in the Kmart in Armadale and other suburbs in the electorate for several months and was pleased that the public reaction to the campaign had MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Adjournment

161,Mr Randall,"Yes, how do you? I am not a person renowned for signing pledges forbeen very positive. Many people have congratulated me on taking the initiative to get the message out there. I was so pleased with the public reaction to this that I thought I would extend the campaign into other shopping centres in my electorate but was unfortunately told by the advertising company acting for Coles and Woolworths in Mandurah and Kelmscott that the message was too political and they would not let me get my message out there. I had sent my money in and signed the papers to sign on to the shopper docket program for this important message, but they sent my money back. Call me cynical, but I cannot help thinking that some of these large retailers are not fair dinkum in their support of the environment or that they have some other sort of vested interest or hidden agenda. I was also keen to promote the same message along the Albany Highway in Kelmscott by taking out advertising on large billboards with the same message: ‘Don Randall says no to plastic bags.’ But again I was thwarted-not by the advertising company this time but by the owners of the land, the Western Australian state government, through MetroRail, telling me that it was too political. These signs were not going to have any mention of the party that I represent or any other political message but were to say, ‘Don Randall says no to plastic bags.’ We are all guilty-and I certainly am-of using plastic bags, and together in Australia we use 6.7 million plastic bags at checkouts every year. On the weekend of 21 to 22 August, as part of the campaign sponsored by National Science Week and Planet Ark, I urge all Australians to do what I am doing and say no to plastic bags. I will certainly be setting an example. Braddon Electorate: Education Awards Medicare: Services a much more prudent and considered use of plastic bags in Australia. I spoke on this in parliament over 18 months ago, even before Senator Brown started the campaign. It is good to see that people have picked up on an idea that was going around in Braddon a long time ago and to know that we can spearhead important national campaigns, because a good idea in Braddon is a good idea anywhere. Today is a very sunny day outside, fortunately, in Canberra, and in the sunshine of the day I would like to congratulate people. The first people I would like to congratulate are the many teachers, educators and administrators in education in my region in the education districts of Barrington and Arthur who received awards for excellence in teaching and training. I attended one of those awards ceremonies and unfortunately missed the other one, but there were many worthy recipients of these very important awards. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those teachers, administrators and people who work in our schools for the terrific job they do and to congratulate everyone that was an award winner. It certainly is very edifying to appreciate the terrific things that go on in our schools-the innovation, terrific goodwill and dedication. Congratulations to all award winners in the Barrington and Arthur education districts. I would also like to congratulate the community of the central coast in my electorate, and particularly their mayor, Mike Downie, and Independent MLC in the Tasmanian parliament, Sue Smith, as well as the good number of community organisations that have been battling even before 1998 to get a Medicare office returned to that municipality and to be located in MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Adjournment
162,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (10.08 A.m.),"I support the member for Canning’s call forUlverstone. Proudly, I was a central coast councillor before I got into federal parliament and I remember being part of the campaign to have a Medicare office reintroduced into the area. Central Coast Council is, I think, the seventh largest municipality in Tasmania, and Ulverstone is one of the most significant towns on the north-west coast. It has a relatively large older population and a relatively young population as well. They are the two groups that use medical facilities more often than the middle-age range group. What currently happens in the central coast is that, once people have visited the doctor, with bulk-billing in free fall in my district most have to try and get their rebate from Medicare. Unless people use electronic means, and many of them do not, they have to travel to Burnie or Devonport. We do not have a good public transport system between these towns and Ulverstone. Petrol has always been dear in my neck of the woods and many of these families live in the hinterland, so they have a lot of travel to do. They have got to go to Devonport and Burnie to get their rebate, yet there is a very good case that there should be a Medicare office in the central coast area. The government members have been approached on several occasions over a number of years to take up this case, a very worthy case, to introduce a Medicare office for the central coast, located at Ulverstone. Unfortunately they got nowhere with that. I am pleased to say that Labor’s shadow spokesperson for health, Julia Gillard, came to this community, met them, heard their case and promised to go away and consider that case. She has done so, has done the costings and in actual fact returned on 22 July to meet directly with the community. She has pledged that if Labor become the next government, and I truly believe we will become the next government of Australia, a Medicare office will be installed at Ulverstone for the municipality of the central coast. I was very pleased to hear that commitment and I know that Mike Downie, Sue Smith and all the representatives that have put this case for so long have been very pleased by that pledge. My next cause is to take up the case of a Medicare office in Circular Head, but that is a fight for another day. (Time expired) Moncrieff Electorate: Tourism Industry this morning to discuss the importance of an industry that is crucial to the long-term sustainability and long-term employment of the people of Moncrieff and in particular all the people of the Gold Coast. That industry that makes such a valuable contribution to the Gold Coast economy is, of course, the tourism industry. I am pleased to rise to speak on the tourism industry because the Howard government has seen the implementation of the white paper, a mediumto long-term strategy to ensure that the tourism industry not only is sustainable but, importantly, has the opportunity to recover from the blows it has suffered over the past several years. These blows include, for example, the SARS crisis, the collapse of Ansett Airlines, and uncertainty about travel to international destinations. Each one of these has taken its toll on the Gold Coast economy, Gold Coast tourism and hotel operators, as well as restaurateurs, throughout the past four years. Importantly, the Howard government has responded, and it has responded in spades. The new $620-odd million flowing into the tourism industry over the next four years from the Howard government is a concrete investment in the future of the tourism industry. I know that all those people employed in the tourism industry on the Gold Coast stand to benefit directly as a consequence of the increased certainty that is flowing to the Gold Coast tourism sector. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Adjournment
163,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (10.13 A.m.),"I am very pleased to rise in the Main CommitteeInterestingly, yesterday I had the opportunity to attend the TTF Australia forum and the luncheon associated with that. At that lunch I received the most up-to-date data from TTF, which indicates that, in my electorate alone, there are some 9,131 employed in full-time equivalent positions in the tourism industry; some 2,500 in the accommodation, casino and gambling sector; some 1,500 in cafes, restaurants, pubs, clubs and taverns; about 2,300 in the tourism retail sector; approximately 500 in the transport sector as it pertains to tourism; as well as about another 2,500 in a variety of areas associated with the tourism industry. That industry accounts for some 12.6 per cent of employment in my electorate of Moncrieff, and I am pleased-in fact, I am delighted-that the Howard government is ensuring that the future of these people is strong and that the future of these people as a consequence of the tourism white paper is assured. That stands in stark contrast to the future for these 9,100 people if the Labor Party were elected to government. What is very clear is that the Labor Party are certainly making sure that they run a mile from giving any commitment to maintaining the funding that is available under the tourism white paper. To this day the Labor Party are still refusing to commit to providing the $600-odd million to the tourism industry over the next four years. Despite the fact that tourism is Australia’s single largest employer, the Australian Labor Party are seeking to walk away from the funding commitments of the Howard government when it comes to the tourism industry. I say to those 9,100 people employed in the tourism industry in my electorate: ‘Be very wary of the Australian Labor Party and what the Australian Labor Party would do to tourism.’ According to the Australian Labor Party, it is an industry that does not need help; it is an industry that seems to be bubbling along just fine, and that is the reason why among the most concerning of the Labor Party’s policies is their proposal to cut from the white paper some $60 million that would be spent on the See Australia campaign. Domestic tourism is fundamentally important to the people of the Gold Coast and the people of my electorate. Some 60 per cent of our local tourism market on the Gold Coast is from the drive market. And that 60 per cent of local Gold Coast tourism would be directly under threat and, in fact, would not have its future assured in the slightest if the Labor Party were elected. So again I say to the people of the Gold Coast: ‘Don’t dabble with the Australian Labor Party, because the consequence would be $60 million cut immediately from the bottom line of domestic tourism promotion.’ I am a very big supporter of the restaurant and catering industry in my electorate. This morning the Restaurant and Catering Association raised the question of commitment: they say it is vital that the ongoing work of Tourism Australia in the implementation of the tourism white paper continues to focus on domestic tourism and that both sides of politics must sign on to maintaining the domestic tourism role of Tourism Australia and maintaining the much increased funding to tourism. Come on, ALP, do it. (Time expired) Newcastle Electorate: Manufacturing Industry Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (10.18 a.m.)-I rise to speak on a matter of great concern to the people of my electorate of Newcastle, to the Hunter region generally, and to the Australian manufacturing sector as well. A Newcastle company, Varley Engineering, recently missed out on an $18 million Airservices Australia contract to manufacture rescue and response vehicles for Australian airports. This would have been a considerable contract and would have guaranteed 60 direct jobs and an extra 15 apprenticeships in Newcastle, with a flow-on effect of jobs MAIN COMMITTEE for another 180 people, as well as the development of skills and capacity in the region. But instead we now learn that these jobs and skills, and the wealth of this country, will go to an overseas tenderer. I am told that, after two years of work on this tender, Airservices Australia advised Varley-via fax on 1 July 2004; and let me say the manufacturing sector had already heard the answer on the grapevine-that they had missed out and that the successful tenderer was an Austrian company, Rosenbauer International. I assume this contract will now have no Australian content whatsoever. While everyone does expect that a tender process would be competitive, we would also expect it to be open, transparent and fair. We on this side of the House would also expect that it might invest in the country’s skill development, invest in the wealth of this nation in terms of employment prospects and security, and invest in an industry that we would always be trying to make more competitive. That of course is not the case under this government. I thank the shadow minister for industry, innovation, science and research, Senator Kim Carr, for his recent work in my region with manufacturers. We have collaborated on a series of questions that will be put on notice in the Senate today. Those questions raise serious concerns-concerns that we want very serious answers to. It was evident that in this tender a security deposit was required in the documentation, and that was set at 30 per cent of the project value. General practice is usually 10 per cent of project value. I do wonder how SMEs in Australia would find 30 per cent of project value for major projects. To tie up that amount of cash does not sound like good practice to help Australian business prosper. We were also informed that Airservices Australia officials spent no time visiting Varley, one of the two final tenderers. Unless they came covertly overnight, no Airservices officials inspected the Varley group’s sites around Australia. However, it has been suggested that Airservices Australia spent at least four days in Austria visiting Rosenbauer’s sites during the tender process. I am also concerned about the loss of the contract by Varley Engineering, because these vehicles are obviously going to be in greater demand. Defence will be seeking these sorts of vehicles for airport response. The whole Asia-Pacific market has great potential, in a terrorist environment, for us to tender for vehicles around our region, because everyone is increasing their security and response presence at airports and ports. These vehicles require a particular chassis construction to be off-road vehicles. There are concerns held by manufacturers that perhaps Australia is not being assisted to develop that particular capacity. AlthoughI am told by manufacturers that New Zealand has that capacity, Australia is slipping back, unfortunately. So we will be requiring the government to account for Airservices Australia’s actions in their awarding of this tender, and we certainly regret sincerely the loss of skills, jobs and training opportunities, and capacity building for Newcastle and the Hunter region in Australia. The thought of these vehicles rolling off a ship into this country without any Australian content is just appalling. There is another potential opportunity, with Defence replacing all its truck fleet over the next 15 years, but one wonders whether we are going to see more Defence work continually going overseas. Labor does back the call from Australian Business Ltd for the Howard government to implement effective government purchasing, even if it is eight years too late. A Latham Labor government will use government purchasing as a premier industry policy tool to support AusMAIN COMMITTEE tralian industry-like those manufacturers in my region-and the creation of high-skill, highwage jobs. (Time expired) Parkes Electorate: Dubbo Ballet Studio Parkes Electorate: White, Mr Mal school will celebrate its 70th anniversary. One person who is synonymous with the Dubbo ballet school is Mrs Joyce Schneider. It was Joyce’s passion and vision that saw the establishment of a ballet school. She set it up and taught there for many years. In fact, she is still actively involved with the school, although she has sold the studio and retired from teaching. It was Joyce’s vision of a ballet studio devoted to excellence that has allowed many students to fulfil their own dreams. Joyce is a remarkable woman who has managed to this day to keep everybody on their toes. Her services to the community, particularly the arts, have been recognised through several notable awards, including the Citizen of the Year award in 1998, sesquicentenary recognition in 1999 and an Order of Australia medal in 2000. On behalf of the people of Dubbo and the central west of New South Wales, I thank Joyce for her vision and commitment to bringing to Dubbo her love of the performing arts. Her commitment to excellence and her passion for dancing were infectious and will be recognised this Saturday night. Over the past 70 years an incredible 18,000 students have been taught at the Dubbo Ballet Studio, and it is widely regarded as one of the most successful dance schools in regional New South Wales-an accolade to be justly proud of. Time after time the studio achieves excellent results in the Royal Academy of Dance exams and at eisteddfods. Last year, for instance, three performances were awarded a perfect score of 100. This is extremely rare at eisteddfods and something the students, teachers, parents and supporters can be very proud of. Over the studio’s long and illustrious career several students have found success in performing arts careers. This is no easy task. Pursuing a full-time career in the performing arts takes equal measures of grit, determination and dedication. Students who have taken this path include Hayley Farr, who became a soloist for the Queensland Ballet Company and is now under contract to the prestigious San Francisco Ballet. Dwan Attwood followed her dream to become a successful singer, dancer and actress on stage and screen in the United States. Recently two Dubbo ballet students, Kyle Davey and Ella Havelka, were accepted into the Australian Ballet School in Melbourne and are now full-time students. Also studying performing arts in Melbourne is Hollie Hewett, who last year was named the best dancer at the Victorian school of performing arts. Several students have gone on to be teachers. By teaching others they provide a lasting legacy of what the Dubbo Ballet Studio stands for and contribute to the future of Australia’s dance sector. Most students will not make a career in the performing arts, but the confidence, poise and sheer enjoyment gained during their time with the studio is completely beyond measure. They will have a lifelong interest in and appreciation of the performing arts and a confidence in themselves that they would not otherwise obtain. On Saturday night I will join many friends, supporters and past and current students of the Dubbo Ballet Studio to celebrate the success of the performing arts in that town, the students who have realised their dreams, the ones on their MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Adjournment

I also want to draw attention to the Dubbo brass band and the fact that last Saturday night some of us honoured Mal White for 60 years-I repeat, 60 years-of continuous service to the Dubbo brass band. He joined the band in 1944 at the age of 12. In all those 60 years, he has seldom missed a rehearsal or performance, and still makes himself available for public occasions, for performances and, even more importantly than that, for teaching others to play their instruments. Mal White plays the euphonium, but he has obviously learned other instruments over that time. This band has been going for 125 years, so Mal White has been an active member of that band for almost half of its entire existence. Involved in this band are sons and fathers, and grandsons and grandfathers. It is very much a family band. It is, without doubt, one of the oldest existing still functioning gatherings in Dubbo and does a wonderful job. I do not think you will ever hear again of somebody putting 60 years of continuous active service into a band as Mal White has done. Australian Fishing Industry meetings with the Australian fishing industry. Representatives from around Australia were here in parliament conveying to members and senators their concerns about some of the trials and tribulations of the Australian fishing industry. As a Tasmanian and someone with large fishing areas in my electorate, it was pleasing to see Tasmanian representatives here putting forward their case. As honourable members would know, as Tasmania is a rather small state, quite often it is marginalised when it comes to representation on national bodies. One of the concerns that people raised with me and with other members and senators was the fact that large amounts of fish and fish products are being imported into Australia. That is not a bad thing: in this time of free trade, importation of products from overseas should be welcomed as long as we can reciprocate. But the thing that concerned me and fishing industry representatives was the fact that the large supermarket chains-Coles, Woolworths and, to a lesser degree, the IGA supermarkets-are importing fish products from overseas, particularly from China, putting them into their supermarkets and not telling people where they are coming from. Whether this is a fault in the labelling rules and regulations in Australia, I am not too sure. I know that when I get back home tomorrow I will certainly visit my Coles, Woolworths and IGA supermarkets and give the owners and the managers in each of those a bit of a hard time. I will go along and buy some prawns and some scallops, and if they are not labelled Tasmanian or ChineseI would like to know the reason why. I was informed-and I take it on good authority-that Chinese scallops are washed and washed and washed, because there is a presumption in China that people like white scallops. If you taste beautiful Tasmanian scallops you will notice that they are a little bit grey and have wonderful roe on them. It was interesting last night at the cocktail party to note that obviously the chefs had no idea how to prepare scallops: they had removed the roe from all the scallops, which is almost like neutering the poor old scallops. But 30 per cent of the weight of Chinese scallops is water content. If Australian consumers are having scallops that contain 30 per cent water foisted upon them, and the scallops are Chinese and they are not being labelled, it is incumbent upon the IGA supermarkets, Coles and Woolworths to do the fair dinkum thing and MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Adjournment
165,Mr Quick (Franklin) (10.28 A.m.),"Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending a couple ofsay, ‘These are Chinese scallops. These are Australian scallops. Here are the prices. You judge the quality, you judge the taste and you then make up your mind what you are going to buy.’ The two large supermarket chains and the IGA supermarkets are doing exactly the same thing with prawns. When you go and buy them there is no labelling. One of the things I offered to the Tasmanian fishing industry representatives was that I would have a yarn to the managers of the two large supermarket chains to try and have knowledgeable people behind the counter. In many cases there are young people working part time and as casuals who have got no idea about which fish is which. They do not know about the names, the texture and the quality. They are more interested in selling red meat and sausages, getting it out to you and getting rid of the next number in the queue. If we are going to promote our fishing industry around Australia there is a case to be made about quality. It is about labelling. And when you do go and ask about what is there in front of you, it is about having people behind the counter who know what they are talking about, who know the quality and who can actually give you the right perspective. I look forward to doing that when I get back home tomorrow. for Macquarie, on behalf of the Main Committee I would like to recognise the participants of the interparliamentary study group. You are welcome today and I certainly hope that your program is a very successful one. Environment: Hawkesbury River of $250,000 to extend the work of some weed harvesters on the Hawkesbury River in my electorate. I thank the government for their quick response to help us out with this urgent local problem. Members might remember that I have spoken in this place before about this issue. Over the last summer and through this year we have had a massive outbreak of a noxious aquatic weed, Salvinia molesta-the largest outbreak, in fact, in the Southern Hemisphere. There are a number of reasons for this: the high nutrient levels in the river, exacerbated by the drought, the low water flow and the unusually high temperatures. In ideal conditions, Salvinia molesta doubles in biomass every 24 hours. During the infestation, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of this aquatic weed blocked navigation in parts of the river and prevented waterskiing and many other aquatic sports that previously occurred there. Members might remember that, in March of this year, the Prime Minister announced $300,000 towards addressing this problem, and this was matched with a commitment by the New South Wales government of another $300,000. With that $600,000 we were able to hire three weed harvesters which have been working at removing the weed from the river. Over the past few months they have done a tremendous job. However, given that winter temperatures were higher than expected, the length of time needed to do the job properly has blown out. I went to the government to ask for a further commitment of money to extend the work of these weed harvesters, and I am very pleased that last week the government announced they would grant another $250,000. This was matched immediately by the state government, so there is another half a million dollars to extend the work of the weed harvesters. This will allow, first of all, the removal of the remaining weed and, secondly, trials for biological controls. They will trial a weevil that eats the salvinia and prevents its multiplication and expansion. These weevils have been successful in other areas, particularly in warmer climates, and the MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Adjournment

167,Mr Bartlett (Macquarie) (10.34 A.m.),"Last week the government announced a grantcatchment management authority will use this example as a pilot to see if we can get this weevil to work in this case. Some limited spraying will also be undertaken in areas that are less accessible. The important thing is that the area requiring spraying is smaller than it would otherwise be because we will have another month or several weeks to remove most of the weed that is still there. In the short term, we are working hard to remove this mass of salvinia; however, it does highlight longer term issues. The salvinia outbreak is a symptom of a much larger, more fundamental, long-term problem with the Hawkesbury River, and that problem has two sources. One is the extremely high levels of nutrients flowing into the river. There are some 30 STPssewage treatment plants-in the catchment flowing into the Hawkesbury River system and these are discharging nutrient-loaded effluent into the river. Sadly, at times of low water flow, discharged effluent can account for up to 80 per cent of the flow of the river-which is not a pleasant thought. So we need programs long term to reduce the levels of effluent discharge entering the Hawkesbury River. The state government really does need to take this issue seriously. We need better use of constructed wetlands and we need more integrated approaches to using grey water and recycling to reduce the demand for water out of the river. The second fundamental issue is the question of the volume of flow. For environmental reasons, there has been inadequate flow to flush out the river, particularly in times of drought, as we have had in the last couple of years; thus the relative loading of nutrients is much higher than usual. With Sydney’s population growing by approximately 1,000 people a week, we need to address Sydney’s long-term water needs so that we are not so dependent on the Warragamba Dam and the Hawkesbury River. This would allow more water to flow down the river to flush out the nutrients and maintain the environmental health of the river. This does require long-term planning. We need an integrated approach that involves the state government-they are the prime carriers of responsibility for this-with input from the federal government, local councils, Sydney Water and the Sydney Catchment Authority. The health needs of the Hawkesbury River must be addressed as a matter of priority because Australia’s largest population is based in this area and is dependent on the health of this catchment. We need to do something about it. For some time now I have been advocating an integrated approach by government and all the major stakeholders to improve the health of the Hawkesbury River system for the sake of us all. Aviation: Bankstown Airport liminary draft master plan for Bankstown Airport, which gives their vision of the way Bankstown Airport should operate in the next 20 years. The reason that Bankstown Airport Ltd have done it, and not the federal government, is that the federal government sold the lease on the airport before it had worked out a plan for how Bankstown is to be used in the future. The expectation of most people in Bankstown was that this master plan would not dramatically change the way things happen in Bankstown. On the briefings that I got from Bankstown Airport Ltd, I did not expect any major change; I expected that this general aviation airport would continue to operate in the way it had operated in the past. I understood that the one thing they were looking for was an extension of the runway by 200-odd metres in order to send freighters out of Bankstown Airport fully laden. However, here today-as I did in a press release recently-I absolutely condemn the fundamentals of this plan. MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Adjournment
168,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (10.39 A.m.),"Bankstown Airport Ltd have just released the preThe demand for a 220-metre extension to the runway is matched by the consideration that they want to strengthen that runway so that it could regularly take not 20-tonne loads, as it has taken historically, but 50-tonne loads. The thrust of this draft master plan is that regular passenger transport operations should be introduced to Bankstown Airport. When you look at the figurings for the future, you see that that would knock out most of the general aviation operations that are the core of Bankstown Airport’s current operation. This is the biggest business in Bankstown. This is the fundamental heart of our industrial activity. General aviation training and general aviation bring income from all over the world into Australia. It is the very engine of our economy in Bankstown. What the draft master plan would seek to do is to supplant general aviation with regular passenger transport services-jet and turbo-prop. What this plan does not seek to do at all, as the government has never sought to do, is to write out 737s and above using Bankstown Airport for the whole of the future and certainly for the next 20 years. The minister for aviation needs now, given that he has never done it before, to specifically prohibit by regulation any code 4C aircraft-717s, 737s and above-from ever using Bankstown Airport, because of its proximity to Kingsford Smith airport. He should refuse, if he is still the minister when this comes to his desk, to countenance a master plan that would put our airport security at risk and our national security at hazard. Clearly, 100-passenger aircraft, turbo-prop or jet, running out of Bankstown Airport-26 kilometres from the General Post Office in Sydney-do not have the same restrictions that aircraft running out of Kingsford Smith have in terms of airport security; they have the same kinds of restrictions that are in country airports in New South Wales. You could load up those jets or turbo-props with up to 100 passengers, and it would be possible for them to be used as those planes were used in New York: as flying bombs, to fly into either Kingsford Smith or targets in the city. Bankstown Airport does not have the security apparatus to deal with large regular transport activity. The proponents of this say that they do not want Bankstown Airport to become Sydney’s second airport, but it is clear that they want the money from the passengers on seats in regular passenger transport. They want to bring a new activity that Bankstown Airport has never seen. I completely reject this on behalf of my constituents in the electorate of Blaxland. Historically, people have by and large supported Bankstown Airport’s operation, but they do not want it extended and they do not want it dramatically expanded. Six thousand people turned up at Bankstown Paceway to protest against the federal government’s attempt to turn Bankstown Airport into an overflow airport for Kingsford Smith. They do not want the jets, they do not want regular passenger transport and they do not want to be fooled into this airport being changed over the next 20 years. It is time the minister for aviation totally ruled out those larger jets, and it is time he gave an indication that he would not be adopting this kind of plan for Bankstown Airport. (Time expired) Cook Electorate: Kurnell Peninsula development with regard to the protection of the Kurnell Peninsula, which is in the eastern extremity of my electorate. As members would be aware, the Kurnell Peninsula is the place where Captain James Cook and the crew of the Endeavour first landed in 1770. It is the site where Captain Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet had their first encounter with the Indigenous population. The Kurnell Peninsula is a place of great natural beauty and contains over 95 per MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Adjournment
169,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.44 A.m.),"I wish to draw the attention of the chamber to a recentcent of the remaining salt marsh habitat in the Sydney Basin and more than 50 per cent of the remaining mangroves. It provides a home for many threatened or endangered species as well as migratory birds from as far away as Siberia and Russia. On 18 May this year I nominated the Kurnell Peninsula for protection on the Natural Heritage List under the new provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999. This listing is currently being considered by the independent Australian Heritage Council. Many local residents took the opportunity to lodge submissions with the Heritage Council as to why this listing should go through. It is unfortunate that the New South Wales Labor government does not take seriously the protection of this environmentally sensitive and historically and culturally valuable area. The New South Wales government has recently written to the Sutherland Shire Council and other interested bodies to notify them that it intends to amend Sydney Regional Environmental Plan 17. SREP 17 was instigated in 1989 by the then Liberal Greiner government, of which I was a member. SREP 17 called for the phasing out of sandmining at Kurnell as a priority. Since SREP 17 was passed, there has been no action of any type to protect or phase out sandmining at Kurnell. Indeed, it does not look as though a phase-out is likely under the existing government in New South Wales. The proposed changes to SREP 17 include some measures which, though long overdue, will be of some limited benefit to Kurnell. However, the devil is in the detail. The proposed changes to SREP 17 contain two areas which give me grave concern for the future of this area. Firstly, the section which deals with sandmining only proposed to halt sandmining operations and does not contain an end date. This means that applications for further sandmining are still acceptable and it is business as usual. An application merely needs to contain a date that it will stop. The date could be in two, five, 10 or even 50 years from now, although scientists question whether there will be any sand left after 2011. It is interesting to note that the New South Wales government is working with Rocla Limited-one of three sandmining companies that are working the neck of the peninsula-to complete an application to extract a further 4.5 million tonnes of sand from Kurnell. The New South Wales minister responsible for the Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Natural Resources, Craig Knowles, had the courage to write to the local newspaper, the Sutherland Shire Leader, to inform local residents that his government wants only the best for Kurnell. If this is truly the case, if Labor really wants to protect this beautiful area, why doesn’t the minister just pick up his pen and stop sandmining this area? The New South Wales government assumed the powers of the consent authority for all sandmining and development on the peninsula some years ago when the shire council tried to stop the destruction of the area. The other area in the proposed amendment which gives me cause for concern is the provision to allow for light industrial and residential development on areas previously subject to sand extraction. For some years, the New South Wales Minister for Planning has had on his desk a contentious proposal by the development company Australand for the development of 500 homes and villas on the peninsula. This development is located on the site of one of the very last remaining sand dunes, now known as Australand dune. This site is also located adjacent to the habitat of the green-and-gold bell frog, which is a species listed as endangered under the New South Wales statute. This amendment to SREP 17 is nothing short of development by stealth. It is a green light to Australand that Labor is willing and ready to sign on the MAIN COMMITTEE dotted line and let them press ahead with their plans for these homes eight months after they got the green light to build factories on the remainder of their site. I am bitterly disappointed that Labor in New South Wales has not used this review of SREP 17 to spell out once and for all the end to sandmining and development on our nation’s birthplace. For far too long, the New South Wales government has sat on its hand watching what is arguably our most valuable historical and cultural site be carted away by the tonne. It is clear to me that shire residents want this area conserved, protected and restored. We want this area to be given the respect and protection that our nation’s birthplace deserves. Maribyrnong Electorate: Transport Infrastructure ate, a tragedy occurred. It involved a V/Line country train striking a motor vehicle on a level crossing at Furlong Road in St Albans. Three people have been killed in this tragedy and I extend my condolences to the families of the three victims. My thoughts are also with the train driver; we are aware of the trauma that train drivers experience in this sort of situation. And our thoughts are with the emergency service personnel who have had the most unenviable task of attending the scene of this tragedy. It is obviously not appropriate to talk about the particular circumstances of the accident so soon after it occurred, but I think it is appropriate to talk about the context in which the tragedy occurred. This is a rapidly growing part of Melbourne. It is an area with rapid population growth, with new estates opening up. That has significantly increased the volume of motor vehicles on local road networks. It is also an area where there has been a significant increase in rail movements. The electrification of the suburban network a number of kilometres beyond this point to the north and west has resulted in increased train movements on this section of track. It is also a section of track that is most important for country train movements. Indeed, as I said, the train that struck the car this morning was a country train. The train track services a very large section of the north and west of Victoria. The state government in Victoria has announced its intention to grade separate the Furlong Road crossing and to fund other works in the region to address the problems. I have always believed that a more fundamental solution is required, involving the lowering of a significant section of the track-not just to grade separate at Furlong Road but also to grade separate further to the north and west along this line. There are other crossings-particularly the Main Road, St Albans level crossing-which also unfortunately are tragedies waiting to happen. Such creative work in grade separation, utilising the funds that the state government has already earmarked for work along this section, could be supplemented with a more ambitious project to attract private sector commitments to works because of the air rights that would be created over sections of the railway line if the lowering were to occur. This is also a situation where, in the context of the Commonwealth’s AusLink policy, there is a need for the Commonwealth to look at ways in which it can creatively collaborate with Victoria in an ‘integrated approach’-to use the words of the member for Macquarie, talking about environmental matters-to solving problems which both the Commonwealth and the state have responsibilities for in relation to land transport. As I said, I do not think there is any doubt that this particular problem is an area where the state of Victoria needs to provide the lead. But it is entitled to look to the Commonwealth to collaborate with it creatively in addressing the fundamental problems. In order to address the MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Adjournment
170,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (10.49 A.m.),"At about 6.15 this morning in my electorstrategic problems of land transport in the area, we need to look to the Commonwealth to move forward much more rapidly with the Deer Park bypass proposal which is outlined in the AusLink document recently produced by the minister but which needs to be brought forward significantly more quickly than the minister is talking about. We need to look at opportunities to significantly upgrade the capacity of the Western Ring Road through this part of Melbourne. It is primarily a Commonwealth road: it was funded in sections-particularly this section-as a 100 per cent Commonwealth project. As I said, this is an area of rapid population growth in Melbourne. It is an area where land transport routes are not just important for the economy and society of the north-west of Melbourne but also crucial for large tracts of provincial Victoria. This is the area through which the main networks servicing Bendigo and Ballarat-and right up to Mildura-pass. This is an area where we are entitled to ask the Commonwealth, through the AusLink process, to creatively and collaboratively work with Victoria and thereby minimise the prospects of further tragedies such as that which has occurred this morning. Child Support Agency talked about the arrogant, jackboot approach, the abuse of constituents’ rights and the abuse of legislative procedures of the Child Support Agency. I did not get to finish my second example but I am going to refer to it now and then raise another abuse by the Child Support Agency of one of my constituents that I received information on last night in my office. I want to make the point that I believe it is disgraceful that the Child Support Agency and indeed Centrelink treat clients and their legitimate, lawful concerns with such arrogant disregard and disrespect. Should the CSA’s investigation of the court documents that I talked about last night find that my constituent is required to pay the amount of child support then I would be pleased to support the decision. However, until these ongoing issues are resolved, I request that this money be returned to my constituent with a full written apology from the Child Support Agency. I am talking about $9,000 illegally confiscated or garnisheed from his bank account in an environment where the 28-day objection period that the CSA is required to give my constituent was abused, because the money was handed straight over to his wife without him being given the opportunity in the 28-day period to prove that what it did was illegal. I have to say, too, that failure to give the two constituents I am talking about a written apology will force me to expose, as I am doing today, how I believe CSA has illegally usurped a decision made by a court and how, unlawfully and without due diligence for the rights of individual, it has confiscated by way of garnishee $9,000 from the bank account of that individual and has given that money to another person without lawful or indeed legislative proof that the money was lawfully owed to that other person. Let me go to the problem that I received notice of last night. My office yesterday received a phone call from a constituent, a female 60 years of age, complaining about her treatment by the Child Support Agency. This constituent lost her son, who committed suicide in June this year in what she considers to be partly the result of the CSA hounding him for payments. She was very concerned then that the CSA asked her by letter to contact them after his death. When she did contact them by phone, they asked her for personal details, her date of birth, which she refused to give out. My constituent feels that they are going to hound her for payments and does not trust the agency at all. MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Adjournment
171,Mr Schultz (Hume) (10.54 A.m.),"Last night in the adjournment debate in the HouseILeaving aside the trauma and the distress that it is causing to this particular lady, I will go on and talk about what flowed from there. After contacting the CSA, my office was told that what happens is that if the payer dies, as in this case, the CSA will then chase up any outstanding payments by suing the estate of the deceased. If the mother was the executor of the estate, which seems to be the likely case, they would then seek to recover any costs before the deceased’s assets are distributed. My constituent is not liable for any costs, ongoing or owing, but if her son left her his car, for instance, this would have to be sold to pay any outstanding debts to the CSA before it could be given to her. Ultimately the issue is the CSA requesting the mother to ring them while in her grief and then demanding her personal details. Why would this be necessary? She does not owe any money to the agency and is not personally liable for any amounts which might be owed by her son. In closing, I say that responsibility of ministers of the Crown and parliamentary secretaries to make departments and officers accountable is paramount. If there is no will, if there is no strength, if there is no commitment and, more importantly, if there is no personal knowledge of management skills, then this abuse of power by CSA will continue. I am not prepared to allow this to continue. I will speak to my constituents and if need be will put them in front of cameras and microphones to educate the community about this abuse of people’s rights and the inappropriate, illegal use of power by CSA officers. The very strong point I am making here today is that I am no longer going to tolerate the sort of nonsense by any department, any bureaucrat or any employee of a department that deprives my constituents of their rights and abuses their role in the community as law-abiding people fulfilling the obligations that they have under the legislation. Agriculture: Dairy Industry Agriculture: Apple and Pear Industry ture, the member for Corio, Gavan O’Connor, in my electoral district and we met with a number of key groups in the agricultural sector to discuss Labor’s approach in these areas. The message came through loud and clear that ordinary people who are employed in or who run businesses in the agricultural sector are fed up to the back teeth with the Howard government. People are frustrated with the lack of initiative, the lack of effort, the lack of interest from the Howard government in this important part of the national economy. We met with a couple of different groups of dairy farmers and set out our approach in relation to creating a better and fairer trading system for dairy farmers, who at present are having a terrible time with a very low milk price, which is something that is driving a large number of dairy farmers out of the industry. Ordinary dairy farmers are very plain about their plight right now. They are very upfront and very straightforward about what they think of the current trading system, where basically they get told a milk price by the dairy company or the milk cooperatives and, even though they understand that that milk price will send them into debt or will send them quite possibly bankrupt or out of the industry, they have no choice, no negotiation in relation to that. Labor have come up with a better approach, which seeks to introduce some negotiation and, where there cannot be an agreement, to put in place a compulsory mediation system to try to create some fairness and some dialogue in this key industry between the milk suppliers and the processors. That is what we want to see: a fair system that will ensure that the dairy MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Adjournment

The shadow minister for agriculture and I also met with a group of orchardists from around the Pakenham district. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I know that you and the other representatives from Tasmania take a great interest in this issue. People in the apple and pear sector are very frustrated indeed-and that is the understatement of the century-with the Howard government’s approach to the draft import risk assessment in relation to the importation of apples from New Zealand. Just to repeat what the issue is here, everyone understands, it seems, except for Warren Truss, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, that bringing apples from New Zealand into Australia would create an extraordinary risk to the apple and pear sector because of the rampant presence of fire blight in the New Zealand apple and pear industry. We do not want to see that disease come into Australia. We are proud of our fire blight free status and we understand that it has a lot of economic benefit for the apple and pear sector in Australia. In many cases, as you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, people have been running these orchards for three and four generations. They have worked their guts out and made a great contribution to their local communities and to the local economy, where they have employed hundreds-and in Tasmania, I am sure, thousands-of people over many years. It is an industry with an enormous potential for export. They are doing a bit of export now, but the industry has great potential for further export market development. All of this will be undermined, all of this will be ruined, if we have a situation where the Howard government allow the importation of apples from New Zealand. Why would they do that? I always understood that it was the role of the Australian government to stand up for the Australian national interest. I cannot understand for the life of me why the Howard government are acting as agents for the New Zealand apple and pear growers. I thought the Australian government were supposed to be there for Australian people, not for people from another country. I say to the Howard government today: let us get this right. Let us see the Howard government admit that they have made an enormous mistake over 3½ to four years in their handling of this process and then start a new import risk assessment process for apples from New Zealand which is based only on science. Marriage House for the National Marriage Forum organised by the Australian Christian Lobby. I want to record my congratulations to Jim Wallace from the lobby and Warwick and Alison Marsh from the Fatherhood Foundation for their work and for combining with other groups to form the National Marriage Coalition. With less than three weeks notice, the forum saw people with a passionate view about the institution of marriage come from all over the country. I was pleased to offer my support to the forum and for the values it seeks to espouse in our society. It comes at a time when the parliament is still to pass the amendments to the Marriage Act. One thing resonated above all else yesterday: the undeniable fact that the marriage of a woman and a man is more than financial and even transcends procreation. The marriage of a man and a woman is sacred. For those who look to the Judaeo-Christian faith underpinning MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Adjournment
173,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (11.04 A.m.),"Yesterday over 1,000 people came to Parliamentour values, this is paramount. But it is also a perspective widely accepted in non JudaeoChristian faiths. I know the forum yesterday was heartened by the press release from the Islamic community also supporting the traditional interpretation of marriage. I am not going to suggest that, as a result of being underpinned by our faith, all marriages are infallible. Marriages fail, and for many that often leads to the greatest regret and disappointment in their lives. But the fact that some marriages fail and that that leads to some people exploring alternative models of union cannot be used to advance an argument against enshrining in law a definition of marriage. In some instances same-sex couples may live together. They may love each other and be happy. I respect them, as I hope they would support my choices in life. But, because I accept the reality of an alternative lifestyle, surely that should not be confused with an endorsement of it being enshrined in our legal definitions of marriage. The respect that we have for marriage is well-established in our culture and has long been accepted as a given, yet it has never been definitively formalised in law. The definition of marriage through the national parliament is extremely important. It establishes a clear and unambiguous legally recognisable definition which can be relied upon, particularly by the judiciary. In my opinion it would be grossly improper for an issue of this kind to be left to the courts to decide. WhilstI have the utmost respect for the judiciary, I am sure they will acknowledge that definitions of this nature are best left to the legislature. If we were to leave this definition for the courts to decide, future generations would reflect on this point in our history and feel betrayed. That is unacceptable. The second point I would like to make relates to the importance of marriage in raising children and its role in strengthening the fabric of society. The benefits children get from their parents living together, through the ups and downs, the highs and lows, cannot, in my opinion, be replicated. Whilst those of us who are separated and have failed marriages strive to do our utmost for our children, it never does replace the original family unit of having mum and dad together. Where children are conceived and born into the care of their loving married parents, that is the best scenario for all concerned. Of course there are extenuating circumstances where that is not always possible. However, despite the claims of some individuals and contrary to their aspersions, this actually still does occur: believe it or not, happily married couples are raising children in homes right around Australia today. AndI know that others, who have had failed marriages, are trying to do exactly the same thing. I wish to reaffirm my belief that the union of man and woman in holy matrimony, living as a family with their children, is an institution that belies all critics. This leads me to my final point. A society ought to be judged by the respect it shows for its institutions. These institutions help define who we are and certainly play a part in determining where we are going. They give otherwise despondent members of society hope and comfort. They provide us with direction and a sense of purpose. Our schools now teach the importance of acceptance and tolerance. Our children are taught to appreciate that we are a diverse nation and that we stand as a bastion of democracy and freedom. I believe there is one question that governments ought to ultimately be judged on. That is: is the fabric of the nation stronger than it was when it we were elected? In my opinion, inserting a definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman will embolden an instituMAIN COMMITTEE tion that I respect and that our nation relies upon for the stability of relationships and the upbringing of our children. Burke Electorate: New Electorate of Gorton comments on the changes that have occurred as a result of an electoral redistribution in Victoria. As you know, I am currently the member for Burke. Under the redistribution, the electorate of Burke is to be abolished and large parts of it are to go into six different electoral divisions. There is a new division being created, the electorate of Gorton. During this period I am trying my best to represent the constituents of Burke-that is my first responsibility; I continue to do that and hopefully I am doing that effectively-and, at the same time, I am acquainting myself with the new areas that I seek to represent and which, if I am lucky enough to be elected to that seat at the next election, I will represent. There are some significant differences between the current electorate and the new electorate that I will seek to represent after the election. The electorate of Burke is a rural seat with some metropolitan areas, whereas the new electorate of Gorton encompasses the western suburbs of Melbourne. There are differences in demographics beyond just the rural-suburban change. The constituents of Gorton in general are ethnically more diverse. Indeed, it will be one of the most multicultural electorates in Australia. More than 50 per cent of households in that area speak a language other than English in their home. That is not to say that they do not speak English, but they speak another language as well. That is an extraordinarily high proportion of households. That shows how diverse and how ethnically rich the region is. I have had the great fortune in the last 12 months of meeting with many of the leaders of the different ethnic communities in the new electorate. I have been to Maltese functions. RecentlyI was at a Greek elderly citizens day at which they were celebrating not only the fantastic soccer win in the European Cup, which was definitely a David and Goliath story, but also anticipating the success of the forthcoming Olympics, which will be back in their original home in Athens in a few weeks. I had a great time there. I have also been invited to and attended Croatian, Serbian and Vietnamese functions. I see my responsibility as the Labor candidate for Gorton to be to look after the generic and general matters that all constituents face-whether it be issues affecting health or education services in the area or other matters such as transport infrastructure. I am happy that the shadow minister for transport was able to announce recently our commitment to the construction of the Deer Park Bypass, which contrasts favourably with the current government, which unfortunately failed to fully fund that very important piece of infrastructure. I think such things are the critical matters, but I also think it is important for me to represent and recognise the leaders of the ethnic communities in the area. They are Australians, but they are proud of their heritage, as we all are. I am an Australian first and foremost, but I am proud of my Irish background. They have the same affinity and pride when it comes to their own backgrounds, so I am very happy that hopefully I will soon be representing that diverse area. This SaturdayI have been invited to the Abruzzese Night. Abruzzese is a province of Italy. I will be going to that function at the Italo-Australian Social Club.

This is especially so because we have one of the fastest growing regions anywhere in the country. The demand on health services has grown considerably and is rapidly increasing. When I came to office the Labor Party had done very little in our local area on the issue of health. When I was elected three years ago as the member for DicksonI inherited from the previous, Labor member the problem of a serious shortage in the number of doctors, with local residents having to drive long distances to access hospital services. Attracting new doctors and fighting for proper health services in our local area has been and remains my priority. In Pine Rivers, we are proud of the fact that we have attracted 18 new doctors under the Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme. This was an initiative of the Howard government and has provided financial incentives for doctors to relocate to areas like Pine Rivers. It should be noted as part of my speech here today to the Main Committee that 18 is the most significant number of doctors attracted to any region across the country. I want to take this opportunity to say, on behalf of the people of Pine Rivers, that we are grateful to those doctors for relocating to our local community; but we also want to say that we need more doctors. We need more of their friends to join us in the Pine Rivers Shire. The growth in the number of young families and older Australians making Pine Rivers their home means that we need more doctors and health services. Anyone who knows the north side of Brisbane would understand that we are desperately in need of hospital based services. Currently, we have Prince Charles Hospital at Chermside, as well as Redcliffe and Caboolture hospitals. We are told by the state government in Queensland that these hospitals are all we need for the north side-that, despite all the current and projected growth, there is no need for a new hospital. Again today I want to put on the record my strong disagreement with that position of the state government in Queensland. When you look at the thousands of new homes being built in places like North Lakes and the surrounding suburbs in the adjoining electorate of Petrie, as well as developments in the Caboolture Shire, it becomes clear that demand on Redcliffe and Caboolture will be overwhelming in years to come. There is no doubt that developments in areas like North Lakes will take up any services that are provided by the Redcliffe Hospital and indeed Caboolture Hospital. To suggest to the people of Pine Rivers that they should access services out of Redcliffe or out of Caboolture is an insult to the people in my local community. I believe that as local community leaders we must be planning for the future of our local area. I am passionate about continuing to deliver services to the people of Dickson, and if we are serious about planning for the future of Pine Rivers then our plans must include the provision of a public hospital. This is an issue for which I have been fighting for some time and I must say that I am at the point now where I am totally frustrated by the stonewalling by the state health ministers and the state government in Queensland. MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Adjournment
175,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (11.14 A.m.),"Health is an issue important to all of us who live inIn May 2003, in response to a survey that I sent to my electorate, I received overwhelming support for the provision of health services in the form of a public hospital in the Pine Rivers Shire. The people of the Pine Rivers Shire support my position and they believe very strongly, as I do, that we need to start planning for a Pine Rivers hospital. There is no suggestion that a Pine Rivers hospital could be built overnight; there is of course the realisation that it would take many years for the provision of such a service. But we need to understand that the demand is there, the future growth in the Pine shire will be phenomenal, and it will not be met by the services that can be provided out of Redcliffe or Caboolture hospitals or, for that matter, the Prince Charles Hospital. One of the big concerns that we in the Pine shire have is about transport issues, again because of the phenomenal growth. To ask people, particularly older people, to travel long distances to hospitals outside the shire is, in my view, unacceptable. I want to put on the record today that I have written to the respective state health ministers on several occasions, including 7 August 2003, 7 October 2003 and 8 December 2003, and we have followed up with a number of phone calls in the intervening period. I wrote again on 12 July 2004-still no reply. This is despite advice from Queensland Health’s Data Services Unit that information has been prepared for me as part of this debate and as part of our argument for this service, but-for whatever reason-the Beattie government are refusing to release that information. I call on them today to release that information and to get serious about providing health services to the people of Pine Rivers. (Time expired) Trade: Free Trade Agreement Five Dock in my electorate of Lowe on 27 January this year, he met with Five Dock pharmacist Mr Mathew Massasso to discuss Mr Massasso’s concerns about the impact the AustraliaUnited States free trade agreement would have on Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Critically, Mark Latham also announced that day that the 1,100-page text of the FTA would be referred by Labor to a Senate committee for calm and rational investigation and that Labor’s support for the FTA would be confirmed only when the benefits of the agreement were clear. In contrast, the Howard government immediately and shamefully placed a gun to our heads, and the head of any Australian who had any questions or doubts about the agreement, and called for unconditional support for this agreement, sight unseen. Moreover, the Prime Minister insisted that, if the ALP did not give it unconditional support, we were anti-American and opposed to Australia’s alliance with the United States-an absurd and offensive claim that the government is still making to this very day. This week a Senate inquiry reported that the overall package of the FTA is marginally in Australia’s interest. Labor understand its net economic benefit for Australia is estimated at $53 million-and, on this basis, it should be supported. We do not want Australia to pass up the chance to trade with the world’s largest and most dynamic economy, with increased twoway investment flows which would be of long-term benefit to Australia. However, critically, the same Senate committee, which includes members of the government, unanimously raised genuine concerns about protecting the regime that ensures that all Australians have access to affordable medicines-namely, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme-and about protecting Australian culture by guaranteeing local content rules. Unfortunately, the Howard government MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Adjournment
176,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (11.19 A.m.),"When federal Labor leader Mark Latham visitedhas failed to negotiate the best deal to safeguard the PBS and local content for free-to-air television. These concerns have been raised by many of my constituents, and I would like to thank many of my constituents who have taken the trouble to let me know their concerns about the FTA-including Dr Gavan and Mrs Judy Young from Abbotsford; Martin Lester from Burwood; Charles and Joy Jago, Sister Mary Britt, Peter Molony, Nancy Walker and Steven Smith from Concord; Geoffrey Brown from Concord West; Trish O’Neill, Margaret Pridham, Patricia Taperell and Elizabeth Mars from Croydon; Gary Lennan and Frouke de Reuver from Croydon Park; Hilary Ivery from Drummoyne; Margaret Phillips and Mona Helal from Enfield; Therese Campbell from Haberfield; Bernard Quinn from Homebush; Anna Logan from Homebush West; and Dr Neville Andersen from Strathfield. Labor have said that we will allow the FTA through the parliament only if the government addresses key concerns to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Australian media content on free-to-air television. In January the government said improved sugar exports must be part of the deal but it backflipped on that. The government has already accepted Labor’s amendment on local content on free-to-air television-a second backflip. Today we are asking the government to listen to the concerns of my constituents and support legislative amendments that will protect the PBS while still allowing the agreement to take effect. A third backflip to protect the PBS is, in my view, not too much to ask. The amendments will protect the PBS by preventing and penalising drug companies that try to block cheaper generic drugs coming onto the market by lodging spurious patent claims. The validity of patent claims would be determined by a court. From day one of the FTA negotiations, Mark Latham has acted responsibly and unambiguously in the interests of the Australian people. In contrast, the Howard government has been myopic and full of bile. Labor’s position has already achieved changes that ensure the FTA protects Australian culture. We now wait for the Howard government to stop the ridiculous claims, cease trying to deceive the Australian people and next week accept Labor’s amendments to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the interests of all Australians. Transport: New South Wales Rail a.m.)-When people ask me what my constituents are concerned about, I am reminded of that scene which I think was from The Elephant Man. The guy puts his head in his hands and he says, ‘The bells, the bells!’ because of the sound of ringing in his ears. When I talk to my constituents, they put their heads in their hands and they say, ‘The trains, the trains!’ They are just haunted by this incredibly shabby, unreliable and increasingly diminished service that is being offered to them by the State Rail Authority and the New South Wales government. It is easy to take a cheap shot at Bob Carr, because, frankly, wherever you look his administration appears to be in crisis-whether it is the public hospital system, the ambulance services or the police, it is just one area after the other. mier in a sort of free fall. It is not my objective this morning to add to his discomfort, but the problem I have is that when I say to my constituents, ‘What are the problems we need to fix in MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Adjournment

179,Mr Ross Cameron,"And water. It is just this crisis-ridden state, and you see a Preour electorate?’ they say to me, ‘The trains, the trains!’ A woman said to me the other day, ‘I’m standing there stranded on Clyde Station because the train that was meant to come simply never arrived. I have a connection to make because I have to get home and a group of young children are depending upon me to be there to feed them. Does Bob Carr understand what it’s like to have a group of teenage and younger children who need to be fed and their mother is not there because she cannot rely on the train service?’ On the Carlingford line, for example, we used to have three direct city services. But, following the promise of the state government to build the Parramatta to Chatswood rail link and then three weeks after the last state election simply axing it after 28 press releases promising it, we now find that the SRA under its last timetable is axing a whole range of services on existing lines. In particular, the Carlingford line used to have three direct city services in the morning and two in the afternoon; it went from three to two and, under this latest timetable, from two to one. What it means is there is massive disruption in this basic area of service provision. When people look at a member of parliament, they say, ‘There are not that many things I rely upon you for. There are not many ways in which you actually add value to my life. But I ought to be able to rely on the published timetable. The trains running on time is a basic area where government can add value to my life and, so far, it is dismally failing.’ The axing of the 6.36 direct service from Carlingford to the city and through the City Circle and of the 7.03 service from Carlingford through the City Circle and to the airport has had a very significant effect on access to employment, for example, for my constituents. When you see that the federal government have driven unemployment down in Parramatta since I got elected, from over 12 per cent under the Keating Labor administration to 4.1 per cent today, it is a stunning achievement. The problem is that all those people have got to get to work somehow. This is where we in turn are relying on the state government to deliver basic services, which they are failing to do. SoI established the train trouble hotline, and I am getting inundated with reports from constituents about the problems they have been having. HereI have a report from a commuter from Telopea who is visually impaired with low mobility and has great difficulty changing trains under the new timetable. In the past she travelled on a direct service to Strathfield, which suited her well. Going up and down stairs to change platforms is a major dilemma-she is arriving late at work and considers the new timetable to be a major hassle. Another commuter was left stranded on Friday night at Wynyard Station. Trains to Clyde after 9.40 p.m. are virtually non-existent. On top of the morning and afternoon fiascos, evening services are far worse. A resident reports that the promise of the Parramatta to Chatswood rail link vanished into thin air after the last New South Wales state election. That resident says that the rail link is very important to the community, with high-rise developments and a growing population, and she encourages me to continue to fight for the Parramatta to Chatswood rail link. I am asking Bob Carr to get back to basics-to basic service delivery, which is what state governments are meant to do, and restore services to the commuters of my electorate of Parramatta. Aviation: Qantas Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (11.29 a.m.)-I am rising today to speak about a very serious issue not just for my electorate but for Australia as a whole-that is, the plans that Qantas Airways has to relocate up to 400 of its flight attendants to London. This has very serious implications for those 400 jobs that would otherwise be Australian jobs, but I think the implicaMAIN COMMITTEE tions are much broader ranging than just those 400 jobs. Qantas is apparently planning to move these flight attendants offshore in December this year, but I believe this really is just the tip of the iceberg. It has already moved a number of jobs offshore to Thailand and New Zealand and there was an agreement with Qantas staff that those numbers would be limited. Qantas now seems to be reneging on that agreement to limit the numbers being moved offshore and is seeking to get rid of the quota for people working offshore-to save $25 million a year, it claims. I can understand that any business has a desire to save money and minimise costs but, frankly, I would say that having well-qualified, friendly, charming Australian staff is one of the greatest selling points that Qantas has. Its safety record and its Australian staff are I believe its two greatest assets. When Australians travel by Qantas, they are travelling with Qantas because it is an Australian airline. Of course, on any trip they would expect there to be some flight attendants who are bilingual at least or multilingual. Some of those may not be Australian citizens; some of them may be based offshore. But what we are looking at with Qantas now is a plan to move offshore as many of its flight attendants as possible. I think that is really going beyond the pale. The plan apparently is to pay flight attendants based in London £16,000 a year. Translated into Australian dollars, that would seem like fairly good money. However, anyone who has been to London knows how very difficult it is to live in London on £16,000 a year. Where will these people come from? Will they be local Londoners or will Qantas be relying on people from further afield in the European Union where £16,000 a year perhaps is decent pay? I have absolutely nothing against companies internationalising their work forces. WhatI am concerned about is that we are undercutting the wages and conditions of Australian workers by farming off what is skilled work-flight attendants need to know a great deal about the safety and the operation of a plane and what to do in an emergency. I am concerned that as many as possible of these skilled jobs are being farmed off overseas-not just the occasional job because someone has particular linguistic skill or knowledge of a particular overseas market but as many of these jobs as possible-purely as cost-cutting measures. Qantas announced this before any meetings with the staff. It has made a public announcement. It has its eye on its share price obviously and has gone out into the marketplace and made this announcement. Doing this in this confrontational way, without any discussion with staff, is extremely provocative, particularly as there is a round of enterprise bargaining coming up. I am not surprised that Qantas staff feel that what will happen is that there will be 400 workers employed in London, a bunch of workers employed in Bangkok and a group of workers employed in New Zealand, and it will make it very difficult for Australian Qantas employees to take any effective industrial action. Qantas profits were down, like those of every airline, after the SARS epidemic and after the terrorist attacks in the United States and in Bali. It is no wonder that profits dropped slightly in the last few years. But the profits are still almost $1 billion, so this is hardly a reason to be looking at these cost-cutting measures at the expense of its reputation and at the expense of the Australian work force. There is a great deal of concern in my electorate about this and about Qantas’s lack of commitment to apprenticeships. It used to be a huge employer of apprentices and it has really let down the side on apprenticeships, as it has on relocating flight MAIN COMMITTEE attendants. I am very concerned about what goes offshore next. Its safety record is first-rate because we have well-trained, highly qualified people working on the planes. (Time expired) Makin Electorate: Law and Order ernment is the protection of its citizens-protection from enemies abroad and from crime on our own shores. The people of Golden Grove and, more widely, the city of Tea Tree Gully in my electorate of Makin could be forgiven for thinking that the South Australian Labor government does not care about their safety. Since the election, albeit under questionable circumstances, of the Rann Labor government in 2002, it has made much of its supposed ‘tough on crime’ credentials. Barely does a month go by without some sensational headline appearing in the Adelaide Advertiser, with ever stronger words coming from the mouths of the Premier and the Attorney-General. Truly, this is a Labor government that desires the appearanceappearance only-of being tough on crime. Unfortunately for my community, the truth is somewhat different. One of the first decisions of the Rann government was to cut funding to all local crime prevention programsunbelievable as that is. This included the highly successful program operated by the city of Tea Tree Gully, which they were forced to abandon when their funding was cut. This was despite all evidence that it was having a very positive effect on reducing crime in our local community, including a massive reduction in graffiti and a drop of 25 per cent in the number of vehicles stolen in the Modbury regional centre. Crime continues to be a major problem in my electorate, and for many years the residents of Golden Grove have been asking for an increased police presence in their neighbourhood, including the establishment of a local community police station. The local ALP member for state parliament, Jennifer Rankine, campaigned on this issue at the last two elections, and it was a promise by both sides of politics at the last election. It has been more than two years since Mike Rann became our Premier, and still there is no police station in Golden Grove. The obvious need for a police station was recently highlighted by the plight of the local Royal District Nursing Service. Facing mounting bills for repair of the damage caused by constant attacks by vandals on its base in Golden Grove, the Royal District Nursing Service considered closing its doors in our community. According to local press reports, the cost to the service reached $100,000 over the past year. Clearly, the time for talk is over. We do not need any more false promises coming from the mouths of Jennifer Rankine or Mike Rann. We need a police station in Golden Grove, and we need it now. I have written to the Premier and to Ms Rankine, and I will continue to support the community campaign for a police station for as long as it takes for these pleas to be heard. How many more properties have to be invaded and vandalised before the state government will take action? How long do we have to wait for urgent assistance to protect this community from crime? The state government happily collects a great deal of increased stamp duty and land tax from the building boom throughout Adelaide, and that boom has been particularly noticeable in my electorate. Surely it is not expecting too much to have some of that money spent on improved infrastructure and support the community with a police station that we badly need. After all, we are asking for nothing more than that the Rann government live up to its responsibilities. MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Adjournment
180,Mrs Draper (Makin) (11.34 A.m.),"One of the most important responsibilities of govEducation: Vocational Education and Training Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (11.38 a.m.)-My home state of Tasmania is extremely serious about vocational education and training. Set against a background of unacceptably high youth unemployment levels and the accompanying irony of shortages in apprentices in many trades, Tasmania continues to place a high priority on VET. Quite rightly, there has been much debate about the need for appropriate opportunities for Australians-however wealthy their families are and wherever they may live-to access further education. A large proportion of Australian parents, whether or not they have ever seen a single building inside a university, want the opportunity for their children to engage in tertiary study. But this is not possible for everyone, nor is it the wish of every Australian. Access to VET is also critical for older Australians. Opportunities for them to retrain and upskill are fundamental in a changing society. It is therefore incumbent on the legislators of Australia, both state and Commonwealth, to adequately provide for vocational education and training. As it happens, it is time for the Australian National Training Authority agreement to be renegotiated between the Commonwealth and the states. I am concerned that these negotiations may be proceeding on the faulty assumption of a demand forecast which significantly underestimates the real need. The Tasmanian government has acknowledged this and has responded accordingly. It has substantially increased both capital and recurrent funding for vocational education and training. The increase between 2001 and 2002 was by more than 13 per cent. Further increases in recurrent funding occurred in 2003 and 2004 and more are foreshadowed for the future. The previous ANTA agreement expired at the end of December 2003. The new agreement, for 2004-06, has been under negotiation since the 2003 federal budget but remains unfinalised. A cooperative outcome from these negotiations is essential. It is vital that all parties acknowledge, and take seriously, the critical role which VET plays for so very many Australians. VET takes many forms. In Tasmania we have, for example, an outstanding program called Studentworks. Many of my colleagues have had the pleasure of visiting this fantastic operation in recent years and meeting Linda Farrington, its administrator. Established in 1978 as a targeted youth training model for educationally disadvantaged secondary students, it is 60 per cent funded through its own commercial workshop. It targets grade 9 and 10 students who have difficulty with the mainstream school system and who might fall through the cracks. Students enter an agreement which requires spending half their time at the workshop and the other half in their original school. They must attend school in order to go to the workshop, and this has led to a sharp reduction in the levels of truancy. Students are offered nationally accredited training in carpentry, metalwork, furniture making and spray-painting, as well as learning the environment of a workplace and the need for workplace safety. Over the last five years, around 97 per cent of students who have participated in this program have achieved recognised educational and trade qualifications. Eighty-two per cent of those students have gained full-time employment. In addition, the program was recognised recently at the recent skills expo in Sydney supported by Dusseldorp. I am delighted to say that it does not end there: these amazing young people are off to London, where they have been invited to participate in an international skills forum representing Australia. It is totally appropriate that these outstanding young Tasmanians have been recognised. The work at Studentworks is an example to all who are interested in alternative learning options. I congratuMAIN COMMITTEE late Amber Coleman, Ashley Roberts and Dean Richardson-none of whom live in my electorate but they are supported by a program that is located in my electorate-and I wish them well in this very important journey in their lives and those of their fellow students. It seems that the Minister for Education, Science and Training now wants to get in on another Tasmanian success story in education and training. Tomorrow he will join me in Launceston for the 2004 launch of the Brooks No Dole program. This 1995 initiative of the Brooks High School and the Beacon Foundation is designed to address the factors which lead to students in their community leaving school prematurely and finding themselves stuck in the poverty and welfare cycle. It has made a significant impact on addressing the problems of youth unemployment in the area by assisting in developing a work ethic and providing workplace training and connections with employers. The program has been such a success that it currently boasts a 100 per cent retention of year 10 students in further education or employment and has been adopted by schools elsewhere in the country. The program is always launched by a particularly high-profile person, but in recent years the school has striven to get really exciting individuals to come along and capture the imagination of the community. Last year the school was delighted to embrace Peter Brock, quite a legend, who came down and participated, really raising the profile of the program. Since then the school has wanted to make sure that it has high-profile public figures performing the launch. It has been advised this year that the Minister for Education, Science and Training will be making the launch, and it has of course accepted. Both of these programs illustrate the superb work being undertaken in Tasmania in VET, but more can be done. I urge the Commonwealth government to place a high priority on the resumption of the ANTA agreement negotiations in order to provide a truly productive and cooperative outcome for all Australians. Drugs: Naltrexone Implants ing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I took a delegation of committee members to Perth to understand the issues of naltrexone implants in the treatment of drug addicts, particularly those on heroin. During that visit, we were able to witness a host of people who had been heroin addicts, who had had naltrexone implants and who had been able to achieve a basic form of abstinence, thus gaining a different life experience.

That treatment is very difficult to find and it has received a lot of controversy. The committee had the experience of watching a naltrexone implant and seeing how it was performed in a clinical setting. The committee then had the opportunity to go and speak with people who had had implants and who had had a re-education program and a rehousing program to determine how they might experience a better outcome for their lives for having had a naltrexone implant. As I said, there has been a lot of controversy around this and not one member of the committee feels, by any means, that it is an appropriate treatment for all addicts of opiates. However, it certainly should be clinically trialled in a safe and effective way to determine the safety and efficacy of naltrexone implants for heroin addicts and to ensure that, if it is a safe and effective product, it be made available to those who wish to become abstinent from heroin use. In the discussions that the committee had with many of the people in the halfway houses, it was evident that for some of them who had chosen to have a life that was without drug use, particularly heroin use, naltrexone implants had played a very important role. But it was not the only thing that was required. It was necessary that money be spent on rehousing, on availability of accommodation away from an environment that might see them move back into a using situation. It also meant that they required further education to enable them to undertake employment opportunities and give them the first opportunity that many of those people have had in their entire lives to be drug free and to be able to contribute to their community and also to their own future lifestyle. We saw and spoke with people who had taken up prostitution at a very young age-13 years old and younger-in order to feed a drug habit, who had finally been able to get their lives back on track by having an implant after trying many treatments. They were then able to be rehoused-which is a very important part of the naltrexone program, should it be implemented-and re-educated so that they could finally take an employment opportunity for the first time in their lives. It appeared to us that it was an extraordinarily good program. The naltrexone implant deserves to be clinically trialled without influence from external factors and the naltrexone implant process should have safety and efficacy proven. If that were to be the case then it should be made available for those people who choose to use naltrexone, who might choose to have a life of abstinence. For many people in the outside sector it seems that if you are seeking to be abstinent, as a former heroin user it is not available.

Four of the five areas where doctor shortages in Australia are most acute are in Logan City. The scandal in all of this, as I will demonstrate, is that the government has been denying it, and today I will reveal just how duplicitous it has been. Two years ago, on 16 September 2002, I wrote to the then minister for health, Senator Kay Patterson, on behalf of the residents of Park Ridge, which is one of the areas identified in this department of health document as suffering one of the most acute doctor shortages in Australia. I wrote on behalf of the residents at Park Ridge who were complaining about the shortage of doctors. I received a response from the minister on 30 October 2002. That response said in part: ... the Statistical Local Areas of Greenbank-Boronia Heights and Logan (C) Bal have currently been assessed as only partially eligible for the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas Measure. This is because these areas have a doctor to population ratio better than a national benchmark set for the Measure. The figures reveal that, in terms of doctor shortages, this is one of the worse areas in Australia and one of the most shabbily treated by the Howard government. Yet two years ago the minister was saying to me that this area was better than the national average. It is one of the most acutely suffering areas in Australia. The minister went on to say: However, my Department will review areas assessed as ineligible for the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas Measure following release of September 2002 quarter Medicare statistics. I think, and I am being very generous to the government, that the government did in fact carry through with that review and identified-conceded reluctantly-that there was a problem. But I now have correspondence from the Park Ridge medical centre, the Park Ridge Family Practice. It is very revealing. On9 January 2004, the Department of Health and Ageing responded to the pleas of that centre in the following terms: This advice is a preliminary assessment as to whether the following location(s) are currently considered to be a district of workforce shortage for the purposes of section 19AB. It identified the area as Park Ridge, Queensland. The answer given is: No ... It was not considered to be a district of work force shortage. The letter goes on to say: The practice must provide evidence of genuine unsuccessful efforts to recruit a suitably qualified Australian doctor through the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas Measure in the first instance. The practice has been trying and trying to recruit such a doctor. I now have a letter of 2 April 2004 from Medical Recruitment Pty Ltd to the practice. It says: Thank you very much for your request for a permanent locum or assistant for your practice. I advise that we have had your request for 3 years and unfortunately during that time we have been unable to secure you a permanent doctor. They have been seeking this support for three years and it has not been obtained. To cut a very long saga short, finally an overseas trained doctor was provided. Before that doctor could start, another doctor resigned. Now they are back to where they started. They have applied again for an overseas trained doctor and they have been told no. So the whole process is going to start again, with the Howard government denying that there is a doctor shortage in the area. It is a scandal. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Aviation: Bankstown Airport master plan for Bankstown Airport. I want to say a few further things in relation to that now. Simply to reiterate what I said before, I and Daryl Melham MP, the federal member for Banks, have expressed our absolute opposition to and total rejection of any regular passenger jet airline services operating out of Bankstown Airport. We are opposed not only to any regular jet airline passenger services but also-given national security considerations, given Bankstown’s history of never having had regular passenger transport services, given that we do not want to become Sydney’s second airport and given that this is a completely new operation that is proposed-to jet aircraft and nonjet aircraft of up to 100 or so seats. We do not think it is reasonable or sensible, effectively through subterfuge on the part of the people who put this master plan forward, that either we as federal members or the community at large in the city of Bankstown should be expected to just say, ‘Oh well, we understand. We know there hasn’t been any regular passenger transport except, exceptionally, during the pilot strike of the early 1990s, when RAAF aircraft used Bankstown Airport.’ When the normal operation of regular passenger transport in Sydney had effectively collapsed, Bankstown Airport was there as an interim substitute to get through the difficulties of the pilots strike. That cannot be, should not be and must not be taken to be a core set of reasons for saying that this general aviation airport should be utterly changed in its mode of operation. I do not accept-and no other federal member that has been in the seat of Blaxland accepts; there have only been three of us, but I refer particularly to the former one and myself-that Bankstown Airport should be expanded, extended and changed so that its mode of operation becomes something different from general aviation. When you look closely at what is actually in this-not at the briefing that we got and not at what I was told six months ago but at the statistics here-some very interesting things come out. The first is that Bankstown, historically the busiest airport in the whole of the Southern Hemisphere, has gone up to about 410,000 movements a year. Currently we are operating at 250,000 movements a year, as a result of what is happening in the Asia-Pacific area with the downturn across a number of countries in their economic activity and in their capacity to pay for their students to come to do flying training in Australia. We have also had the impact of the SARS epidemic and the general impact of the change in economic circumstances and cost imposts on general aviation. But more of those activities have been displaced elsewhere. These figures say that, given the current level of 250,000 movements a year, if you project forward another 20 years that will move up to about 425,000. But 288,000 of those movements would be regular passenger transport aircraft, whether BAe146s-jet aircraft that are the model aircraft taken for all the figures here-prop jets or others. So there would only be about 120,000 movements left for general aviation and other operations out of Bankstown Airport, including all of the firefighting and medical work that is done. What is clearly intended is a displacement of general aviation activity to Camden, Wedderburn and other cheaper airports in Sydney and for that displacement to give effect to the imposition, for the first time, of regular passenger transport planes. It would have been useful for the people running Bankstown Airport Ltd to have been up front about what they really want here, not to slide an argument through by saying, ‘There have been a few in the past and this is where we want to go for the future.’ I know of no sigMAIN COMMITTEE",155,Adjournment
189,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (11.53 A.m.),"Earlier today, I spoke on the preliminary draftnificant section of my electorate of Blaxland that would cop Bankstown being turned into a jet way. I know that there is no support for Bankstown becoming Sydney’s second airport.

(Time expired) Roads: Funding Ms GAMBARO (Petrie)-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (11.58 a.m.)-I am very pleased to speak today about the recent AusLink announcement which will guarantee further funding to the Bruce Highway. I was very pleased to be at the launch of this great announcement with the member for Dickson and the member for Longman. That now brings to a total of $280 million the sum that will be spent on upgrading the Bruce Highway, which is one of the major highways that links the south-east corner to some of the northern areas and which is the main route that is used for produce and for people who travel up to the wonderful tourist destinations of Maroochydore, Noosa, Hervey Bay and the other terrific spots that we have in Queensland. The upgraded Bruce Highway is going to make a significant difference for the region. It was one of the worse spots in terms of congestion and the number of incidents that occurred. I have done my very best to deliver on the local scene as much as I can as a federal member, but sadly that is not the case for the two state members that represent the area. I want to thank the people of Petrie for their wonderful response to the petition that was tabled some months ago on the Houghton Highway Bridge. It is official: it is Queensland’s worse road. The RACQ nominated it as the worse road. The other day the Courier-Mail did a survey that said it was one of the worse roads in Queensland. So what further validation does the state member, Ray Hollis, need that it is Queensland’s worse road? A number of the residents who signed the petition have written to me. They have mentioned some terrible incidents of road rage, being late for work and fearing for their safety. They feel that they are being treated as second-class citizens. The people of Redcliffe have really had enough of the two state members making poor excuses. They are sick of constant stalling and feasibility study after feasibility study. I want to read into Hansard a selection of comments that some of the residents have made: I recently broke down on the bridge, on the one open lane. I was abused by motorists for causing delays. I was stuck there for over half an hour. The traffic in both directions was banked back for kilometres. That was a Scarborough resident. A Redcliffe resident said: We moved here 12 years ago and nothing in all that time has been done to upgrade the Houghton Highway Bridge. Driving over it once or twice is very different to those who drive over it twice a day, five days a week. I do that, so I know how this person feels. How many times have you driven over it, Mr Beattie? As for this beautiful peninsula consider those of us who live here who need a rail link to travel to beautiful Brisbane instead of driving. ‘The Houghton Highway is a three lane death trap!’ said a Clontarf resident. Another Redcliffe resident said: What does one say to the employer who no longer wants to believe that excuse again for being late! ‘Isn’t there another way to go?’ asks the employer. No, there is no other way to go! One cannot drive over water! MAIN COMMITTEE Another resident said: I feel very upset being treated by the Beattie government like a second-rate citizen. But I won’t forget when it comes time to vote. Other comments include: ‘The bridge is a disaster waiting to happen’; and ‘The 60 kilometre speed limit will only aggravate drivers more and you could start seeing more road rage.’ Another resident said: Don’t cross the bridge in dark hours-try crossing it in peak daylight hours-tolerate the smashes and the failure of traffic control lights. Apologise to your employer yet again for late attendance at work! Another resident said: I am sick and tired of the accidents, breakdowns, traffic-jams and near-misses that I come across and the road rages that I see. For 24 years that I have been a Redcliffe resident I am sick to death of the state government’s irresponsibility to our safety and livelihoods! Another resident said: This bridge is just plain dangerous and needs to be remedied. Think about it-head to head traffic on a narrow bridge with no carriageway division. Even worse-nowhere to go and nowhere to manoeuvre in the event of a potential collision. Another resident said: Thirty years is a long time to be told no, after all the promises, Mr Beattie! I urge the two state members to do something about this. I have done my best as a federal member to get funding for the Bruce Highway. Please use some of that GST money that we bestow on Queensland so generously to do something for the people of Redcliffe and solve this terrible bridge problem. It is a nightmare. It is an outrage for the people of Redcliffe to have to put up with such a terrible bridge that is the cause of many accidents and much road rage. They deserve far better than this, and they do not deserve to be fobbed off. (Time expired) Foreign Affairs: Taiwan talking-up of tensions across the Taiwan Strait. There seems to be a view around at present, pressed by a number of lobbies, that all of a sudden there is a big issue across the Taiwan Strait regarding whether Taiwan is seeking independence. It was part of the election campaign in Taiwan, where one party said that President Chen could not be trusted because he was in favour of independence for Taiwan. This was echoed by the PRC. There has been a lot in the press here and a lot being privately said here in Australia by representatives of the PRC that talks about independence in Taiwan could cause not only cross-strait tension but also possibly open warfare. It is important to look at the facts. Has President Chen said that Taiwan wants independence? Is there a very strong lobby in Taiwan for independence? Does the Taiwanese government recognise that independence is not the way to go? I think the reality is that, while there was a lot of hype during the election campaign in Taiwan, President Chen has made it clear since the election that Taiwan is not seeking to take a strong independent position. President Chen has said that there is a need to upgrade the constitution and to make significant changes in public administration in Taiwan. That is probably long overdue. Taiwan has a modern economy but it does not have, in some areas, a modern enough public administration to back MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Adjournment
190,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson) (12.03 P.m.),"TodayI would like to raise the issue of thethat up. I think it is very clear from listening to people in Taiwan and from talking to Taiwanese officials that there is not any program for Taiwan to claim independence. While at present the world seems to have its eye on the Middle East, I do not think we are looking at this other very important area and important issue in our region, and I think Australia should take a lot more interest in this. Taiwan is one of our major trading partners, as is the PRC. Australia has a lot of business links with both sides of the Taiwan Strait. They are important links for us, and it is an important area for us to be across. The idea that is being peddled at present that there is increased tension is just a fiction, and it is a fiction that we here in Australia should take a fair amount of interest in. If there is a predisposition to make this an issue which could cause the problems of war in the Taiwan Strait, that would be very detrimental to Australia. But it is a bit of a phoney issue because the Taiwanese government, President Chen and the vast majority of the people in Taiwan are happy with the status quo. They are getting along with their lives and their business and they are not pressing this independence line. We should be aware that Taiwan has now had two very successful proper elections. Taiwan is now pretty much a very well developed democracy. The Taiwanese people have found themselves being able to choose their own government and their own representatives in parliament and they want to modernise their own public administration and constitutional structures. But in that desire there is not a desire for full independence. That has been made clear both by the Taiwan government and the people of Taiwan. the intervention? remarks shortly. (Time expired) Environment Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12.09 a.m.)-I would like to read into Hansard a speech written by two work experience students who have been with me this week. Harriett Bateman and Anna Leacock, who are present in the chamber, have been working with me this week. They wrote this speech, and the issues raised are of personal interest to them. I thought the chamber would appreciate hearing the concerns of two young Australians. The speech reads: Due to the climate change and fluctuating weather patterns, many people are relying on their good old reverse cycle air conditioners to help them out; unaware that it is destroying our country’s natural resources. This isn’t just happening in my electoral area, but all across Australia, from the coast to the red centre, people are misusing electricity because of minimal environmental standards promoted by the State Governments and Municipal Councils. Most Australians don’t realise that over 90% of their electricity is generated by burning coal. If the Federal Government of the Commonwealth of Australia promoted building codes like watersaver systems, better insulation of houses, planting of natural and appropriate vegetation and encouraged the use of solar energy technology, this would greatly reduce emissions and lift the current standard of unsatisfactory building codes. Councils have an important role in educating residential and industrial areas within their municipality about the benefits and issues regarding “Green Power”. MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment

193,Mr Leo Mcleay,"I am sure that the member for Wentworth might rise and echo myHowever, the State Governments should also aim to monitor the commercial industries over-use of electrical power and water wastage. If the state set a level of environmentally beneficial building codes which all builders, architects and engineers of commercial and residential buildings had to comply with, this would reduce the need for non eco-friendly devices. The councils could then regulate further restrictions if it was deemed necessary for their area. The NSW State Premier, Bob Carr, introduced water restrictions on October 1, 2003, and this is obviously a positive step towards saving our natural resources. However, the watering of gardens and lawns accounts for only 27.3% of household water usage, leaving 72.7% unaffected by the restrictions. Mr Carr’s mandatory water restrictions fail to apply to motor radiator repair workshops which waste 100 litres of clean water to flush car radiators; or poultry production plants which squander 35 litres of water per bird per minute. Mr Carr’s government seems to have no problem with this clear exploitation and abuse of our state’s water resources by the industrial community but puts the foot down when people try to keep their gardens green and destroy the typical elderly Australian past-time of lawn maintenance. All three levels of Government need to implement laws and restrictions on abuse of water and electricity. But Sydney City Council wastes thousands of litres of water by pressure hosing pavements in the dry city of Sydney. The NSW State Government leaves the burden to the Municipal Councils which have neither the resources nor the budget to implement the laws which could prolong the life of our country’s natural resources. Together, the Municipal Councils, State and Federal Governments need to support the Australian renewable energy industry to reduce our country’s greenhouse gas impact and at the same time raising awareness about the issues in the public. I congratulate Harriet Bateman and Anna Leacock on their work. I distance myself from the remarks about the ‘typical elderly Australian pastime’ of lawn maintenance, and I did want to withdraw that remark as being politically incorrect. I suppose to two year 10 students even I seem elderly in terms of my attention to my garden and my interest in gardening, which has obviously come to a halt with the current water restrictions. Harriet and Anna have been a delight and a pleasure to have around, and they are a credit to their school. I really have enjoyed having them this week. I should not say this in case their teachers read this speech, but I introduced them to Alexander Downer-and I asked them to get some questions ready to ask because they are both interested in a career in the foreign service. They did not do that; they got terribly flustered and did not manage to ask him any questions. ThenI said, ‘Let’s introduce you to the Prime Minister and you can ask him some questions.’ Again, they failed to ask any questions. But I am sure that, as they gain the confidence of age, they will get that confidence to nail our political leaders on issues that are important to them and go on to make a great contribution to our society and the great democratic country that is Australia. Congratulations to Anna and Harriet. add my congratulations on a well-written speech.

194,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Corcoran),"BeforeI call the next speaker, I would like to",161,Adjournment
195,Mr King (Wentworth) (12.14 P.m.),"I rise today to speak about the superb and wondereral way, that contribution and to then make mention of some of the contributions and grants that have been awarded over the last three years or so. The arts community in my electorate is probably the most vibrant of any in the country. It includes playwrights, film stars, painters, poets, actors and people of all description within the film industry-located, as it is, adjacent to the Fox Studios. My electorate includes the seaside suburb of Bronte and the suburb of Paddington, in particular, areas where people who love the arts and who are aesthetes, as it were, love to live and gather. These people make a wonderful contribution to my electorate and to our whole country. Over the last three years, the period for which it has been my privilege to represent this community, there have been some extraordinary contributions by a wide range of people. I have had the privilege of working with people such as Chris Haywood, one of the leaders in the arts community in my area and an actor. We worked on a project to ensure that local people in the area had the opportunity to make a contribution on issues concerning culture in the US free trade agreement. Chris Haywood led a delegation to my office and I then arranged meetings with the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Rod Kemp, who made himself available, as well as then Minister Alston and Minister Vaile. That was an important opportunity for the arts community in my area to have input. I am not suggesting that all of their suggestions were taken up, because there are some concerns remaining about the cultural aspects of the US free trade agreement. I want to congratulate the arts community in my electorate on their contribution not just on the stage or on the page but also on policy development in that way and elsewhere. I will mention before I go to the sporting community, in the limited time. I have available, a suggestion from the arts community that division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Actwhich was introduced, interestingly enough, by then Treasurer Howard as a 150 per cent deduction in relation to helping the Australian film industry and which was reduced to 100 per cent, so, really, just a tax deductible expense, during the Hawke years-really ought to be reintroduced, to give our film industry a fair go. They really do need a proper fillip to get themselves back on the road, because at the moment the levels of training of crews are falling off, so that offshore industries are not being able to access sufficient Australian skills. We are going to lose work to New Zealand and other places unless we act now. I also want to refer to the contribution by the sports men and women of the electorate of Wentworth. The other day I held the Commonwealth sporting excellence awards in my electorate, down at the famous Bondi Icebergs Club. There some 54 sports men and women in my electorate were congratulated. Nick Farr-Jones, the former Australian Wallabies captain, handed out the awards. It was a terrific day. The Australian men’s winter open relay team from the Bondi Icebergs won the Australian championships. The Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club, which won the New South Wales competition, the Sydney competition and the one-day competition, were appropriately recognised, as were the Cranbrook School sailing team, which won the Australian junior championships, and a number of other wonderful sporting men and women too numerous to name in my address now. I want to recognise that contribution of excellence and also the contribution of the ordinary people across my electorate who swim daily, who run daily, who are part of this wonderful surge of sporting contribution, who are athletic and who love the sport of our country and make it as great as it is. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Aviation: Bankstown Airport plan for Bankstown Airport and some of the critical things that are not being done. The very first thing that has not been done by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Prime Minister or anyone else in this government is ruling out, now and into the future, the use of Bankstown Airport by 717s, 737s, 747s or any of those aircraft that are in category 4C and larger. The people in Bankstown know about this issue, and 6,000 turned up to Bankstown Paceway on one day to protest against the decision taken by the federal coalition government on 13 December 2000 to load up Bankstown Airport as the second airport for Sydney, to make it the overflow airport for Sydney, to make it the regional transport airport for Sydney. That was their decision of 13 December 2000. At the time, I said that they were completely and utterly crazy. They obviously did not understand the interoperability between Bankstown Airport and Kingsford Smith airport. The east-west runway at Kingsford Smith airport operates in such a manner that you cannot run jet or prop-jet activity out of Bankstown Airport at any greater level than 12 per hour. There is a provision-increased in 1998 by the minister for transport-that, where there is a conflict between Kingsford Smith airport and Bankstown Airport, Richmond Airport or any other airport in the Sydney basin, Kingsford Smith airport has priority. They spent months trying to work out a way to turn Bankstown Airport into effectively Sydney’s second airport. Although they put Badgerys Creek on the backburner, they wanted a way in which to elevate Bankstown Airport so as to get regional traffic placed there and to run more jets in and out of Kingsford Smith airport, thereby letting Sydney Airport Corporation earn a lot more money. Since Max Moore-Wilton has gone from the Prime Minister’s office to running Sydney Airport Corporation, the vested interest of that corporation in trying to maintain and expand their activities has been extended. The people who have taken up the lease on Bankstown Airport say that one of their planning priorities is for Bankstown Airport not to become Sydney’s second airport. If that is the case, that should be not just a suggestion; it should be written into this master plan. If that is the case, they should not just say in the master plan, ‘We’re not making any planning decisions in relation to code 4C aircraft’-that is, 717s, 737s and above-‘or doing any analysis of that, because we don’t think we’ll ever use it.’ They have said that the three runways at Bankstown Airport are important. However, they put the argument that they need to extend the principal runway by 220 metres and to strengthen the runway and the associated taxiways so that, instead of taking the 20-tonne loads that they currently take, they would be able to take 50-tonne loads. Where in these provisions do they say that they want to run regular passenger transport in and out of Bankstown Airport? They say that there would only be 12 flights a day on that 50-tonne limit. When they say that, they know as well as I do that you can run 12 an hour, not 12 a day. They also know that they can apply to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services once they have established those kinds of operations to say, ‘We have a runway here which has the capacity to take larger aircraft. We have established usage, because we pinched a whole lot of activity from Kingsford Smith airport. We think we should be able to do more than this. We think we have a problem in the protection that is currently around Bankstown Airport.’ Because of the general aviation operations and the ceiling levels involved, you do not run the same kinds of operaMAIN COMMITTEE",161,Adjournment
196,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (12.19 P.m.),"by leave-I return to the question of the mastertions that you do at Kingsford Smith airport. So they can apply to the minister to seek permission to run more than 12 jet and prop-jet flights a day in and out of Bankstown Airport. This master plan should have been open, above board, direct and transparent. It should not have hidden clauses that would dud the people of Bankstown, but it does. That is why I totally reject the fundamental propositions in the master plan. I reject the notion that regular passenger transport services should be incorporated into Bankstown Airport operations. The minister needs to reject this when it gets to him, and the people of Bankstown need to reject it in the 90-day period. (Time expired) Aviation: Second Sydney Airport Environment: Water Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12.24 p.m.)-In response to the last speaker, I want to say for the record that the Australian federal government, headed by John Howard, has no plan for a second airport for Sydney. It has been quite clearly stated that Sydney will not run out of airspace for the next 30 years. The only political party considering a second airport for Sydney is the Australian Labor Party. It is considering Wilton but, when that falls over in the EIS, it will look at Richmond and it will look at Bankstown. It will look everywhere to put the second airport somewhere. Our policy is that there is no requirement for a second airport for Sydney-case closed. For 20 years people have been beating on government doors saying, ‘We’re going to run out of air slots for next year.’ I imagine that, by 2034, there will still be another 30 years of life at Mascot. There has been all the hoopla over that piece of infrastructure, but you should look at another key part of New South Wales infrastructure, and that is water. We are going to run out of water in Sydney next year if it does not rain this summer-and there is no reason it should. My local churches have a two per cent regular attendance at church. So if Australia is praying for rain, we are relying on too few Australians to do too much. Without rain, we will run out of water this time next year. Frank Sartor’s water restrictions, which have been in since last year, have done nothing to curb the draining of our dams and Sydney’s water reserves. Sydney’s current water reserves were built to cater for a city of four million people. We now have 4½ million people. On Craig Knowles’s own estimates, there will be 7.5 million people in Sydney by 2050. We urgently need to effectively double Sydney’s water reservesor I think we will have to call in the national guard to restore civic order in Sydney when we run out of water. If there is no water, how long have you got before there is chaos? Three days? You can go seven days without food but only three days without water. It is absolutely disgraceful, poor planning. Here we have the opposition going on about an airport 30 years from now when we are talking about running out of waterMr King interjectingMiss JACKIE KELLY-That is right. The ALP is talking about an airport now. We are not talking about any need for an airport for 30 years, by which stage it will be another 30 years. We are talking about running out of water next year. In Western Australia, with a proper government strategy, they are guaranteed two days a week of watering of household gardens. That is guaranteed by their current water policy. On the other hand, Bob Carr has basically targeted residential users and household water. The watering of gardens and lawns accounts MAIN COMMITTEE for only 27.3 per cent of household water. I will read you a letter to Frank Sartor written by the New South Wales Turf Growers Association’s CEO, Don Ainsworth. Mr Ainsworth says: According to Sydney Water figures for 2002/03 households use around 53.3% with outdoor water accounting for around 27.3% of all domestic water use. Nursery industry research shows that over 70% of people were already using hoses to water their gardens. So the current restrictions are only targeting 30% of 27.3% of 53.3%, or less than 5% of household water use. So it is hardly surprising that dam levels continue to fall despite mandatory restrictions become mandatory water restrictions are targeting less than 5% of household water use. What perhaps angers me most is that neither Sydney Water nor the Minister are capable of explaining why the banning of sprinklers is necessary when an averaged sized radiator repair workshop is allowed to waste on average 100 litres of water when flushing a normal car radiator, or when poultry farmers use 35 litres per minute per bird in a typical processing procedure. Furthermore, there appears to be no scientific evidence to substantiate the claim that a properly controlled sprinkler irrigation is less efficient than drip irrigation, and no scientific evidence to substantiate watering gardens and laws at 8.00am in the morning is more efficient than watering at 10.30am. I will rise to say more on this issue later. (Time expired) Military Detention: Australian Citizens Guantanamo Bay and the two Australian prisoners, Hicks and Habib, in particular. It is not well known, but there are two formal inquiries under way in the United States at the moment into prisoner abuses in US prison camps in Iraq, the United States and Guantanamo Bay. The first is by the inspector-general of the navy and the second is by the detainee group within the Department of Defense of the United States government. Those formal inquiries are important because they are probably the most sensible and reasonable basis on which information about possible prisoner abuse can be obtained. In several Australian newspapers today, a detailed report was published and became available to most Australians concerning claims by English prisoners at Guantanamo Bay regarding the torture of, amongst others, those two Australian prisoners, who are our fellow citizens. The fact that they may have committed gross crimes and even treasonous offences against this country-although it is not proven at this stage and, in the case of one, not even allegeddoes not mean that they are stripped of the rights of every Australian person to freedom from abuse and the protections that international conventions and the laws of this country give them, as they give you and me. If we pick and choose when to apply those laws and conventions, we ourselves end up in a tyrannous state. My suggestion to the government, which I have sent in writing to the minister today, is this: an Australian serving military officer with legal experience-that is, a person who is either a member of the legal branch of the Department of Defence or, as the member for Lindsay herself once was and maybe still is, a member of the military personnel with legal experience in the Department of Defence-be appointed to assist one of those two inquiries in the United States so that the Australian government and the Australian people have the confidence of knowing that the issues regarding prisoner abuse and possible convention breaches are addressed. That is important because there is at least one convention to which Australia is a party that the United States is not, although, in general terms, both countries are party to the relevant conventions relating to these matters. MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Adjournment
197,Mr King (Wentworth) (12.30 P.m.),"I rise to raise some points concerning prisoners atThe alternative is that the Australian government itself appoints its own inquiry, again with an appropriately qualified person with military experience and also legal experience to conduct such an inquiry. In that way, the Australian government can itself act and be confident and report to the Australian people that this issue has been properly addressed. Until now, it may not have been as serious as I am suggesting. But these reports from English prisoners and the claims that they have made are so extraordinary that they ought not to be and really cannot be ignored. That is why I have written to the minister, and I hope that he responds, either in the two ways that I have suggested or in some other way to assure the Australian people that such rights that those prisoners have to be free of abuse in incarceration are not infringed. The only other I thing I mention about this is that it is high time both these men were charged and brought to trial-not just a trial but a fair trial. It has been too long since they have been incarcerated without charge and, as Australian citizens, their trial ought to occur. I would like to see that occur in this country in the same way that the English prisoners who were in Guantanamo Bay have been repatriated and were considered under the laws of the United Kingdom for charging in that place. Those issues are important because they relate to the very issues and reasons why we went to war in Iraq and conducted the war against terrorism in the first place. (Time expired) Aviation: Bankstown Airport informed and untargeted debate and discussion that came from the member for Lindsay previously. Given that she was a government minister, given that she is a parliamentary secretary, given that she is a resident of Sydney, given the proximity of where she lives to Badgerys Creek-the reserve second airport for Sydney-and given the centrality of the debate in relation to airports in Sydney, I would have expected a finer argument in relation to this master plan proposal at Bankstown airport, because it is not as though this has not arisen before. The reason the member for Lindsay can comfortably argue that nothing is really going to happen in relation to Badgerys Creek at all-it is not an issue, it is not a question-is that the government, having pocketed it in reserve on the basis that Kingsford Smith would be able to deal with their aircraft needs for the next 20 years, have made this master plan an extension of the swiftie they tried to pull in December 2000. That is, they say that part of the way in which Kingsford Smith would be able to cope with increased usage in the future is to get regional and smaller aircraft out of Kingsford Smith to an overflow airport in Bankstown. They actually had a specific provision put in that said that the sale of that lease had to have some conditions. One was that the runway be extended. What is in the master plan? An extension of the runway. Another was that the runway be strengthened. What is in the master plan? That the runway is strengthened-to take not 20-tonne loads but 50-tonne loads. Another was that provision had to be made for 737 aircraft to land at Bankstown airport. The only reason Minister Tuckey, in the absence of the minister for transport, announced that they were not going to insist on lengthening and strengthening the runway, on 737s being able to use Bankstown airport or on Bankstown becoming an overflow airport was that they finally caught up with the fact that, with the intersection of the east-west runway, Bankstown and class C airspace, you could not sensibly interoperate the two airports. That is the only thing that saved Bankstown and the surrounding areas-in which half a million people in Sydney live-from being turned into the jetway that this coalition government would have MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Adjournment
198,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (12.35 P.m.),"by leave-I take umbrage at the rather illimposed. Given the attitude in the debate expressed by the member for Lindsay, we can understand that nothing much has changed-Bankstown can be a dumping ground, and this master plan, if accepted by a coalition minister for transport and aviation, would impose on Bankstown the preconditions for the future expansion of the airport. It would impose on Bankstown regular passenger transport modes that have never been a regular feature at Bankstown airport. The history of this airport is general aviation usage. The people who put the master plan forward, who want to make a big buck out of this proposal, who want to spend big money on lengthening and strengthening the runway, who want to put 100-seater aircraft into Bankstown without the controls in terms of airport security and who want an amount of money paid for every one of those people on those 100-seater aircraft-and the aircraft for this airport is in fact the BAe 146-300, which has an on-board capacity of 128 people-want to change the usage in Bankstown airport. They have picked up what the government said on 13 December 2000-the fact that you could have regular passenger transport services. They have said that that is the way they want to go. They want to establish a platform to dramatically change that usage. I reject that proposal on my behalf and on behalf of the 82,500 constituents I have in Bankstown. The member for Banks has absolutely rejected that proposal. We have further demanded this from a Liberal government which will not sign off on it. All they have said is, ‘We’re not saying anything more about larger aircraft for Bankstown.’ Code 4C aircraft, 737s and above, should be written out of usage at Bankstown Airport now and forever. Code 3C aircraft-aircraft that currently only charter from the airport but do not have any licence to operate regular passenger transport-should be written out in terms of use as regular passenger transport. There is no need to extend the runway, and there is no provision for that in terms of freight, unless there are adequate protections for the people. In all the 151 pages of this master plan, there is not a single syllable about the impact it would have on people. (Time expired) Aviation: Second Sydney Airport Environment: Water Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12.40 p.m.)-by leave-I reiterate for the member for Blaxland that the Sydney Airports Corporation has guaranteed that Sydney can take all regional aircraft, as it is currently doing. It will meet the current curfews-it will do all of this-within the existing arrangements. All regional passengers will be able to exit at Mascot, transfer to connecting flights and get around Australia. There is no need for a second airport. In the year 2030, the issue will be looked at again to see what infrastructure is required. Personally, I think the member for Blaxland would probably be better advising for a 2030 plan that Brisbane and Melbourne be the second airports for Sydney and that Canberra be the second regional airport. That is the logical solution. That arrangement has been put in place around the world. It has happened at Narita. As airports reach capacity, larger aircraft are employed from closer airports. International passengers will disembark in Brisbane and Melbourne, with domestic flights to Sydney on larger aircraft. We can sit here and trade opinions on air movements for Sydney well past 1.30-we could do it until 2030-and still not be in a situation where we must come up with a solution for tomorrow. However, that is not the case with Sydney’s water usage. If there is no rain this MAIN COMMITTEE summer, we will be out of water by this time next year. In Sydney, we will go to turn our taps on and have a drink, and there will be no potable water. This is a serious, unbelievable situation that we are in. It happened in Joseph’s time. Surely everyone recalls Joseph and his coloured coat. His brother is thrown down a well, he is sold into slavery, he becomes a great prophet and he predicts seven years of plenty and seven years of famine. For seven years they did not have rain. It can happen. It does not have to rain this summer. There are no pipes from the Hunter to replenish Sydney’s water resources. There is no dam in the Colo; there is no dam at Welcome Reef. There are not even any plans for an EIS on a dam there. There is no desalination plant under construction as there is is WA, and it has not even been looked at. There is no water, and we are about to run out. Frank Sartor’s solution is to beat up on gardeners when we have the entire commercial sector of Sydney absolutely abusing water. This time next month, when Warragamba Dam gets below 40 per cent and we are into 39 per cent-when we go down to the thirties everyone starts panicking-Frank Sartor is going to go to stage 3 water restrictions, which are outrageous. I personally have already seen the loss of nearly 100 jobs in my electorate from these water restrictions. There are 20 at the Castlereagh nursery. There is John’s Garden Centre. All of my turf farms and nurseries are either closing down or laying people off. Across the industry, altogether in New South Wales 6,000 jobs have gone. When Frank Sartor goes to stage 3 restrictions, it will be even more devastating. He is not even willing to consider an inquiry or a better way of managing water, such as the one his good mate-of the same political colour-in WA can advise him of. Western Australia manages water in a far more appropriate manner-in a far more rational way that does not cost jobs and that does not have catastrophic effects on industries and residential users. It is quite unbelievable that Frank Sartor continues with his current water restriction policy like a bull at a gate. It is draconian and it is totally unnecessary. There is a better way of managing this issue than just sticking with what his bureaucrats have. He should do a bit of work, get out in Australia, find out what the rest of Australia is doing and come up with a better plan for Sydney as put forward by the Turf Growers Association and by the Western Australian government and water users. Our commercial users are not being penalised-our commercial users for whom it is a tax deduction to implement devices that will save water. They are not being forced into that situation. (Time expired) Aviation: Bankstown Airport me leave to speak. There is a clear and present danger in the city of Bankstown. That clear and present danger is that the master plan, which people have 90 days to comment on, will be decided upon by March of next year-well beyond the election, which I expect to be on 18 September. Whoever wins government will have to make a determination on the master plan agreed by the Bankstown Airport Corporation. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services will have to make a determination on whether to accept or reject the master plan. The minister cannot make amendments to that plan. The originators of the ideas in relation to what will happen to Bankstown Airport have a 90-day period, based on the 1996 Airports Act, which Labor put into place. They have prepared all of the documentation in relation to this and argue that this is deep, full, extended and gives all the information required by the legislation. They are seeking comment and they are MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Adjournment
199,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (12.45 P.m.),"by leave-I thank the government side for givingseeking input. There is a decision making group set up by them. I think loaded with people who are supportive of what they have chosen to do here. They have to look at every one of the inputs, every one of the criticisms in relation to this and come up with a final master plan. This is a preliminary draft. What they have done has been inappropriate. The member for Lindsay has misunderstood what I am saying here. The second Sydney airport issue is separable from this entirely. This is about what happens with the existing Bankstown Airport and its mode of operation. Do they stay the same as they have been at that airport historically since it was first put into use during World War II as a general aviation airport or do they dramatically change and, in dramatically changing, be allowed to run regular passenger transport out of it-both jet and nonjet? That activity has to come from somewhere. They will pull that activity out of Kingsford Smith airport. Why? Because they will be able to offer people currently operating out of Kingsford Smith a lower cost of operation competitively. The amount of money it costs them to run the airport is not as high. They will be able to pull those people out to operate out of Bankstown by offering them better conditions and a better cost structure. If they are able to build that and then compete against Kingsford Smith for that part of the market, more slot spaces open up for larger aircraft at Kingsford Smith, whether they are 747s, A300s or whatever. That is not the critical point here. The critical point is that there is a master plan that has to be considered. The master plan has to be modified and then the final one presented to the federal minister for transport and aviation in December of this year. I am arguing about federal matters, not the state concerns and state matters that the member for Lindsay has been arguing about in relation to whether or not there will be potable water for Sydney. I know those are significant issues for all people who are living in Sydney, but it is another indication of a government that is transfixed by the campaigning basis of flogging state governments around Australia, dealing with state issues and not the issues that are at the core of their responsibility. On the question of the federally owned Bankstown Airport land-it is still owned by the Commonwealth government; there is only a 99-year lease that has been put out on that-the decision-making authority for what happens at Bankstown Airport is the federal minister for transport and aviation. State people can have concerns about it, the local council can have concerns, but what is going to happen there in the next 20 years is simply a question of what the federal government will decide, undistracted by state issues. The key question that needs to be answered now is whether Bankstown will operate as it always has or will be transformed into an overflow airport. That is what the federal government sought to do and then backed off on, and we need to know what the new owners will seek to put into place in their stead. It will cost a lot of money to strengthen that runway and to extend it by 220 metres. I ask the minister for aviation to entirely rule out that lengthening, and the strengthening of that runway to take 50-tonne loads. Bankstown should run as it has always run and not be transformed into something that is a threat to the people of Bankstown. (Time expired) Environment: Water Lindsay Electorate: Town Planning Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12.51 p.m.)-by leave-Bob Carr and his minister for utilities cannot go to stage 3 water restrictions in New South Wales as they are currently drafted. They need to be redrafted to allow MAIN COMMITTEE some survivability of our landscaping industries. The stage 3 water restrictions as currently drafted will squeeze another 20 per cent of savings from domestic gardeners. Basically that means banning all hosing of gardens and lawns. That is economically irresponsible in terms of wiping out more jobs from the industry. Currently the industry has lost over 6,000 jobs, which is 15 times more jobs than lost at Orange Grove. It is also leaving us with a brown and dusty city. In my area of LindsayI have the highest asthma rate in Sydney. A key feature in our fight against Badgerys Creek was the particulate matter in the air in Western Sydney. With a dry and dusty city the particulate matter increases, with a corresponding increase in respiratory problems. Having a green city is a health issue as well as an aesthetic one. Talking of infrastructure planning, there is some other poor planning occurring. The member for Blaxland says it is a case of a federal member getting up on a state matter. I am getting up because I live in this area and have to breathe in this area and I have to get to work and get to the shops in my area, and I am representing the local issues of people in my area as they are brought to me. Generally the federal government is doing extremely well on federal issues and most of the issues that people talk to me about are state ones, such as the incredible traffic jam on the M4 going to work. Most people fear this will become even more claustrophobic as more and more houses are built in the area without a corresponding number of jobs coming with that. That is why I am dedicated to an outcome, and I do have to work with state and local governments, of getting 5,000 jobs on the Army land at North Penrith. The Army land at North Penrith is right at the Penrith railway station, and any urban planner will tell you that within 400 metres of a railhead, especially one like Penrith which is only an hour from the city by train, becomes a commutable distance for using public transport to get to work. If you can get off the train and walk 400 metres to your job, that is an ideal place at which to locate your business. Yet in that area the Penrith City Council is planning houses. I know that what will happen is that as businesses get squeezed for rents on the south side of the train line they will find houses that they can utilise as home office or mixed use and they will squeeze themselves into this residential area within 400 metres of the train station and take advantage of poor council enforcement, because councils never enforce any of these zoning laws. I have got bulky goods zoned areas that are retailing, I have got all sorts of uses happening all across my electorate, and the only time council ever enforces anything is when a neighbour complains. There will be more and more businesses moving into this area in an ad hoc way and we will end up with a CBD that is ill planned. If, with proper planning now, we build a bus-railhead, build a 2,400-space car park on the north side for commuters and free up parking on the south side, if we make interconnectivity underneath the rail line and look at buildings going over the vacant rail space, we can develop a CBD at the heart of Penrith which is a major attraction, which is liveable, which is a great place to work and which is sustainable, given the number of houses that we are having developed in our area according to the state government’s planning policies. Penrith City Council has to come up with 20,000 new home sites; that is an extraordinary ask. We are finding some on the ADI site, some in the Penrith Lakes area and some at the back of Glenmore Park. We will have an enormous churn of houses, and people are very concerned because we do not have the jobs to sustain the people who will live in them, so they will empty onto our roads, causing traffic jams for the locals. We are not used to paying for parking and we are not used to waiting for more than 10 minutes to move down a suburban road. These are the issues that MAIN COMMITTEE the state government needs to take a very serious line on. It needs to build infrastructure and make our built environment an environmentally friendly and liveable area. It is critical that members like me continue to kick the state and local governments so that they get on and do their job and represent the people that they were elected to represent. Aviation: Bankstown Airport me to speak again. It is good to have some debate in this house of parliament. It is good to have some back-and-forth debate within the Main Committee chamber. There should be more of it here, and there should be more of it in the House itself, which is dominated by question time, in the public mind. We need a better interactive debate here between members battling it out, hand to hand, face to face, dealing with these fundamental issues. Like the member for Lindsay, I live in Sydney. I understand the problems that occur when you have a large city with many transport needs and demands, and with that increasing over time. Fundamentally, what I have been talking about today is one aspect of that increased use, the potential problems generated by it and the fact that a federal government needs to fix it. I have been concentrating on what is said in the draft master plan in relation to change of use and the introduction of regular public transport services. I will now quote from the master plan so that people can see that it is not just what I am saying; the argument is in the master plan. The plan says at page 105: Studies have examined the airspace implications of potential RPTregular public transportservice at Bankstown and possible air traffic conflicts arising from larger, more sophisticated aircraft that might be associated with scheduled passenger service. A February, 2001 Airservices Australia study concluded thatand remember that this was two months after the government tried to load up Bankstown Airport as the overflow airport for Sydney. The quote from the study is as follows: “The introduction of RPT operations to Bankstown will necessitate the expansion of controlled airspace around Bankstown, the introduction of ClassC airspace traffic management procedures at Bankstown and the redesign of the Bankstown procedures for arrivals from the east (runway 29 CI (C) arrivals) and departures to the east (runway 11CI (C) departures). These new arrival and departure procedures will result in increased interaction with Sydney Airport operations.” The plan goes back to its assessment of this situation: Airservices Australia notes that the Bankstown CTR is currently designed to accommodate low to medium performance general aviation aircraft. Should larger, faster commercial passenger turbo propeller or turbo jet aircraft serve the airport in the future, airspace and air traffic management procedures will need to be carefully examined to minimise conflicts between the two airports. That is a very significant paragraph. It tells us a great deal about what is intended here. The master plan continues: More recently, Airservices noted in discussions with BALBankstown Airport Ltdthat at low levels of RPT operations, ClassC airspace management procedures may only need to apply when the larger aircraft are present in the system, and the airport could otherwise continue to operate under GAAPMAIN COMMITTEE",168,Adjournment
200,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (12.56 P.m.),"by leave-I thank the government for allowingthat is, the general aviation airport procedures. This is laying the framework; they have had regular discussions about it. They would move to a different mode of operation, and they are saying that they could run those two together at a particular time. The next paragraph in this section on airspace protection says: While a significant number of RPT operations could require more general application of ClassC airspace for both arriving and departing aircraft, the number of RPT movements triggering such a change would likely need to exceed 12 or more per hour. BAL will continue to work with Airservices Australia to determine airspace and approach issues for RPT on a demand driven basis. It is as clear as clear could be when you look at this. They are proposing this master plan and saying, ‘We want to run these aircraft out on a regular basis,’ with only 100 passengers even though the BAe146 will take 128. Why? You do not have to spend the money on airport security that you do at Kingsford Smith if you have 100 or fewer. They want to run them out, they say, at 12 operations per day-oh, yeah? They can go 12 an hour without changing the airspace management, and even have an intersection at 12 an hour. But they say here: BAL will continue to work with Airservices Australia to determine airspace and approach issues for RPT on a demand driven basis. And if the demand is for 12 services an hour and up, don’t you think they are going to apply to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to do it? I say we should reject this out of hand until they come back with a sensible proposal. (Time expired) Environment: Flora and Fauna Protection Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (1.01 p.m.)-by leave-May I congratulate the member for Blaxland. I know what it takes to fight for the best interests of your community and defeat an airport in your area, and I wish him well in his fight to get the best outcomes for his electorate. That is what the whole democratic and parliamentary process is about. For my part, my fight against an airport has been won, so I can be generous! I rise to mention one other issue that grieves me, and that is the management plan for the 850 hectares that the federal government has preserved for an environmental park on the ADI site in my area. The management plan is unknown at this stage, but it was always my assumption that there would be a fence. I have done a lot of work with Warrawong sanctuary. I know exactly how they work; I have visited them north of Adelaide; I have examined this style of fence. Basically, it is a fence that is over six feet high and goes three feet into the ground, like the old rabbit-proof fence. It is electrified at the top. Three metres back from it you have another fence with signs on it saying, ‘Beware: electrified fence,’ and all that sort of thing-it is a double fence. The internal part of the fence is walked daily, and inside the fence there is usually a white hen or white duck that is basically the ‘canary down the mine’. If your spotters see some white feathers, then you figure that you have some feral cat or other animal in there preying on your native creatures and you can hunt it and exterminate it from your park. In this way, the 850 hectares of environmental land on the ADI site can be rehabilitated to become quite a nature reserve. Bird life would come back; the feral cats will not attack the nests, and so it would become a nesting area. All of your small marsupials like your tiny possums, quolls and a variety of other creatures could be seen. I understand by a recent report that there are possibly koalas on the site. If there are not, they could be introduced into a safe environment where they are not going to attacked by urban cats, because the entire site is surMAIN COMMITTEE rounded by urban areas. I am not asking for people to give up their cats and dogs, but I do want the environmental area that I have fought so hard to preserve to be preserved and to be the leading-edge environmental display and tourism attraction that it can be and that I have always envisaged along the lines of Warrawong. Warrawong is run by a private company, but our ADI ‘Warrawong’ sanctuary can be run by a community organisation such as the ADI RAG. There are various other structures. I would suggest that it not be run by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, because they really are not set up to run that model of environmental park. It is leading edge, it is visionary and I think we would have an excellent opportunity. I am very happy to work with the New South Wales government and the local councils and even look at federal funding for such a fence if the management plan goes that way. I thank the opposition for the opportunity to add those comments to today’s debate. Main Committee adjourned at 1.05 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Education, Science and Training: Staffing (Question No. 3548) 11 May 2004: (1) What is the full list of groups, divisions, branches and other work units (Minister’s department.) (2) How many full-time equivalent staff currently work in each work unit. (3) In respect of each work unit, how many staff are (a) ongoing, and (b) non-ongoing, broad-banded classifications. (4) What was the operating cost of each work unit for 2002-2003. (5) What is the budgeted operating cost for (a) 2003-2004, and (b) 2004-2005. (1) A full listing of the Department’s groups, divisions, branches and other work units is at Attachment 1. (2) The full time equivalent staff currently working in each unit in the Department is at Attachment 1. (3) The employment status of staff in terms of ongoing/non ongoing and broad-banded classifications is at Attachment 2. The data is provided down to unit level for the State Network. However, the data has been provided down to Group level only for the National Office of the Department. The reason for this is that the data requested is not readily available and it would require a significant diversion of resources to drill down to the requested level of detail for the National Office structures. It should be noted that DEST has only two broad-banded classifications: DEST Level1 encompasses APS Levels1 to 3 and DEST Level2 encompasses APS Levels4 and 5. (4) The operating cost of each work unit for 2002-03 is detailed at Attachment 3. For the purpose of this response operating cost includes general administrative expenses and employee expenses. The operating costs do not include items such as property operating expenses, legal expenses, IT expenses and research and project expenses. (5) The estimated budgeted operating cost of each work unit for 2003-04 and 2004-05 is at Attachment 4.

3,023,991 3,053,626 Australian Defence Industries: Sale (Question No. 3573) Mr Price asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 May 2004: (1) Further to the answer to my question without notice (Hansard, 11 May 2004, page 28140) and his subsequent letter to me, at the time of the execution of the ComLand Share Sale Agreement on 22 January 2004, was the size of the central park (the location of the sporting complex) on the ADI site less than 100 hectares; if so, what was its area. (2) Is expanding the central park to 100 hectares dependent on excising land from the regional park; if so, how much land needs to be excised. (3) Is excising land from the regional park dependent on state government approval; if so, has he written to the Premier of NSW; if not, why not. (4) Does the above ComLand Share Sale Agreement stipulate that $10 million be spent on the park, as claimed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, or $6 million. (5) Does the $6 million include expenditure on roads and other infrastructure other than sporting facilities. (6) In respect of the sporting facilities to be provided, (a) how many outdoor playing fields are planned and for which sports are they intended, (b) how many synthetic all-weather playing fields are planned and for which sports are they intended, (c) how long will the cycleway and walking trails be, (d) what facilities will be provided in the picnic and barbecue areas, and (e) what is the individual cost of each facility planned. (1) At the time the ComLand Share Sale Agreement was executed on 22 January 2004, it was agreed that the size of the Central Park on the former ADI site at St Marys would be approximately 100 hectares. This has not changed. (2) Consistent with the Minister for Finance and Administration’s announcement on 22 January 2004, it is intended that the Regional Park containing conservation areas listed on the Register of the National Estate will be approximately 850 hectares. Central Park will be separately developed on land currently zoned as ‘Regional Park’ or ‘Regional Open Space’, which is not listed on the Register of the National Estate. Central Park has been designed to be compatible with the currently approved uses of the land in question and its facilities will complement the intended uses of the land. (3) See answers to (1) and (2) above. (4) Under the ComLand Share Sale Agreement, Lend Lease is required to provide certain facilities, the final cost of which will not be known until the stakeholder consultation and planning approval processes have been completed. (5) See answer to (4) above. (6) As I stated in my letter of 12 May 2004, it is intended that the facilities will include outdoor playing fields, a synthetic all weather field, tennis, netball and basketball courts, cycleways, walking trails, picnic and barbecue areas. The items of detail to which you refer will not be finalised until stakeholder consultations and planning approvals are complete. Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Question No. 3582) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 25 May 2004: Further to the answer to question No. 2568 (Hansard, 10 February 2004, page 24250), will the evaluations of the Government’s $9 million media campaign titled “Here’s the prescription for a healthy Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS)”, featuring Dr James Wright, be made available to the public before the federal election; if not why not. No decision has been made yet on whether the evaluation of the PBS campaign would be publicly released. The evaluation continues to be of relevance for current Government purposes, including in the context of the Medicare campaign which incorporates information relating to the PBS. No advice is available on when the federal election is to be held. Citizenship: Promotion Campaign (Question No. 3597) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 31 May 2004: (1) Under what circumstances does the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs organise, and meet the cost of, public citizenship ceremonies as a means of promoting the value of citizenship. (2) How many such ceremonies were organised by the department in (a) 2002-2003, and (b) 20032004 to date. (3) In respect of each ceremony, (a) what was the (i) date, (ii) venue, (iii) federal electoral division, and (iv) total cost to the department, and (b) what were the names of all the Commonwealth and State Members of Parliament who were in attendance.",174,Questions On Notice

204,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Promotion campaigns over recent years have been developed around citizenship ceremonies on or close to Australia Day, Australian Citizenship Day and Harmony Day. In addition, advantage is taken of opportunities which arise throughout the year and are assessed as being of value in promoting community awareness of the meaning and value of citizenship. Special ceremonies are often used as a means to promote citizenship. Considerable promotional value is derived, at no cost to the taxpayer, from media attention given to these events. (2) (a) 42.

(2) How many (a) male, and (b) female clients of the Child Support Agency in (i) NSW, and (ii) the electoral division of Chifley receive a Child Support Payment. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) As at end of December 2003 there were: (a) (i) 194 285 male payers* in NSW; (ii) 6392 male payers* in the electorate of Chifley. (b) (i) 21 218 female payers* in NSW; (ii) 532 female payers* in the electorate of Chifley. Note: *payers have been assessed to pay child support but that does not mean all of them have actually met their child support obligation (2) As at and of December 2003 there were: (a) (i) 20 972 male payees** in NSW; (ii) 449 male payees** in the electorate of Chifley. (b) (i) 192 544 female payees** in NSW; (ii) 5791 female payees** in the electorate of Chifley Note: **Payees are those parents who are eligible to receive child support but that does not mean that all of them have actually received the child support to which they are entitled. Drugs: Postinor-2 (Question No. 3613) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 2 June 2004: (1) In respect of the sale without prescription of the drug Postinor-2, which contains the active ingredient levonorgestrel, is he aware of the article titled “Adverse reactions and emergency contraception” in The Lancet on 14 April 2001, which states that (a) several writers in the United Kingdom have remarked on the scarcity of safety data regarding the adverse reactions from use of the drug levonorgestrel, (b) 5% of women have a genetic susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer and another 5% have a genetic susceptibility to thromoembolic disease, and (c) the relevant tests will not generally be done before a pharmacist supplies levonorgestrel to women who may have stopped taking daily hormones because they had adverse reactions. (2) Can he explain how the women who take levonorgestrel without prescription will be protected against the potential side-effects of the drug. (3) Is he able to say what scientific evidence his department relies on when deciding on the sale without prescription of products containing levonorgestrel; if not, when will he require the withdrawal from sale of Postinor-2 and, if he will not, why not. (4) Can he explain how the precautionary principle applies to the supply without prescription of levonorgestrel to women; if not, why not. (1) It is important to point out that The Lancet article referred to is not a peer-reviewed report of a clinical study but is a letter to the editor, expressing a single individual’s point of view. (2) Women seeking to buy Postinor-2 for emergency contraception may be adequately assessed through the asking of a short series of questions by a doctor or a pharmacist. (3) First, the initial availability of Postinor-2 in Australia on prescription was on the advice of the expert Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, which had available to it detailed independent evaluations prepared by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of a package of information submitted by the product’s sponsor. The package included reports of a number of clinical studies in women. Second, the change from ‘Prescription Only Medicine’ to ‘Pharmacist Only Medicine’ for Postinor-2 was a recommendation of the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee, which had at hand an evaluation of an additional submission submitted by the product’s sponsor. (4) All medicines pose risks. The evaluation of new medicines is based on assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicine. Factors that are taken into account in this assessment include the proposed",188,Questions On Notice

207,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:therapeutic uses, safety concerns, the absence or availability of alternative treatments, the relative efficacy, the extent and seriousness of adverse reactions and contraindications. Australia’s system for evaluation of medicines is highly regarded internationally as amongst the best in the world. Drugs: Postinor-2 (Question No. 3614) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 2 June 2004: (1) In respect of the sale without prescription of the drug Postinor-2, which contains the active ingredient levonorgestrel, is he aware of the article by Professor Richards titled “An important drug interaction: an alternative mechanism” in the British Medical Journal volume 321, December 2000, which concluded that there is potential for serious harm which must be taken into account if levonorgestrel is to be supplied without prescription. (2) Can he explain how the precautionary principle has been applied to consider the risks described by Professor Richards to women who purchase Postinor-2 without prescription and without undergoing a medical examination, and what measures has he taken to mitigate against the harm as identified by Professor Richards. (3) When will the precautionary principle be applied to prevent the sale without prescription of Postinor-2. (1) The primary purpose of the letter written by Dr Richards and Professor Aronson in the British Medical Journal Rapid Responses 22 December 2000, was to dispute the possible mechanism of an apparent interaction between levonorgestrel taken as emergency contraception and the anticoagulant drug warfarin. It is important to note that this interaction had been postulated by Ellison and colleagues on the basis of a single case report. Clinical manifestations of such an interaction have not otherwise been observed during clinical trials or other post-market experiences with Postinor-2. Furthermore, a more recent report by Gainer EE, TremblayD and Ulmann A, In vitro studies, postmarketing data do not corroborate levonorgestrel-warfarin interaction; BMJ Rapid Responses 21 February 2003, states that “Therefore, we conclude that levonorgestrel emergency contraception presents minimal risk for patients who are fully anticoagulated with warfarin”. (2) and (3) See answer to Question No. 3613 (4). Drugs: Postinor-2 (Question No. 3615) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 2 June 2004: (1) In respect of the sale without prescription of the drug Postinor-2, which contains the active ingredient levonorgestrel, is he aware of the article titled “Drug Points” in the British Medical Journal volume 321, December 2000, which states that women receiving warfarin treatment may be at risk of an interaction between warfarin and levonorgestrel if they are prescribed the progestogen only regimen because of its apparent safety. (2) What procedures are in place for pharmacists to ensure that women who are currently taking warfarin treatment are not sold Postinor-2 or other levonorgestrel drugs without prescription. (3) Are pharmacists medically competent to make decisions about the impact on women of the sale of Postinor-2 or levonorgestrel without prescription. (4) Will he impose regulatory controls to ensure that the drug Postinor-2, and other drugs containing levonorgestrel, cannot be prescribed without prescription and before a full medical examination; if so, when; if not, why not.",191,Questions On Notice
208,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) See answer to Question No. 3614 (1). (2) The support materials provided to pharmacists by the distributor and by the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia both include a question about medication being taken. Furthermore, it would be reasonable to expect that any women of child-bearing potential who is anticoagulated with warfarin would be taking the drug under close medical supervision and would have been advised not to take any other medicines without specific advice from her doctor. It would seem highly unlikely that such a women would be seeking to purchase Postinor-2 from a pharmacist in the absence of that medical advice. (3) The National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee (NDPSC) considers that pharmacists are professionally competent to make the necessary assessment and to provide appropriate advice to allow the safe and effective use of Postinor-2. (4) I have no powers of control with respect to the access controls applied to the supply of medicines. These powers reside with the States and Territories. My powers in this area are limited to requiring the NDPSC to consider a matter and to report on its consideration. Drugs: Postinor-2 (Question No. 3616) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 2 June 2004: (1) In respect of the sale without prescription of the drug Postinor-2, which contains the active ingredient levonorgestrel, is he aware of the article titled “Emergency Contraception” in Archer Family Medicine, Volume 9, July 2000, which states that emergency contraception does not interrupt an established pregnancy and that women who obtain emergency contraception should undergo a pregnancy test first. (2) Did his department consider this finding and can he explain how a pharmacist will determine whether a woman has an established pregnancy at the time of the supply without prescription of Postinor-2 or another drug containing levonorgestrel. (3) Will he provide a copy of the evidence which supports the claim that emergency contraception drugs can prevent pregnancy by damaging the lining of the womb preventing the implantation of an embryo; if not, why not. (1) The article states that “Women who obtain their EC in the physician’s office should first be tested for pregnancy”. There is, however, alternative published advice that pregnancy testing is not normally necessary when assessing a women seeking to purchase Postinor-2. (2) An established pregnancy at the time of a request for supply of Postinor-2 can be excluded by the questioning of a women by a pharmacist or a doctor. Pharmacists are expected to exercise professional judgement and if there is doubt, it is open to them to refer the patient to a medical practitioner. (3) The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) sought agreement from the sponsor of Postinor-2 in Australia to release details of their evidence, given that the TGA treats such material as Commercial-in-Confidence because of intellectual property and other commercial considerations.

209,Mr Abbott,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,193,Questions On Notice
210,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Can he confirm that Clause 1.3 of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia’s Policy– Code of Conduct states that pharmacists must exercise professional judgment to prevent the supply of products likely to constitute an unacceptable hazard to health or the supply of unnecessary and/or excessive quantities of medicines and other products, particularly those which have a potential for abuse or dependency. (2) Can he confirm that Clause 1.4 states that pharmacists must ensure that all reasonable care is taken when disposing of medicinal products and chemicals. (3) Can he confirm that Clause 1.5 states that pharmacists shall accept responsibility for their own professional activities and for all activities undertaken under their direct supervision. (4) Can he explain how pharmacists can protect themselves against the foreseeable and non-negligible risk of harm from the supply without prescription of Postinor-2 and other drugs containing levonorgestrel. (5) Is he aware that there is authoritative medical opinion to the effect that Postinor-2 and other drugs containing levonorgestrel pose a serious risk to the user when supplied without prescription and a full medical examination and therefore constitute an unacceptable health hazard to women. (1) (2) and (3) Yes. (4) Pharmacists can assess any potential and foreseeable adverse effects of Postinor-2 by asking a series of questions before selling the product. (5) The “authoritative medical opinion” referred to is not identified. In such circumstances, it is not possible to respond in detail. Such an opinion, however, is not shared by the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee and a number of overseas countries, including the UK and France, where levonorgestrel EC is available from a pharmacist without a prescription.

(2) Can he explain why his department and the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee have accepted the definition of pregnancy they have adopted. (3) What arguments were put in support of the definition of pregnancy which has been adopted by his department and the NDPSC. (4) What was the source of the legal opinion referred to in part (2) of the answer to question No. 2997 and will he make the legal opinion available; if so, when; if not, why not. (1) (2) and (3) The Department and the NDPSC have not relied on nor sought any expert opinion to arrive at the definition of pregnancy. Legal advice sought by the Department and the NDPSC was in relation to the questions of whether morning-after pills are abortifacients and the definition of restricted goods. The definition of pregnancy was considered in the Smeaton case (R (John Smeaton on Behalf of Society for the Protection of Unborn Children) v The Secretary of State for Health) in the UK High Court on 18 April 2002 by Munby J. The definition of pregnancy was considered in the context of the definition of miscarriage. The court in Smeaton’s case held that a par-",193,Questions On Notice

(2) Can he confirm that there is no prescribing clinician on the NDPSC; if so, will he explain why. (1) Yes. (2) There is not currently a practicing GP on the NDPSC. However, there are four registered medical practitioners, all who have prescribing rights, two of whom are in active clinical practice in their speciality. Drugs: Postinor-2 (Question No. 3647) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 16 June 2004: Further to the answer to question No. 2997 (Hansard, 31 March 2003, page 26637), is he able to say whether there is a relationship between Medipharm Pty Limited and Intensive Care Products Pty Limited and, if there is no relationship between the two companies, will he explain how the sponsor referred to in part (3) of his answer can be different from that named in the consumer medicine information pamphlet for Postinor-2.

(2) Yes. (3) No. As of 1 January 2004 the Postinor-2 packaging should include ‘Pharmacist Only Medicine’ as the signal heading. States and Territories, however, may have granted a temporary labelling exemption to allow for existing pharmacy stocks of Postinor-2 with the Schedule4 packaging to be sold by pharmacists without prescription. Health: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machines (Question No. 3667) Ms George asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 22 June 2004: Will he grant Wollongong Hospital a Medicare-funded MRI service; if not, why not. On9 July 2004, I announced an Invitation to Apply (ITA) process to allocate Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) eligibility to approximately 20 additional units. These units are to be located in under-serviced areas (both metropolitan and regional) and in hospitals providing a relatively high number of private services. This process has been advertised widely and applications will close on 3 August 2004. Although Wollongong was not identified as a priority area, the ITA process is open to other areas and hospitals that have comparable claims for MBS eligibility. Wollongong Hospital is able to apply for MBS eligibility in this context. If there are insufficient applications from priority areas or if providers can make a compelling case, this will be taken into account when final decisions are made.",195,Questions On Notice
