Yes. In a new price list issued by H . V. McKay .Pty. L t d . last month,' the average portant machines and implements, is approximately 25 per cent, less than the average prices current for the same machines in the year 1920. 2. From information so far obtained, as to the prices in Australia of many lines of machinery and implements supplied by the Sunshine Harvester Works, compared with similar or comparable machinery and implements sold in New Zealand, it is calculated that the prices paid in Australia by agriculturalists here are now approximately about 25 per cent, lower than are being paid for these similar or comparable implements of foreign origin in New Zealand.

W ill he furnish to the House the number of returned soldiers who are suffering f r om tuberculosis, and also the number of wives and children dependent on them? answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Every consideration is given by the Repatriaiion Commission and its officers and advisers to all claims of ex-soldiers who have developed tuberculosis since tlieir discharge from the Forces. . In the last six years pensions and treatment have been granted in approximately 200 new cases annually. 2. Gas, hardship, and exposure are recognized as factors in the causation of tuberculosis. Of a block of 300 cases-of tuberculosis investigated, by the Repatriation Commission, the following percentages of illnesss are recorded as being factors:-Respiratory , 30.2 per cent.;"" gassing, 19.7 per cent.; pleuritic, 13.3 per cent.; gunshot wounds, 10.6 per cent.; trench fever, 3.4 per cent.; other illnesses, 10.5 per cent.; commencing on service as pulmonary tuberculosis without prior illness, 10.9 per cent.; having no illness whatsoever (on service), 1.4 per cent.

54,Mr Gardner (Robertson) [2.56].,"and the Commonwealth is indebted to the former Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Collins, who is about to take up a responsible position in London, and the other officers of the Treasury, for their able management of the public purse, although I am bound to say that the financing of the policy promulgated by this Government and supported by honourable members on this side is easy in comparison with what would be the responsibility of the officials if they had to finance the policy advocated by honourable speaking, the path which the Treasury officers are required by this Government to tread is strewn with roses. I propose to j u s t if y my support of the Government and its financial programme. worthy of note that even the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), whose analytical mind and powers of debate in regard to all questions, particularly finance, must be recognized, did not seriously criticize the financial proposals of the Government. The faults he found in the budget related almost entirely to policy. One of the brightest features of the Treasurer's administrative record is the business-like way in which the national debt is being redeemed by means of the sinking fund . It must be particularly gratifying to the people of Australia to know that the dead weight of war debt has been reduced by no less a sum than £28,500,000 w it h in the last four years. A number of remarks have been heard during this debate concerning the press, but they have been made in a more or less jocular vein. W it h those honourable members who have spoken in rather a derogatory manner about our leading newspapers, I am not in accord. press has as great traditions to live up to as Parliament itself. How long would democracy last if it were not for the freedom of the press? I think that all honourable members are glad of the publicity that they receive through the newspapers, and credit should be given where it is due. I recall some eloquent words of the honourable member for w it h humourous sarcasm, he described the triumphant march of honourable members to the Federal Capital, where, he said, we should be free from the dreadf u l influences of the Melbourne newspapers. I hope that when this Parliament reaches Canberra, those newspapers w ill strive to live up to the highest ideals of the press. One newspaper, in referring to the national debt as amounting to £458,443,637, on the 30th June last, remarked that, when figures of those dimensions were mentioned, a kind of coma came over honourable members, and they seemed to take no interest in them. I notice that this newspaper did not analyze the figures, and point out that no less than members opposite. Relatively £83,408,859 of the total represented amounts borrowed on behalf of the States, and that the war debt alone amounted to £304,546,643. Nor did it draw attention to the reduction of It is the war debt in the last four years by £28,500,000. It is interesting to know that £11,149,549 of the interest on the war debt is payable in Australia, and £5,974,806 in London. Not any of the interest is payable in New York. Of interest on the total national debt, £15,107,162 is payable in our own country, £9,181,483 in London, and £770,575 in New York. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) remarked that, although sinking funds have been provided, the Government has proceeded with further borrowing. I shall show that that is inevitable in regard to certain capital expenditure. We find that the loans raised during the past year totalled £19,609,565 : but there was a decrease of the war debt during the same period of £6,647,554, so that the net increase for the year was only £12,962,011. Of the latter sum, the larger proportion represents money borrowed on behalf of the Postal Department. One cannot exclude the Post Office from financial calThe culations of this nature, since the Government has wisely decided that it shall not be used as a taxing machine. It provides its own sinking f u n d of 1£ per cent., with which to extinguish its debts in 30 years. The surplus on the Post Office for the past year was £163,371 . the Post Office would become a taxing machine. pliment the Postmaster-General( Mr. Gibson) upon his administration of that department.

Much has been said about our soaring Customs receipts; but Australia is not the only country in which Customs receipts soar. In the United States of America the increase of Customs revenue since 1921 has been at the rate of about SO per cent. It is interesting to note the headings under which our main expenditure occurs. I have not heard any criti cism of the Government's expenditure by any one who is in accord with its policy. Honourable members oooosite criticize the expenditure because they do not approve of the policy; but if one agrees w it h the policy, most of the expenditure can be justified. The expenditure from revenue on the Commonwealth railways and Commonwealth territories is £730,347; but blame for that expenditure cannot be laid at the door of this Government. Our territories are an obligation from which we cannot escape, and our railways cannot be abandoned. understand criticism of these items of expenditure by those who have to carry the financial burden. railway is both criticized and commended, but under the agreement w it h tbe South Australian Government this Parliament had no alternative b u t to vote for its construction. admitted, it is useless to criticize the financing of the project. There is a contribution of £2.500,000 for defence. Tlint expenditure is incurred only in accordance with the defence policy of the Government, to which I think every one of its supporters has subscribed. bave an increasing repatriation expenditure, but I do not think that any honourable member would suggest that we should use the pruning knife in that department. tribute to tbe excellent administration of the Repatriation Act by the present Minister for Defence( Sir Neville Howse), who has done a great deal to improve the lot of our afflicted soldiers and war widows. Formerlyi t appeared as though the Repatriation Commission, in what it considered to be the f a it h f u l discharge of its duty, endeavoured to find every possible excuse for not granting a pension; but since the present Minister has had control of the department the policy appears to have been to discover any reason for granting one. committee desires the Government to deal in a niggardly way with those who served the nation well in its time of extremity. It is quite possible that our repatriation expenditure will be heavier next year than it is this. Our expenditure for old-age and invalid pensions has increased. This was inevitable if the pension was to retain its value, for the cost of living has increased. Mau<? indigent persons in the community after contributing directly and indirectly to the revenue of this country for many years find themselves, in many cases through no fault of their own, in financial difficulties in their latter days, and it is only right that we should help them. Bounties have also involved the Government in a considerable expenditure; but as no bounty is payable except by the decision of Parliament, criticism in that respect should be confined more to the principle than to the amount of money involved. The Government always has the most careful inquiry made into the One can condition of an industry before it in troduces a proposal for the payment of a bounty to it ; and it is proper that we The north-south should ensure that industries are carried on efficientlv before we assist them in this way. Those who have taken action to assist in marketing their own produce have merited the assistance that the GoI f that is vernment has given them. I am particularly interested in the dairying industry. Unquestionable the Dairy Export Control Act. passed by this Parliament, which has been supported by legislation in various States, has done a good deal to assist the industry; and dairy producers We are now conducting their affairs more efficiently and placing a better article on the markets abroad.

Mpr. FOBDE -What is the opinion of the honourable member in regard to allowance postmasters and postmistresses? honourable members, have made representations to the Government to rectify anomalies in respect to these officers. The Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson) has in formed us that the allowance paid to some of them exceeds the revenue received through the oflice that they conduct. Altogether, when one carefully examines the position it is quite easy for him to discover where the so-called vanishing surpluses have gone. The notable reduction in income taxation since 1921-22 of 47 per cent, has been of great value to the people, but there is one matter which affects the imposition of company taxation on co-operative butter factories that I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer. MrH . F . Mason, a public accountant in Sydney, who has had many years' experience in taxation matters, and besides being in terested in primary production is an auditor for several butter factories, has done excellent work in ventilating this grievance. The practice has been to tax the balance of profit remaining at the end of the year's operation in the profit and loss account of these co-operative butter companies. These companies are not operating primarily to make a profit on their trading; their main purpose is to improve butter manufacturing methods and the standard of our butter, so that it will command a ready sale. In these circumstances, I submit that the balance remaining in their profit and loss account at the end of their trading year is not profit in the ordinary sense of the word; it is simply an amount which they axe holding for the suppliers of their cream. Some of the factories have overcome the difficulty by creating what is called a deferred payment account, into which, at the end of the year, they transfer whatever amount stands in the profit and loss account. In this way they show practically no profit.' But some of the companies do not do this. Not long ago the Treasurer introduced a bill which was designed' to relieve companies in this position, but unfortunately it has not They should be well had that effect. brought forward after a discussion between the Commissioner of Taxation and these co-operative companies. tive butter companies represented ? from the Treasurer that the dairy companies were represented. They certainly should have been able to look after their own case. I am putting the case as It has been presented to me. Under section 4 of the amending act passed last session, they were exempt from taxation on the amount distributed as dividends, but the section stipulates that 90 per cent, of the commodities acquired by and 90 per cent, of the commodities disposed of by a company shall be acquired by or sold to its own members. If that provision of the act were strictly interpreted no cooperative dairy company could secure any relief under it , as while 90 per cent, of its supplies are acquired from its members only a few pounds of butter are sold to them. I quote the following from what the Commissioner of Taxation had to say with regard to the taxation of butter companies :The factory is held by a special legal entity called a company, which in turn consists of the separate individual dairy farmers who, through the company, are manufacturing their butter, &c, under modern methods which result in greater individual profit to the members than they could have secured if they worked individually. Many co*-operative companies of the kind mentioned propose to distribute the whole of the income received to the suppliers, and to make levies on the suppliers for the purpose of creating an assets reserve fund to meet the cost of reconstruction of factories and the installation of the most modern plant and machinery whenever it becomes available. A levy of this kind wonld not form part of the income of the company and would not be taxable to it under the act Some co-operative companies and societies formed for the treatment, manufacture, and selling of primary products, which distribute the whole of their surplus profits to members",22,Budget 1926 27

63,Mr Gardner,"I am glad to learnand suppliers, at all times have a small undistributed surplus of profit, because it is a most difficult inatter to arrange business affairs in large companies so as to bring about an exact equalization of aocounts and complete distribution of profit. It has been claimed that any surplus which exists is an amount whicli justly belongs to the suppliers of the company. The surplus is insufficient to pay a bonus, and is absorbed in payments to suppliers during the succeeding months. I trust that the Treasurer w ill go into this matter with a view to rectifying the anomalies which have been brought under his notice. D r . EAELEPAGE -matter w i th the, Commissioner of Taxation. to the Government'3 proposal to abolish the per capita payments to the States. It occurred to me'when the Attorney-General spoke on this subject the other night that he most effectively answered the objections to the Government's proposal. He certainly made a convincing reply to the case presented for Victoriai n the pamphlet issued by Sir Alexander Peacock. The framers of the Constitution could suggest no definite provision to deal with this matter, and only a temporary expedient was adopted. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) has suggested an annual reduction of 2s. 6d. per head in the per capita payment to the States. But, in my view, that would not be as satisfactory as the straight-out proposal of the Government. Under the right honourable member's proposal the position would still be left indefinite, and there would be a recurrence of the trouble with the States every year. Sof a r as any moral right of the States to the per capita payment is concerned, I think the claim is sufficiently met by reference to the fact that the amount required to meet war expenditure, interest, repatriation, and old-age and invalid pensions exceeds at the present time the total revenue from customs and excise. We are not in this matter able to make comparisons in considering the case put Up by the States, because the State authorities have so f a r supplied no figures. I consider that the Attorney-General made a strong point when he referred to the fact that taxation has been reduced in the fields of taxation which the Treasurer proposes to hand over to the State authorities. As the figures submitted by the Treasurer were JUL Y , 1926.] Budget, 1926-27. 4481 prepared by the officers of his department, I have no doubt that they can be relied upon. The principle upon which the Treasurer depends, that those who spend money should have the responsibility of raising it , is sound, though it does not seem to be very palatable to the State authorities. They should submit figures in this matter before they can expect that any serious consideration will be given to their claim. The Treasurer's proposal possesses the advantage that it will, in time, do away with duplication. away 'with it to a very great extent. The honourable member for Darwin( Mr. I wish now to refer Bell) raised some difficulties in connection with the matter, and specially referred to the difficulties which he considers likely to arise from the practice in the Central Office of aggregating incomes derived from more than one State, but I think it will be found that the difficulties suggested by the honourable member can be overcome. When the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) was dealing with this subject, he gave us the cheerful news that when the party to which he belongs comes int o oflice, it will re-impose the land tax. The land tax is really misnamed. It was introduced in 1910 with the avowed object of bursting up large estates. In this connection, I direct attention to the fact that the interference of the Federal authorities in matters that should be left to the State authorities, which has in this debate been complained of, is not new. Settlement on the land is essentially a State matter, and the legislation imposing the Federal land tax represented a distinct interference with that concern of the State authorities. The tax did not result in the breaking up of large estates to anything like the extent that was anticipated by those who introduced it . F if t y per cent, of the revenue derived from the land tax throughout the Commonwealth is collected upon city and town properties, the owners of which are in a position to pass on the tax. In their case, the tax is really an income tax. tal, but the owners of the properties taxed in cities and towns are in a position to pass the tax on. much more than half the revenue derived from the land tax is collected on city and town properties.",23,Budget 1926 27

The honourable member for Robertson must have been absent from the Chamber when that soeech was delivered. I wish now to refer to our debt to the British Government, matter of great importance. should be made by the Commonwealth Government to secure a reduction of the interest rate on that debt which originally amounted, in round figures, to^ £92,500,000. A funding agreement was entered into with the B ritish Government in 1921, under which we agreed to pay 6 per cent, on our original indebtedness, the interest on the loan being 5 per cent., and the repayment of t h e principal, 1 per cent. ment underthat funding agreement is, according to the budget, £5,548,000. Since 1921, the debt has been reduced to £86,000,000. have paid to the British Government since the agreement was made is, approximately, £25,000,000, of which £5,000,000 represents repayment, and £20,000,000 interest. But the British Government has given considerably better terms to Italy, and is at present negotiating a similar agreement with France. As eA'ery one knows, Britain has funded her debt with the United States at the interest rate of 3 per cent. If a i l to see why this country should be committed to an agreement I am prepared to which compares unfavorably w i th those extended to foreigners. In view of the sacrifice that this young country made during the war-nearl y 60,000 of our dead lie beneath the fields of Europe to-dayand the heavy burden of debt that we are carrying to-day, we are at least entitled to the consideration extended by the United States to Great Britain, or by GreatB r it a in to It a l y .

The Right Honourable P h i l i p Snowden, speaking in the House of Commons, saidThere was a total indebtedness to this country (Great Britain) of about £2,100,000,000, and that all that had been received up to the present was a first instalment of £2,000,000 of the Italian debt. We and the other dominions, apart from Italy, are the only nations that are attempting to redeem our indebtedness to Great Britain. Mr Snowden continuedThe Italian debt amounted to about £600,000,000. There was no provision in the agreement concluded with the Italian GovernThis is a ment for the payment of a single penny of An effort interest. Italy was to pay, upon the average, for the next 62 years, £4,000,000 a year, or altogethter about £250,000,000. The cost of that to Great Britain, funded upon the terms of the American debt, was £1,500,000,000. The difference between those two figures was the burden which, for the next 62 years, would rest upon the shoulders of the taxpayers of this country. Italy's debt amounts to £600,000,000. The British Government has, in effect, written down Italy's debt to a value of £75,000,000, under the terms of the Our annual payagreement.

I have careembarks upon one of f u l l y read the Attorney-General's speech, and I do not agree that he answered conclusively the arguments of the right honourable member, who said that the main roads proposals of the Government were an invasion of a sphere of activity specifically reserved by the Constitution to the States. he quoted the words of the Attorney General two years ago. tradicted the right honourable member's statement. tion. point raised by the right honourable member for Balaclava by saying that the grant for the construction of main roads was a form of financial assistance to the States.

In fact we have been told to-day that the Attorney-General is issuing a writ against the South Australian Government because it wants to build and provide for the roads in the way action will open up a very interesting constitutional question, and no doubt in due course the High Court will declare just how far the Commonwealth may invade a State sphere. will not be proceeded w i th unless the States agree to it . settled.

Adresse Telegraphique Serum-Geneve, Hotel de l'Hermitage, Nice. 10th February, 1926. Dear Mr Walsh, I apologize for not having answered your S 1 again and quite unable to attend to my correspondence. You ask me: 1. WhetherI am satisfied that I can cure explain that, before I entered into an agreeconsumption in any stage. This is not a question for me to answer, as and its other representatives how much funds I should not express an opinion on my own were required to carry on the work. In the work.

You have received a pamphlet called, ""Evidence con-, cerning the Spahlinger Treatment."" It was edited by a group of English philanthropists, A t the present time, of among them Sir Arthur Stanley, chairman of the British Bed Cross Society. If you read this pamphlet carefully, you will be able to form an opinion regarding the efficacy of my sera and vaccines. The remaining 5s. 6d. 2. You wonder why I do not sell my treatI ment to any government? I am quite prepared to sell my vaccines for cattle, but I do not wish to commercialize or to sell my treatment for human beings. 1 Either course would proshould have published all details concerning my method long ago, had I not feared that it would have enabled commercial concerns to prepare sera and vaccines claimed to have been made according to my formulae (although this would not have been the case), and put a large quantity of useless preparations on the market, thence discrediting my work, and thus depriving sufferers of tuberculosis from its benefits. There is no reason why I should not sell my 'bovine vaccine, which would be of a great economic value to the purchasers, and supply me with the necessary funds to carry on my work on human tuberculosis. 3. Why do I not treat test cases? When I first started to treat patients in The Minister also said 191.2, I was faithfully promised that, if these cases would recover, I would get all financial assistance I needed). , These {patients have : recovered; but, in spite of it, I have had to spend my own fortune to go on with the work. In 1913, when I started to work in London hospitals, I was told that if only 50 per cent, of the cases under treatment would get well, I would have the world at my feet. Not only did these patients get well in 1913-14, hut the majority of them are well and alive to-day. Yet my struggles are not over. He saw I have taken one after another test' cases, but no official help has materialized. At present, I am in a difficult situation to take test cases, as I only dispose of partial sera and vaccines. Is it fair to form an opinion on a treatment when only one-third of it is available? Yet, with my partial sera and vaccines, I have saved many sufferers, but I do not think I am justified in making an official test with partial treatment. There, would be no necessity for preparing complete treatment if the partial one was just as effective. 4. You ask me whether I had not returned uestions at once. Since you left, I have been unconditional grants made to me? I have not. You have probably in mind my agreement with the British Bed Cross Society.

He added that the building of the two 10,000ton cruisers, two submarines, and a seaplane carrier was proceeding, and that the Government had agreed to make a payment to New South Wales of £135,000 as a subsidy towards the cost of a floating dock at Newcastle on the understanding that it would be capable of accommodating the new cruisers. He further stated that during the past financial year a satisfactory advance had been made with the developmental services, including the enlistment of personnel for the cruisers and submarines, the extension of oil fuel facilities, the training of the Royal Australian naval reserves, and the purchase of munitions, artillery, equipment, &c. there had been substantial progress in the-building of munition factories and in air force buildings at Point Cook, Laverton, and Richmond, and that additional personnel would be provided during 1926-27 for the manning of the submarines. most parts of the world, a few persons who believe that we should not spend any money on national defence, but should rely more or less upon chance. persons are connected with political life. MrD . CAMERON -Perhaps not; but there are a few bf them, even in Australia. the other extreme, and urge the spending of f a r more money than it is possible for us to dream of spending. great majority of the people, however, believe that it is the first duty of a national government to see that adequate provision is made for the defence of the country, if , unfortunately, we should ever be called upon to defend it . making that provision, of course, due regard must be had to our financial capacity and our man-power. nized that such a defence policy is necessary as a precautionary measurea form of national insurance, and that on no account must it be allowed to lapse. These are the views of the citizens who to-day are, perhaps, more or less concerned about this matter, after having read the last report of the Inspector General of the Commonwealth Military Forces, SirH a r r y Chauvel. The subiect of defence should not be treated in this or any other Parliament as a party one. That Australians are a peace-loving people cannot be denied. We wish to be always on friendly terms with neighbouring nations, and to carry on the development of this country unmolested. We are not influenced by the ancient hatreds and fears which for centuries past have disturbed the peace of Europe, and which even to-day make it difficult for some of the older nations to feel that their security is assured. Althoughi n a time of great emergency Australians have shown their readiness to leave their callings in city and country, and were prepared to fight in foreign lands for a cause they considered just, they are essentially 'a peaceloving people; no other nation has a greater desire to be left alone to work out its own destiny. We must recognize, howHe pointed out that ever, that the best way of securing a lasting peace is to place the country in a position to defend itself. The League of Nations is the hope of the world, but while there remain outside that League countries which represent one-fourth of the There are in AustraUa, as in population of the globe, it w ill be severely handicapped in its beneficent work. Unproductive expenditure, such as that on defence, is always begrudged. But as we expend large sums of money to protect ourselves against ill-doers for in stance, we maintain prisons and provide police forces, light our streets, and buy locks and keys-w e should There are also those who go to recognize that it is necessary to take precautionary measures against a possible enemy from overseas. The Prime MinisThe ter, in a statement the other day, removed the impression from the minds of some people that the report of the Inspector-General of M i l it a r y Forces referred to the Commonwealth's general defence undertakings. It refers, of In course, to m i l it a ry expenditure only. I should like to quote briefly from the in troductory and general remarks in the It is recogreport, in which Lieutenant-General Chauvel statesBefore considering the various aspects of the policy of the Military Board during the past year, I desire once more to offer a brief review of the military situation of Australia which has led to the adoption of that policy. In my report submitted on 31st May, 1924, I referred to the effects upon the defence of Australia brought about by the reduction of-the British Navy to a one-power standard. I wish again to draw attention to the fact that the dependence of Great Britain upon open sea communications, which is the",30,Budget 1926 27
92,Mr Fenton,"I do not think thoseprimary factor in determining the location of the fleet in peace and its employment in war, may render it impossible for the navy to operate effectively in the Pacific for some time after the outbreak of war. Although, therefore, it is true that the defence of this country is ensured primarily 'by the British Fleet, so long as there remains a possibility that the fleet may ibe retained in war in European waters, the forces of Australia must continue to 'be regarded as the ultimate means of defence and the primary means of obtaining that local security which alone w ill enable the British Fleet to concentrate its maximum strength at the decisive point, wherever it may be, unhampered by the concurrent necessity of providing for the immediate local defence of Australia. In my report, above quoted, I defined in the following terms the policy which, following upon the agreements reached at the Washington Conference, and, in view of the existing financial stringency, had been adopted by the M i l it a r y Board:(a) To maintain the divisional organization in nucleus form within the limits prescribed by parliamentary votes; to produce and train the leaders (omcers and non-commissioned officers); to inculcate the elements of discipline in the annual quotas of trainees who comprise the nucleus, and to lay the foundation for more advanced training. (b) To procure ( if possible, within a fixed time) the requirements of the army in ammunition, and other necessary stores. These aims remain unchanged. They cannot and are not expected to result in the production of an army capable from the moment of mobilization of undertaking active operations. They are designed rather to retain an organization whicli w ill permit the army to be mobilized, to provide for its equipment, and to ensure that, at a time of crisis, there shall be available, in sufficient numbers and w i th sufficient training, leaders capable of completing the training of the army on scientific lines, and of leading it in war upon sound and uniform principles, provided that time is available in which to complete the training of the rank and file. The fact that time is necessary, after the outbreak of war, in which to complete the training of the army, is a considerable risk in itself. The adoption of . a policy which would eliminate this risk is not possible, on account of the limitations imposed by the present restricted financial votes. It w ill be readily realized that, as a result of the late war, and of the considerable development which has taken place since the war, the armament and equipment of an army have undergone marked increases, whilst war experience and constant improvements in design have led to more scientific methods in their employment. In consequence, the organization of an army has become more complex, and its training wider and more varied. The co-operation of aircraft, the employment of [172] artillery, the speed, radius of action, and power of tanks, and the armajment of infantry, have all undergone marked development. These, together with an ever-increasing employment of mechanical means of transportation, are extending the scope of military training to an almost unprecedented degree,, and are making ever more difficult in war the tasks of commanders, staffs, and regimental leaders. It is apparent tliat these developments have increased the cost of military preparation very considerably. A comparison of theamounts expended on military preparation before and since the war is, therefore, relevant. The amounts are inclusive of a l l military expenditure other than war expenditureFinancial Year.

He also points o u t t h a t the nucleus organization requires expansion, a n d t h a t the arrangements for t r a in in g leaders are inadequate. The onl y other p o r t i o n of t h e r e p o rt w h i c h I wish to quote is the f o l l o w in g remarks on coast defences:Owing to the change in the naval situation and the increased range of naval guns since the late war, the armament of our forts has given cause for grave anxiety, and the War Office was asked for the advice of the Com-' mittee of Imperial Defence regarding their re-armament. The recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence were received on the 11th December, 1925. The approximate cost of carrying out these recommendations has 'been estimated by the Military Board, and a programme .submitted covering a certain period. If this programme is approved, it will be quite impossible to provide for any portion of it out of the normal allocation made to the Military Forces from the Defence vote. As we are frankly depending on the British Navy for protection from invasion, it is considered that the provision of secure bases to enable its ships to operate in our waters is of it would cost £50,000,000 a year for sufficient importance to warrant special financial provision being made. It is recommended that this course be adopted, and the work commenced without delay. The policy referred to by Lieutenant General Chauvel is intended to retain an organization which w ill permit the army to be mobilized, to provide for its equipment, and to ensure that at a time of crisis there shall be available in sufficient numbers, and with sufficient training, leaders capable of completing the training of the army on scientific lines, and of leading it in war upon sound and uniform prin ciples, provided that time is available in which to complete the training of rank and file. He states quite definitely that to place the Australian army in a reasonable state of preparedness is not possible with the funds now available. He refers to the shortage in permanent personnel, and points out that this is one of the main obstacles in the way of the training of leaders. W it h regard to the provision of equipment, he points out that although a.commencement has been made with the munitions programme approved by the Government, it will be many years before the requirements of the army are met. It is pointed out that the increases necessary, to which attention has been drawn, are not designed to augment the scale of war preparation beyond the nolicy adopted during the past three years. They are necessary increases in expenditure if we are to conserve our power to mobilize, equip, and train an army of two cavalry divisions and five in f a n t r y divisions effectively. The Prime Minister referred to the Government's policy of defence generally, particularly to naval expenditure; but he did not answer the Inspector-General's statement that the necessary funds had not been made available to carry out the definite policy laid down in 1924-25 as regards military expenditure. I appeal to the Government to in f o rm this House and the country whether provision can be made in thp direction indicated Chauvel. Defence and migration that are indissolubly other. take the defence of a continent with a coast-line of 12,000 miles, and the Minister stated the other day that to attempt Mr D. Cameron. ten years at least. The developmental commission shortly to be appointed, w ill , I hope, recognize the wisdom of encouraging industries which, in time of war, can be used for war purposes. We should do all we can to manufacture in this country engines for aeroplanes and other forms of mechanical transport. It is astonishing that hardly any tools are made in this country. I doubt whether there is a saw, chisel, or hammer used in the Commonwealth that is manufactured here. There are two important facts that we must not overlook in connection with defence. The first is that we are dependent upon a citizen force army. In the great test of the war our citizen forces proved worthy, and I doubt whether there could be any greater tribute to their worth than the success of the Australian Imperial Force. The same encouragement is not given to the citizen forces to-day as was given to them before the war, and while expenditure continues to be curtailed, I am afraid our citizen forces must lag. Under existing conditions young men are not encouraged to serve their country in that force. We depend for our defence todav, as in the past, primaril y upon the British Navy, and there is no denying that in the event of trouble it might be some time before that Navy could come to our assistance. A country without coastal defences, without an army, and without any organization for the rapid mobilization of an army, is a very tempting lure to an enemy. I again appeal to the Government to treat this report, as I have no doubt it must, with the seriousness it deserves. Having had the privilege of knowing Lieut -General Chauvel for many years, I can say that he would not make such a report without having good ground for it . It is worthy of the consideration, not only of the Government and Parliament, but also of by SirH a r r y the people of this country. I should like to refer also to the proare subjects blem of repatriation. Each budget speech linked with each makes shorter reference to the' work of Six million people cannot underrepatriation, thus indicating that the problem is gradually becoming a smaller one. In my opinion, it has now reached a most difficult stage, by reason of so many of the main to be dealt with being of a difficult nature. speech, statedThe cost of war pensions is still increasing owing to"" the birth of children to pensioners and to liberalizing the conditions under which pensions are granted. No immediate reduction in the numbers applying for medical attention is anticipated. Certain factors, such as increased age, progress of disease, and complications of war disabilities with the ordinary diseases of civil life are likely to cause the numbers to be maintained throughout the ensuing financial year. The conditions under which pensions who wore being paid a pension of £1 3s. 6d. are granted have been made more liberal. per week, or, if they had dependents, £2 2s., One of the most difficult problems we 2s. have to deal with concerns the aggravareceives a minimum of £1 3s. 6d. per week, tion of pre-enlistment disability.

A comparison of the pensions widow. Tlie whole question has been payable throughout the Empire discloses thoroughly considered, and it has been decided that the provisions of the Australian that war widows without dependent children Soldiers' Eepatriation Act are indeed shallweek liberal. Only one of the various counper tries engaged in the great war has in widow's other income, if any, ensure to her a any sense improved on them, and that is total income of £2 2s. per week Consideration Italy. I understand that the Repatriahas also been given to soldiers' widows who, by tion Act passed by the Italian Parliare-marrioge, ment places the onus on the Government only two years after re-marriage. Some of of proving that an ex-soldier has not the widows have married a second, and even suffered through his war service, whereas a third time, and the Government has decided in our case the onus is on the soldier to that prove that he has so suffered. In that ceive a living allowance if she is without way, perhaps, it may be said that the adequate means of support after the death of Italian Government treats its men more her second, or subsequent husband. liberally than the Australian Government; but, when one takes into account the amount of pension actually payable, the position of the Australian soldier is far superior to that of the ex-service men of any other country. Other factors which contribute to the betterment of war-disabled soldiers in the Commonwealth are, that pensions are payable in respect of their wives when they marry after their discharge, and also in respect of their children born subsequent to their discharge. I think these conditions apply cases that reonly to Australia. In certain cases of dependants, where the circumstances The Treasurer, in his budget justify, living allowances are granted, in addition to the war pension. At the 30th Jnne, .1926, 252,609 pensions were in force in Australia, and our annual liability was £7,217,704. According to the latest figures available, 6,435 soldiers' widows are receiving pensions. I feel that these widows should be guaranteed a minimum pension of £ 2 2s. per week. The Ministerf o r Defence recently informed the House thatThe Government has decided that widows shall be sure of an income of not less than £2 Thus, under the act, a soldier's widow £2 2s. per week where the widow has dechildren or wliere her circumstances dependent child or children, the practice has and is, to grant tlie £2 2s. maximum, therefore, automatically loses his or her pension, some hardship is thrown on the receive as pensions either the £1 3s. 6d. minimum provided under the act, or such larger amount as will, together with the have forfeited their pension, which, under the present regulation, continues for a soldier's widow whose pension has been cancelled because of her re-marriage may reI t is my opinion that these widows should receive a minimum pension of £2 2s. per week, and I trust that the Minister w ill again give this matter his sympathetic consideration. Because a soldier's widow is t h r if t y , and does her best to augment her income by going out to work, she should not be liable to have her pension reduced. I think she should be placed in the same position as a soldier, whose pension is payable irrespective of whether he is in receipt of an income of £1,000, £2,000, or even more a year. If the Government -would accede to this request it would act graciously and generously towards these widows. Up to the 31st March, 1926, the Commonwealth had spent. £161,132,865 in making provision for its soldiersWar pensions General repatriation benefits Waj Service Homes Land settlement War gratuity (cash or bonds) 27,471,211 £161,132,865 The Soldiers' Children Education Scheme is a praiseworthy' part of our repatriation activities. Underi t assistance is granted to the children of deceased and totally and permanently incapacitated scldiers from the age of thirteen years to complete an apprenticeship in trades or for training for professional careers. The allowances are of a liberal character, ranging from £26 to £78 per annum, if the beneficiary is livin g at home; and from £52 to £130 per amrum if the beneficiary is away from home. These amounts are in addition to any' pension that may be payable. These children are thus afforded the opportunity to obtain competence to follow skilled trades and technical or professional careers, deal w it h at present has regard to suband without it many of them would d r if t efficient ex-soldiers.

Of the amount of £1,411,373, due as quarterly instalments at the 30th June, 1926, in respect of soldiers' instalments, exclusive of land settlement, the amount of £1,264,454 was paid by the due date, leaving £146,919, or 10.40 per cent, arrears.

[4.56] -The items that I wish to deal with refer specially to the Northern Territory. £53,000is provided for ""construction of buildings and roads, engineering services, and water boring "" in North Australia ; and an amount of £30,500 is provided for similar undertakings in Central Australia. It is gratifying to me that so much has been earmarked for developmental work of this character. can be no question but that the construction of roads and the provision of water conservation schemes are absolutely necessary before we can hope to settle our empty spaces. An amount of £3,000 is provided for "" construction and filling of petrol tank "" in North Australia, and, of course, it must be apparent to honourable members that the provision of a satisfactory petrol supply is a necessary corollary to the roads policy. When the construction of the oil tank at Darwin was first proposed, I understood that it was the intention of the Government to make petrol supplies available to settlers in the Territory at a reasonable cost; but I was sorry to learn from the statement made a few days ago by the. Minister for Works and Railways( MrH ill ) , that that point had not been definitely decided. The provision of petrol tanks is just as necessary in Central Australia as it is in North Australia, and I suggest to the Government that it should use Port Augusta as a base for supplying Central Australia with bulk petrol. There are sufficient public bodies in North Australia to ensure that any public money available for expenditure there will be spent economically. The North Australia Commission will shortly be appointed, but already North Australia has aland board, a Government resident, a public works department, and other public departments with staffs adequate to carry out the necessary road and water schemes there. Shipping is also available to facilitate the transport of material, and there is a railway for its inland transport, extending over a length of 200 miles. In respect of these facilities, the northern part of the Territory is in a much better position than the south. New legislation has. been passed, cutting off the north of the Territory above the 20th parallel of south latitude, and I point out that for the central Australian half of the Territory, no organization whatever has been provided to administer the expenditure of the proposed vote of £30,500. I am complaining, not that the northern part of the I find that an amount of Territory has been , provided with the necessary organization, but that none has been provided for central Australia. A l t ogether, too much dependence is there placed upon a police sergeant, who has to carry out his work w i th native labour, which is more or less, useless. In view of the fact that this police sergeant has many .There duties to perform, and superintends an area of over 250,000 square miles, it is not too much to claim that his exclusively police duties as sufficient to occupy the whole of his time. The policy of development for central Australia -should be placed in the hands of a competent board. I agree that provision for transport and water is fundamental to the development of the Northern Territory, and 1 trust that no time w ill be lost i u giving effect, in a practical manner, to the policy proposed. Water is urgently required on the stock routes. We have been told from time to time t h a t 'there are wells 40 or 50 miles apart on the stock routes, and some people seem to think that that is all that is necessary for travelling stock. If only one mob of cattle were travelling, the water supply available might be sufficient; but when eight or ten mobs are being travelled, as was the case recently, the cattle may have to go for weeks without a drink. The future development of the Northern Territory must depend to a very great extent on the progress made by the pastoral and mining industries, and every proposal in the interests of those industries should be favourably considered by the Government. I make the statement without any personal feeling that Ministers in charge of the Northern Territory in the past have not been sufficiently conversant with its conditions. I trust that the new Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Glasgow), whose duty it will be to frame a policy for the development of the Territory, will personally visit it , not on a flying trip through the country, but in such a way as to enable him to see the country from all angles, to meet the people, and learn their requirements. If he does that, he will be in a position to understand references to the Territory made in this Parliament. In view of the fact that a fair sum of money is available, it should",31,Budget 1926 27

This might be done without loss to the wealth, because if the cost of obtaining water is spread over a number of years, the settlers will be quite prepared to repay money expended for this purpose. are vast areas in the Territory occupied, and if the Government were to put down bores in those areas, a great portion of the country would be placed under stock in a comparatively time. asking too much of the pioneer to blaze a track and also provide the water supplies necessary before it is possible to stock the country. should dognet 100,000 square miles of country, subdivide the area, and provide water supplies for the subdivided If that course were followed, there would be more settlement five years than there is to-day. honourable member for Wakefield Foster) has told the House on numberless occasions that Central Australia cally regulates tlie meat markets of a considerable portion of Australia. country can do that, in its present undeveloped state, I suggest that with sympathetic treatment, velopment of mining, its pastoral possibilities are unlimited. should try to overcome existing ties, not in the course of many years to come, but during the next few years.

The cotton, peanuts, and producers of mineral ores. rulin g freights are 100 per cent, higher than this offer, which represents an in creased subsidy of only £3,700 for a shipping service which, in addition, would cater for the whole of the coastal trade of the north. Goods would be shipped direct from the south to the northern ports, instead of being landed at Darwin and transhipped, in some cases, 400 or 500 miles back over the route of the steamer. We should consider the difference of £3,700 in the light £ s. d. more of a subsidy to primary producers than of. a subsidy to the shipping company. Only by bringing about a reduc10 0 0 tion in fares and freights, shall we be able to settle people in the territory at a reasonable cost. Reduced freights would be a great factor in developing the min ing industry, apart altogether from the .., .. . . 8 10 0 agricultural and pastoral industries. It would make possible the shipping of crude ore from the northern ports, and the beneficial result would more than j u s t if y the additional expenditure of £3,700.

It is as pineapples, of whichl large quantities can grown in the territory, would also be would be offered to growers and shippers of The reasonable rates of freight quoted, should materially reduce the cost of living in the territory, and this alone should promote development and settlement. In climatic conditions similar to those experienced in the Nortliern Territory, especially in tlie coastal districts, it is almost a necessity thiat at least women aiid children should be able to visit the southern and cooler States certainly every two or three years. It is expected that the very reasonable fares quotedin connection with the service, will afford facilities in this direction. It is also certain that a tourist trade will be built up which will allow of the advantages of the territory being brought prominently beforo the investing public. Alternatively I beg to make the -followins: offer:Steamer-As above. Ports of call-As above. Duration of voyage-As ahove.

Annual subsidy to be paid by the department to the contractors Eleven thousand pounds (£11,000) per annum. Thle advantages of the above alternative lie in the fact that it provides for low rates from Darwin to the south, thus enabling Northern Territory products to find markets which, at the present time, are difficult, if not impossible. It also provides for regular communication with the McArthur and Victoria Rivers. While this alternative proposal does not entail the expenditure necessary under proposal No. 1, it should be pointed out that the advantages offered with regard to tlie reduction in the cost of living in the territory, and the cheaper passenger fares, which mean so much to the resident in the territory, are not secured. Mr Nelson. The present service does not supply those -ports at all. That tender was rejected, although it showed a considerable reduction in the freights and fares. But, subsequent to that, a tenderf o r a service from Melbourne to Darwin, at the same time carrying on the coastal trade of the Northern Territory, was rejected, and a contract let to the same tenderer for a service in Territory waters alone, at the price for which he was prepared to carry on the service between Melbourne and Darwin. Surely the reasoning of the Government is beyond the comprehension of man. This matter vitally affects the development of the Territory. I have shown that the present high rates of freight could be considerably reduced if the Government were in any way anxious to settle people in the Territory. £ *. d. In the Estimates, under the heading ""Lands and Surveys DepartmentEncouragement of primary production,"" an amount of £4,000 is provided. As that sum does not appear elsewhere in the Estimates, we ' must take it for .. 22 10 0 granted that it applies to the whole of the Northern Territory, and not to No r t h Australia or Central Australia. Every 15 0 0 form of production comes under the heading of primary production, with the exception of mining, for which there is provision in the Estimates. Primary production includes the pastoral industry, in connection with which, under certain con£ s. d. ditions, £ 6 8 0 can be granted to intending settlers. But how that grant can be .. 3 5 0 made under the expenditure provided for in the Estimates is a conundrum to me. Primary production includes agriculture, mixed farming, saw-milling, paint production, and fisheries, including pearlshell fishing, trepanging, and drying and canning of fish. One is entitled to ask the Government whether it is serious in its endeavour to develop primary production in the Northern Territory when only £4,000 is placed on the Estimates for that purpose How much closer settlement could be effected for that expenditure ? Honourable members have said that it takes £3,000 to place one settler on the land under repatriation and other schemes, and yet only £4,000 is provided for the settlement of 500,000 square miles of territory. The honourable member for Riverina( M t . Killen) recently stated that the Barkly Tableland was highly suitable for closer settlement, and that that country could carry 10,000,000 sheep. If that were brought about, the problem of developing the Northern Territory would be more or less solved; but. how would it be possible to place 10,000,000 sheep on the Barkly Tableland when the expenditure is limited to £4,000? The Territory and its development are being sacrificed on the altar of ignorance. The honourable member for Riverina said that about 20,000 acres of that country would comprise a decent holding for a settler, and I agree with him. LandB ill was before the House, I endeavoured to impress upon honourable members the fact ings should be 20,000 acres, but my appeal fell on deaf ears. The honourable member for Riverina also said that the Barkly Tableland should be resumed for sheep-raising purposes. I fail to see how resumption can take place under the existing land laws of the Territory. I know that existing legislation provides for resumption of land for agricultural purposes; several times during the debate I was told that there could be no resumption for pastoral purposes. I may be told that the act makes provision for the resumption of land, and that, therefore, the tableland, which the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) declared to be capable of carrying 10,000,000 sheep, can be made available for closer settlement. But m y view, as a layman, is that no lessee in the Northern Territory need, under existing legislation, surrender any of his land u n t i l the completion of his lease 42 years hence. is true that one-fourth of the area of the lease w ill be resumable in 1935, and a furthe r one-fourth may be resumed in 1945, but the lessee may, by giving two years' notice of his intention so to do, elect to sub-divide an area equal to that which the Minister would be entitled to resume. In other words, when resumption is due in 1935, the lessee may, by merely, giving notice of his intention to sub-divide one-fourth of his area, escape compulsory resumption, and transfer the land to a dummy. That ruse cannot be defeated, because the difficulty of distinguishing between the dummy and the genuine settler is well recognized. A l though the Barkly Tableland is very suitable for sheep-raising, the ignorance of honourable members of this Chamber, and their refusal to take notice of those who understand local conditions, has caused the land to be locked up for the next 42. years. I moved an amendment that the consideration of the Northern Territory LandB ill should be deferred pending a visit to the Territory by practical men, who would gain first-hand knowledge, of its conditions, and impart their knowledge to Parliament. Had the bill been deferred u n t i l practical men like the honourable member for Riverina had visited the Territory, it would When the Northern Territory have been amended in many respects, and the Barkly Tableland would have been the starting point of a policy that the holdfor the settlement and development of Northern Australia. Unfortunately, for the next 42 years the land now held in leases cannot be resumed and sub-divided for sheep grazing, except at almost prohibitive cost. Two industries that offer great prospects for the development of the Northern Territory are pastoral and but mining. I have perused the estimates carefully in order to ascertain the Government's idea of the mining possibilities of the Territory, and I am astounded to find that only the paltry sum of £400 has been provided under the ironical heading ""Development of mining industry, including loans to prospectors and others."" The sinking and timbering of a prospecting shaft would cost at least £6 per foot, so that the allocation of this sum on a £ 1 for £ 1 basis,, would enable a total depth of 133Jft. to be sunk. How much w ill that do to deIt velop the mining industry? Whence the loans to prospectors are to come I do not know. The placing of such a ridiculous amount on the estimates proves that the Government was not soundly advised in this regard. The gross ignorance uf successive governments regarding the requirements of the country has been reflected in the budget and estimates from year to year, and, because of that, the Territory remainsi n its present undeveloped state. Last year£1,000 was provided for the development of the mining industry and loans to prospectors, and I criticized that amount as quite inadequate. In reducing it this year to £400, the Government has reached the dizzy l i m it of absurdity. One party of prospectors would absorb the whole amouut. The Minister may reply that a sum of £15,000 is provided under another vote to encourage the production of precious metals. All metals are more or less precious, hut, whereas a gold mine capable ' of employing 40 or 50 hands might be assisted from that vote, a silver lead mine, or other base metal proposition, capable of employing 1,000 hands, would not be eligible for assistance. The mining history of Australia teaches us that the largest and most permanent mining communities have been founded upon the winning and treatment of base metals. If £15,000 were made available for the encouragement of mining generally in Northern Australia, it might to some extent retrieve the Government's absurdity in placing £400 on the Estimates for that purpose. Recently a geologist for Northern Austr.alia was appointed, and before the Estimates were drawn up the Government should have sought the advice of the expert on the job. Had that been done, the amount provided for the mining industry would have been much larger. there is no justification for any reduction of the vote this year, because the reports of Dr. Jensen, who is one of the ablest geologists in Australia, should encourage any government to pursue a vigorous policy for the development of mining. Eor"" Stock and Brands, also Government Stations, wages, and general expenses,"" an amount of £1,850 is provided under the heading of "" Administrative Staff-Contingencies,"" ther amount of £1,890 under the heading of making a total of £3,740. That amount covers the whole of the activities of a department that is conditioning one of the largest industries of the Northern Territory, and the bulk of it represents the wages of the administrative staff. Very little money will be available for the purchase of new. stock, or the ' improvement ' of the herds already on the Government stations. The sum of £400 is provided for a stock inspector, in addition to the chief inspector of stock. I have known for many years that this officer is not required in the Department, and that his departmental chief has persistently asked that he be retrenched, on the ground that he is incompetent and does not fulfil the conditions of his appointment. Although those facts are known to the Government, and the officer has Afr. Nelson. been away from the department for a considerable time and his services are not needed, the Estimates again include provision for his salary. His incompetence must be reflected in the general work of the department. I have said that in the past one of the chief qualifications for appointments to the service in the Northern Territory seemed to be lack of knowledge of the duties to be performed. Because this officer is the pet of somebody in authority, the Territory is to continue to be saddled with the responsibility of paying to him a salary for services that he does not render. Successful pastoralism necessitates scientific breeding, but that policy has never been attempted on the Government cattle stations, which were established to supply stud cattle to the settlers. The Government has sent to the Territory a few stud bulls of very indifferent type from Northern and Central Queensland. These crossed with "" bush "" or "" scrub "" cattle are supposed to improve the quality of stock in the Northern Territory, and even their progeny In any case, are availed of by the settlers. The station could be made self-suppporting. I have received numerous letters asking for assistance along the lines I have indicated. The question may be asked why the settlers themselves do not obtain the necessary stock. The answer is that owing to such diseases as "" red water,"" due to tick and other causes, it is necessary for stud animals to be acclimatized before they are of much and a furvalue. Those enterprising settlers who have paid high prices for such cattle have had "" Administrative Staff-Salaries,"" them die on their hands. It is necessary to breed cattle that will be immune from the diseases prevalent in the Territory, and. the Government, rather than individual settlers, should bear the initial cost. No serious attempt has been made to achieve the alleged objective If we deduct £600 for stockmen's wages, and£500 for food, leaving out of consideration tools and saddlery, which are essential on a cattle station, the vote roughly represents about £700. That sum would not buy a useful stud ram or bull, to say nothing of improving the breed of hundreds of thousands of stock. The Chief Veterinary Officer and Chief Stock Inspector is kept at a salary of a little over £700 per annum, although he has rendered valuable service for ten years under almost unimaginable conditions. He has to ride thousands of miles in all kinds of weather, and he has given general satisfaction to the pastoral industry. Yet, year after year, while others receive their annual increments, he has been kept at the same small salary. According to the Melbourne Age, of the 16th July last, applications are invited from persons in the Victorian Public Service qualified for the position of Chief Veterinary Inspector and Chief Inspector of Stocki n the Department of Agriculture, and the salary offered is £800 per annum. It is stated that applicants must possess a university degree in veterinary science, or its equivalent, and administrative experience in government veterinary work. All those qualifications are held by the Chief Veterinary Officeri n the Northern Territory, and although a commencing salary of £ 8 0 0 is offered in the southern States, this experienced officer in the Northern Territory is, for' some paltry reason, still in receipt of a little over £700 a year. If the Home and Territories Department were administered by a man who could appreciate a good servant, he would remove this anomaly, and see that justice was done. I also notice that the salary of £ 3 5 0 is provided for the manager of the Government Cattle Station. officer is second to none as a cattle man, and he is persistently kept on the £350 mark, while other officers, who are rendering less valuable service in the department, are receiving from £400 to £ 5 0 0 a year. Repeated requests for an increase in his salary have been unheeded. thought that he would rise in the service because of his ability; but, unfortunately, ability is often wasted in government departments in the Northern Territory. Officers with ability are frequently overlooked, and those without it receive all the favours. Por' the purpose of showing how some of the officers are treated, I shall refer again to the education vote. The head Although we were informed that the teacher and supervisor, of schools, DarLand Board would be absorbed by the win, is to receive £566 per annum, the commission, I notice that the Estimates head mistress £375, the teacher at Darstill provide for win £450, the teacher at Pine Creek The Government should tackle the pro£300 , and the teacher at Alice Springs blem of the settlement of the Northern £210. only £ 2 1 0 a year to the latter teacher is place the work in the hands of experts, obviously an oversight; but year after and should tell them to lose no time in year no increase has been provided. All proceeding with it . It should not repeat visitors to Alice Springs applaud the work the farce of the land board, which had of this teacher. attention more or less for 24 hours a day. fore the regulations to allow it to funcI n the morning she has to instruct the tion were framed. If the same lackawhite children, and in the afternoon she daisical methods are followed with the supervises the education of the half castes. She is in charge of what is termed "" the bungalow,"" which is a "" s h a c k "" ' where the half-castes are herded. Although she is paid about £100 per annum less than the next lowest paid teacher, her duties are far more onerous than those of the others. Even now it is not ""too late to do justice to her. The sum of £13,000 is provided under "" W o r k s and b u i l d in g s "" for ""repairs, maintenance, fittings and furniture "" in North Australia, and £5,000 in Central Australia. It will be necessary to erect administrative buildings in Central Australia, and a house for the Government Resident; but I do not imagine that any elaborate buildings can be provided in that isolated spot out of the comparatively trifling sum of £5,000. I draw attention' to the accommodation provided for the police in some of the outposts of the Territory, where they are domiciled in bough sheds, similar to those in which the aborigines live. How can the police be expected to maintain the dignity of the force under such conditions? For some time. I have impressed upon This the committee the necessity for having a government surveyor in the Territory. For many years, no such oflicer has been provided. The absence of a surveyor where a policy of closer settlement is to be put into operation is tbe height of absurdity. I do not know the qualificaHe tions of the members of the Land Board; but if there happens to be a surveyor connected* with that body, he has not been employed in that capacity and is not available for the purpose. It seems to me that we are likely to have confusion worse confounded if a commission charged with the duties of administering North Australia is permitted to function while a land board exists for a similar purpose. its maintenance. I suggest that the payment of Territory on scientific lines. It should Her duties demand her been appointed for eighteen months beNorth Australian Commission, it may be two years before that body functions. I wish again to direct the attention of honourable members to the need for bush doctors in the north of Australia. It is true that, through the agency of the Inland Mission, hospitals have been established in different parts of the Territory, but it is also true that, although those hospitals are doing humane work, and rendering valuable service to the settlers, they are not equipped, and those who administer them have not the scientific knowledge to handle all cases that arise. There are two doctors in Darwin within half a mile of each other, and not another one in over 500,000 square miles of territory. munity should be the first consideration of every government. If this Government wishes to induce men to take their wives and children from the congested city areas to the Northern Territory, it should at least provide for their medical wants. If a serious case is brought to one of the existing hospitals, no one on the staff is competent to diagnose it or to perform an operation. The patients frequently have to be conveyed hundreds of miles before receiving proper attention. The appointment of evem two doctors for the Northern Territory could not be regarded as an extravagance. doctors are available is obvious from the reports in the daily press of the number of medical graduates. It is necessary for me again to emphasize existing in the leper station near Darwin. The unfortunate lepers are not given, even a fighting chauce of recovery. thrown on an island infested with mosquitoes and sand-flies, and are left to treat themselves. sant with the conditions there he must budget is the proposal to abolish the per know that their heads to leave the island, can do so. them have not yet returned. this question with the Anglican of Carpentaria, who has been himself in the work. tbe direction of the Bishop have refused to and my conviction to-day is even stronger allow a girl of eleven years of age to be than it was, that the State Parliaments sent to the lazaret, because of the lack of occupy too high, and this Parliament too supervision there. persons have offered, at a nominal examendment of the Constitution can alter pense to the Government, to banish themthat state of affairs. My objection to the selves on the island for the purpose of proposal is that the Government, by a attending on the unfortunate Mr Nelson. is stated that the lepers are receiving treatment. Certainly, medicines are supplied, but as the attendants are half castes and lepers, the treatment prescribed is rarely administered. The sexes are not segregated. In those conditions, who can blame the Bishop for refusing to send a girl eleven years of age there ? The result of the dispute was that the Government had to give way, and allow the mission to retain the girl under certain conditions as to isolation. The mission still has charge of her, and of others who are suffering similarly. While such in humane conditions exist in a Commonwealth institution, it is no wOnder that humane persons feel compelled The health of the comto defy the Government. Surely the condition of these lepers should elicit the sympathy of the Government, which should take advantage of the offer made by certain missionaries to give their services so that the sufferers may receive reasonable treatment. I understand that leprosy is curable if proper medicines and treatment are administered. But cures cannot be effected in the way now followed, and it is not f a i r to send girls of ten or twelve years of age to an island where they would have to mix with adult half-caste males. To That have a visit of inspection once a month is not sufficient, and is not f a i r to the patients. I hope that the Minister w ill insist upon humane conditions being provided, and if he does that he w ill gain the admiration of all fair-minded people the unsatisfactory conditions in the north. An impartial investigation by h i m would reveal the fact that the treatment which the lepers are supposed They are to be receiving is not being administered. If the Minister is converOne of the most important items in the when they take it into capita grants.

They said, in effect, "" There are our proposals. take them or leave them,"" and they clearly not wish to read a comment on the proposal by the editor of the Australian Industrial and M in in g Standard. That journal strongly supported the Ministry at the last election, and was most vitriolic in its attacks on the Labour party. literary abilities to bear to defame the Labour party and to enchance the reputation of the Ministry. week after the delivery of the budget by the Treasurer, a leading' article appeared in that journal containing these statementsHaving foolishly undertaken a coercive supervision of State finances, Mr Bruce and his colleages have heen compelled to provide a revenue for 1926-27 sufficient to cover all contingencies arising from possible 'errors in calculation in order to demonstrate the efliciency of their policy to tlic States without involving thc Commonwealth in loss. The Treasurer, therefore, has carefully exaggerated expenditure and elaborately underestimated revenue with the intent of simultaneously cultivating the opinion tliat the revenue from Customs and excise is still insufficient to meet the commitments of the Commonwealth Avithout recourse to tlie aid of direct taxation, and of creating the belief that further continuation of thc per capita payments to the States from Customs revenue would be unjust to the prosperous Commonwealth rather than to tbe needy States, whose position will be enormously improved by the Commonwealth's partial vacation of the field of direct taxation. In short, the budget has been very skilfully doctored to present the best possible case for the Commonwealth and the worse possible case for the States-in re the question of the per capita payments. And the accounts have been so treated as to render very difficult and conState authorities to their fusing any lay attempt to compare the ComI t should act constitutionally. monwealth's revenue and expenditure from year to year. Apart from this specialized and deliberate medication of the accounts for home consumption, Dr. Page's budget for 1926-27 is a document that will not enhance the reputation of the Commonwealth abroad. That was written by Mr Ambrose Pratt, They formerly one of the principal writers on the Age newspaper, but now editor of the Industrial Australian and Mining Standard.

Members of Legislative Councils are either nominated by the Government of the day, or elected on a restricted franchise; and .the honourable member for Riverina knows very well that there is very little hope of a land tax being imposed by any State Parliament where there is a Legislative Council. member believe that the State Upper Houses will be obliged to agree to the i m position of sufficient taxation to carry on the government of the country ? the Upper Houses have their own ideas of how taxation should be imposed. We have had experience of their methods in the past, and it has satisfied us that they would never impose such a tax as the Federal graduated land tax. No doubt bhe Treasurers of the State Labour Governments will be placed in a serious difficulty by reason of this move by the Treasurer, and will have difficulty in securing sufficient revenue to meet their expenses. MrM . CAMERON -That is not ber for Barker( MrM . Cameron) knows very well that in his own State the Legislative Council is dominated by one gentleman who used to be a member of this Chamber, and if he and two or three of his colleagues intimate that they disagree with legislation that comes before them, that is the end of it . Everybody knows that governments which impose new taxation are unpopular, and if the Commonwealth Government oeases the per capita payments, the State Labour Governments, in particular, w ill have to impose new' taxation, and that will render them unpopular. One State Minister, in conversation with me on this matter lately, said, "" We w ill throw the blame for any new taxation that is necessary on the shoulders of the Federal Government,"" but I replied, "" My dear fellow, it is of no use for you to talk like that. If you impose newtaxation, you w ill be blamed for it . "" I have no desire to be unfair, but in my opinion the principal motive of the Government in introducing these financial proposals is to bring the State Labour Governments into disfavour by involving them in'serious financial difficulties. D r . EAR LE PAGE -That is absolutely wrong. These proposals were indicated in 1923. at any rate; and I am not a Staterighter. If I . had my way, I would divide Australia into provinces to-morrow, and set up the national parliament as the supreme authority. I would provide for single-house parliaments for the provinces, and give the people a better form of home rule than they have now. Incidentally, that would eifect a measure of decentralization that will never be possible under the present arrangement. The time is fast approaching when we shall have to subdivide Australia, and set up local authorities to administer local affairs. I would make the constituency of the honourable member for Riverina one province. I would overlook all artificial State boundaries, and would bridge the river Murray so that that portion of Victoria, w hich has community of r interest with the Riverina would be part of that province. I would not deal with the new State question in the patchwork fashion proposed by some honourable members opposite. If Canada can carry on satisfactorily with one national parso. liament, and single-house provincial parliaments, Australia need not fear to adopt such a policy. If there were, say, fifteen or twenty provinces, each with its own capital, the population would not gravitate to the present State capitals as it has done in recent years. Mjr. KILLEN -Unificatio n would prevent decentralization. Australia into provinces in the way that I suggest is unification. Such a policy would have far better results than can possibly follow merely robbing the States of the per capita grant.

It will be seen that, if we pay off the national debt at the rate ""of £7,000,000 per annum, but at the same time increase the national liabilit y by £27,000,000, our total indebtedness w ill mount up in an alarming fashion.

He fixed the 'total indebtedness of Australia, State and Eederal, at £1,000,000,000. members are aware that the same set of taxpayers have to pay interest bills for Commonwealth and State loans; but I remind them that the same set of taxpayers have also to meet the interest bill for moneys borrowed by municipal authorities, metropolitan boards, water boards and other local authorities. for which those moneys have been borrowed are revenue-producing? are revenue-producing, but we need to recognize that it is upon the total gross indebtedness of the country that interest has to be paid by the people. If we take the gross debt at £1,000,000,000, the interest bill on that amount must be at least £50,000,000 per annum. There is no burden that presses more heavily upon the people of Australia than the interest which has to be paid upon our publio debts. It amounts to about £8 per head of the population. A family of five is called upon to bear a burden of £40 per annum to meet our interest bill alone. At the commencement of the war the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr by the Labour party of the CommonWatt), who then sat on this side of the house, was one of the financial authorities who told the then Treasurer ( Mr budget figures will disclose the fact that Fisher) that it was impossible to raise the money to meet war expenses in Australia, and that, any attempt to do so would bring about stagnation in the industries and businesses of the country. It was then proposed to borrow £4,000,000 or £5,000,000; but before the war was finished we had borrowed ' nearly £400,000,000. Anything that can be done should be done to reduce the big family burden for interest in Australia. I am, of course, in favour of the sinking fund for loan redemption that has been established. If honourable members will examine the figures, they will find that the two institutions in this country that are the biggest contributors to the loan redemption fund are the note issue, the profits from which go into the fund, and the Commonwealth Bank, half the profits from which are paid into the fund. These institutions were established by the Labour party. When the note issue was taken over by the Commonwealth, it was arranged that the earnings from it should form the nucleus of a redemption fund Honourable for the extinction of the national debt. I do not blame the present Treasurer for laying the flattering unction to his soul that he has done something to reduce the national debt of Australia; but it might be as well to inform him that Common, wealth loans were redeemed before h» entered this Parliament. When the present High Commissioner ( Sir Joseph Cook) was Treasurer of the Commonwealth, a loan for about £7,500,000 was falling due, and he was distressed to know how he was to meet the obligation. Those who were associated with the establishment of the note issue fund assured him that he had no need to trouble himself, as already there was money in that fund by which he could liquidate the debt. He immediately turned to the fund which had accumulated from the note issue, which then stood at about £7,750,000, and with it he wiped off the hooks of the Commonwealth for ever the loan of £7,500,000 that fell due at that time. That was one of the first'efforts of a practical character to pay off some part of the national debt. That would not have been possible but for the establishment wealth note issue and the Commonwealth Bank. An examination of the these two contributors to the debt redemption fund contribute between them something like £1,250,000 or £1,500,000 per annum. Notwithstanding the foreboding of a number of those who at the time opposed the Labour party, the taking over of the note issue has been responsible for other benefits that have accrued to the Commonwealth. This will be seen by a reference to the budgetpapers, and to the bulletins issued by Mr Wickens, dealing with Commonwealth, State and municipal finances, splendid publications containing a vast amount of useful information issued from the Statistician's Office. When the Commonwealth took over the notes issue, the then Treasurer ( Mr Fisher) intimated to the States, that he had money to lend from the profits accruing from the note issue, and within a few months after the note issue was taken over by the Commonwealth, the Federal Treasurer had lent £27,000,000 to the States, which was",45,Budget 1926 27

Mr Fenton. know whether it was the Treasurer's object to save the cost of printing , but we have been supplied by the honourable gentleman with only about six folio sheets giving figures connected with the budget. Probably the honourable gentleman has Reassumed that honourable members would find all the figures they required in the Quarterly Summary of Australian Statistics issued from the Statistician's Office.

According to the current estimates these profits have been reduced to £900,000, whereas for many years past they have not been less than £1,200,000. I should like to know whether the difference, which amounts to £300,000, is being handled by the Commonwealth Bank Board. table I have read proves conclusively, as 1 stated in my opening remarks, that the State Governments are now, from a finance point of view, practically in the hollow of the hand of the Commonwealth: and I believe that it is the desire of our present Ministers, by means of the por capita grant and other propositions, to bring them to their knees. To my mind the only honourable, f a i r and constitutional way of putting the States in their rightf u l positions from a national point of view, is to amend the Constitution, and, u n t i l that is done, I think we should allow the present financial arrangements to continue. So long 'as the State Governments are allowed to carry out most important functions, not transferred under the Constitution to the Commonwealth, no! endeavour should be made to cripple them financially. I think I have already successfully indicated that even if the Commonwealth gives to the States the righ t to re-impose the income tax, the land tax, and the probate duties now collected by the Commonwealth, the result w ill be to leave the States at least £2,000,000 short of what they are now getting through the per capita payments, because their Upper Houses will not pass the legislation required to impose the necessary taxation. I have no desire to be unduly critical of the Treasurer's budget, but I repeat that the figures given by the Commonwealth Statistician show the financial positionof the States much more clearly. ""Within the Tnext two and a half years State and Eederal loans amounting to £184,000,000 must be redeemed. . States' share of this indebtedness is £83,000,000, and I think I am safe in saying that a very large proportion of this amount was borrowed many years ago at low rates of interest, probably as low as 3 i per cent. There is not the slightest hope of obtaining money for the redemption of those loans at less than 5 or 5^ per cent. This w ill impose a heavier burden on the people, who already have a heavy enough interest burden to carry. boasts of having reduced the war debt by £28,000,000, yet the aggregate debt of the Commonwealth hasincreased by The £27,000,000 costs the country £700,000 a year. the increased rate of interest that has to be taken into consideration; conversion costs are also a big item. The honourable member for Beid( Mr Coleman) has pointed out that under the board sys-, tern of managing the Commonwealth Bank, the cost of floating loans is f a r greater than it was in the days when Sir Denison Miller was governor of the bank. During the war that gentleman floated loans which, if they had been borrowed through the ordinary channels, would have cost Australia £7,000,000 more than they did. There is no doubt that Australia has difficulties ahead in regard to the redemption of these huge loans. I hope that the Treasurer will be able to give us a brighter picture than he has given. I have no desire to detract from his efforts or those of any man who is trying to do good for the Commonwealth, but it would have been more worthy of the honourable gentleman if , instead of remaining silent on the point, in each of his financial statements, he had given credit to the Labour party, which laid the foundation of tbe Australian note issue and the Commonwealth Bank, which have proved to be the largest contributors to our debt redemption f u n d . I should like to know how Australia w ill stand in regard to borrowing, because I am rather apprehensive on the point. There was considerable criticism when Mr Theodore, then Premier of Queensland, borrowed money in New York. When he attempted to borrow in London, the door was shut Thei n his face. What happened on that occasion makes me feel certain that there is little hope of getting the State Legislative Councils to impose a land tax.",46,Budget 1926 27

When he found that he could borrow no money in London, he went to New York, and, through the kindly help of Sir Denison Miller, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, obtained what he required. About eighteen months ago, when the Commonwealth needed £20,000,000, our financial advisers in London said that the British money-lenders could not advance more than £5,000,000, and our Treasurer had to go to NewY o r k to obtain the balance of £15,000,000. He was not blamed for doing so, but Mr Theodore was termed a disloyalist for going' outside the Empire for money. I understand that the financial houses of N i v i son, in London, and. Morgan, in New York, £20,000,000 loan for the Commonwealth. To me that is rather an ominous sign, indicating the possibility of a combination between the money-lenders of the United States and GreatB r it a in to fix the rate of interest Australia w ill have to pay for any money it borrows abroad. I hope that my fears in this respect are ungrounded; but, when I find two financial houses, previously in competition with one another in making loans, now united, it seems to me that Australian borrowers abroad will in future be compelled to pay higher rates of interest. I do not know that any honourable member would seriously oppose the establishment of munition factories in Australia. Every one who has studied the defence of Australia realizes that wo must have, not so much . cruisers for naval defence, as properly equipped munition factories, public and private. I members wish to inspect the cordite factory at Maribyrnong, which is really Australia's arsenal, the Minister for Defence( Sir Neville Howse) will be only too pleased to arrange for the experts there to show them over the works, which are an eye-opener to all who see them. The policy of the Labour party is to pay for defence works out of revenue. Although a considerable proportion of our defence No . Mr Theodore bill is being met out of revenue, yet the expenditure on munition factories is being met out of loan money, and this year a sum of £600,000 will be paid out of loan for works in connection with munition factories. I have no objection to expending loan moneys for reproductive works, such as the post office, but I strongly object to what may be termed insurance premiums being met out of revenue, and not o r t of loan. The expenditure on defence may be regarded as an insurance premium Our present system reminds me of a man borrowing money to meet his insurance payments. To-day, for defence works, we are paying £600,000 out of loan, but a few years ago the expenditure was £3,000,000 or £4,000,000. During the war money had to be obtained by hook or by crook, but in peace time there is no need to establish the defence of a country by borrowing money. member advocate paying for permanent united to underwrite the defence works out of revenue ? penditure on defence as an insurance premium. We have for several years enjoyed surpluses running into millions of pounds, and there is really no need for the Treasurer to borrow money for defence works. It is bad management, and the principle is iniquitous. This year the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr. Pratten) anticipates that the Customs revenue will be greater than it was last year, and yet the Government continues to borrow money for unproductive works. The Labour regime of 1910-13 left this country several splendid legacies, such as the Commonwealth Bank, the Note Issue, and a sound defence policy.

FENTON -The .Labour party was responsible for the introduction of the old-age pension. Even prior to the war, I tried to warn people against amassing a huge interest bill . We have no guarantee from this Government that it will restrict its borrowing policy. So long as we borrow money from overseas, so long will this country be flooded with imports. But what is the use of a protective tariff when we borrow money abroad, and it comes to us in the shape of goods? Our imports from Germany are greater than ever, and our imports from America are steadily growing. I suppose that Australia has borrowed about £15,000,000 from the United States of America, and as a result our imports from that country are to-day three or four times as great as they were three years ago. Even apart from oil and motor vehicles, our imports fro m America will soon be as great as our imports from Great Britain. The safeguarding of our national health is very important. We may have good roads, a protective tariff, efficient railways, and a sound financial position, but if the health of our community is in a bad state this country must deteriorate. I doubt whether the cancer figures submitted by the Minister for Health( Sir Neville Howse) to the Health Conference yesterday were quite accurate, but he was perfectly justified in sounding a note of warning. I do not know whether the press misconstrued his remarks, but, according to the newspaper reports, the Minister gave the impression that Australia was an exceptionally unhealthy place. That is not so. New Zealand is the only country that has better health statistics than ours. The prevention of disease is more necessary than th<* making of good roads. the greatest asset that any community possesses. their lives in their hands, set out in wooden boats to cross uncharted seas, and to carve out their destinies in Australia. As descendants of such magnificent stock we should never be content u n t i l our health statistics are second to none. Through our criminal negligence in health matters we have allowed disease to strike down human beings who should be leading vigorous lives to-day. I favour preventive rather than curative medicine. We are told by experts that 95 per cent, of our school children have defective teeth. I know that in some cases the defects are slight, and can be remedied by prompt attention. B y giving such attention we shall confer a great benefit upon the rising generation, and help to build up in a few years' time the most efficient nation in the world. I would willingl y support the expenditure of £2,000,000 or £2,500,000 to enable efficient dental service to be rendered to our Australian children, particularly those whose parents cannot afford to pay for proper attention. I trust that the health conference now sitting in Melbourne w ill not merely pass pious resolutions, but that the State Governments, in conjunction with the Commonwealth, vvill do everything in their power to i m prove the health of the community. I commend the Melbourne newspapers for the splendid articles which have recently appeared on this subject, and I trust that the agitation which has commenced will continue, and that further endeavour will be made to educate the people in the interest of the nation. Both parties in this Chamber agree that greater activity should be displayed in connection w it h the construction and maintenance of our main roads. Good roads are not only essential to the comf o r t of travellers, but they materially assist development and are of great advantage from the defence view-point. A l though further attention should be given to the construction of new roads in country districts, the time has arrived when financial assistance should also be rendered to some of the municipalities in the metropolitan area, the roads in which are in a very bad state of repair. The Mount Alexander-road leading to Bendigo, the Ballarat-road, through Health is Footscray, and the Geelong-road all pass through the electorate of Maribyrnong. Our early pioneers, taking Fully 95 per cent, of the traffic passing over the roads i u the municipalities of Essendon and Footscray is through traffic, and an unnecessarily heavy financial burden is, therefore, placed upon them. If £20,000,000 is advanced",49,Budget 1926 27

120,Mr Fenton,"That is so. In 1910during the next few years for the construction of main roads, the Government should also provide a few millions for the construction of roads in the metropolitan areas. For instance, the Point Nepeanroad is in a splendid condition for 50 miles beyond the. Moorabbin railway gates, but on the city side its condition is deplorable. A united effort should be made to induce the Prime Minister to put a sum aside during the next financial year to enable some of our main thoroughfares within the metropolitan areas to be placed in a better condition. I do not suggest that the amount proposed to be spent on country roads should be reduced, but that an additional amount should be provided for the purpose I have mentioned. I regret that sufficient time has not been allowed to enable many of the Government's financial proposals to be fully discussed. The day is not far distant when the financial position of the Commonwealth must be so discussed. The budget statement is not so clear as it ought to be. I trust that future prominence to the remarks of the financial statements will be submitted in such a form that they can be readily understood by every taxpayer, and that an effort will be made to prevent Australia from plunging into financial disaster. have listened with a great deal of interest to the budget statement of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page). Most of the comment has been in relation to only one or two subjects, and, in that respect, the debate has differed from previous budget discussions. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) dealt with the financial proposals of the Government in a business like way. He discussed the revenue, expenditure, and taxation from his party's view-point, as it was his duty to do. He also said that the budget-papers were not complete, as certain figures were not available; but, having regard to its early introduction, it was practically impossible to submit all the figures. Others can be discussed when the Auditor-General's report is available. When the financial proposals of the Government are submitted early in the financial year, honourable members obtain early information concerning them. In this instance, the Treasurer has established a record. In 1910, the budget was presented by Mr Fisher .on the 1st August; in 1911, it was presented on the 7th Septemberin 1912, on the 26th October, and in 1914, on the 3rd December. Mr Higgs, who was Commonwealth Treasurer in 1915, did not present his budget until the following year. When the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) was in control of the Treasury, the budget statement was presented on the 26th September, and, in the following year, it was made on the Sth October. Some objection has been raised to the early presentation of the budget, but when a member of the Public Accounts Committee, which conducts investigations into departmental expenditure, I gathered that it was impossible to carry on certain departmental activities continuously when money was not available until the Estimates had been passed. In some instances, six months of the financial year elapsed before departments could actually get to work. The daily newspapers gave great lin), which was only right, as ho was speaking on behalf of practically one half of the electors of the Commonwealth, and the party of which he is a member. According to one newspaper, "" The present group of Ministers have no genius the criticisms levelled against for the job."" I have for many years read the newspaper in which that statement appeared, and I cannot remember it having ever' said anything complimentary concerning the Labour Government, which held office some time ago, or of the succeeding government led by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). It has been the policy of that newspaper to severely .criticize every government which has held office. It is evident that this critic desires a change of government; but as it certainly does not desire to put the Labour party in office, one wonders what alternative it has in mind. The same journal says that this Government has shown itself utterly incompetent and wasteful, and one may profitably examine the statistics in order to see whereon the accusation is founded. The facts, says this newspaper, are food for thought. So they are, but it is not the thought to which that journal gives expression. As all of the criticism directed against the budget by honourable members",50,Budget 1926 27

122,Honourable Member For Yarra ( Mr Scul,"opposite was founded upon tlie speech of the honourable member for Yarra, I points of his attack. He said that taxation is continually increasing, and thai, an extra burden of £40,000,000 had been imposed upon the people during the last four years. It is alarming to think that we have exacted from the people in creased taxation averaging £10,000,000' per annum over that period. ' People wonder where this sort of thing w ill end. origin, they may get a fair indication of the true position. the financial discussions of to-day is the division of taxation into direct and in direct. In earlier years taxation always meant money taken directly fro m the pockets of the people; Customs duties were not included. Now people speak of taxation, but meaning both direct and in direct taxation; the criticism of this budget has been in relation to the growth of indirect taxation. The total taxation has increased during the last four years from £49,885,017 to £54,373,007, but if we analyze the amount we find that direct taxation, which four years ago was £17,012,889, was only £15,174,124 last year. Indirect taxation, however, has Increased from £32,S72,129 to £39,192,883. It w ill be seen, therefore, that the whole of the increase in taxation has been in the indirect form of Customs and excise. The lowering of the income tax rate, and the raising of the exemption to £300 accounted for 47 per cent, per head of the total reduction of direct taxation. The receipts from this source decreased from £12,904,518 to £10,858,045. During the four years the production of the continent has been increasing at the rate cf 6 per cent, per annum, due to an increase of the population by nearly 500,000, and improved methods of working. It is f a i r to assume that if the rates had not been lowered, the amount of income tax raised would have been considerably higher. The revenue from the estate duty has increased from £1,172,935 to £1,411,337. a rich man dies, the Commonwealth is entitled to take a share of his estate, and the collections from that source bave advanced by nearly £300,000. During the same period land tax receipts increased by £500,000. largely owing to the collection of arrears. The total taxation,-direct and indirect, has advanced from £8 17s. l d . to £8 19s. l i d . per head. propose to deal briefly with the Indirect taxation has increased from £ 5 16s. 8d. to £ 6 6s. 7d.; whereas direct taxation has decreased from £ 3 0s. 5d. to £ 2 10s. 7d. Over the whole period the total increase has been only 2s. lOd. per head of the population, or 8""rd. per head per annum, which is much less than the increase in general taxation levied during the same period by any State Parliament. We must remember also If they w ill inquire as to its that costs of all kinds have increased. It costs more for a Government, as it A new feature of does for a private individual, to live, but in spite of the increased wages awarded by Arbitration Courts, the greater burden of interest, and the increase of the old-age pensions by £2,800,000 per annum, or 9s. 5d. per head of the total population, the ""total increase of Commonwealth taxation, direct and indirect, has been only 8-Jd. per capita, per annum. That is a truly remarkable result. Our critics tell us that the remission of income tax has failed to w in appreciation, yet I have never met any man who> was not grateful for a reduction of his income taxation by 47 per cent., tor for his escape from taxation by the increase of the general exemption to £ 3 0 0 . A ny person who fails to appreciate what the Treasurer has done in the remission of taxation is such an oddity that he should be put in a glass case. It is said that the average citizen objects to the Pederal authority raising any income taxation at all. If the whole of the income tax were abolished the taxpayer would probably consider 'that he was getting only fair play. When the Treasurer first announced his proposal to evacuate the field of direct taxation, the Age and other newspapers received the intimation with acclamation. They probably thought that the tax would be entirely abolished, but when they found later that the States would be expected to reimpose it , they became violently opposed to the Government's proposal. Apparently the idea of the critics was that if the Commonwealth reWhen mained in this field of taxation the Government could be made willy nilly to repeal an impost that produces an annual return of £.11,000,000 per annum. But can any honourable member indicate Commonwealth expenditure amounting to £11,000,000 per annum that can be discontinued while the .per capita payments to the the Government suggest that the Commonwealth can, without any surrender £11,000,000, capita payments to the States. ""We know that the statement that the decrease of direct taxation is not appreciated by the public is untrue. who pay the tax, but the whole community, is benefited because a bigger amount is available for investment increase in Customs and excise revenue two very opposite remedies are suggested -(1) to decrease the duties, and (2) to increase them. that, if we decrease the duties, we shall not bring about a reduction Customs produce a greater volume and not only will the amount of duties levied at the lower rate equal the present collections, but the community will have to submit to the imposition taxation to meet the considerable ployment that inevitably will result. employment which must be met 'by extra Therefore, remedy for the state of affairs to which objection is taken. other hand, that if duties are increased the Experience has shown that theory to be a fallacy. was imposed in 1921 we were assured that there would be a decrease of imports, and consequently Customs duties. been disproved. matter to what extent the duties increased, the volume of imports will not diminish, and it may actually This is a problem that urgently inquiry. cure for excessive imports is to increase the duties to the point of prohibition. that would get little or no Customs and the community through increase modities, first class to feel the pinch be the country producers, who could not pass on the additional, There is no getting away from it.

The income amounting to figures quoted by the honourable member and still make the per for Yarra were correct. They were taken from figures supplied by the Treasury. I wish, however, to still further subdivide them, since they include the whole of the Not only the peopio revenue relating to business undertakings and the Territories which are met by the by the reduction, expenditure on them. Before doing so, however, let me say that the Treasurer in industry. Eor the large deserves every credit for the manner in which the budget has been presented. I am a public accountant, as most honourable members know, and, it is my business to deal w it h finance, but It is practically certain in spite of my training I have found it almost impossible to follow accounts preof the sented by most Treasurers. During revenue. Such a course will the last few years, however, the Comof imports, monwealth finances have been presented in a for m that can be understood. The practice adopted by the Treasurer of separating what he calls business underof further takings and Territories from the ordinary unemdepartmental services is to be commended. UnThe businessundertakings refer, of will mean an economic loss course, to such public services as the railtaxation. ways, the post office, and so on. They a reduction of duties is no could be run by private individuals. Consequently, they should be expected to We are told, on the produce revenue. The honourable member for Yarra took the total figures, includCustoms revenue will decrease. ing those relating to the post oflice, the railways, and Territories, and so on. The When the Massy Greene tariff proper way to examine the position is to eliminate the receipts and expenditures of all such business undertakings, because a decrease in there must necessarily be corresponding That prediction has credits for all expenditure which these It seems that, no business undertakings incur. We find are that in the year 1922-23 the revenue, exclusive of business undertakings, was increase. £53,737,000, and in 1925-26 it was demands £58,996,000, an increase, not of £7,S30,000, Some fiscalists say that the but of £5,258,858. Where did the increases occur? We find that Customs If and. excise accounted for £6,316,000, land were done, the Commonwealth tax for £503,000, estate duties for revenue, £239,000, and other sources for £772,000, would have to pay making a total of £7,830,000. Thei n the nose by the inevitable crease practically was due to the t a r if f . in the cost of all comThe decrease in revenue from taxation, and it is certain that the notably income tax, was £2,572,000, would malting the net total increase £5,258,000. The honourable member for Yarra stated that expenditure had increased. If we decharges. duct expenditure on account of business We undertakings, & c , we find that the ordinary expenditure to meet statutory war obligations and that on departments amounted in 1922-23 to £45,758,069, and in 1925-26 to £52,384,247, an increase, not of £9,000,000, as stated by the honourable member for ""Yarra, but of £6,626,000. He was correct in stating that the total increase was £9,000,000, but his figures included business undertakings and the Territories, and, as I have shown, excluding business undertakings and the Territories, the increase has been £6,626,000. office made a profit of £160,371, but the railways lost £547,467, and there was a deficit on account of the Territories of £343,000, making the total deficit, on account of these undertakings, £730,347. If we closed up our railways and undertook no responsibility in regard to the Territories, the expenditure would be less, but uo one would consider such a proposal for a moment. Let us dissect this expenditure, undertakings, and see how the matter stands. his accounts under votes . for departments, special appropriations, defence, war first heading, which includes the departments Prime Minister, the Treasury, Attorney-General, Trade and Customs, Works and E a i l ways, Health, Markets and Migration, & c , there has been a decrease in expenditure from £2,952,000 in 1921-22 to £2,874,462 in 1925-26, a reduction of £78,012. Statedi n other terms, the cost of running the departments in 1921-22 was 10s. 9d. a head, and in 1925-26 it was down to 9s. 6d. a head. Certainly that is an achievement. Next year, with a nonduplication of the Taxation Department, and the bringing into force of the new financial proposals, there w ill probably be a further saving of £100,000, which should bring the cost of running the government departments down to 9s. 2d. a head. This is the more satisfactory in view of the fact that there has been an increase in population of nearly 500,000, that arbitration awards have considerably increased salaries, and that all costs have risen. Let us now examine the position under the second heading, namely, special appropriations. penditure under this heading rose from £7,620,851 in 1922-23 to £11,207,176 in 1925-26, an increase of £3,586,325 . Of what did it consist ? Paynients on account of old-age pensions represent an increase of £2,828,000. Would any one suggest that that vote should be cut down ? Expenditure on account of the Council of Scientific Research and Industry is responsible for £250,000. Again no one can suggest a reduction. The expenditure on prospecting for oil and precious minerals was £100,000. The post No one would care to reduce that amount. The wine bounty accounts for £242,000. Perhaps some honourable members would like to take a little off that. Under the heading "" Iron-steel products bounty,"" including such articles as wire netting, galvanized iron, t h e ' expenditure was £195,000. All these items represent a total of £3,716,000. Defence expenditure has increased from £3,409,000 in 1922-23 to £7,353,000 in 1925-26, an increase of excluding business £3,944,000. Probably the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) and his party The Treasurer has divided would like to reduce that amount. One newspaper of late has been indulging in a good deal of criticism concerning what it and repatriation. Under the terms the wasteful extravagance of Commonwealth departments, but in the very of the Parliament, the issue in which that complaint was made it complained that the Defence DepartHome and. Territories, ment was being starved. It is hardly likely that any one w ill cavil at the increase in defence expenditure. War and repatriation services show a decrease of nearly £1,000,000, although payments on account .of war pensions have increased, so nothing further need be said on that point. In addition, £1,000,000 was paid into debt redemption. Thus, of the total increase in expenditure of £6,600,000 during the last four years, special appropriations, including those for old-age pensions, bounties and scientific research, which no one would interfere with, have accounted for £3,500,000; £1,000,000 has been earmarked for the extinction of the national debt, and nearly £4,000,000 represents an increase of naval and military defence. A t the same time there has been a decrease in the ordinary departmental expenditure and under war and repatriation. It w ill be interesting to refer to preExvious surpluses. When the honourable member for Y a r r a ( Mr Scullin) was speaking, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) interjected, "" The old surpluses have largely disappeared."" Th? honourable member for Yarra was then pointing out how this huge expenditure liad been incurred, and the interjection seemed to imply that the surpluses had been wasted. If we look into the matter we shall see that a surplus of £6,408,424 was carried over into the year 1922-23the year in which the present Government assumed office. There have been surpluses since then, but that is the only w old"" surplus, and I shall refer only to the years ended the 30th June, 1924 and 1925. In the former year there was set aside out of the surplus moneys £2,500,000 for naval defence construction, and £4,915,755 for debt redemption, which was more than the entire old surplus; and yet we have this statement that the '' old surpluses have largely but after paying £28,000,000 off the war disappeared."" In the following year, 1924-25, £988,140 was set aside as a special defence provision to cover a developmental programme, £500,000 for assistance to primary producers, and a further for debt redemption. The total of those items for the two years was £10,403,895, made up as follows:-Debt £6,415,755; defence, £3,488,140; assistance to primary producers, £500,000. Yet we were informed that the old surplus of £6,000,000 had disappeared! If any honourable member has an objection to the ""way in which that money was set aside, I should like to hear it. In addition, there was paid in those two years for bounties on meat, wine, canned fruit, iron products, &c, the sum of £682,989, and in invalid and old-age pensions an extra sum per annum of £2,688,754, or a grand total in the two years of £13,072,649. How then could it be wondered at that the old surpluses have disappeared ? I have not taken into account further sums of £1,750,000 for roads, and £250,000 for wire netting, which bring to over £15,000,000 the total surplus moneys set aside. Probably there are some persons in the community who would say that this amount, seeing that it represented a surplus of revenue, should have been returned to the taxpayers. That course could have been followed; but I do not think that many people would contend that that should have been Mr Hunter. done instead of using it for debt redemption, and the other ways in which it was used. The honourable member for Yarra stated that the national debt had increased by £3,500,000. The Treasurer's figures, however, showed a"" decrease in the debt of £160,629; but since the population has increased by 481,855, the total net debt, which the honourable member for Yarra took, has decreased by £4 19s. 6d. per head since 1922. But we find that the unproductive war debt, for which we have no assets, has decreased by £8 3s. 9d. per head, or by £28,000,000 during that period. It was suggested that little benefit was derived from paying a huge sum off the w ar debt, when we immedir ately increased our total debt by incurring fresh ""obligations. It is true that wo are paying off one debt and incurring another of practically the same amount; debt, which went up in smoke,, we now have a new debt of practically the same amount that is represented by assets, and that will be paid off by means of a sinking fund. sum of£1,500,000 There is a vast difference between having a debt for which we have no assets and one that is represented by tangible assets. redemption, The total net debt at the end of 1922 was £339,002,000, and at the 30th June, 1926, it amounted to £338,841.476. There has been an increase in the State debts, and also in the debts incurred by the Commonwealth; but one notices that the net debt is practically the same. We have paid off £28,000,000 of war debt, and of the loan expenditure in this fouryear period no less than £16,000,000 was spent in connection with the post office. Does any honourable member object to that? Certainly no country representative will find fault with it. Other loan items in respect of tha same period are £1,724,000 for railways, £810,000 for the Murray Waters Scheme, and £219,000 for the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, making a total of a little over £19,000,000. Looking at the statement of the total debt, we note that in the year 1922 there were other sums repayable to the Treasury, such as unexpended loan moneys in hand and sinking fund balances, amounting to £25,000,000. The loan balances on the 30th June, 1926, exceeded the loan balances on the 30th June, 1922, by £3,595,000.

Therefore, it was to show that those who make that critisaid, we were "" actually £65,000,000 cism are incapable of understanding worse off."" A t first glance that seems to them.

If Great Britain had been going the States would then have to collect to the bad at the rate of £100,000,000 what they spent, and the critics. would a year, she would have become bankrupt have only one, and that the real, culprit long ago. The main reason for her to blame. In abusing two governments excess of imports is that she is a the Age newspaper and its lending nation, and her imports largely friends evidently hoped that, if they represent the payment of interest in the could not get a concession from one, they form of goods. Undoubtedly, the money might from another. borrowed abroad by the Commonwealth rently thinks so much of the Commonis received in the form of goods; but, wealth Government that it abuses, as to when we float loans overseas, prices there believe that if the taxation which it is are not decreased to induce lis to buy. proposed to hand over to the States were We should disabuse our minds of the idea retained by the Commonwealth,, reducthat our exports should always exceed tions, which the States could not be exour imports. If that position could be pected to make, might be made by the 'created and maintained, we should reach Federal Government. We are not only sellers, but instalments amounting to buyers of goods and also buyers of money. we borrow offers to let us have its goods, at a specially low rate as an inducement to us to borrow there, and that it does not do. In one of the criticisms of the budget We were informed that the Government were really intended to that while it continued to enjoy as large a financial The Age appaThis is really a compliment to the Bruce-Page Government which the Age did not intend to pay. that the Commonwealth had grown to enjoy being the nation's all round almoner, and was going round bestowing favours on States, and areas, and interests, after the manner of some wealthy and benevolent rajah. What are these favours? They are really money for roads, wire netting, bounties, and special grants; and involve wireless and oil concessions All the expenditure was necessary, but it could not have been made by the States themselves without special taxation. If the Commonwealth had not granted money for these purposes, but had permitted the wealthy friends of the Age to obtain relief from taxation to something like the extent of its benefactions to the States, the Labour party and I would have objected strenuously. a need for all the assistance granted to the States by the Commonwealth, and the Labour party, having agreed to the granting of it, has sacrificed the right to criticize it. But, if we are to believe the Labour party, had it been in power, it would have spent much more than this Government has. It has to be remembered that the wireless and oil schemes were initiated, not by this Government, but* by a previous one. It is clear that the States had no means of their own to do what they have done with Commonwealth money. And, after all, it makes little difference to the taxpayer where the money comes from-the Commonwealth or the States-provide d the benefits accrue. Seeing that every line of expenditure provided work for people, it is a moral certainty that the Labotvr party cannot logicaly object to it. Many arguments have been advanced against the financial proposals of the Government, but the only one that has any substance in it is that the States may not be able to operate in the fields of taxation £5,000 mark, and gradually increased that the Commonwealth is evacuating. This is argued particularly in connection with the land tax. There may be something in that, for the Upper Houses in all the States but Queensland-whic h has none -ma y be inclined to resist it. I am not a Labour man, but I want to say that one of the best things that the Queensland Labour Government has yet done Mr Hunter. was the abolition of the Legislative Council there as it was then constituted. It The Age went on to say was a nominee chamber, and, as such, was repugnant to our present-day ideas. party strenuously opposed its abolition. not in existence at the time. member advocate its abolition ? it will never be restored in its old form. If we must have an upper house, let us have one elected on the same franchise as the lower house. as bad. point is that the only substantial objection that has been offered to the Government's proposals is that the State Upper Houses may not agree to the imposition There was of sufficient additional taxation to recoup the State Treasurers for the loss of the per capita payments. But I think that the onus should be placed on them of rejecting the taxation bills sent on to them from the lower houses. If any State Government went to the country in cousequence of the upper house rejecting a land tax bill, it would unquestionably win the support of the people. It would havo behind it the argument that as the Commonwealth had evacuated this -field of taxation on the understanding that the State should enter it, the Legislative Council should not have resisted its doing so. In any case, thc interests represented by the Legislative Councils would only be paying a similar amount of taxation as under the present regime. It is only some of the wealthy interests in the community that are actually opposing these proposals; the ordinary man in the street has said nothing against them. There should be no difficulty in the way of the State Parliaments re-imposing the land tax, if they started at the the rate of tax in accordance with the provisions of the present Federal measure. I have another newspaper extract, which is so amusing that I feel that I must place it on recordThe Government's financial proposals involve crushing increases in income tax to make up the amount of relief given to the payers of Federal land tax. There is no doubt the Commonwealth",51,Budget 1926 27

Dr. Page would rob the States of tlie revenue which goes to support roads, public works, education, and other services, and then distribute it to mendicant States as a dole, taking care, of course, that Victoria, which spends huge sums on roads, will be prejudiced by having to make large contributions to distant communities for these local purposes. Seeing that only two States have had special grants from the Commonwealth, namely, Tasmania and Western Australia, I call the attention of representatives of those States to the term "" mendicant States."" In my opinion, a proportion of the large amount that is collected in the States with the largest population, should be spent to develop our outback areas. The Federal spirit demands that the comparatively well developed States shall help the undeveloped States to hear their burden. The Commonwealth must be considered as a whole, and not as different States; and moneys raised in Victoria and New South Wales may justifiably be spent to develop the outback areas of Queensland Queensland is not a manufacturing Statei n any sense of the word. Like Western Australia, she is a primary producing State, and her people purchase all their manufactured products from the other States. plain that money raised here should not Western Australia, the people of those States might ' just as reasonably say that the profit made by Victoriai n selling her manufactured goods in those States should not be retained by her, but should be returned to them to assist in their development. I read in the press the other day of a man declaring that we had lost the Federal spirit; but his letter showed that he must have been looking in a mirror. It is in accordance with the true Federal spirit that the wealthy States should help to develop the poorer ones; and it would be totally at variance with it to set up the principle that money raised in certain localities must be spent in them. If that stand is to be adopted, how is the f a r north-west of Western Australia, or the Northern Territory, or the northern part of Queensland, where no money is raised, ever to be developed ? It is in the best interests of the settled areas to get these empty spaces populated as soon as possible, for they are the danger spots to Australia. Those who object to spending money in developing them do not know the meaning of the Federal spirit, and cannot claim to be federalists. They are what is known as State-righters, pure and simple. real criticism offered to the Government's financial proposals centres round the proposed petrol tax, and the abolition of the per capita payments; but two or three side issues have been introduced into the debate. One of these touched the question of the taxation of Crown leaseholds. I thought that that matter had been settled once and for a l l ; but during the last Federal election a dead set was made on it against supporters of the Government by the Labour party, and pamphlets were scattered throughout the length and breadth of Australia denouncing the Government's action in this connection. But the propaganda cut very little ice in Queensland, for the people there cannot understand how there can be a dispute and Western Australia. over it . Practically all the land in Western Queensland is held under lease, and the leaseholders realize that the leases are subject to re-appraisement every seven years, and that in 28 years or 50 years they revert to the If Victoria should comCrown. An y one who started .advocating the imposition of a tax on Crown be spent in Queensland or leaseholds in Queensland would be laughed at, or else jumped on. The Federal land tax is not imposed on leaseholds unless a man holds a very large area, for which he is paying a very low rent. If a man held, say, 200,000 acres, and had to pay the tax on it , it could hardly be argued that he was a poor struggling farmer. The people who are taxed on their leaseholds are assumed to have got their land at much too low a rental. I am glad to say that in Queensland the leases have been granted at a rental that brings in sufficient revenuein that case. matter of fact, lessees of cattle areas in Queensland have not made sufficient in the last five or six years to pay their rent. To-day the meat industry is in a parlous condition. The Labour Government of Queensland, realizing the condition of that industry, reduced the rents on cattle properties. It went further, and approached the Arbitration Court with a",57,Budget 1926 27

The cattleman may pay £2 10s. a week, as against £3 10s. a week paid by the owner of the adjoining sheep run. That was done by a Labour Government which understood the situation. I desire to refer to the personal criticism which is sometimes indulged in, not only in this Chamber, but also on the public platform larly at election time. Personal of members of opposing political is to be deplored. never indulged in it. If half of what I have heard regarding Mr Bruce and Dr. Earle Page were true, I should not .speak to them, but should turn my back cn them in the street. jection to the policy of a political or its administrative so long as personalities are avoided. The present Government to considerable criticism, but, so far as I am aware, none of it has been because of its mistakes; all the criticism has been in connection with something Government r.gain in similar must remember that the men on the' treasury bench are human, and that governments, make mistakes. I remind honourable members that attacks against others sometimes react on those who make People are frequently standard by which they judge others. am pleased that in this new thero has been less personal criticism of members was in the last Parliament. honourable ( Mr Fenton), I agree that credit should be given where it is due, even if it be .to those in opposite political camps. would appear sometimes that the only persons who have a right to critcize are the members of the Opposition. criticism, such as we have heard in this Chamber in the past all too is sickening to the general public, and particularly leries to listen to the debates. where I sit I frequently ments made by the persons sitting in the gallery behind me, and I can assure'honMr Hunter. orable members that they are making a mistake if they think that personal criticism of those on the opposite side of the House to them are appreciated by the audience in the gallery. BeforeI entered this HouseI used to read Hansard carefully, although I can hardly understand now why I did so. When I read the speeches of honourable members, I used to picture them starding before the representatives of the people, who were hanging on their every word and listening intently to the pearls and elsewhere, particuof wisdom which fell from their lips. criticism When I was elected to this Chamber, in parties stead of reading the speeches that were Personally, 1 have delivered, I listened to them. I found that some honourable members spoke at intervals of a day or two on a number of different subjects, and that they were capable of continuing on There is no obeach occasion for an hour and 35 party minutes. I felt that I was in the acts being criticized, presence of supermen. For a while I could not understand it . Later, when has been subjected travelling in various parts of the country, I came in contact with men who, although familiar with the speeches delivered in this Parliament, did not read that the them in Hansard. . In time, I learned has done, and would do that the honourable members who made circumstances. We those speeches had copies of the Hansard reports of such speeches circulated in pamphlet for m throughout the country. ThenI like individuals, sometimes understood the reason for their speeches. In the back-blocks of Queensland I have seen copies of the reports of speeches them. made in this House. On the banks of judged by tbe the Warrego the speeches of the honorI able member for YaTra( Mr Scullin) and Parliament of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) are read by the people, and of other parties than there find favour with them. I have met men With the who could repeat them almost word for member for Maribyrnong word. This House comprises 76 members; if each occupied an hour and 35 minutes on every possible occasion, It what would be the result? I hope that we shall not again have to listen in this Parliament to the kind of criticism which Personal was indulged in during the last Parliament. A higher tone in the debates would be appreciated, not only by members of the frequently, opposite party,but also by the people generally. W h y should the Government to those who sit in the galof the day, no matter from what party it From is drawn, be described as rogues and vagahear the combonds by the Opposition, which, in turn, claims to have a monopoly of all the virtues. works many changes. It is only a matter of time when the party in opposition becomes the party in power, and we do not like to think that the party in power is composed of rogues and vagabonds, even though the members of the Opposition be all angels. I trust that when the legislation to which reference has been made in the budget comes before us-particularl y that dealing with roads and the per capita payments-honorabl e members will deal with it in the right spirit. If the people generally understood the Government's proposals, they would realize that they are in the interests of the States, and will cause no unfair burden to be placed upon the people. I can only liken the attitude of the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr. Hunter), in finding faul t with those honourable members who at times have spoken for an hour and 35 minutes, to that of Satan reproving sin. He, himself, spoke for an hour and 20 minutes. months. MrA . GREEN honourable member does not offend often; but neither do I . Like the honourable member, I may tax the patience of persons sitting in the gallery, with the result that the few who have remained to hear the conclusion of his speech w ill , percial year, and to secure the reputation haps, have disappeared before I have finished. It is strange to hear an honourable member criticizing the Opposition because it opposes the Government. I do not know how the -Government would get on without the Opposition. In all parliaments, it is the custom for the Opposition to criticize the party in power. It can, at least, be said for honourable members on this side that .when they do find f a u l t they honestly believe that there are good grounds for their attacks. Believing that, they would be failing in their duty if they did not endeavour to show wherein the Government had failed. The honourable member said that the speeches of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) are read on the banks of the Warrego. They are read equally at the port of Broome, and in other parts of the north-west. It is gratifying to members of this party to know that although they are unable to have their speeches broadcast by the In the political sphere time press, as Government supporters are, they can have them read by the out-back workers, who are the people that really count. The early delivery of the budget is an achievement of which the Treasurer is proud. In ordinary circumstances it is ligh t for a Treasurer to present his budget so that members may discuss it early in the financial year, before the money has been spent; but when a budget is lacking in information, its early presentation is not of much advantage to any one. The Treasurer should have devoted two more weeks to its preparation, and then he might have been able to give us something of value. I am not ordinarily a querulous individual, but I frankly say that during the tenure of office of the present Treasurer, at least, bad budgeting has been the rule. If a Treasurer states that next year the Government w ill receive £40,000,000 from Customs and excise duties, and it actually receives £42,000,000, and if the same error is repeated for four or five consecutive years, the only possible conclusion is that the budgets are faulty. I cannot believe I admit that the that the Treasurers of the past have miscalculated to that extent. To underestimate is merely a safe way to finance. If a Treasurer estimates to receive less than he knows he w i ll receive, he is sure to have a surplus at the end of the finanof being a good Treasurer. We were told that for the year just closed a certain expenditure would be necessary, but the estimate was exceeded by £1,174,000;. and on the other hand the estimated revenue was exceeded by £3,422,000. The main item with which I am finding fault is that of Customs and excise receipts which, at the end of the year, showed an increase over the estimate of £1,988,000. I make bold to place my forecast for this year against that of the Treasurer, who, with the whole force of his department behind him, estimates that the Customs and excise receipts w ill be £40,500,000. But I estimate that the receipts from that source w ill be £41,500,000, or just £1,000,000 more than the Treasurer says he expects. I will take the opportunity this time next year of reminding the Treasurer that I am right and he is wrong. He does not, of course, think that",58,Budget 1926 27
133,' Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [10.13],,60,Budget 1926 27

His forecast of £40,500,000 is so much moonshine, for he and his officers alike know that it will be greatly exceeded. £2,000,000 last year, and I am letting him down lightly by telling him that he is underestimating to the extent of only £1,000,000 this year. It has been said that "" History is philosophy teaching by certain extent, forecast the future on the experience of the past. During the period of nine years, from 1916-17 tu 1925-26, the Customs and excise receipts increased from £15,500,000 to £39,000,000, or an average increase of £2,500,000 per annum. It is, therefore, safe to assume that the receipts for the present year will show a £2,500,000 increase over the receipts for the past year. increased some of the Customs duties during the present session will further tend to increase Customs receipts. There is no justification for the Treasurer's proposal to withdraw the per capita grants. duties are undoubtedly a tax on the people. Neither my friend the honourable member for Maribyrnong Fenton), who is probably as consistent a protectionist as any other honourable member, nor the honourable members for Yarra( Mr Scullin) and Hume( Mr constituency, and it is necessary for me Parker Maloney), who are also ardent protectionists, would contend that a protective tariff is effective which provides a revenue which increases by £2,500,000 a year. That kind of tariff is just a burden on the people, although it undoubtedly suits a treasurer. It is impossible to impose taxes beyond a certain amount without withdrawing capital from industry. Revenue from the Customs is not only much larger than it used to be, but is also much larger per head of the population. The amount received from the Customs per head of the population in 1916-17, which was not a pre-war year, was £3 4s., and the estimated amount for this year will be £6 12s. 3£d. per head, an increase of over 100 per cent, per head. That increase of £3 8s. is a very serious matter to the people of Australia, and is particularly serious to the States, because it means that the fund from which taxation can be drawn is being tapped to that extent by the ComMr A. Oreen. monwealth, and that the States cannot impose taxation needed for developmental purposes. The Treasurer does not need He made a mistake of this additional revenue, nor does he need to withdraw the per capita grants. It has been flamboyantly snouted from the house-tops that he has a surplus of ' £2,786,000. He took the unusual course of paying £2,500,000 of an anticipated examples."" We can, to a surplus last year into a trust fund for air services, investigations into scientific and industrial matters, naval construction, and the like. The honourable member for Maranoa dealt with the budget seriatim, and asked on almost each item, ""Are honourable members prepared to cut this down?"" He thus endeavoured to obtain a suggestion from this side what specific item should be reduced. We can find a parity of reasoning in the The fact that we have case of a man who suddenly has his salary raised. A man who is receiving a salary of £5 or £6 a week, and then enters this Parliament and finds himself in affluent cimcumstances with a salary of £1,000 a year, would probably Our present Customs say he was unable to reduce his expenditure below £1,000 a year. If he were asked to do it, he would say, "" I do not ( Mr know where I can cut down my expenditure. I take my wife to the theatre once in a while; I must give a certain amount of money to needy people in my to dress better than I did formerly, and I have other unavoidable expenses."" But that is a poor argument. When large sums of money are given into the care of the Treasurer, who, before he was Treasurer, said that his predecessor in office was extravagant, we might have expected economical administration, but he spends with a prodigal hand. Further, it is easier to spend other people's money than one's own, and that explains the intention of the Treasurer to filch from the States the small amount of revenue they at present receive from the Commonwealth. On behalf of the States, I emphatically protest against that proposal. On page 10 of the budget papers there is a remarkable statement of surpluses, and deficiencies since the year 1907-08. It discloses, naked and unashamed, the manner in which different sources of revenue have been wrested from the States. Commonwealth Treasurers should graduate in a position of responsibility in a State Government, so that they would understand the financial difficulties that confront the States. us see how the Federation has acted towards the States. The note at the head of the statement to which I have referred readsUntil the end of 1906-7, the whole balance of the Consolidated Revenue fund was paid to the States. In 1907-08, the whole of the balance was paid to the States after thc provision of £193,621 had been made for expenditure in the following year under trust fund, invalid and old-age pensions account. I realize that the Federation is now in a position vastly different from what it was in during that period. impulses on the part of this Parliamentthe granting of old-age and invalid pensions and the maternity allowanceled to a considerable increase in the expenditure of the Commonwealth. The estimated expenditure under those two heads for the present financial year is £9,675,000. The note goes on to stateFrom 1908-09, and until tlie abolition of the bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution in 1910-11, the States received only three-fourths of the net Customs and excise revenue, and the balance of tlie Consolidated Revenue fund was transferred to trust fund, invalid and old-age pensions, and naval defence (construction of fleet) accounts to provide for expenditure in subsequent years. That paragraph throws an illuminating sidelight on naval construction. In those days, the expenditure on naval construction was defrayed out of revenue account. To-day, unfortunately, it is defrayed out of loan account. These financial chickens must ultimately come home to roost, and, possibly, future Treasurers may be forced to make furthe r inroads upon the moneys that the States now receive to meet a situation caused by the financing of this Government. The note proceedsFrom 1910-11 until the end of 1925-26, the States received 25s. per head of population per annum, and the balance of the Consolidated Eevenue fund was. transferred to trust fund, invalid and old-age pensions, and war pensions accounts. In this financial year it is proposed to discontinue the per capita payments to the States. It w ill thus be seen that in the period from 1906-07 successive Treasurers, in stead of instituting economy and giving the States an opportunity to carry out necessary services, have gradually taken from them different sources of revenue. Where is the need for the withdrawing of the per capita payments? In 1917-18, the receipts from the Customs amounted Let to only £13,200,000. I have purposely chosen that year, because it was subsequent to the war. In the present financial year, it is estimated that the receipts w ill amount to £40,500,000, an increase of over 300 per cent. A wise man named Solomon once wrote a number of proverbs, that have been preserved and are on record. Speaking of people who in his day occupied a position analogous to that of our Treasurer, he likened them to the daughters of the horse leech, whose one cry was, "" Give, give."" This proposal will Those humane have a disastrous effect upon the Federal sentiment. We should increase rather than withdraw the per capita payments. In 1917-18 every man and woman in Australia was taxed through the Customs to the extent of £ 2 13s. 7d. per annum. To-day that tax amounts to £ 6 12s. 3 i d . In the former year, when the Treasurer had made to the States the per capita payment of 25s., he still had in his possession an amount of £ 1 8s. 7d. per head. To-day the amount which he retains is £ 5 7s. 3£d. per head. Under those cir'cumstances I cannot understand his proposal to deprive the States of the per capita payments. The States have important duties to perform. Without wishing to decry this Parliament, I contend that their functions more closely touch the people than do ours. Connected with their lands administration is the question of rural credits. They are not "" f a k e "" rural credits, such as those that are controlled by the Commonwealth Bank. I have not been able to find in Western Australia a farmer who has received one shilling from the rural credits branch of the Commonwealth Bank. The Industries Assistance Boardi n Western Australia has at times removed people fro m a condition of absolute poverty. In 1910, which was a bad season, the men on the land in that State were practically starving. They had r u n up accounts with the grocers that they could not hope to wipe off for years. The State stepped in , and took over the liability, which in a number of instances amounted to scores of pounds. It provided the men with sustenance at the rate of 9s. or 10s. a day, advanced them seed wheat and superphosphates, paid for clearing, provided them with agricultural machinery, fencing, and bags in which to consign the wheat, assisted them to take sary service if administered in a new off their crops, and trusted them in many spirit.

Another Federal service which is revenue-producing is the post oflice. The invalid and old-age pensions and the maternity allowance cost £9,000,000 a year. The Customs tariff, instead of preventing foreign manufactured goods from coming here, is being used to bleed Australia white. It is taxing the people to the extent of £40,500,000 to bring about an increase of the manufactures of this country. The administration of lighthouses by the Commonwealth has been a failure, and I am not surprised at that, because lighthouses are of necessity widespread. Any government must f a i l in its efforts to control services situated at a long distance from the seat of administration. A service is most effective when administered on the spot. We have wonderful examples of the failure of long-distance administration Northern Territory. The administration from Melbourne of the lightbouses on the north-west eoast of Western Australia is an absolute farce, and there has been no real effort made to improve the lighting of that coast. If the administration of the lighthouses and the expenditure on them had been left to the States, they could have agreed on some uniform system, and given a f a r better service as f a r as the ports and harbours of Australia are concerned. Honourable members may accuse me of being a States-righter, but that does not deter me. The position of Western Australia is different from that of other States; because it is f a r removed from the seat of the Federal Government. Recently a royal commission on the finances of Western Australia visited that portant recommendations that, unfortunately, have been entirely ignored by the Government. The commission was composed of independent experts, who decided that there was reason for the dissatisfaction existing in Western Australia. One member of the commission even went so f a r as to stateIn my opinion, Western Australia sliould never have entered the Federation; but, having done so. there is, I feel convinced, only one [173] complete and satisfactory remedy for her present disabilities, namely, secession. If that event occurred, all other recommendations in this report would become unnecessary. As, however, it cannot be taken for granted that secession will take place, I have joined in recommendations having the object of relieving (at least to some extent) the present financial disabilities of the State of Western the Commonwealth Australia. I have quoted that statement because the cry of secession on the part of Western Australia has frequently .been ridiculed by honourable members in this House. Certain medical services, which are non-paying, are undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. It is doing excellent work, particularly in connection with the serum laboratories.

MrA . GREEN I am pleased to hear that. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter), when speaking on the budget, challenged the Labour party to suggest improvements in it . In my opinion, there are three directions in -which savings could have been effected. In the first place, we could have effected a saving last year of £4,000,000 in respect of defence. Secondly, a considerable profit could have been made by extending the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, which up to the present have been "" cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd."" Instead of making a profit of £1,3S0,000 last year on the note issue and the minting of silver, and £480,000 in connection with the operations of the bank itself, that institution, if it had been allowed to function as originally in State, and made some i m tended by its founders, would be making a profit sufficient to meet the invalid and old-age pensions and maternity allowance. There is a clear cleavage between the National party and the Labour party. The National party represents vested in terests. The Country party is said to represent the primary producers, but what is the true position? We know that the legislation passed in this House has been actuated by the great National Union,",63,Budget 1926 27
136,Sir Neville Howse,"The indicationsand for that reason an ex-Minister to-day declared himself through the press to be outside the ranks of the Country party. I congratulate him oa his bold step. Land taxation, amounting to more than £2,000,000, that rightly belongs to the people, is being practically thrown away. The Commonwealth Government intends to hand over the field of land tax to the States, because it knows that they cannot reimpose that tax, since vested interests are represented in the Legislative Councils of the States. Like Shylock, who, as time went on, increased his usury, the Treasurer dallies with the States only to drive a keener bargain. vernment whole field of taxation to the States, but the proposals of the 4th June reserve to the Commonwealth 60 per cent, of the income tax. The Treasurer said that,the authority that expends the money should have the responsibility of raising it, and to demonstrate his consistency he proposes to raise money by a duty on petrol, and hand it over to the States for expenditure on main roads. He is offering to relinquish certain forms of direct taxation which, the people insist, shall be curtailed, and in return for that apparent concession is grabbing the whole of the Customs and excise revenue which, for several years, has been increasing at the rate of £2,500,000 per annum. I wish the honourable gentleman had the responsibility of the Treasurer of Western' Australia. He says that the States cannot ignore the vital effect of the Avar on the finances of the Commonwealth. What has been the effect of the war upon the finances? In the year 1925-26 CommonAvealtlj expenditure on war and repatriation services Avas £29,168,000, whilst the receipts from Customs and special taxes imposed during the war, excluding the land tax, were £51,000,000. 'Thus he has a balance of £22,000,000 of revenue in excess of special war expenditure, and that balance is equal to the total revenue of the Commonwealth from all sources m 1914-15. pensions of to-day compare with those m 1914-15? vastly increased, but the total amount paid for old-age and invalid pensions is only £9,000,000, whereas the Customs receipts have increased during the last four years by £10,000,000. The honourable gentleman's scheme for the adjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States is based on the supposition that the latter will increase their taxation to an amount equivalent to the capitation grant. Surely he does not believe that they can do that. In Western Australia the income tax rises to 4s. 7d. in the £1, which is liigher than in any other State of the Commonwealth. The pastoralists, who, when they are doing well, are relatively better off than doctors, laAvyers, pubOn the 19th May, this Golicans and other men Avith fairly good proposed to hand the incomes, find that it is not profitable to invest money in Western Australia because of the high income taxation. Thus the State is hit in two ways. In addition, the protectionist policy injures its primary industries. I recognize that the small community in Western Australia cannot hope to change a fiscal policy which is benefiting considerably the large numbers of people living on the eastern and southern seaboards; but Ave say that as the tariff is indirectly injuring our industries and directly benefiting the industries of the eastern States, they should make some special allowance to us. All that the Pederal Treasurer proposes to do is to discontinue the per capita payment of 25s. per annum, and leaving the State no opportunity to reduce its accumulated deficit of over £6,000,000, or to finance its deA'elopmental requirements. HaA'ing been for some years in the State Parliament, I know that an increase of the land tax is the very last legislation to which the Legislative Council would give its sanction. I fear that the proposals which the Treasurer has put for Avard will dislocate business. At different periodsin its history Australia has experienced financial crises, although, fortunately during the Avari t was immune from any troubles of that kind. Even America, although it has enjoyed a Avonderful run of luck, and is probably more prosperousto-day than at any period of its history, had several financial crashes during theyears 1914 to 1918.

I am not a calamitymonger, but I honestly fear that, if the Treasurer insists upon his financial proposal, he w ill precipitate a panic. therefore hope that he w ill not proceed with this scheme. In regard to the duty on petrol, the Government promised ou the hustings that it would give £20,000,000 to the Statesf o r the construction of main roads. The Commonwealth was to be a f a i r y god-mother, distributing largesse to the States, and that promise had a considerable influence on the general election.

In effect, the Treasurer says to the States, "" We know your people are taxed up to the hilt, but we must go ahead with our splendid main roads policy. must find £15,000,000 of the £20,000,000 that we promised, and the State Parliaments must tax them for the other £15,000,000 which they have to provide."" In other words, the people of the States w ill pay £30,000,000 of the £35,000,000 that is to be made available. The Treasurer's attitude reminds one of the story of the monkey, who, having four nuts to share with two friends, said to them, "" Thore are two for you two, and two for me, too. Treasurer f a i r to the States as the monkey was to his companions, and honourable members can understand w i th what mixed feelings the State Ministers now regard the gold brick which he sold to them. The Government's main roads proposals will not be acceptable to thc people of Western Australia. It is impossible to build any but very rough roads in the vast and sparsely-populated hinterland of that State. This scheme may suit Tasmania and Victoria, which are compact and comparatively highlydeveloped States; they have a prospect of being ultimately grid-ironed with fine I arterial roads. But the back country of Western Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland will not derive one pennyworth of benefit from the Commonwealth grant for which the users of motor tractors in those areas are to be taxed. The greater portion of the previous Commonwealth roads grant to Western Australia was expended in the comparatively closely settled electorate of Porrest. I do not complain of that, because I recognize that good roads are necessary for the cartage of wheat, but the vast extent of country out-back, which is eminently suitable for the use of motor tractors, his proposals for making will have to do without high-class main roads, even if £50,000,000 be raised by These gentlemen usually the petrol tax in Western Australia alone. This portion of the Government's policy w ill hang like the Old Man of the Sea about the necks of the toilers who are developing the remote portions of AusThey are now finding that tralia. There is already a State tax of 3d. per gallon on petrol used by vehicles proposes to extract engaged in road transport; but the Government, recognizing the peculiar conditions of the north-west, has exempted it from the tax. The Commonwealth Treasurer does not propose to do that, and the already over-taxed and imSo they poverished community in Western Australia is spending its money freely in sending to me, and other representatives of that State, telegrams of protest against the petrol tax. Doubtless, every representative of a country constituency is inundated with similar correspondence from his electorate. The Treasurer, after selling to State Ministers a gold brick, gave them some gratuitous advice. Knowing that they will not be able to Taise an extra £15,000,000 of revenue That is f a i r . "" The after he has taxed their people for the has not even been as £15,000,000 that he promised to give to the States, he told them that they may raise their contribution by lo.an, if necessary. It is not sound finance to raise money for roads by way of loan. The proposal has met with a hostile reception in all parts of the Commonwealth. I am prepared to accept grants for roads, wire netting, or any other purpose, because Western Australia is a needy State. If the Treasurer, instead of proposing to withdraw the per capita grants, examined the actual financial position of States liku Western Australia, he would realize that instead of taking money away from them, the whole of the financial arrangements between the Commouwealth and the States should be re-adjusted to facilitate development. it impossible for the States to raise revenue, progress w ill be retarded. Once again I draw attention to the unfortunate industry in Western Australia. Minister( Mr Bruce) stated in Sydney that the secondary industries should be protected by means of the tariff and the primary industries by way of bonuses; but I point out that relatively little assistance has been given to Western Australia, although the gold-mining industry, larly, is worthy of consideration. pointed out on numerous occasions that during the war the industry lost a sum variously estimated at between and £3,000,000, because gold at pre-war prices was placed at the disposal of the Empire, to enable the war to be successfully prosecuted. for a bonus of £1 an ounce. £9,000,000 locked up on the eastern goldfields of Western Australia. ing £1,950,000, perty to the value of £1,000,000 in Kalgoorlie and Boulder alone. Government the gold-fields buildings and railways. monwealth is not prepared to grant a gold bonus, it should at least appoint a special commission matter. commission that inquired into the disa-' bilities federation recommended the granting of a gold bonus for ten years. I admit that two members of the commission contended that the mine-owners should first develop the fields without government assistance; but if a man in rags asked me for a shilling with which to purchase a meal, it would be inhuman of me to tell him that I would comply with his request on the condition that he presented himself to me in a 10-guinea suit. ago, another of the mines closed, and 360 more men were thrown out of work. The only way out of the' maze is to grant a gold bonus Minister announced that he proposed to Mr A-. Green. refer the request for a gold bonus to the Board of Tradei n Western Australia. I have frequently asked that the report of that board should be presented to Parliament; but I have been told that it is being considered by the Government. I If this Parliament makes know as well as the Prime Minister-does that the board recommended that an expert commission should be appointed to inquire into the conditions of the goldposition of the gold mining mining industry. The Prime Minister The Prime is evidently unwilling to allow that recommendation to be made public. Since the Government is willin g to assist other industries, both primary and secondary, it has no excuse for refusing the help that Western Australia sorely needs.

The Prime Minister, in his policy speech at Dandenong on the 5th October, saidThe Ministry proposes to make available to the States a' sum of £20,000,000 spread over a period of ten years, such amount to be provided out of the revenue derived by the Commonwealth from taxation to be collected from motor users through the Customs Department. That quotation, perhaps, may justify the Prime Minister in claiming that he clearly stated that taxation was to be collected from motor users through the Customs Department; but in discussing this question we must take into consideration the contention, which has been puf forw a r d ' for a number of years, that the money received from motorists should be allocated specifically for road construction and maintenance. Roads Association has passed several resolutions on' that subject, and deputations representing that and similar bodies have waited upon Ministers. I am not sure that I did not receive one of those deputations myself when I was a Minister. ""When the Prime Minister stated that the Government proposed to provide this sum of £20,b00.000 by taxation collected from motor users, the public generally underthe protectionist policy. stood that it would adopt the policy that revenue duties for a specific purpose. had been so long advocated by the The Minister for Trade. and Customs National Roads Association.

A motor car was the hall-markof plutocracy, and it was conthe Commonwealth. Australia was so depensidered that the owner of one was dent on outside sources forthis commodity squandering money, and could afford to pay heavy taxation. But times have I changed. The motor car is no longer, a luxury, it is necessary, particularly in the out-back parts of Australia. I live in a remote part of this State, and I know, just as do other honourable members who have lived in the out-back, that nothing has done more than the motor car to make country l if e attractive. The days of the horse and gig, or buggy, w it h a hurricane lamp tied underneath, and no shelter from the rain on a wet night, have almost gone; though we still sometimes see, unfortunate people in that kind of conveyance, and are thus brought to realize what a difference the motor car has made to life in the country. Three hundred thousand motor, users in the Commonwealth are very much concerned about this proposed tax, and in addition a large The National number of persons desire to own motor cars, and are eagerly looking forward to the day when they can buy one. For them this tax places that day farther forward, What is the object of the impost ? The Ministry speaks on that matter with two voices.

145,Mr Stewart,"that some encouragement was very necessary. He believed that they would lead to increased prospecting for oil within Australian territory. He tells motor car users that if they wish to escape the tax they oan do so by using Australian spirit and Australian tires. Yet the honourable gentleman must know that the total production of motor spirit in Australia is only 10,000,009 gallons, whereas the consumption is 115,000,000 gallons. not escape taxation by using Australian motor spirit. Australian motor spirit be increased ? creased sufficiently to enable every motorist to escape this t a x ; but if it could, what would become of the roads policy ? The whole thing is ludicrous. Placing the most generous interpretation possible on the motives' of the Government, it is obvious that this tax has a dual purpose; it will raise some revenue, and it Avill be another instalment of the high protection policy so ardently advocated by the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs. It s object is to appease the growing pains that he referred to in one of his speeches not long ago, and to f u l fill the promise that he made to certain Australian manufacturers who complained that they did not receive ""consideration,"" as they were pleased to term it , when tha last tariff schedule was framed. He told them that new schedules would be submitted fro m time to time. In short, I hold the opinion that, in the guise of a ioads policy, the Ministry has given us another instalment of excessive protection, which seems to be the policy of the Government. I do not wish, at this stage, to argue the old, well worn question of the merits and demerits of high and low duties; but I want to say that, rightl y or wrongly, the primary producers generally I do not say all of them, but j say, with confidence, ' a majority of them-hav e decided that Customs duties have reached a stage at which some one ought to call a halt. Let me state the fiscal resolutions and some of the fiscal policy of the Victorian Farmers Union. 1 quote from a document presented to the right honourable the Prime Minister on the 20th July, 1925, and signed by MrH . V . Pickering, chief president of the Victorian FarmersU n i o n ; MrE . Reseigh, vice-president of the union, and MrE . E . Roberts, general secretary of the union; and also on behalf of the Town nnd Country Union. and Country Union? occasion an apologist for the Town and Therefore, every motorist canCountry Union. I leave that organization out of the question, and speak only for the Victorian Farmers Union, which was responsible for this document. It is a formidable document, and I shall not attempt to read all of it . It contains this On the 13th March, 1925, 350 delegates from the various branches of the Victorian Farmers Union met in Melbourne, and unanimously carried the following :That this conference considers the Australian Commonwealth tariff unnecessarily high, and that its incidence is hurtful to the great primary-producing interests, and also to the welfare and progress of the Australian community as a whole, and this conference further considers that a percentage reduction should be made annually on all tariff items dealing with the staple necessities of primary and secondary industries. Then follow many reasons in support of the resolution. Let me read a.specific reference to motor taxationLicence fees paid by motor vehicles contribute to the fund out of which roads are built and maintained, but we restrict the efficacy of these roads, and limit their cenvenience by levying heavy taxation upon these vehicles, and upon the lubricating oil and fuel they use. Transport, the liandmail to settlement and production thus becomes more, instead of less, costly. On one hand the necessity for markets, population and transport is proclaimed, and simultaneously a high Customs tariff is imposed, which hinders or defeats attainment of these conditions. The document also saysThe high tariff, rather than ministering to increased prosperity, progress, and sound industrial development, has hindered greater progress and better development, and, in addition, exposes our people to the effects., of a disastrous reaction. Because of alleged "" insufficiency"" of present duties, high tariff advocates are asking higher or more duties. We submit the remedy is the reduction of existing duties. There are several pages of similar sentiment. The fiscal plank of the' Australian Federal Farmers' Organization also provides for the reduction of duties upon",68,Budget 1926 27

Nobody knows better than I and certain members of the Cabinet that that is the settled fiscal policy of the Victorian Farmers Union. They and I were nurtured in that organization. Certain figures have been quoted regarding Customs taxation. Let me give those that relate to the net Customs aud excise receipts for the period commencing with 1921-22. They are as follow:1021-22 1022-23 1923-24 1924-25 1925-20 The estimate of the Treasurer ( D r .

Would the honourable member favour an increase in the land tax? tax, which was removed by the present Government, could be re-imposed, and the income tax could be restored to its former level. Those loudly proclaimed .remissions of direct taxation were actually not remissions at all, because in their place has been imposed additional Customs taxation, which is the most obnoxious of all forms of taxation, and the most-unfair to the-primary producers of Australia. The result is seen in the position that is occupied to-day by many of the primary industries. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( MrA . Greet) on several occasions this evening used the term "" mendicants."" Some of our p r imary industries are to-day compelled to adopt the role of mendicants. The growers of f r u it s to be canned or dried, the apple growers, the doradilla grape-growers, and the dairy farmers have been forced into an economically impossible position by the high cost of production, which has been largely due to the tariff, that has! brought in its train Arbitration Court awards that have granted to employees higher wages and shorter working hours. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), and other honourable members, including myself, have on many occasions introduced to the Government primary producer mendicants. It has been argued by honourable members of the Opposition that our troubles have been due to rising land .. .. £27,630,000 values. That is not so.

Only yesterday Mr Mclvor, the chairman of the Closer Settlement Boardi n Victoria, who has had the experience of settling upon the land thousands of returned soldiers, told a conference of returned soldiers that That colossal sum is land values in the dairying districts had fallen. He invited them to make application for a re-valuation of their hlocks, and said that such a request would receive favorable consideration. Many returned soldiers were compelled to buy fencing wire, galvanized iron, and other requirements at inflated values, and they are now compelled to pay, not only the prin cipal sum borrowed, but also the interest which in the meantime has accumulated. All these matters have a bearing upon the proposed tax. A while ago I referred to the fiscal creed of the Victorian Farmers Union. I shall now deal with the fiscal creed of a portion of the Nationalist party. That party speaks with two voices. I quote the agreement which was entered into prior to the last election by the P r i m a r y Producers' Association and the United partywhich is synonymous w it h the N a tionalist party-in Western Australia. It readsThat, as the present high tariff is inimical to the best interests of Western Australia, the full strength of the two associations shall be devoted to securing a substantial reduction in the existing tariff. That, as a reduction can only be secured through our parliamentary representatives, neither shall give its endorsement to any candidate not in agreement with this policy.

A member of the present Cabinet, the Leader of the Government in another place, accepted those conditions, advocated under them. Howf a r the Government was aware of . that I am unable to say. out clearly: Either the Prime Minister and the other members of the Cabinet acquiesced in the agreement and accepted it, or the Vice-President of the Executive Council, without the consent or knowledge of his Cabinet colleagues, entered into an arrangement that embodied a vital principle. The tariff issue, the world over, has always been regarded as a big political question. Even in Australia, in spite of the claim that it has been settled, it still vitally affects equalled elsewhere. our political affairs, because we obtain nearly two-thirds of our total revenue from the tariff. Y e t we have the spectacle of a party appealing to the people under the flag of high protection in the eastern States, and under the flag of a low tariff in the western States. I do not know of any previous successful party that was guilty of such an action. Q\iite apart from -the political morality of the arrangement, those who entered into it should endeavour to carry out their pledges. If on the hustings the members of the Victorian Farmers' Union in this State advocate lower duties, they should regard it as a duty to stand up to those principles when returned, to Parliament. this subject, I shall .touch upon another very important aspect of it . As the position of those who are engaged in primary industries becomes more pre-' carious, finance is curtailed. An outstanding illustration of that fact is afforded by the position of the driedfruits industry. The associated banks, so I am informed by those engaged in the industry, refused to make advances on horticultural because of the precarious condition of the industry. Government had to come to the rescue of the producers. Buti n spite of the Government's loudly-proclaimed policy of rendering equal assistance to secondary and primary industries, an advance, and not a bounty, was given to the producers. This industry is one of the few primary industries that is governed by arbitration court awards in respect of hours and conditions of labour. The irony of it all was that when this Government was assisting the producers who them, and won his seat were absolutely down and out-and the Government at the time did save that industry from disaster-the A r b it r aBut one of two things stand tion Court increased the wages of the workers in the industry and the unfortunate producers had to pay the extra impost out of the money advanced to them.

Upon that the Countryman unkindly commented that a man who spoke of exporting manufactured goods under Before leaving the present' conditions in Australia was Like a dog baying the moon. I do not think that criticism is f a r wrong, for, whilst the Treasurer may have been merely indicating an ideal to be aimed at, he spoke' of something which is impossible under present economic and industrial conditions.

Victorian Parliament, bitterly partisan as they are, united this week in urging the Government not to proceed with this proposal. fluence on public opinion in this State. The Treasurer's persistence has certainly brought this question into the realm of practical politics, and has given the States something to think about; and if the proposal were discussed in this Parliament before being adopted, it would have a better chance of being accepted by the States. The Government's roads policy, and the per capita payments, will come before this Chamber again on separate bills, and I shall then repeat some of the views I have expressed this morning, and shall add other views that I have not the desire to state at this hour. -The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) must be commended for many of the sound points he has made. I do not agree with all of his arguments and deductions, but he has certainly had the frankness to deal with some of the principal economic burdens that are weighing heavily upon the shoulders of the great rural population of Australia. I propose to deal with some of those economic factors from another and State boundaries. angle. The nightmare of the producing interests of Australia is the apparent impossibility of escaping from unsound economic conditions. I regret to say that I see no bold adventure on the part of the Treasurer to break away from the unsound conditions of the past, no ray of hope for an I am well aware of alteration. I can bring the Treasurer face to face with vivid instances. I should not have risen this morning but that I felt a pressing duty to bring under his notice, before this item was passed, the deplorable condition of nearly 30,000 of our best citizens, the ex soldiei-3 of this country. I do not say that all the ex-soldiers are in such a condition; but, since I last spoke on this subject fresh facts have come to my knowledge, and have almost bewilders some of its convinced me that thousands of these young men are in a position of hopelessness. I exclude those in the great wheat-growing belts, for Both sides in the wheat is to-day the sheet-anchor of Australian finance. The subject cannot be left where it is. It was our national obligation to raise the army for the Avar and That will have, a great in afterwards to repatriate the soldiers, and Ave cannot pass the obligation on to the States by merely providing the money and leaving the men to f a i l hopelessly or d r if t away. I do not discuss this matter from any other stand-point than the economic one. The Treasurer and the Commonwealth must face the situation sooner or later. Victoria is a' splendid wool-producing State, but, since the f a l l in the price of AVOOI from an average of £33 a bale to £17 a bale, many of the men settled in this State can barely raise sufficient money to meet interest and sinking f u n d , payments of 6 per cent. The gross yield from some of the areas is barely equal to the annual payments required of the settlers. I do not point this out to the Treasurer in a Carping spirit, and' I hope he Avill not interpret my remarks in that wav. There is an accumulated debt for instalments of, roughly, £4,000,000, which these men OAve. That represents the earnings applied to the cost of living for them during the",73,Budget 1926 27

I am not charging during the oast three years:this Government with dereliction of duty; I am merely urging the Treasurer, who is handling the finances of the nation, to go to the relief of these men, or to re-arrange the economic conditions. WhatI deplore more than anything else is that I can see nothing on the political horizon that gives a margin of hope to these men, except the remote possibilty of another boom in the prices of primary products. I shall not make an analysis at this hour of the morning of the general finances of the country. But I say to the Treasurer that his vaunted prosperity is a false prosperity; it is based upon a levy through the Customs of £40,000,000 on the people's requirements. I am not referring particularly to the incidence of the Customst a r if f ; but I remind the honourable member for Wimmera, who points to protection as the sole cause of our troubles, that the causes are much wider and deeper than he assumes, and that an adjustment of the tariff will not provide a complete remedy. The cause of this unsoundness, and of the failure of the nation to return to normal economic conditions, is that the Government is engaged in a prodigal expenditure of loan money. In addition to spending a revenue of, roughly, £76,000,000 it intends to spend Commonwealth loans amounting to £12,000,000; and £35,000,000 w ill be raised for the States to spend, all in the present year. above its means. We are pledging posterity. We have to-day a public debt of £900,000,000. £500,000,000 is approximately State debts, for which we may say that there are some corresponding assets. Commonwealth £400,000,000. I am glad to know that the debt has been reduced by £28,000,000 by payments from many sources, but not entirely from revenue, as some persons may have been led to believe. conditions existed before the present Treasurer took office. some one must face the situation.

An improvement in the position cannot be effected until we make up our minds to cease borrowing, especially overseas, except for the conversion of loans and our most pressing needs. I know that such a policy would cause trouble, but it is better to grapple with the problem now than to wait u n t i l it has been multiplied inany fold. Honourable members of jthe Opposition have on several occasions said that the adoption of a policy of borrowing overseas whilst you are endeavouring to build up your own industries, results in your having upon your shelves the goods of your rivals, thus doing a detriment to your own products. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) cannot escape the logic of that argument. certain amount of borrowed money may be used for bookkeeping purposes between the Commonwealth and the British lending authorities, but in the main the argument is perfectly sound.

I should not have noticed the incident had not the noise been so great as to disturb both the Chair and the honourable member who is addressing it . what was said by the honourable member for Wimmera is pertinent to the present position. If the primary producers of Australia are forced to come cap in hand for bounties, we have almost reached the stage when the rural industries of the nation w ill be on crutches. I object to being regarded as a pessimist when I refer to the existence of what I believe to be a growing danger. It is about time that the Commonwealth refrained from over-stepping Pederal boundaries, and invading the provinces of the States. Our obligations are sufficient to occupy the whole of our attention. always bad. allowed to handle their own affairs until the nation determines that greater power shall be exercised by the Commonwealth Parliament. All the star items in the Government's programme are dependent for their consummation upon the goodwill of the States, yet it is proposed to pick a first class quarrel with the States. Without their active co-operation and the use of the whole of their machinery, every one of those items, would remain a dead letter. I implore the Treasurer to obtain first-hand knowledge of the actual conditions under which our former splendid soldiers are struggling with adversity in many of the rural industries. It is jointly the obligation of the CommonAvealth and the States to endeavour to put matters right. The Commonwealth cannot allow the position to remain as it is without dishonour to itself and the neglect of a national responsibility.

In anticipation of this Parliament's approval, the Government made provision for the States to be relieved in the last interest payment that they had to make. An y person who has studied the marketing and bounty proposals that have been brought forward during the last few years by the present Government must recognize that in those directions also substantial relief has been afforded. £5,000,000 was made by the Commonwealth to the States, not directly to the soldiers ? now soldiers; any action that we take must be through the agency of the States. insisting that the soldiers shall have the benefit of the remission ? been made available for general relief, and it is for the States themselves to apportion that relief among the soldiers. Tbe original arrangements, with regard to land settlement especially, were made in 1917 and 1918. It was then definitely decided by agreement Commonwealth and the States that the Governments of the States should deal directly with the returned soldiers. It is too late now to endeavour to bring about an alteration of the arrangement. That relief of £5,000,000 is part of a' total of £10,000,000 granted by the Commonwealth Government. The Government is endeavouring to get to the root of the economic troubles that were referred to by the honourable member for Wimmera. Althoughi t is the fashion to designate certain of our actions as an invasion of State rights, I point out to the committee that the establishment', of a f u ll measure of industrial peace in Australia wotild be one of the best means possible for bringing about sound economic conditions. The proposals of the Government in the States not regard to housing and national insurance are designed to that end, and must help to improve the whole economic fabric. In addition, the improvement of the roads the suggestions of the Comas a result of the policy of the Government w ill undoubtedly decrease the cost of production in Australia, and permit both the primary and the secondary producers to compete more successfully in the markets of the world. Althoughi t may be.said that certain measures proposed by the Commonwealth Government could he carried out by the States, yet the fact remains that the States have not carried them out. If Australia is to be in a position of national efficiency to compete with other countries, in both our home and overseas markets, we must fall into line with them. Bothi n the United States of America and Canada, action similar to remission of that proposed by this Government has been taken with regard to roads. The United States of America is a federation similar to the Commonwealth, and this year its Government is expending the sum any direct connection with the of 670,000,000 dollars on roads in the form of subventions to the States. That Government recognizes that good roads Commonwealth tend to decrease production costs. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr. Stewart.) said that the Government's roads policy was a contradiction of its policy in respect of the per capita payments. There is a fundamental difference between the two propositions. The roads policy has been arrived at in agreement with the States, and the Commonwealth w i ll exercise control in respect of the between the method of expenditure; but the Commonwealth Government has no control of the expenditure of the per capita payments to the States. I wish to make known to the committee the exact position respecting our national debt. The honourable member for Yarra tried to make out that the position was much worse than it really is. The gross debt of the Commonwealth on the 30th June,' 1922,, was .£416,071,000, and on the 30th June, 1926, £458,444,000, the increase being £42,373,000. The debt incurred for the States was during that period increased by £32,178,000, so that the total increase in the gross debt for all Commonwealth purposes was £10,195,000.",76,Budget 1926 27

Dr. EARLE PAGE -That position has to be considered as well. borrowing money from Great Britain and America at rates of interest nearly as favorable as they were before the war. We have been able to attain that position by the effective use of our sinking fund , thus giving the general impression abroad that the Commonwealth is attempting not merely to develop this country, but also to repay its unproductive debt at the earliest possible moment. That has enormously improved our credit throughout the world.

The principle is the same, but he objects to the present scheme, even although it is not to operate for a year. It is suggested that the main objection to the proposal is the difficulty of passing legislation by the State Governments to recoup them for the loss of the per capita payments. Th;;re is a general consensus of opinion amongst members of State Parliaments, as well as cf the Federal Parliament, that the day of the present system of capitation payments baa rone For instance, SirW i l liam McPherson suggested that there should be an annual reduction of Is. a year u n t i l the payments ceased.

The right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , seven I disagree entirely years ago suggested a reduction of 2s. 6d. a year, without any Commonwealth concessions, but he now surrounds that proposal with certain conditions. It would be much more difficult for the States to replace Is. 3d. or 2s. 6d. every year than to deal with the replacement of the whole amount once for all. Under the proposed If things gradual abolition it would be impossible for them to deal comprehensively with the recasting of their system of taxation; they would be forced to deal with ""We are it piecemeal. There would be an annual fight in the State legislatures to pass their proposals. It would be much better to deal with the whole matter on a comprehensive basis at the beginning. The honourable member for Wimmera suggested that we should bring the proposals into force -next year, but what virtue is there in next year as against this year? The honourable member for Eichmond( Mr R. Green) pointed out that this was not a constitutional matter, and I agree with him. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) suggested that we should iink with the per capita proposals the transfer of State debts. At present it is impossible without connot stitutional alterations, for the Commonwealth to control State borrowing, and unless some binding agreement on that score is arrived at, how could'we deal satisfactorily with the transfer of State debts? Would any one sug-. gest that we should take over State debts unconditionally, and allow the States to borrow money as they thought fit, irrespective of the Commonwealth? Under present conditions, therefore, it is impossible for this Government to take over State debts on a satisfactory basis. Item agreed to. Progress reported.
