We desire to call your attention to a notice This notice is evidently rilous and vulgar document of the same nature, was posted by pressmen in another part of the House reserved for their use; and tion to exclude. members of the Inter-State Press from all privileges at Parliament House. Yours faithfully. H . W . Peters, Esquire, Chairman of the Press Committee, Parliament House. The following reply was received from Mr. Peters:Melbourne, 9th December, 1914. The President and the Speaker of the Federal Parliament. DEAR SIRS, In reply to your communication of December 9, I have to say that I was previously unaware of what was posted in the Argus and the Age rooms. House. .room a list of members of the House Committee was posted on the wall. As soon as I saw it I endeavoured to tear it off. But as it was .stuck too tightly to remove more than a part I pasted a blank sheet over it . When this sheet was removed I pasted another with a request that it should not be interfered with. It was not afterwards touched by any member of the Inter-State Press. -merely a prank of one of the young fellows who bave access to the room. Youthful effer-vescence takes curious forms sometimes, and often acts irresponsibly without"" intending to be harmful. Perhapsi t is the result of an undeveloped artistic sense, a fact not uncommon en este valle de lagrimas. The fact that the notice was at once pasted over, and was, therefore, cancelled and repudiated in the only method that was conveniently possible should, I submit, be accepted as a clear indication that there was no intention by the room to transgress any rules of the House. A t the same itime I admit that there was an indiscretion by whomever it was committed, and I wish to express regret that it 'should have occurred. I am, dear sirs, Yours faithfully, H . W. PETRKS, Chairman of Gallery Committee. That letter was not considered satisfactory, and Mr Peters wrote a further one. Melbourne, 10th December, 1914. The President and the Speaker, The Federal Parliament House. DEAR SIRS, In reply to your letter of yesterday it is corpersonal e x p l a n a t i o n ? rect that there was a notice posted in the Inter-State Pressroom containing the names of the members of the House Committee. I at onee endeavoured to remove it , but found it was pasted too tightly on the wall. Accordingly I covered it with a blank sheet of paper. This was removed. I placed another with a request that it should not be interfered with. This request was observed. I wish to express my regret that the notice was posted at all, and to say that the indiscretion was one that I am sure will not be repeated. I am, sirs, Yours faithfully, H . W. Chairman of Reporters' Gallery. That letter was not considered satisfactory, and . Mr Peters wrote again. Commonwealth of Australia. The Senate, Melbourne. The President and the Speaker, Federal Parliament. DEAR SIR, Supplementing my letter of to-day, I wish to add that as Chairman of tbe Gallery Committee I unreservedly apologise for the incident to which it relates, and express my regret that a breach of parliamentary decorum sbould have heen committed in the Inter-State Pressroom. I am, dear sirs, Yours faithfully, To this the President replied as follows:. I rarely visit those parts of the The Senate, It is a fact that in the Inter-State Melbourne, l l t h December, 1914.

76,Mr Josephcook,"M a y a member ofpress may go to the Library and ask the Librarian for any book he requires. Honourable members understand that the Commonwealth is acquiring some very valuable works and documents, some of which it is not considered wise to allow even members of Parliament to handle. If honourable members were permitted to handle these works as they please, the Library would be in a very bad way in a short time. reflecting on all of us. bers will permit me, I should now like to refer to the matter more f u l l y so that the position may be thoroughly understood. In the Library are bound files of newspapers, some of which go back for a considerable number of years, and it has been found that some of these have been cut. sidered necessary to take very drastic action. attribute that action to members of the press, because I have not the remotest idea of when, how, or by whom it was done. I wish to say clearly and distinctly that they enjoy the same privileges now that were granted to them by this Parliament fourteen years ago. Those privileges, however, must not be abused. short time ago I had to take action in consequence of finding that the corridors were turned into a smoking saloon. ThisI resented, and the practice waa put a stop to after ample apology had been made by those offending. mentary gardens are set apart for the use of members. are allowed to have the use of the gardens it is not possible for members to there hold private conversations, or play their games amongst themselves if they desire to do so. use of the gardens along with honourable members, matters, which were never in tended to be public, may get abroad. Some members of the press seemed to take complete control, or, at any rate, to go beyond th© privileges originally granted. The House Committee unanimously agreed that this practice should be discontinued, and that only certain privileges should be granted. since been given to that decision by the A member of the President. One word more in connection with the Library. In that Library we are building up a very valuable collection of booksa collection which every honourable member should cherish and endeavour to guard to the fullest possible extent. Y e t , as a fact, it has been found that honourable members themselves take books from that Library which are sometimes returned either marked, or with passagesunderlined or erased. It is quite a common thing for works of reference to be Why? This is returned with all sorts of marks in them. Manifestly tliat sort of thing ought not If honourable memto be permitted. But the difficulty is to find a means of stopping it . It is a very bad practice that books should b© thus marked, and I trust that in future honourable members will discontinue it . So far as the Library is concerned, certain regulations hav© been framed by the Committee for our guidance. It is quite a That being so, it has been concommon thing for honourable members to obtain books from the Library and to hand them over to pressmen or to other hear ! persons to take away. I have actually I do not wish to witnessed this sort of conduct myself. Now, the Library has not been established for that purpose, and u n t i l the Hous© decides that it has, neither the Library As to the members of the press, Committee nor I intend to sanction it . It will thus be seen that honourable members themselves are to a large extent blamable in this connection. Now that the matter has been brought before the Only a Housea circumstance whicli I very much regret and which I d i d my best to preventI trust that honourable members w ill assist the House Committee to carry out their duties in the way in which it was intended they should be carried out-. It The Parliahas frequently happened that new magazines have disappeared from the table of If members of the press the Libraryf o r two or three weeks, and in the interim fresh magazines have had to be purchased. Then again, it has been found that press representatives are often in the Library when honourable members If strangers are permitted the go there to discuss matters of which they do not desir© the public to be informed. In these circumstances tlie Library Committee have resolved that, whilst the press representatives shall b© afforded every opportunity to obtain any works of reference which they may desire to consult, thos© works must be secured only after direct application has been mad© to the Librarian. very much obliged to you, sir, for having",12,Peters Lowed I N The P A R L I A M E N T A R Y Gardens O R

[12.44] I should like to say in reply to the Prinie Minister that the Government have not been influenced by any such reason for refusing to limi t the operation of such legislation in respect to auy of the war emergency proposals which have so far been submitted to the House. I have embodied in my amendment precisely the .wording used in the other war Bills which have been before this Chamber, and which are now upon the statute-book. Prime Minister might have applied to any of those measures the argument which he has just used in defence of the motion now before the Committee. The Prime Minister has said that there is no occasion to limi t the operation of this proposal for a particular time because the legislation can easily be altered by Parliament at the instance of the Government at any time. statement to make. If a person is aware that it is proposed to impose upon him a heavy tax for only a limited time he may probably be prepared to pay it with a good grace, but if he knows that he. will have to pay the tax for a long time, or an indefinite time, he will consider it a much more serious matter. People may be able to meet burdens for a little time which they would be altogether unable to bear for a lengthened period. a great mistake in trying to impose upon the country a burden of this kind for an indefinite period. sent being taken by the Government bears out what I have previously said -not touched up the honourable gentleman. I believe that if no war at a l l had occurred these burdens would have been imposed upon the people who will have to bear them, by the Government and the party they represent, as a matter of policy and in furtherance of their desire to destroy the land-owners of the country. friends opposite have openly said so. ' They have declared that the Federal land tax was imposed with the object of bursting up large estates, and not for revenue purposes at all. A t one time the. object was closer settlement, now it is revenue. The Prime Minister, and those who are supporting h i m , are showing their hands clearly. They believe in this taxation as a permanent burden upon land-owners and those who have acquired landed property dn this country. This is really a levy and not a tax.

The honourable member for Barrier was the only honourable member who had the courage of his Free Trade convictions. In reply to tlie interjections of the honourable members for Swan and Darling Downs concerning the duty on sugar and other things, the only logical deduction of their contention, if it is pushed to its proper conclusion, is that the limitation of the production of any article immediately establishes an argument in favour of having no Customs duty upon it . As a matter of fact, in Australia, there is in the dried f r u it industry at M i l than men who manipulate the foodstuffs. dura a deliberate method of limiting production in order to keep up the price of the article produced. There are certain goods for which the public pay the wholesale rate of 4 i d . per lb., but which tlie producers admit, on sworn evidence, can be produced at a profit at 3d. per lb. ment. statement is to be found in the evidence taken by the F r u it Commission. In answer to a question as to the price at which f r u it could be profitably produced, the reply of a witness was that it could be produced profitably at 3d. is probably speaking of the price at which f r u it can be delivered at the packing house, and not of the finished article ready for the market. of the actual price the grower requires. This admission shows how an article that might, and ought to be, a regular useful diet of the people is being manipulated in order to secure high prices. According to the argument of the honourable member for Darling Downs, when pushed to its logical conclusion, ail that would be necessary to establish a case for the abolition of the Customs duty would be the limitation of production rendering importation necessary. What the Government intend to do, and what we desire, is the encouragement of the production of sufficient goods in Australia for our own requirements, obviating the necessity for any importations. How does that position affect the matter of wheat supply ? We are faced with a shortage of wheat, a commodity which is absolutely necessary for the health and welfare of the people. The people must have bread, but, unfortunately, the farmers of Australia, owing to unfortuitous circumstances, have not been able to produce sufficient wheat for our requirements, and therefore we have no option but to import. Eveni f we retain the duty, importations will not be prevented, and the question for us to consider is whether we should make the wheat we import for the purpose of making it into bread as cheap as possible, or whether we should maintain it at a fictitious value in order to benefit a few wheat speculators.

But we are faced with the position that there are thousands of people out of work, and less able to-day than they have been for the last twenty years to pay extra for food, and this is the very time when opportunity is given for a remission of duties on goods which we are not able toproduce locally, in order to give assistanceto our people.",27,Schedule

Mr .FINLAYSON -The honourable member for Henty has repeated a statement, which has been made previously in this discussion, that there is no encouragement to the farmer to go in for increased wheat growing, but the statement of the Minister that this is only a temporary expedient shows that the remission of this duty does not remove the inducement to the farmer to utilize an increased area for wheat growing. farmer pay more for his bags. to be dealt with when we come to it . I am prepared to make conditions as easy as possible for the primary producers. Every man of us, no matter what he represents, or what his occupation in life may be, knows that when the primary producers are doing well, we are all doing well, aud when the primary producer is not doing well, none of us is doing well. It is all nonsense to say that one man or another man, or one party or another party, is opposed to assisting and,., protecting the primary producers. this side are just as anxious to assist the primary producers as are the members on the Opposition side, and I deprecate all this talk about the party in power being opposed to the man on the land. The primary producer is entitled to protection as much as any other man in the community, but there is nothing in tliis proposal of the Minister that is going to have the slightest effect, legally or logically, in hindering the farmer from planting out areas of wheat. Eveni f extensive areas were planted to-day, it T h a t is not the would be months before there could be a harvest, and we could get any benefit from the sowing, and during that time the present abnormal conditions, which haye necessitated the action of the M i nister, might have disappeared. tionist Minister would put back the duty for the benefit of the farmers. would. If that were not so, there is The country is nothing in the argument of honourable members opposite who are objecting to the removal of the duty as being a step which is detrimental to the farmers. I m mediately the present difficulty vanishes the duty ought to be re-imposed, and if it is not sufficient we ought to increase it in order to give the farmers adequate protection against any possible competi 1 tion from foreign-grown wheat. I only rose to emphasize the fact that the principle I was advocating in this House a fortnight ago is now accepted, and I hope that later on, when we are dealing with the Tariff, and I have the honour of again submitting a suggestion on similar lines, honourable members on both sides of the House who approve of the remission of the duty on wheat w ill not forget that special circumstances demand special remedies, and that there ought to be a reserve power with the Minister to T h a t is a matter deal with extraordinary conditions such as prevail at the present time. The burden of the argument of the honourable member for Brisbane is that when there is a shortage, and prices rise high enough to enable the wheat duty to operate, we should strike it off, but we should re-impose it when there is a big production, low prices, and a surplus for export. That is to say, that the wheat grower must be protected through the Customs when Protection cannot be of We on any use to him, and when the duty is of any use we must strike it off. I quite appreciate that in the present circumstances, with the shortage of wheat, the existence of a state of war, and the prevalence of drought;-althoug h tlie war is the least influence in connection with the price of wheat there is a very strong inducement to the Minister of the day to take extraordinary means in order to deal with an extraordinary situation.

289,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [3.16],"that the Protectionist farmer will be given very scant courage in the growing of wheat, and also in his general support; of a Protectionist policy, if he comes to the conclusion that the duties, which he believes tective and might have a steadying influence on prices, are to be struck off every time there is a shortage. The present position of the Protectionist farmer, as far as I , a representative of a farming district ancl a supporter of a Protectionist policy, can ascertain, is that he believes that the primary products of the soil should receive protection alongside with the production of the secondary industries. tectionist wheat-grower knows perfectly well that the wheat duty is not immediately operative, that it operates only in extraordinary times of drought and shortage But there is a fundamental principle underlying the whole policy, and he believes that there is a possibility of the duty on wheat steadying the prices in certain seasons of heavy production elsewhere. We know that a protective duty is not i m posed for the purpose of giving immediate Protection in times of normal production and importation, but one of the most valuable phases of the Protectionist policy is that it prevents dumping in certain seasons when there is a surplus. The farmer, therefore, knows that there is a steadying influence exercised by the duty on wheat, and he has loyally supported Protection as a national policy. I am satisfied, however, that for some considerable time the farmer in the wheat growing districts has looked upon the policy of Protection in respect of the secondary industries as a policy which is inducing centralization throughout Australia -116 believes that that policy has had the effect of centralizing in large factories most of the manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth. secondary industries? industries. The primary producer raises the raw material, aud the secondary phase of the production is its conversion by the manufacturers into the finished article. The one is a primary producer, the other a secondary producer, but both are equally valuable units of the community. I tionist principle at all, but pointing out that for a considerable time there has been a belief on the part of wheat-growers that the tendency of the Protectionist policy has heen to centralize a large number of factories in the towns, might sometimes be proand that such aggregation has had the effect of enormously helping the Labour policy of the Commonwealth. There is no doubt that that feeling has been growing for a considerable time amongst a number of sound Protectionist farmers. The farmer who is a Protectionist believes that the Protectionist policy should operate all round. I ask the Minister Avhether this was the only way in which I recognise that even a Prohe could do something to relieve the situation? AlthoughI introduced a deputation to the Minister some time ago, and have asked him several questions on the subject here, I have refrained from asking him to suspend the duties on fodder. In Australia we grow something like 3,250,000 tons of hay per year, and consume the whole of that quantity. It is estimated that in Victoria this year there will he a shortage of f u l l y 40 per cent. If that is the case all over Australia, probably the shortage will be 1,000,000 tons. Fodderf or cattle is absolutely essential to the putting in of more wheat for next season. In my district, which, I may say, is the largest wheat-growing constituency in this State, 90 per cent, of my constituents w ill have to buy seed wheat, and,, as an immediate expedient, I am not prepared to say that they may not welcome the suspension of the wheat duty. Somefarmers w ill welcome the proposal as a means of getting seed wheat a little morecheaply than otherwise they could do. I can understand that the position is an acute one. would come from the suspension of the fodder duties. having suspended the duty on wheat, should have suspended the fodder duties,, because fodder is as essential as. seed wheat to the putting of large areas under wheat for next year. The position of the Minister is an inconsistent one. I am prepared, and have been prepared as a P r o tectionist, to support the Protectionist am not attacking the Protecpolicy and to retain the duty on wheat in existing circumstances, because I believe-",29,Schedule

293,Mr Sampson,"Yes. The Minister,tliat fundamentally it is dangerous to interfere with and render unstable that which people believe to be a stable policy. If this course is to be taken in the case of other hand, the Government have imposed wheat because there happens to be a temporary shortage, why should it not be taken all round? Why should not the Minister suspend the duty on every commodity of which there is proved to be a shortage in the community? for the very large importations of most of the goods we use is that we do not manufacture a sufficiency or do not manufacture the goods at all. If there is a shortage in any one of these lines, is there not a justification, assuming that the article has reached a famine price, as sometimes occurs, for a section of the community immediately representing that particular interest to ask the Minister to suspend the duty in order that the goods may be cheapened to the community? able members are going to suspend the duties, oven on extraordinary occasions, iu order to bring down the prices of commodities, they will completely undermine and upset the Protectionist policy of the Commonwealth. That, it seems to me, would be a very dangerous thing to do. So far a large section of the farmers, as we all know from the return of Protectionist members to this House, have loyally supported the Protectionist policy. I might divide my wheat-growers into two classes; one believes in having no wheat duty, but he says that consistently with that position there shall be no duty on agricultural machinery or any other 'product which the farmer uses. The Protectionist farmer is not able to state that, generally speaking, the duty on wheat is an effective duty, but he says that it is part of the policy df the Commonwealth, which he loyally supports, and might have a steadying influence on prices. That it can exercise a material influence on prices we know is not true, because we export more wheat than we consume. If the exportation^ of wheat is not to continue, wheat growing will cease to be an industry. As wheat is an exportable product, the. duty on the article is generally inoperative. I am very sorry to think that in present circumstances the Government have seen fit to propose taxes to be levied almost wholly on the lands of the community. I am not going to speak of the particular Mr Sampson. kinds of lands on which taxation is to be levied, but most of the new taxation is to be raised directly from the soil. On the a revenue duty on cornsacks, the raw material of the farmer, and immediately following that imposition he is singled out in connection with the wheat duty as the individual whose protection is to be The reason disturbed, because there is a shortage of wheat in the Commonwealth. Possibly the action of the Minister may meet with the general approval of the community. I believe that it would have been possible for the States to have managed this business better, and probably if they had managed the business it would not have been necessary for the House to take any action. I am not referring to any particular State. The principle which has heen introduced by the Minister is one If honorwhich might work very badly in the building up of the general policy of Protection. In present circumstances, I regret very much the proposal of the Minister, although it will serve the wheat growers in my electorate who have to buy seed wheat. The proposal will he welcomed by those persons to some extent, and the consumer will -welcome it as a means of securing to him a cheaper loaf, but viewed from the Protectionist standpoint it introduces a dangerous principle. Having once decided to suspend the duty on wlieat during the period of the present drought, the Minister should, in order to be consistent, have suspended the fodder duties in order that the farmers might have an equally necessary commodity to secure the cultivation of a larger area next year. Erom whichever stand-point it is regarded, the proposal is certainly a blow aimed, at the established Protectionist policy of the country. [3.28] I must confess that I am not in agreement with some of my colleagues on this side in regard to the attitude of the Minister on this particular question. I , as a consumer, and speaking on behalf of other consumers, welcome the proposal. My only regret is that it does not go quite far enough. The Minister has stated that this year there will be a shortage of 7,000,000 bushels in the quantity of wheat, necessary for home consumption. I think that some action of this kind",30,Schedule

ELLIOT JOHNSON -This action will tend to prevent the price of bread from being unduly increased, which is a great consideration to the masses of the people. We must have regard rather to the interests of the community as a whole than to those of any section, whether they be primary producers or manufacturers. Any action that can be taken to prevent the cornering of foodstuffs should be taken by whatever Government may be in power. Such action w ill always have my cordial support. The cornering or attempted cornering of the people's staple food supplies I regard as a crime against the community at large. I urge the Minister to go further. I am entirely in agreement with those who hold that the primary producers should not he subjected to unnecessary disabilities. One of the disabilities that have been imposed on the farmers is the duty on cornsacks; that duty has been objected to by representatives of the farming community. cause it requires them to pay more for the cornsacks which they have to use. further handicap upon the farming industry is the duties on agricultural i m plements and machinery, and upon other things required for farming operations. I should like the Minister to recognise that the farmer needs encouragement. That-encouragement can best be given by removing taxation from the machinery, implements and material that he visestaxes which now add materially to the cost of farming. The honourable member for Wimmera has pointed out that the farmer himself w ill benefit by the free importation of wheat, because at the present time there is a shortage of seed wheat for thc next sowing. Seed wheat w ill be cheaper now that the duty on wheat has been removed than it would have been had the duty remained in operation. That w ill be a. decided gain to farmers who have to purchase seed wheat. The normal market price of wheat, however, is not likely to he affected, because the cost of freight and in surance is in itself a considerable protection against undue competition from abroad, enabling tile locally produced wheat to compete successfully against the imported wheat. As a consumer, and speaking on behalf of consumers, I am I think that that is a f a i r glad that action has been taken which w ill prevent the price of bread from being unduly increased. I welcome any steps that may be taken, especially in a time of drought and of war, to prevent the inflation of the prices of the necessaries of life. There are some who can afford to pay higher prices, but the majority who are wage-earners cannot bear a heavier burden than that which is now imposed on them. The purchasing power of their earnings has been materially reduced by the imposition of duties on the many articles which they have to purchase to meet their daily needs. A tax which would increase thebread b i ll of a f a m i l y by Is. per week would he a very serious thing to most wage-earners. per family. MrW .

MrW . ELLIOTJOHNSON I do not think that he should be so singled out,, but that a similar course of action should be taken regarding the things the farmer needs in the prosecution of his industry. The Minister has pointed out that the price of bread would have risen to almost a prohibitive figure if he had not taken the action whicli he has taken. The farmers would be the last men in the world to wish to bring about such a state of things as would arise from the excessive dearness of bread. Asi t is, they will not be affected adversely.

It would have been quite as effective if the Minister of Trade and Customs had merely proposed a suspension rather than the repeal of the duty on wheat. The Minister has intimated that it is not the intention of the Government that the proposed repeal of the duty shall be permanent, but there will be considerable anxiety in the community as to when the duty repealed will again be imposed. except in a drought year ? with that in a moment.

There are districts in South Australia that have suffered more or less severely from the drought, but there is still in those districts an abundance of wheat for farmers on their farms seed and for flour, although scarcely any cities fodder in hand and no herbage in the paddocks with which to face the coming winter. One phase of the great trouble, in South Australia more particularly, is that, during the summer and autumn, farmers within the rainfall area, where drought conditions hitherto have been When we are dealing with the comparatively unknown, will suffer more severely from want of herbage in the paddocks than from shortness of wheat.

The conditions are exceptional. Two causes are contributing to the very high price of wheat. In the first place, the price of wheat existing today is at a liigher point than it would have reached but for the European war; whilst the second consideration, and one' nearer home, is the existence of a drought which has deprived more than one-half of the wheat-growers of South Australia, at all events, of any result from thei r labours during the past year.

They have not been cleared, and they will be subject to a revenue duty, which is certainly unjustifiable from every point of view. on cornsacks has to be borne despite the fact that cornsacks to-day cost nearly twice as much as they did two years ago, the price of jute having practically doubled. one representing the farmers, will have to pay the duty, aud carry these cornsacks the honourable over to next season, plus the duty and twelve months' interest.

Protection as a principle is not challenged, although the Leader of the Opposition says it is. We conserve our market's for our own products when we know that we can supply our requirements, but when it is obvious that through no f a u l t of the country, or of the people in it , we cannot -do so, surely common sense dictates that we should meet the situation. Some one has said that consistency is the doctrine -of fools, and it is time that some people recognised the truth underlying the saying. When our own production is in excess of our requirements, the price of the commodity is immediately levelled by the world's price, and, conversely, when our -own requirements are not supplied in ternally, the incoming commodities are regulated by the Tariff, and therefore the prices of all our supplies within the T a r i ff barrier are raised accordingly. We do not want this. No Protectionist is anxious for high prices. We want to conserve our markets for ourselves, and when this is done effectively there is no abuse possible. Provided that competit i o n is possible, it is immediately generated. Our desire is that the competition shall he encouraged, and that the advantages of a Tariff shall not be abused. It is for that reason that we have asked for greater powers, but that opens up another question.

It seems to be altogether opposed to the actions and speeches of the Minister of Trade and Customs ever since he entered this House. I always thought he was an ultra-Protectionist, and almost a prohibitionist, but I am afraid that his ideas are circumscribed by what is going on in Victoria, and that he forms his judgment from what he sees immediately around him. I fear that he does not take a wide view of the whole question. The Government of Victoria are quite alive to local interests, but the honourable member has admitted that he has not consulted any of the people or Governments of the States, and has acted "" off his own hat.""

If the Minister of Trade and Customs says it is obligatory, it is so only from his point of view, and would not have been obligatory on our part.

I hope that in future country voters will know how to treat men who profess to represent the farming classes, but who turn down their interests on every conceivable occasion. I am one of those who do not believe in suspending a Protective policy on every occasion. But I believe that the circumstances of to-day are quite exceptional.

During the present year we have, I presume, an assured wheat harvest of something like 25,000,000 bushels, and it is assumed that, in order to meet the requirements of our population, we shall be obliged to i m port 7,000,000 bushels from overseas. The ratio of difference between our population in 1902-3 and that in 1914-15 is not commensurate with the difference between the present crop in sight, and that harvested in 1902-3; but the point I wish to make is that the grower in 1902-3 waa under the domination of the world's market, whereas to-day he is not under that domination, for the simple reason that only a few months ago the Minister of Trade and Customs saw fit to put an embargo on the export of wheat, in spite of our having more than twice the harvest that we had in 1902-3. against the export of wheat practically means that the whole of Australia's wheat crop is retained in Australia for the purposes of Australia. The removal of the import duty will subject that wheat to with wheat grown by black labour, as pointed out very properly by the honourable member for Richmond. We are too credulous and hopeful if we think that we can get wheat from Canada. That Dominion is practically committed to supply all its surplus to the United Kingdom. Last year the United Kingdom had a shortage of 50,000,000 bushels, although we contributed 18,000,000 bushels, and to which countries in Europe that are to-day out of action contributed many million bushels. Russia w ill not allow wheat to be exported because it requires its wheat crop for its own use, and as Austria, Hungary, and some parts of France are in a similar position, Great Britain must look largely for its supply to Canada. Whati t cannot obtain from that source it will probably get from A r alphabet 'of farming. gentine and India, while the removal of our import duty on wheat will mean that some of our shortage of 7,000,000 bushels will be grown by black labour in In d i a : producers of Australia, let this motion go thus is Labour wisdom justified of her children. equilibrium that the farmer has been [64] led to believe exists regarding his calling is not a proper thing to do. The farmers as a class have been truly f a it h f u l to the basic principle of our Federation-that there should be Inter-State Free Trade with some modicum of Protection against the outside world-ye t at the only time that this i m post on wheat can be at all effective, t h at is when there is a shortage in the wheat supply of Australia, it is proposed to take away that modicum of Protection. Therefore, .1 say that, in the circumstances, the inducement for the farmer to remain f a it h f u l and loyal to his political creed is fco be severely shaken. tectionist. that? stand that the honourable member does not know what a moderate Protectionist is.

I do not know how those honourable members on the other side of the Chamber, who represent constituencies containing large numbers of primary producers, can reconcile their position as members of a party which proposes to remove the duty on wheat. When they go before their constituents, they will have some ugly questions to answer, seeing that tlieir party propose fco do this, while at the same time they place a tax on the very bags that the primary producers have practically to give away with their wheat.

That is the position as it appeals to me. Those honourable members who talk about the removal of the fodder duties being of equal importance with the removal of the wheat duties are misconceiving the position. There is no analogy between the two duties. Every hour of rain and every change of conditions may help to solve the problem of food supply for stock, and even in the last resort, if we are faced with the alternative of whether stock or human beings shall die, we shall have little diffito indict us on principles and on evidence culty in apportioning our sympathy. It is also true that by using those portions of our fertile continent which are not afflicted by drought, and making the best of the conditions in those portions which are afflicted, by the growing of other crops, we can do much more to alleviate tlie difficulty in regard to feed for stock than we could by any interference with the fodder duty. The difficulty 'in that respect is not a great one; I am a staunch Protectionist who is not willing to subvert his principles for any exigency except one of pre-eminent importance. The exigency of to-day is one of pre-eminent importance, and if,"" as I believe, it is a situation that can never arise again in our lifetime, or, I hope, in the history of the world, we cannot reasonably cavil at extraordinary action to do the best thing possible in a set of disastrous circumstances. As I apprehend the situation, what the Government are doing is this: The wheat supply being short, we are going to provide means by which the exploiters of the present false system of distribution will be compelled to loosen the ropes they have put round the necks of the community, because, for the time being, our ports wil l be open to wheat from oversea. A t the same time we shall see that the principle of Protection is observed so far as to insure that . the wheat-growers will not be affected in the future. Surely, when we take the [64]2 The honourable member only means by which we can protect all parties we are not doing anything which is not justifiable upon the highest prin ciples. Those people who think they can make political capital by indicting us before the farming constituencies w ill find that they are reckoning without their host. The vast majority of the wheat produced in New South Wales is produced by share-farmers, who have much bigger grievances in connection with the initia l stages of production and distribution than may he brought about by the cause we are now discussing.

I would prefer to make up the difference out of my own pocket than to support a proposal which would enable a very few farmers who have some wheat to exploit the general public, and to f ill the coffers of speculators under our absurd system of distribution.

It is very easy to show that in such a highly protected country as the United States of America, although wealth has been developed to an extraordinary degree by the imposition and maintenance of a Protectionist policy, its distribution has become a scandal as well as a danger to the whole world. ""We are told, on evidence put forward by a late member of the House, Mr house. This only goes to show that a man Thomas Brown, in a paper he read some time ago, that in the United States of America nine men control £600,000,000. The Labour party is out all over the world for the purpose of providing by effective Protection-and it will never be effective until we are able to institute the new Protectiona system which will not only secure the greatest possible result for labour applied under scientific principles of production, with every aid that can be devised by the community or the individual, but also a system which will insure its legitimate, fair, and equitable distribution amongst the people who created it. in business on these lines? man knows perfectly well that individual action is utterly incapable of opposing the forces which scientific swindling has developed in this age, and for that reason we want to introduce this system. In Australia we have not the power now. In the extraordinary circumstances which are apparent to all, the Commonwealth Government are doing the best possible thingI do not say that it is the best thing-and we hope by the institution and maintenance of this truer and better system with regard to production and distribution to obviate the necessity of even our principles being subverted in a moment of exigency such as the one we are going through now. The men who claim to speak in the name of the working farmer, as I have pointed out before, are never heard where he is being robbed and despoiled. I was corrected for stating that a man can put in and take out a crop, without including the cost of the little while ago that you had share seed and the manure, for £1 an acre, farmers 1 and the honourable gentleman, at one time Premier of an adjoining State, share farming now, since I have come who contradicted me, said that the statement is an obvious absurdity. Nine shillings an acre, he said, is the cost of the seed to put in the crop, and he put down the price of the bags to hold the crop at 2s. I can honestly say that for the twenty-five years I have been growing wheat, the bulk of the seed, being produced on the farm on special plots, has not cost me 3s. a bushel, and if it did not take 7s. or 8s. to provide the bags to hold each 9s. worth of seed sown, the bulk of us would have been in the poorwho says that 9s. worth of ordinary or average seed wheat, when harvested, will go into 2s. worth of bags knows nothing about the question. That is the class of man we have safeguarding the farming interests in the State and Federal Parliaments, and voicing the grievances of the farmers. If I had the time, and honourable members cared to listen, I could tell them that on the Stock Boards on the local governing bodies, where I sat for years, and even on the Land Boards, whose presiding officers are some of the ablest men in Australia, the conditions which are brought about through absurd laws would simply appal practical men, and it is little wonder that we have men of intelligence and capacity flocking from the country to the cities. These are grievances apparent to the every-day eye of a practical man, but I have never heard them challenged by the gentlemen who, for the purpose of making a little political capital, try lo indict certain action as being against the interests of the farmers. In the Labour movement we represent the legitimate farmer who works with his own hands. What justification is there for attempting to conduct an industry in a wholesale way under a system of expensive idlers when any man of ordinary intelligence may, with application and perseverance, become a fairly successful farmer? Why do we require a system which really means that we have quite a number of expensive people who never do a day's work, but who farm the farmer, and claim to voice his interests and support him in every possible way?",42,Schedule

The present proposal increases the rate of the land tax, but the underlying principle is unchanged. As there is an exemption of £5,000 unimproved value, it is clear that a considerable estate may be held by any person free of taxation. On all taxable estates the tax is to increase uniformly until the taxable value is in excess of £75,000, when it culminates in a flat rate of 9d. in the £1. denied that the tax is a heavy one, but, as I do not wish members to misunderstand my positionI speak for myself in particularI say that I believe unimproved land values taxation to be sound in principle from top to bottom. the beginning, without an unimproved value exemption of £5,000. sons for an exemption of £5,000 unimproved value in the case of a Commonwealth tax.

Many people, no doubt, if they did not actually sell their estates, at least divided them amongst their families so as to reduce the incidence of the tax. In the more favoured parts of Australia, such, as the western district of Victoria; the Mount Gambier district in South Australia, the north-west coast of. Tasmania, and. certain parts of. Queensland, there are lands for which it is possible, no doubt, to find a good market even a t the present time. Such lands can be sold in small areas, and there is generally a demand for it . But in other parts of the Commonwealth land is not nearly so saleable to-day as it is under ordinary conditions. Land which might realize £ 3 0 an acre in a normal season, if forced on the market at the present time, might not realize more than £ 2 0 per acre.

That ia one tax alone, but the States have to come in with their land taxes. There are municipal rates to pay, and other outgoings to meet. This, therefore, is not taxation, but a confiscatory levy, and very engaged means as much to the poorest few pastoral propositions in Australia can stand it. The man who wants to sell his property will have to take £30,000 or £40,000 less for it than he thought the market price would be a little while ago. That is not the way to encourage men to take up land, nor is it fair to those who have undertaken pastoral propositions. The only justification there could be for it would be a policy by which the Government was to take over all the land. That is one way to nationalize land, but it is a very unjust way. It is simply filching the land from the man who owns it by reducing its value. If the Government want to take a man's land from him, they, above all others, should be prepared to do the fair and honest thing. Let them pay the owner a fair amount for the acquisition of the land. That is the way the States do it. If they want a man's land they have it fairly assessed, and he has the right to put the matter to arbitration. The State then pays him what the arbitrators consider to be the fair value. The Commonwealth Parliament, on the other hand, simply lowers the value of the land until the Government can take it over at a very low price. That is not fair, and is certainly not what the general body of the people want. They like a fair deal, but this is not a fair deal, and yet we are coming to it very fast. If this tax is not put on for war purposes, it must be put on as part and parcel of the programme of certain persons who meet periodically in Australia to draw up a platform which our honourable friends opposite have to accept and put through this Parliament as soon as they can.

He said he was assured by the Attorney-General that it did, but on examining the BillI find that all that it repeals is the schedule in the original Act, substituting for it a new schedule embodying higher rates.

In a case where the rental is, say, 6d. per acre, but, in addition, the lessee has to clear so much scrub, or do so much fencing, or put certain improvements upon the land, the fulfilment of those conditions is regarded as part of the rent, arid consequently will diminish the taxable value upon which the proposed tax will fall. improvements to be made in the future, but what about improvements which have already been effected ? which have already been made w ill nob affect the value of the lease; the economic value of the lease will not be in creased by virtue of these improvements at a l l , because this is a tax upon the unimproved value of that, lease. orable gentleman arrive at the economic value of a lease and still allow for i m provements ? ber might just as well ask me how I arrive at the present value of a freehold estate upon which improvements have been made.

I wish to point out that improvements put on a lease are not to be considered in any way as part of the value of the lease.

Where a lease is held upon the condition that improvements vest in the lessee, they are not in the nature of rent, because the lessee will u l t ithe economic annual value, whatever it mately get the benefit of them. But I call all these leases, which, in my own State, are designated improvement leases. Sir conditional purchases in Western Australia. ther the right honourable member is aware that which are really conditional leases, are now taxable under the section of the Land Tax Assessment Act, which readsNotwithstanding anything in the last two preceding sections, the owner of a leasehold estate, under the laws of a State, relating to the alienation or occupation of Crown lands, or relating to mining (not being a perpetual lease without revaluation, or a lease with a right of purchase) shall not be liable to assessment or taxation in respect of the estate. Where there is a right of purchase, or where the land ultimately falls in as a freehold, it is now taxable. Where a lease is held upon the performance of certain covenants, and subject to the performance of these, the ownership vesting in the lessee, it is to all intents and purposes a conditional purchase within the meaning of this section. But I was speaking of a different class of lease altogether. If a man holds a lease; if , under'the terms of that lease, he is required to make certain improvements, and if the lease contains a condition that upon its expiry the improvements shall vest in the lessee, then in such a case their capitalized value will not be deducted from the value of the lease. But where the carrying out of improvements is regarded as one of the conditions upon which a man holds a lease, and where, upon the expiration of his lease, they vest in the Crown, and they are in the nature of rent, their capitalized value will be deducted from the value of tlie lease. But at the expiration Where an improvement is effected by the lessee, either under the terms of his lease or otherwise, and those improvements, under the conditions of his lease, are vested in him, so that he may dispose of them when he disposes of his lease, the value of the improvements will not be deducted from the value of the lease, because, under the terms of the lease, he is already entitled to those improvements and to a * f a ir value for tliem when he transfers. The value of a lease may be determined by arriving at the difference between the rent paid by the lessee to the Crown and is, and that value is to be ascertained in the same way as the value of a freehold is ascertained. It is based on the JOHN FORREST -They are called departmental tables, which provide for 4£ per cent, per annum, which is considered as a f a i r return for capital invested in I do not know whesuch circumstances. In other words, 22^ years' annual rental equals the conditional purchases so-called, capital value. Now let me say a word as to the class of leases likely to be taxed. A great many leases w ill not, in the very nature of the case, be taxable, among them the overwhelming majority of mineral leases. The precise value of a mineral lease for the purposes of the proposed amending B ill will depend on circumstances. Usually a reasonable rent is paid. Sometimes it is quite as high as the economic rent. In some cases the Crown reserves surface rights, and in all mineral leases there is a reservation of all silver and gold found thereon. These reservations naturally decrease the value of a lease for the purposes of land taxation. mining leases? say that, in the majority of cases, goldmining leases would not be taxable. paying big dividends? whether they pay large dividends has nothing to do with the point.

The value of land of a similar kind must be considered. The amount of land available for mining for precious metals is necessarily limited, and it follows that if we give to A a certain right to mine upon a piece of land we limit the right of every other member of the community by so much, and we therefore say to A that he must pay to the community an equivalent amount for the exclusive right he does not share with the rest of the community. you tax the output of the mine. output should be one of the material factors, but not be the only factor in determining the value of a mining lease. a royalty on the output be the better method ? be a tax on dividends. a lease whether it is being used to the best advantage or not. Let me put the matter in this way: If there are alongside one another two pieces of land, one of which produces 30 bushels of wheat to the acre, and the other with precisely the same kind of soil produces nothing of any value, a man may come along, and say that the second piece of land is worth £20 an acre, and the fact that the piece of land alongside and many other areas close by have been able to produce large quantities of wheat will fix that growing land, and affect its value, although it has not produced anything approaching 30 bushels to the acre. In regard to mining, however, the situation is a little different, but the same principle desire to know is, whether this is to be applies. as the only factor in determining value. I shall not push the matter any further, because all that we wish to lay down is the general principle, and this, I suggest, is sound. In the absence of data, the amount of revenue likely to be derived from taxing leaseholds cannot be fairly estimated, but the principle of taxing leaseholds is absolutely sound. We tax a man on the value of the land that he holds, and for which he does not pay a fair equivalent. He is taxed on that value for which he does not pay, a value which belongs to the people, and which derives its value from the community, as does the value of freehold land. -We have heard two explanations of the Bill, one from the Prime Minister, and one from the Attorney-General. I noticed that the explanation given by the Attorney-General was more pointedly addressed to the honourable member for Grey, but that honourable member found that the explanation was so abundantly clear that he did not consider it necessary to remain in the Chamber. I am sure that when the Attorney-General bludgeoned this measure through Caucus he must have made himself considerably clearer, especially in regard to the taxation of leaseholds, than he has done to the House. This is a new class of taxation. I am sure honourable members, after listening to the explanations of Ministers, must be perfectly clear as to how the value of leaseholds is to bo arrived at, and as to the rates leaseholders will have to pay, and practically as to what the tax will amount to. For instance, the Prime Minister told us that the Bill now before us contains all that is necessary in order to carry out the taxation proposals, not only in regard to freehold land, but also in regard to leasehold, but we have now had an explanation from the Attorney-General, that, except in regard to the rate of the tax, this Bill does not affect leaseholds, and that a new Bill will have to be introduced to deal with them. This is a very important point, which will affect a considerable number of taxpiece of land as wheatpayers throughout the Commonwealth. We have been told by the Attorney-General that there will be a number of leaseholders in the Commonwealth who will not pay any taxation at all. WhatI We cannot regard production classed as one assessment or two assessments. Are there to be two taxes, one for leasehold and another for freehold, or are the two to be put together?

A civil servant may have a small orchard at Dandenongj or have some speculation in Queensland, and to say that the leaseholder will not be taxed because his leasehold will not be worth taxing is all humbug. They will find out that a man owns certain property in another portion of the Commonwealth, and he will be hunted to death like every owner is hunted at the present time. Honourable members say that they know what every leaseholder will have to pay, I can honestly say that I do not know what any leaseholder has to pay by way of land tax. .We are told that the economic value of the property is to be taken, that the fair rental value will be estimated, and then if improvements are made under certain conditions, a deduction for them will be allowed. If the improvements are made under other conditions, the deduction will not be allowed. Take the case of pastoral properties in Queensland. Many of those properties were assessed only two or three years ago by the Government of Queensland, and I presume that that Government will not allow the holders to continue to rent the properties at an absurdly low rental. They have brought the rental up and up until they have reached what they consider a fair figure, taking into consideration the loss which the holders suffered in the past. Many of the people who put money into properties in Queensland would only get their capital back to-day if they sold out. Do honourable members think that the Government of Queensland have not assessed those properties at a fair value ? What is the position of countries on which the holders have had to go in for artesian bores? Take an estate, the saleable value of which I will assume to he £100,000. It has, say, 60,000 sheep on it to-day. As the sheep are worth £60,000, the value of the property will be £40,000. Then there would be fences and buildings, and perhaps four or five bores, which may have cost on the average £3,000 or £4,000 each. What is to be the taxable value of that property? people on that land have in the past suffered to a very considerable extent, and the price at which they could sell to-day would return to them practically only their capital. NowI turn to the Mr Manifold. increase as regards rates. The Prime Minister's manifesto, and his supporter when they were going about the country, said that any new taxation would be taken from those best able to bear it. Apparently these landholders are the people whom the Government consider best able to bear the taxation, the people who are endeavouring to keep their stock alive and to carry on their properties. Many people who went in for those large properties in the drought areas havebecome involved to a considerable extent. Probably, in many cases, these people are on the verge of ruin. Numbers of their stock have died, and they are not able to get any more money with which to attempt to keep, the remainder of the stock alive, but.the taxable value of. their properties may be £200,000 or £300,000. of their land decreased ? on the basis of the selling value, of many of those places to-day is absolutely nil. those places are? properties, the selling value of which would be nil if they were placed on the market. Those places are mortgaged to a considerable extent, and the owners are not in a position to pay taxation. Under section 66 they may go begging to the Commissioner for a remission of the tax, but that is all they can do. What is in the Attorney-General's mind is that the valuer for the Land Tax Commissioner will, on seeing the drought conditions existing on these properties, reduce the unimproved value to a very considerable extent. Mighty good care will be taken that the valuers do not go to tliose properties while the drought is continuing. Another factor that has an important influence upon the land tax is the very high unimproved value that is placed on property. member suggest that the value put on two years ago is necessarily the value today? value put on two years ago is the value to-day.

Let me refer to the plains land of this State, whicli I know as well, perhaps, as any .member of the House. The arable land there was saleable, and, perhaps, is saleable to-day, at £6 10s. or £7 per acre. Near by, just over a ridge| is stony country, which it is impossible to crop, and the valuer says that if the arable land is worth £ 6 10s., this other land adjacent to it must be worth £ 5 . Does any honourable member say that it is fair to put on land that will carry a sheep to the acre an unimproved value of £ 5 ? That is the way in which the valuations have been made. What is the land-holder to do if he objects to the land valuation? Court, and fight his case with all the witnesses he can get, and then comes the Land Tax Commissioner'with his valuers, and says, "" I . know a man who w ill buy the property at a certain price; therefore, that must be the value of the property."" The assessments have been very unfair indeed, and the mode of objecting to the assessment is also unfair, and involves the taxpayer in enormous expense. In a few cases 'the unimproved value has been successfully disputed before the Court, but what has that settled? Nothing at all, because the Commissioner shelters himself behind these words, "" Y o u r case is not similar."" Therefore if any other land-holder wants redress, he too has to go to Court. In this way the Land Tax Commissioner can defeat every application for a review of the assessment. As regards the rate, there have been many arguments to show that this tax really does not fall heavily It will f a l l very heavily indeed upon those who have large holdings. I am one of the lucky individuals, as I do not own very much land in the Commonwealth. I was fortunate enough to own a property, which I endeavoured to develop and put to the best possible use, in the localities where land could be sold. Buti f there had been no settlement I would have been landed in exactly the same position as those who went out into western 'Queensland, 'New South Wales, and the northern portions of Australia. The land tax does not affect the holders If the value has gone of good land in the Commonwealth to anything like the same extent as it Yes ; after one has affects those men who are stranded with properties which are not fit for closer settlement. The people who are doing their very best to develop the Commonwealth will be h it particularly by the land tax. I hold, and have always held, that if there is land which is f it for closer settlement, and it is situated in a locality where closer settlement would be advantageous, and where men could establish comfortable homes, and make a fair living, it is the duty of everybody to put that land under closer settlement. It does not matter whether the land is put under leasehold or under freehold, though I consider it is very much better for men to work their farms on the freehold system. In order to get at the few people who persist in He has to go before the holding land in these particular localities -the Attorney-General mentioned the State of Victoria-the Government propose to saddle the whole of the people of the Commonwealth with a very excessive tax indeed. A tax of 9d. in the -£1 on the unimproved value means practically ruination to a. good many persons. It is, of course, idle to argue the point. I recognise that one is only wasting breath in speaking. This matter has been settled. It was settled some years ago, and it has been settled again in this Parliament. We iknow perfectly well what we have to expect. Men know today that if they continue to hold land in large areas it is .the intention of the party on the otlier side, if a tax of 9d. in the £ 1 will not break up the estates, to increase the tax to Is. That is practically what it all comes to. I issue a note of warning 'to those who continue to hold large estates, that honourable gentlemen on the other side have not any on the small individual. excuse.

The only alteration which it is possible honourable members on the other >side contemplate is to make the tax heavier than it has been if they get the opportunity.

Once we take the individuality out of men or stop them from making improvements the value of the land disappears. We know that since the imposition of the Federal land tax the value of land has decreased in a great many places in the Commonwealth. land has gone down owing to the drought and the war. much on this subject, but I think that in Australia, especially in this Parliament, men do injury to the country by pointing out the great disadvantages to which the land-holders are subject, and in that way help to destroy the value of the land. The Attorney-General has stated that it is intended to tax all Crown leases. Hitherto such leases have heen frei; of land taxation. This proposal will hit every Crown lessee in Australia. does not matter whether a man is a large or small holder. holder he will not make improvements ou the soil, and therefore there will be no employment for people. do not improve the lands there will be no value in them. It is idle for any man to say that you can take the unimproved value of the lands. What have the great lessees done in Queensland and New South Wales? By putting down artesian bores, erecting wire-netting fences, and making improvements they have really made the value of the land. tion will take the heart out of the landholders. We shall not get capitalists to go out into the back country to improve the land if they find that directly it is improved the Federal Treasurer will come along with a proposal for a heavy tax. A holding is subject, first, to a local tax, next to a district tax, and then to a Federal tax. Government seek to tax people both wben they are on the land, and when Mr Livingston. they are in the land. If this proposal is enacted there will be absolutely no incentive to a man to take He has had a great up a piece of land and improve it as the pioneers did in the old days. This iniquitous legislation will not give any Tho man the benefit of the exercise of his brain and energy, and the value of his property. The honourable member for Grey, no doubt, will point out directly that the Government are taking power If anything is likely to to tax all kinds of leases. In South Australia we have perpetual leases, gold leases, salt leases, and oil leases. I hope that before very long we shall hear of the holders of some oil leases paying a very large dividend. In South Australia, shortly, we shall see the first bore started in Australia for oil. I am aware that the value of Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. I do not like to say too General said this afternoon that the lessees will be asked to declare the valuo of their leaseholds, but that in a great many cases will be an extremely difficult thing to do.

It The Government have made a mistake in stirring up a discussion on land values at If we hit a large this time. Whenever anything bad is said of Australia, it is cabled across the world, and our credit is damaged, but If holders when anything good is said it gets no publication. I noticed that when travelling in the Old Country three years ago. The existence of a drought or the occurrence of a flood would be cabled Home, but nothing was said about the mighty good season that some places were getting. In my district it would be impossible This taxafor a stranger to properly estimate the value of the land. Many properties there have been so improved that persons who knew them five years ago would not know them now had they been away in the interval. We have had a lot of battles on the subject of land value taxation, and now the whole question is to be opened up again. We were led to believe that the The present Government intended to impose taxation to meet the cost of the war, but no one can say that the land tax is incidental to the war.

I know of land ih New South Wales not far from my own district which a few years ago was merely a rabbit warren, but an enterprising man took it up, fenced it with wire-netting, made dams and put down bores, and to-day the property is a valuable one. Do you think that that sort of thing will be done if the more land is imnroved the. more it is taxed. It is to be remembered that when enterprise is checked it is the working man who suffers most. improvements. provements the land of which I speak, aud much other land, would have no value. The working man is made to nay even when taxation is imposed on city property. taxed passes on the tax to the smaller trader, and he again passes it on to his customers by adding a little to the prices of the articles which he sells to them. At the present time land in many parts of Australia is worth nothing. Some of our best country has suffered more of late than it ever suffered before during the last sixty years. On the other hand, happily for the Commonwealth, there are parts of Queensland and New South Wales where the season was never better than it is this year. What Governments should do in Australia is to develop the country by extending railways through it, so that stock may be shifted more easily in time of drought. provided against by the building of railways to allow stock to be easily moved, and by the sinking of bores and the conservation of water. The honourable member for Balaclava said the other day that it is in times of prosperity that one should spend. I say that it is in times of prosperity that one should save. In South Australia the Government always puts a little aside in good times, and I am proud to say that this year it is in a position to postpone the payment of its rents for twelve months, thus giving consideration to the Crown lessees in respect of the losses sterling in the taxable value by One-fifteen which they have suffered by reason of the drought. I should not object to the taxation if it were war taxation, because every man in the community, rich or poor, should be only too pleased to do what he can to help the Empire in its hour of need. A great deal more will be lost by the imposition of this land tax than will be gained in revenue. It will create a disturbance which is to be deprecated. An army of inspectors will be needed to travel over the country valuing leaseholds. At the present time most of the lessees have no money with which to pay a land tax. The next taxation that will be proposed will be income taxation, and then the Commonwealth Government will have imposed all the taxation that it is within its power to impose. It would not be so bad if the holders of land had money with which to pay the tax. All estates under the value of £5,000 are exempt from taxation, but returns have to be made in respect of estates worth £3,000 or more. It must be remembered that the holder of land cannot The merchants whose land is rely unon getting a certain return from it every year. To-day a good part of our wool is stored in sheds, unsold. How could the owners of that wool pay the tax. The produce of land has to be sold in thc open markets of the world. The Govei'nment, therefore, should be careful not to harass the land-holder, particularly the lease-holder. The Postmaster-General knows what struggles land-holders have made during the last twenty years to settle themselves on the land. Many of them to-day, although they have worked hard, are walking about without a shilling in their pocket. They deserve the greatest consideration from the Parliament of this country, and Droughts can be largely I hope they will get it. The Government, in this measure, propose the imposition of an extra .absentee tax. There is a very great deal in this little Bill, though it has not required very much printing to give it expression. In the first schedule to the Bill provision is made for the rate of the land tax when the owner is not an absentee in these terms:For so much of the taxable value as does not exceed £75,000, the rate of tax per pound sterling shall be One penny and one-fifteen thousandth of one penny where the taxable value is One pound sterling, and shall increase uniformly with each increase of One pound thousandth of one penny.

The Bill with which we are now dealing relates only to freeholds, or to such leases as come under section 29 of the principal Act. member's pardon. when one would expect the Government to keep as far as possible from party politics, they have chosen to impose what I regard as a vindictive tax upon the landholders of the country. So far as urban lands are concerned, the city propertyholders will simply pass on the tax. Who pays the land tax on the magnificent block of buildings occupied by Anthony Hordern in Sydney? firm does not pay it. It puts an additional halfpenny upon this article and an extra penny upon that, so that the consumer pays it all the time. It is not the city land-holders who will pay this tax. But the impost will hit the workers of Australia so far as it applies to our cities. extending from Queensland into the When it comes to broad acres outside our metropolitan areas, I admit that the landholder will have to pay it. But here again I venture to say that it will fall very heavily on the workers, and will add materially to our growing army of unemployed. this question of valuation, and also upon the merit of taxing leaseholders, I desire to say a few words. The Attorney General has said that the method of estimating theunimproved value of leases which will be adopted-and , personally, I think it is the correct method-wil l be to take as the capital unimproved value of any lease the difference between the actual rental, minus improvements, that is being paid, and the true rental, or, as it is colholds. We must not view this new loquially called, the economical rental of the land. That is doubtless the true method of taxing lessees, assuming that the policy of taxing them is a sound one. But in taxing any estate one has to consider a great many facts, especially when there are two jurisdictions to be put into actual operation. Let us take the position in Queensland. There the pastoral lessees under the Crown, near the Northern Territory, pay about 5s. l$d. per square mile as rent, but they pay a total rental of 12s. 9d. per square mile for a good area of that country, in the shape of, without rent, betterment taxes and rates which they are charged for the public service given by the construction of railways, and in outlining a policy for the the honourable Northern Territory I pointed that out. Assuming that the basis of the tax on leaseholds is to be the difference between the actual rental, which is about 5s. l j d . , and the economic rental, which might be 12s. or 14s., is it fair to levy a tax on that difference, considering that already Queensland is getting it in the shape of rates and betterment taxes ? Queensland tax leaseholds? pointed out, on page 8 of the outline of policy for the Northern Territory, the great difference in the rent paid in the Northern Territory and Queensland for practically the same class of country. I showed that, even taking the same estate Northern Territory, the annual rental paid in the Northern Territory was Is. 6d. per square mile, while Queensland charged 5s. l^d. per square mile; but I also pointed out that in Queensland the total obligations were 12s. 9d. per square mile, because the leaseholders have to pay local rates and betterment taxes which are based on the assumption that developmental railways give a corresponding advance to the value of the area under lease. In these circumstances, if the State estimates are correctly made, the Crown in Queensland is already taking or taxing the difference between the actual rental paid and the economical rental, and the Queensland lessees are the class of leaseholders who will be largely taxed by the Commonwealth taxation of leaseform of taxation in a prejudiced, or abstract, way; we must look at the actual facts and see to what extent we should tax leaseholds under the varying conditions with which we have to deal.",62,Speaker Cer Which We Term The Unimproved Value Of

568,Certainly The Mr Glynn,"It does in one way. IThe States should certainly ""tax the unimproved sale value of leaseholds, but there is another difficulty in the fact that in a great many cases the annual rental is fixed at a low figure in order to induce settlement. matter quite apart from the consideration that must be given to the existence of onerous covenants in a lease as provided for in section 28 of our Assessment Act. Land may be leased at an annual rental of 6d. per acre, though its true rental should be Is. an acre, but there may be onerous covenants such as building covenants, and, in assessing what the actual rent is, we must take into account, not only the cash payment of 6d., but the value of the onerous covenants. the other hand, the Act does not allow for betterment taxes or local rates, which in no sense can be regarded as onerous covenants attaching to a lease. Before leaving the question of the Northern Territory, there is another matter upon which I would like to say something. The Government had, very properly, in view a large policy of systematic development, not only by connecting Queensland and the Northern Territory, but also by extending, without delay, the railway northwards from Oodnadatta through the Macdonnell ranges. As a matter of fact, a survey of the best route from Oodnadatta through Alice Springs is, I think, now being made on instructions issued by the last Government. This railway is to be built right through the centre of the continent, and, when Queensland is ready, connexions will be made from about Newcastle Waters on the central line w i th the southern part of that State, and thereby w i th New South Wales. However, as we cannot build these lines unless we get from the lessees in the Territory and others benefited something like a reasonable return for the public advantages given by their construction, in the outline of policy I provided that if we were driven to it there would be a possibility of taxing what might be regarded as the difference between what is the true and what ought to be a reasonable rental. We get Is. and Is. 6d. a square mile for land which in Western Australia, no better in quality and in the same geographical area, fetches 6s. 3d. per square mile. I maintain that the States, or in the case of the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth, must consider certain factors which are disregarded in the taxation of lessees by our existing law. The last Labour Government passed aD Ordinance under which the first 5,000 I am speaking now of a allotments of agricultural land were to be free of all rent for twenty-one years, or during the lives of the lessees, b ut on the principle laid down in the B ill to be brought in , as no deduction could be made for onerous covenants, the f u l l economic rent of these leases would be assessed in defiance of the Ordinance giving the land free of rent. But why was the land to be given free of rent? In order to induce settlement, and not because of certain covenants having to be fulfilled on the On leases. I had to deal with this matter in a d r a f t Crown LandsB ill , which, had we been in power, I would have introduced into the House, and I took some of these conditions into account in respect to a possible policy of taxing the leases in the Northern Territory. The reason for fixing low rentals in the case of pioneers who go out to our dry pastoral areas, and for allowing them to take up their holdings free from the burden of covenants, is that they take tremendous risks in the task of developing the outskirts of our practically unsettled areas. would exclude all those leaseholders you mention. am not laying much stress on the burdeu that will be imposed on the lessees of the first 5,000 allotments under the Ordinance of 1912 in the Northern Territory, though, perhaps, in a few years' time the economic rental may be much higher, and the covenants may be harder. I think M ill says that a principle is best tested by an extreme case of its application. The rent of pastoral leases is fixed at a comparatively low figure in Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, in order to induce men to go out and develop difficult areas. Experience has not enabled us as yet to arrive at any fixity of periodicity for droughts, and the possibilities are that in the first year of his enterprise, a man may be h it by a drought, and thus the rent is fixed at a very low figure for considerations that our assessment law, as it now stands, cannot take into account.

That might work hardship in some caseswhere the others were not'liable. For instance, in section 27'of the Land Tax Assessment Act. reference is made to section 13, under which certain lands, such as those held by charities, are exempt from taxation. and the lessee had to pay the whole of the taxation, unless we make provision in our Act, he would have no recourse against the reversioner, that is the holder of the fee simple, because under section 13 he is not liable for anything. As the result, of the criticism by honourable members on this side-and I think we did cure a goodmany of the imperfections that appeared in the Bill-provision tion 27 to cover such a case as that. But the position as it is now is that, if the lessee under the Crown has to pay under the circumstances I have mentioned, the Crown is not liable. We cannot tax the Crown in the States, and it is the Crown in the States who is the reversioner of this land. other provision, or it is covered by section 13, the lessees whom we now drag into the net oftaxation will have to pay the whole of the tax without recourse to the reversioner, who is the Crown.

Take now the case of mining: Suppose thetaxreached, such Crown lessees as'the' companies-holding the mines at Broken Hill. Nothing appeals more to people than to say, ""Why should not these big shareholders living in Germany and England be taxed?""

But let us look at the actual position. It not prepared to say, that every ounce of gold won from the earth costs more the tax at once, he than its value. Perhaps that is a paradox only fit for one who is not an Irishman. However, I always regard that remark as meaning that there are so few prizes in prospecting over the big areas of Australia, that unless we hold out the inducement of a very big reward to enterprise and patience-[becaus e labour not having capital has to be patient arid selfIf those lands were leased, denying, whilst capital requires only the money-w e will never, without large State expenditure, have our. mines, unknown at present, but actually in existence, discovered and subsequently developed..

If we bring in a severe tax, in the form of either a royalty or a tax oh the unimproved sale value of the mine, we may be ignoring such, considerations as those to which I have Therefore, unless we make drawn attention. As I have said, I am not opposed to taxation on the unimproved value of land, whether it be held on lease or in freehold, but I see in connection with Crown leases that there are difficulties; which I hope the Minister will not overlook, and amongst the greatest are those of. which I gave an example in 'what I the bearing of some, saidabout Queensland -. Members of the Opposition seem to have over-reached themselves in the captiousness of their criticism of these taxation measures. Everything is wrong in connection with the Government proposals for raising money. We are told that we ought not to have introduced the Tariff in order to raise money; that is an outrage. We are told that the death duties are something, unheard of, and will deprive the widows and orphans of their just dues, although we know that the duties will be so adjusted as to avoid anything like an unfair imposition.

For the time being, percause of the many vested interests that haps, the owners of certain site-values, have grown up with it.

If it is to be dealt with by this Parliament it will be done by the GoI do not care what has vernment now in power, and I shall have Every tax some remarks to make about these matters when the Tariff is being considered. We are doing only a fair thing by the people of Australia in asking them to contribute according to their capacity at this juncture in our history. We must get money from ourselves in some wayby using our own credit, by issuing notes, as we cannot borrow, and by taxation, indirect and direct. As regards indirect taxation, we are adopting the easiest form to the people, and as regards direct taxation, we are adopting the easiest equitable form which can be conceived of, and, in doing so, we are not attempting to tax the whole of the wealth of people. We are taxing wealth after the poorer people have been passed over, and then in due proportion, as the aggregation of estates is disclosed. In respect to the leasehold question, I agree to a great extent with what has been said, namely, that the results from the imposition of the tax are not likely to be very great. It will probably be discovered that the tax is not worth collecting. I do not know whether it is or not. But I do know that many a leaseIsi t seriously hold proposition is better than many a freehold proposition. A t the same time, I admit that there is many a leasehold which is not worth picking up. I also admit that to-day there is not much in many of the leaseholds. In assessing We have land values a wise assessor takes due cognisance of the fact that the seasons are not always good, and, according to the location of the land, the rainfall, and so forth , the value is fixed.

My honourable friends have an ineradicable idea in their minds that if they can w in at an election, that is the best proof that everything they are doing is right. They have only that one test. Those who get the biggest number of votes must of necessity be on the right side. I ask the honourable gentleman to confine himself to the B ill . dei. amount of the "" vox "" about my honourable friends, but there is not much "" d e i "" about them. Here are some more instances of the effects of this taxation in Sydney. They are taken from the taxation returns.

A . , of Sydney. from returns furnished by the people concerned. If a man obtains a return of taxation from the City Council, wil l the honourable member dispute it ? he learns from the Taxation Office the amount of taxation paid, w ill the honourable member question his figures? What is the meaning of this? where this document can be obtained. a copy for each honourable member opposite. This statement was published in the morning newspapers of Sydney. This is the way in which the figures relating to eighteen city properties work outTo make the position, whioh is a serious one, more understandable, I have tabulated the lowest, fixed taxable outgoings on eighteen city properties in Martin-place and Moore-street, and others near the General Post Office. The calculation includes the now super tax proposed for this year by the Holman Government. It will be noticed that the property I referred to as paying £1,600 a year land tax pays in rates and taxes £4,058 per annum for the 78-ft. frontage, or £52 0s. 8d. per foot frontage per annum. Out of every £1 rent paid, 10s. 3d. goes in rates and taxes; the real landlord gets 9s. 9d., and out of that must come bad debts, agents' commissions, & c, and if he buys materials for repairs he pays again s 25 per cent. Customs duty on locks, paints, &c. It is clear, therefore, what is required to reduce the present admittedly high rent charges is a political surgeon or statesman who, recognising the real cause of the evil, will cut off from the produce of property the extraneous growths of taxation which bave wrongly fastened themselves on to rents. And so on. He furnishes the whole table of rates. That taxation is made up as f o l l o w s : "" W a t e r rates, 6 d . "" member speak of a water rate as a tax ? the sense that it is penal.

Many a man to-day enters into a lease which it would not pay him to accept if it extended over only four or five years, but he enters into it because he hopes to get something out of it during the last four or five years of its currency. If , under this Bill, at the end of , say, six years, when his property is beginning to return him something, we are going to tax the economic rental of that man's lease, we shall be doing him a gross injustice. do not see how it is possible to avoid constant trouble, seeing that these two landlords will be assessing these leases at different taxation from them. The proper thing to do is to leave this question of leasehold to the people who own the land, and who have sovereign rights over it in the different States. his fair share, in principle he is just as [65>-2 much entitled to be taxed as is the landowner.

In many cases-as I have already pointed out-reward s are offered to men to tempt them to go and reclaim land for the State. has entered into a contract with those men, and has said to them, "" If you w ill go and reclaim these waste lands for a certain number of years we w ill give you a certain reward,"" surely we have no right to break into that contractual relationship between tenant and landlord-the landlord being the State Government, and operating through its State ofncials. Consequently this B ill is based upon the principle that before we can get a penny tax under it we have to condemn the present management of State lands by State officials and the control of it by the State Government. I do not desire to occupy the time of the House at any further length, but I felt it my duty to point out this very grave defect in regard to the proposed taxation of leaseholds. [10.19] I must apologize to honourable members for trespassing upon their time at such a late hour on Saturday evening, hut this is a matter of such supreme importance to the great producing interests of the country that I feel I must make some observations upon the principle of the B ill which is now before us. measure is a direct attack on the landholders and the primary producers of the Commonwealth. It is a distinctly class tax, with no scientific or sound economic basis. serves of the State Governments, attempting, as it does, to interfere with the public administration, in those various States, of the lands of the Crown, particularly in regard to Crown leases. This tax is superimposed on existing State taxation. Wlien the original Commonwealth Land TaxB ill was introduced in 1910, honourable members opposite justified the legislation on the ground that in some of the States the Parliaments had failed to i m pose proper taxation. That justification may not be cannot hold good to-day, particularly in view of the heavy taxation imposed by this National Parliament in that original Act. This legislation strikes at the very root of the question of the cost of l i v in g; because anything that hampers primary production must operate in the direction of increasing that cost. As to the incidence of the taxation, it has been explained that, in so f a r as it relates to city properties, it may be passed on; and I can give one illustration of this. The first progressive land taxation passed in any Australian Parliament was introduced in South Australia by the Government of which the late Mr Kingston was the head. A t that time Mr Kingston was attorney in Australia for one of the richest absentees who held property there, and Mr Kingston, as representing that gentleman, made a provision in all future leases that any taxation should be paid by the tenant, in addition to the rent. the Commonwealth Act. done in South Australia, and has continued ever since. I believe in land taxation that is reasonable and just; and I should like to draw attention to the example set by the democratic people of New Zealand, who were the first to i m pose heavy land taxation of a progressive character. Next to that of the Commonwealth, the taxation there is the heaviest, being, perhaps, double that of any other community in the southern world ; but the same Parliament that imposed this heavy progressive taxation, also proThe vided that the produce from land shoidd be exempt from income tax. This exemption placed the land-holders there in just about as good a position as the landholders in some of the States where no It clearly trespasses on the preland tax prevailed. I do not intend to dwell on the question of freehold taxation more than to repeat what has already been stated, that when the 9d. scale is reached, it means 75 per cent, of the capitalized value of the estate, and another 25 per cent, means the whole lot. This kind of unjustifiable taxation is not equalled! elsewhere in any part of the world, and by driving capital out of land investment, it does infinitely more harm, twenty times over, than it can possibly do good. This taxation is",74,Pbopebties

When the original Land TaxB ill was introduced here, sworn declarations were received from the representatives of the owners of estates in the Eiverina district, showing that every penny of profit would be swallowed up by the tax; and these declarations were 'foilowed by requests that the Prime Minister would send a Government official to examine the returns and balance-sheets, which it was hold would clearly and unanswerably support the statement. However, ray intention to-night is to deal more particularly with the new phase of this legislation, which includes in its operation Crown leases of well nigh every kind. Eirst, there are the pastoral leases; and, judging by the remarks of the A t torney-General, in moving the second reading, it is the intention of the Government to take every penny between what is now collected by the Statesi n the way of rental, and what the Commonwealth taxing officer considers the present economic value of each property. This is a very uncertain quantity. be a generous limit. able to-day, but in twelve months' time may disappear altogether, along with a good deal more of the value. circumstances the incidence of this taxation will be quite unreliable as a permanent source of revenue for the Treasurer. Australia, on which three years ago 105,000 sheep were put through the shearing-shed, this year less than 25,000 have been shorn, and they have had to be followed all over the run of 2,000 square miles, and the wool taken off them wherever they happened to be found. That is the present condition of one estate in South Australia, which some years ago would give a clear annual revenue of £25,000 to £30,000. interests of the development of the in terior of the country, where climatic disadvantages have to be faced, and where the pastoralists have to contend with the ravages of wild dogs, foxes, and rabbits involving enormous expense in the erection of vermin-proof fencing, costing annually in many instances double the whole of the rent collected by the Crown, is it wise to look for the last penny of available taxation from settlers upon country of this character? The taxation proposed is trenching on the prerogative of the State Crown Lands Departments, because if there should be a margin between the rent now collected and levied over a given term, and the value that may exist in a normal or a prosperous season, it ought to be regarded as the property of the State, and not as the property of the National Parliament. Mr"" RODGEBS -And if the States secure this margin their action will defeat the object of the Pederal tax. it will. I am amazed that such a proposal, so far as pastoral leases are concerned, should have secured a passage through Caucus, seeing that among honourable members opposite there are not only honourable members representing pastoral areas, but also honourable members with a close and practical knowledge of the conditions attaching to the occupation of these big areas. State Governments and State Crown Lands Departments have had anxious times in dealing with the vexed pastoral problems, and the result of their experience, extending over It may the last thirty or forty years, has been It may be availthat the rental of a lease, even without taking into account added taxation, is a secondary consideration, and that the In tliese primary consideration is to secure continuous occupation and the carrying out of improvements of a permanent character. Improvements such as subdivision On a pastoral property in South and water conservation represent, possibly, more than half the value of the whole estate, and the carrying capacity of a lease is proportionate to the capital wisely invested in carrying out these permanent improvements. The exaction of heavy contributions to the public revenue from estates that have to experience so many disabilities, climatic and otherwise, thafc no legislation can abolish, is a most suicidal policy. In the In the late 80's and the early 90's there was a fallacy in South Australia that the squatter was robbing the people of the grass, and as tliere was a popular clamour to penalize him, when fche 1888 leases fell in , provision was made by which the State was to exact a much heavier rental.",75,Pbopebties

Men who had been in the out-back districts the State warned him and the tration that his policy was wrong, and their warning was well-timed, because in four or five years these estates, rents had been quadrupled, serted, and could have been taken up at any price. every of which and 5s. per square mile to £3 or £4 per square mile, were left on the hands of the Government, that when that happens in the case of pastoral estates improvements' rack and ruin in a very little time. would have been infinitely South Australia not to have got a penny of rent so long as the properties could have been kept in occupation. result of the mistake was that after a Royal Commission had investigated part of the way-back country, legislation character Parliament Those men had to be given a forty-two years lease, and, in case of many of the estates, at practically a peppercorn rental with the right to re-adjust the rent at the end of the first twenty-one would seem from the speech of the Attorney-General, that a good many of these estates are held to-day at a rental altogether inadequate portion to their real value, and it is the intention of the National to appropriate the. difference between the present rental and tlie real value to-day. If such an available margin does exist, it is the property of the States, and not of the these estates are just now ending first term of twenty-one years, and have nearly reached the time when an adjustment of the rental will have to be made for the second twenty-one years. I say Mr Kicliard Foster. again that the margin between the rental the 1888 leases when they and the real value, if it exists, belongs auction to the State, and if we take it from the Just at that time Statei t is depriving the State, not only of its rights, but of something that it Commissioner needs more than does the National Parliament. But what is the true position to-day ? Unfortunately, in connection with in many of those pastoral properties, there high is no such margin. The reason is that after the present holders entered upon the occupation of their 1893 leases, they had from the very inception of to make improvements of an extensive Adminischaracter. It is true that wool rose in price, but it is also true that the vermin question became more severe than it had whose ever previously been in the pastoral history of Australia. W i l d dogs, rabbits, were deand foxes overran the country and there was a consequent necessity -to provide Vermin was spreading in over those immense areas vermin-proof direction. Estates, the rental fences, which represented an impost on had risen from 2s. 6d. the pastoral lessee two, and in some in stances three, times greater than the rental they had to pay. Therefore, the position and we know of the pastoral lessees in South Australia is that, in consequence of the enormous go to liabilities they had to incur to get rid of It the vermin, such burdens have been laid better for upon them that if the real value of their leases is greater to-day than it was then, the added value does not compensate for The the payments bf 6s., 8s., and 10s. per mile that the lessees had to make for every protection against the vermin. Added pastoral to those considerations is the fact that of the most generous in Australia, with the exception of ever submitted to any Queensland, there is to-day so far as had to be introduced. the pastoral properties are concerned, a bigger drought than has even been experienced before. In some instances, the flocks have almost' beeu entirely wiped out, and generally they have been deciyears. It mated to such an extent as to represent a very heavy loss. and out of all prorent of those lands?
