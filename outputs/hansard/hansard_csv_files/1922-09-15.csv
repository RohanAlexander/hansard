In view of the small amount of business to be done, I consent to an extra sitting day only on the ground that the Prime Minister does go to the constituencies, for the sooner that is done the better it will be for Parliament. That suggestion does not seem, to me to meet with unanimous support. However, the Prime Minister, in an endeavour to justify this motion without giving tbe real reason, states that it is submitted because of misdemeanours on the part of the Opposition-becaus e we have obstructed business. But I venture to say that no fair-minded person acquainted with the work that has been done since the commencement of the session would say there has been any obstruction; indeed, there has never been what might be called a lengthy speech. I do admit, however, that it haa been necessary for the Opposition, in order to focus public attention on the misdemeanours of the Government, to submit several questions for consideration. deserves another! ISIr. CHARLTON I submit that in taking the course we did we wasted no time. stand the Prime Minister being desirous to create the impression outside that because of obstruction by the Opposition he is compelled to abandon certain measures. I assured the Prime Minister yesterday that, so far as concerns the measures on the business-paper, there would be very little time consumed, and no obstruction by this party. I wish to repeat a question that I asked yesterday as to whether the Prime Minister intends, according to his promise in the Governor General's Speech, to introduce the constitutional amendments, and (have them submitted to the electors about the 9th December next. not intend to do that, or, if he does, he has not taken the House into his confidence.

As to the Budget, I said, when six weeks' Supply was granted, that it was sufficient to carry the Government over until we went to the country, and I repeat that statement now. Inside six weeks the measures on the business-paper will be all passed. What is the use of talking about the Estimates, and there not being time to discuss them? As a matter of fact, the Government will have a job to keep a quorum by the time the business is through, for all will be off t j their constituencies. If our friends ia the Corner wish to move any amendments on the Budget they will find themselves Of course, we can quite underleft "" on their own,"" and the Government will not care so long as they get the Estimates through. There will be no trouble when the Government once make it known that they are going to the country, because then the fight will be in the constituencies, and not in the House.

It is obvious that an election is going to take place. wish to know if they know now?

35,Mr Charlton,"Quite so. WeParliament may be given the enlarged powers that are neeessary. -The other day, when we were in Committee, there was some objection raised to the use of a foreign tongue in this Chamber. To-day we have had more instances of the use of a foreign tongue here. The Prime Minister has described the Budget as sui generis, but we need not resort to a foreign tongue in order to say what the right honourable gentleman means. The Budget has all the characteristics of ""chop-suey,"" and it is generous in every respect-it is like a bunch of carrots for the stock to eat. The Prime Minister has referred to the business that has to be done, and to certain misdemeanours that have been committed by parties in this Chamber in the conduct of public business. I can only say that the Country party have never been guilty, during the whole life of this Parliament, of any obstructive tactics. On every measure introduced this party have, as far as lay in their power, brought constructive criticism to bear, but if they thought a given measure was altogether beyond repair, then, of course, the criticism became destructive. As to the business that has yet to be done, the Country party, whatever may be done by members of other parties, intend to remain at their posts right to the finish. seat3 if you do. but that is what we intend to do. However, we should like some definite statement from the Prime Minister regarding the introduction of the constitutional amendments. Last year, when the Convention Bill was brought down, we had a definite statement from the Prime Minister in response to the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) that we should have ample time to discuss those amendments to be submitted to the people at the next general election. In view of the constitutional difficulties that surround this question, we should like a definite statement now as to whether it is the intention of the Government to give the House an opportunity to discuss the amendments. quite fail to gather the real reason why this motion is necessary. I cannot see how an extra sitting day will assist the .Government. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) tells us that the extra day is to enable Parliament to get into recess, but I remind the honourable gentleman that Parliament has only recently met, after a recess of some months. When Parliament meets, and honourable members take the opportunity to ventilate some of the gross misdeeds of the Government. misdeeds, aud I think that is the way in which the people of the country would describe them. When honourable members take advantage of their opportunities here to direct attention to the misdeeds of the Government, we find the Prime Minister airily saying that on account of obstruction here the Government are compelled to ask for an extra sitting day. That strikes me as the most serious reflection the Prime Minister could cast on his own Government. It is a clear indication or admission that the Government is hopeless and helpless to control the affairs of the House. The Government have a majority, and yet it is so helpless that a minority is able to block necessary business If that be the position, the Government are unworthy to occupy the Treasury bench. lenient, and I reproach myself bitterly. it is the Opposition who have been altogether too lenient. We have not taken advantage of the opportunity to half the extent we might have done to assail the Government. Wc have allowed the Government to dodge on the question of sugar, which they have completely shelved by referring it to a Committee that in all probability will not submit any definite report before Parliament is dissolved. There is no necessity for an extra sitting day. If the Government have certain business to do, they have a majority behind them, and it is their duty to see that the business is carried through, as it can be in the ordinary course. The greatest admission of weakness and helplessness on the part of the Government is the submission of this motion to-day by the Prime Minister.",16,Repatriation

43,Mr Mahony,"Indeed, I think thatnot agree with the closing observations of the last speaker ( Mr Mahony). I think that this motion will meet with the almost unanimous acceptance of the House. That is chiefly because of the intimation which was conveyed some fortnight ago by the Government to the Chamber, that it would be necessary, if expedition was to be resorted to in the discharge of public business, to give time allowance to measures; in other words, to use the guillotine if more progress was not shown. Some of us then thought the proposition to have an extra sitting before that extreme measure was used was infinitely preferable, and we said so. I still regard it as a better proposition than for the Government to mark out the time which the House may consume on individual issues. As I said before, I think that the guillotine is an objectionable measure, unless absolute urgency is demanded. machine, if properly used. if used with discretion, and in fairness to all concerned. a long time for that! will have to wait a long time, particularly if the allusion of the Prime Minister to the appearance of his face, at the time the Prime Minister was speaking, has any element of truth in it . It is clear, have promised, not only to introduce, but I think, from what we see in the press, and what we hear whispered, that the Government's object, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) said, has not been fully disclosed to-day. If this were an ordinary session, and it was proposed to get into recess in order to allow members to reach their homes by Christmas, it is true that the state of the business-paper would not justify the introduction of this motion. It is perfectly clear that if the Government desires are not frustrated this Parliament will go to the country as early as possible, and certainly before the end of the year; and I think the Government would be wise in directing such a course. I do not mean wise for their own sake. That remains to be seen; I mean wise for .the country's sake. I do not think, however, that the Government are animated entirely by that consideration. The most patent fact about this Parliament is that it ought to return to the people, for it has run its course. Without desiring to employ terms of impropriety, I would say that, in a political sense, this Parliament is demoralized, and that the sooner the people are given a chance to decide on the policy and personnel of a new Parliament the more likely are representative institutions to be restored to ipopular favour. If the Government, however, hurry to the electors and decide not to consider important matters which were promised at the opening of the session-whethe r they be on the notice-paper at this stage or not-the people will be rightly resentful. If , for example, Parliament were to give but slack consideration to the finances of the country by scurrying through the Budget debate, or if the Government were to ignore their repeated promises to adopt means for the is an admirable amendment of the Constitution, such conr duct would be an improper use of their opportunities. I join with other honourable members in asking the Government to intimate as early as passible their intentions regarding the amendment of the Constitution. It is true that thc Public Service Superannuation Bill is an important measure, but it is not so important as the basic or foundation law of our whole parliamentary system. The eagerness with which the Government to finalize the Superannuation measure before the close of this session proves, to me, at least, that the Prime Minister is out of focus in respect of that matter; that is to say, he will have proved h/mself so unless he follow it up immediately by announcing that the Government will deal also this session with the question of constitutional amendments and will afford the people the constitutional period, and opportunity, in which to decide regarding them. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) should receive consideration at the hands sf the Prime Minister. It will be of no use for the Government to introduce the subject of constitutional amendments at too late a stage. If the necessary Bills were introduced at",17,Repatriation

50,Mr Watt,"The honourable memberence the present moment would be early enough for Parliament to deal with it ; but if this opportunity to give the people the necessary two months' consideration required by the Constitution is let slip, the fault will be that of the Government. The Government have been insistent all along, ever since the taking of the Fisher referenda, upon the necessity -for changes in the Constitution. The proposed Convention Bill failed by reason of its own weight, through its own faulty construction. It was obviously doomed to failure from the first. Honourable members almost unanimously expressed the view that such must be its fate; but that expression did not and does not end our duty. If we believe that Australia cannot become a great nation until the National Parliament shall have been endowed with wider powers, the matter immediately ranks as more important even than finances at this particular stage. It is more important, indeed, than anything else in the Government's programme and in the promises contained in the Governor General's Speech. I trust that the Government will give this House an intimation, as early as may be possible-if not to-day, then, at least, on Tuesday next-regardin g the actual programme which they intend to pursue; and that they will announce, particularly, whether they intend to go on with the Constitution amendments. I do not wish to be as scorching as th« honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr tend to utter a word upon matters of the Watt), but I protest against the Prime Minister making his appeal for an extra sitting day each week on the pretext or excuse that honourable members have been wasting time. There are very important matters still to be dealt with. The Electoral Bill is one of these; but the proposed amendments to the Constitution will necessitate the presentation of the most important Bills of all. There are still other weighty matters to be dealt with, such as, for example, the necessary legislation to deal with the railway gauges. orable gentleman may say, ""Hear, hear!"" Th* work of bringing about uniformity will run into £57,000,000; the first instalment alone will' involve a huge sum. Are honourable members to be expected to rush the necessary Bill through at a moment's notice, without consideration or debate? Are they to commit the people to enormous expenditure without ordinary legislative care and forethought? Then there is the Public Service Superannuation Bill-anothe r very important measure, and one which will involve the taxpayers in an expenditure of still more millions. Is that to be forced hastily through Parliament? members present. absolutely disorganized. A hint has now been dropped that honourable members will not be given an opportunity to discuss the Budget, or that if they take the opportunity they will be compelled to remain here "" on their own."" If suggestions of that kind are "" playing the game,"" I must have only a very slight knowledge of honourable members' responsibilities to their constituents. If the Prime Minister would definitely announce when the elections are to be held, honourable members could settle down to business. The Prime Minister laughs. My remarks are matter for laughter also to some of his supporters. I warn them that it will be no laughing matter for many of them when the election results are announced. The tactics of the Government in bludgeoning business through after the fashion now proposed will receive critical consideration at the hands of the electors. In this chamber to-day Government supporters are gagged and bound. They are told not to dare to open their mouths; they are threatened with all sorts of happenings if they disobey. So, presumably, they do not ingravest importance. But do they really propose to permit the Superannuation Bill, and the measure for the unification of railway gauges to be rushed through without debate or the slightest examination? Do honourable members behind the Government actually propose to commit the taxpayers to the expenditure of millions of pounds without word or thought ? on the other side of his face before long. He certainly would continue to do so if he had remained at Bendigo; but, having removed, he will probably come back here and smile again.

Honourable members are about to go before their constituents. This Parliament will have ended before many more days. It is urgently necessary, therefore, that the Bills to provide for the referenda should be immediately presented. I suppose that if the Government refrain from taking the necessary steps the proposal for holding a Convention will again be raised. Commonwealth will be put to the expense of selecting delegates from every State. A costly Convention will be held, and the results of its labours will eventually come before Parliament, which, if it accepts and ratifies them, will then submit the proposals to the people. Why should that devious course be adopted in view of the forthcoming elections? not a party one. All honourable members must agree that the huge expense involved in calling together a Convention, and in eventually taking a special referendum, should be obviated. The Constitution must be amended. should not have to submit to be governed by decisions of the High Court. A t present the Parliamentary Accounts Committee is investigating the sugar question. When its report comes to hand it will be found that the Committee had not the power to secure complete information from the Colonial Sugar Befining Company. It will be learned that witnesses representing that company declined to give information. There is no power under the Constitution, according to a decision of the High Court, which can compel those witnesses to do so.

If referenda are not taken at the forthcoming elections, a special election of delegates to the Convention will be entailed, at a cost of, probably, £100,000, and if its proposed amendments are subsequently submitted by Parliament to the people by means of a special referendum, another £100,000 If that course is adopted the will be involved.

If the Prime Minister will state the intentions of the Government in this regard we shall know exactly where we are. ister) [11.46] -Despit e a little superficial criticism, there has been a surprisI who urged amendments upon this Parliaing unanimity in regard to this motion, and it is most refreshing to find honourable members at this stage in the history of the present Parliament so full of recognition of the Government's wisdom and foresight in this matter. A number of questions have been put to me about the date of an election of some sort. My acousticon is not working very well this morning, but I think "" election "" is thc word that was used. That information I am not able to supply. Honourable members have told me their own views upon this matter; as to my own, I say frankly that I have, and always had, a rooted objection to elections. Bub in regard to this matter one is only as a cork tossed in a maelstrom. What can one poor man like myself do when this Parliament has taken the bit in its teeth, as I understand it has done? I was disappointed with the speech of ton), who said that "" The sooner we have an election the better."" The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) also said, ""The sooner we go before the people the better."" I am quite overwhelmed by these opinions. against the united wisdom of all parties manifested in this way? If honourable members are determined to go to the country, let them go; I will not attempt to stop them. That is that. As to the proposed amendments of the Constitution I must say that I am a little amused at this newborn zeal on the part of some honourable members. Weeks ber who interjects said that because we and weeks have passed during which we did not bludgeon things through, behavo dealt with everything under the sun, cause having a great power we did not use in the bowels of the earth, and in the depths of hell, and in all that time there has not been one mention of the Constituof a million pounds. tion. Suddenlyi t is discovered that thc Constitution goes to the very foundation of our political being, and that amendments are urgently necessary. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), who usually treats the House to portentous deliverances about finance and its vast importance, now says that nothing is worth a snap of the fingers in comparison with these alterations of the Constitution in regard to which he has been silent almost, I believe, since a time beyond which the memory of man does not go. I am the man who should talk about the amendment of the Constitution, for it was ment and upon the reluctant and conservative factious sitting in opposition. But all my efforts were in vain. The people persisted in rejecting the amendments I pressed upon them. It comes as a shock to me, therefore, that the stone then rejected by the builders has now become the corner stone of the temple. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Mcwilliams) said, "" If it is to be done it should be done now."" What should bo done? I would like to see the amendment of the Constitution for which the honourable member would dare to vote, and I would like to see that amendment put before the Leader of the Opposition, and made acceptable to him also. A nice kind of hotchpotch it wonld be. However, I do not intend to say anything about this matter. To be perfectly in order, my remarks must be confined to the motion. It is that the House shall meet on Tuesdays. Time to deliberate is what we want. I agree with the honourable member for Balaclava that we should not rush through the Budget discussion. We should have time to discuss it. Honourable members What can I da will have time, but they must attend here; they must not waste time.

This motion precedes a proposed amendment of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation.) Act 1921. The experience gained by the Government and the Tariff Board, whose duty it is to advise the Government in regard to the working of the Act shows that certain amendments are vitally necessary. When the Industries Preservation Act was introduced last year, the House was told that there was no precedent for such legislation, and that there must be a good deal of experimentation about it, because it was impossible to gauge the trade vicissitudes that were ahead at a time when the world was receding from five years of great upheaval, during which all economic laws and normal conditions had been set aside. By general acclaim, the Commonwealth has adopted a policy of Tariff Protection for Mr Rodgers. its industries, and it was felt that the Protection afforded by the Customs Tariff, if unsupported, would be of little avail, owing to the economic conditions obtaining in certain countries, and the depreciation in the exchange value of the currencies of those countries, which gave-to their manufacturers a tremendous advantage in the cost of production. Accordingly, the Industries Preservation Act, which was passed in December of last year, was an attempt to maintain our lian industries. At that time, exchange was nearer to normal than it is to-day. When the Act was passed, the mark had depreciated from 20 to 240 to the £ 1 sterling, but to-day it is quoted at 7,025 to the £ 1 sterling. sider that that gives an advantage to German manufacturers? mists in the world are perplexed in regard to the question. The advisers of the Government in this matter are the members of the Tariff Board, who have had a wide experience in trading and commercial circles, and command the respect of the Australian trading and commercial community and producing interests. Having had the opportunity of conferring with the Australian business world, and of visiting most of the capital cities of the Commonwealth, and many provincial centres, they have learnt a great deal of the working of the Act, and have gathered information concerning the economic conditions of countries which have a depreciated currency, and as a result of their experience, and of the information they have thus gained, they have submitted recommendations to the Government for amendments of the main measure. It will simplify the position if I read their report, which is dated 2*nd August, 1922. It is as follows:In a separate memorandum submitted herewith under the heading "" Protection of Australian Industries-Proposed Amendment to Section 154 of the Customs Act,"" the Tariff Board has submitted proposed amendments to the Customs Act. In the course of the inquiries which gave rise to the submission of that report there came under the notice of the Board the necessity to also amend the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921, to insure that the intended effect of that Act shall be achieved.",22,Customs Tabiff Industries Preservation Bill
65,Mr Jowett,Does the Minister con,23,Customs Tabiff Industries Preservation Bill
66,Mr Rodgers,"The greatest econo-2. The Board wishes to particularly emphasize the fact that in the unanimous opinion of its members it w ill 'be necessary that effect be given to both the recommendations hereinafter made, and the recommendations for tlie amendment of the Customs Act. Neither the amendment to the dumping provisions, nor tlie amendment to the Customs Act alone, w ill give sufficient power to adequately protect Australian industries. Explanation 3. Section 5: Sub-section 4 of section 5 reads:"" In this section ' a reasonable price' means such a price as represents thc cost of production of the goods, plus five per centum, plus free on board charges."" 4. In the opinion of the Board, this proposal w ill not provide a reasonable price. The evidence obtained on every hand is that the proposal to add only 5 per cent, to the cost of production of the goods w ill make the protection in this section of no value whatever. The Board, after closely investigating the matter, agrees with the representations made, and recommends that the Board should have power to f i x a .reasonable addition, but that the maximum addition be fixed in the Act at 20 per cent. It is considered that .the present provision unduly favours oversea exporters, and is entirely opposed to the interests of local manufacturers. 5. Section G: Sub-section 4 of section 6 reads:"" In this section ' a reasonable selling p r i c e ' means the price ascertained upon the following basis, namely:-To the fair .market value of the goods there shall be added the freight, insurance, landing, and other charges, together w i th the amount of duty payable under the Customs Tariff, together w i th five per centum on the aggregate of all tbe items mentioned."" ' G. The Board recommends that instead of 5 per centum in the sub-section there be inserted a provision allowing the addition of a percentage to be fixed by the Tariff Board, but not to exceed 15 per cent. It is difficult to state the definite rate which should be applied, but the Board is satisfied as tlie result of careful investigation that 5 per cent, is wholly insufficient. The reason why 15 per cent, is recommended in this instance as against 20 per cent, in the preceding section is that the percentage in this case is added to the fair market value, plus freight and charges, whereas in the preceding section the 20 per cent, is added to the cost of production only. 7. In ' sub-section 5 of section 6 "" 5 per cengian currencies) or 240 marks to the £1 (i.e. tum "" is again mentioned in two places. In conformity with the recommendation to amend section 5 (4) the Board recommends that this be altered to provide for an addition determined by the Board, but_ not to exceed 20 per centum. In this case it is the cost of production, which has to be plussed up, and the figure recommended is, therefore, consistent with the previous recommendation. 8. Section 8: Owing to the rapid depreciation of the currency of some European Continental countries since this Act was dealt with , the present provision of a maximum of 75 per cent, is altogether insufficient to meet the competition likely to arise from such countries, and, further, the Board considers it would be practically impossible to accurately arrange a series of advances on the present maximum to meet tbe present position of the exchanges. 9. The effect of such wholesale depreciation cannot be properly estimated, and it appears to the Board that it would be better to arrange for a method of protection' similar to that to the Proposed Amendments. laid down in section 9. If such a course were followed, the penalty duty would be imposed on the difference between(a) the landed cost in warehouse in Australia (including duty calculated in accordance w i th the provisions of the Customs Act 1901-1920), plus a percentage of profit to be determined by the Board, and (b) the Australian wholesale price of similar goods of Australian manufacture. The ordinary Tariff duty would then be imposed, in addition to this penalty duty, and would be calculated on a sum equal to the value for duty under the Customs Act, plus the penalty duty. It w ill be necessary to insert a clause providing for this. 10. This provision will, of course, only be effective when goods are dutiable according to value. As importations may come under notice of goods subject to specific duties (that is, so much per ton, per gallon, or per pound) it w ill be necessary to insert a clause securing an equal protection to such goods as would be afforded to ad val. goods. 11. It should be pointed out that the protection at present afforded in section 9 to B r i tish goods is greater than that afforded under section 8 to Australian goods. 12. The Board, whilst recognising that Parliament has endeavoured to give adequate protection to British industries under this Act, cannot believe that it was the intention of Parliament to give greater protection to goods the produce of the United Kingdom than to goods manufactured in Australia, but the depreciation of the currencies since the Act was, passed has brought that position about. 13. In view of the very unsettled state of the exchanges, and of the uncertainty as to the effect they w ill have on the selling price of goods, the Board considers that the better course would be to adopt a similar provision in section 8 to that followed in section 9, and accordingly recommends that, when the figure denoting the rate of exchange is greater than 300 francs to the £1 (i.e. for French or Belfor German currency) or relatively for other currencies, provision should be made for a penalty duty on the lines suggested in paragraph 9 above. 14. Section 9: The amount of dumping duty under this section is at present provided for in sub-section 3 as follows:""The amount of the dumping preference duty in each case shall be the sum which represents the difference between the f a i r market value in the United Kingdom and the export price."" 15. It is rcommended that this section should remain as printed, but that an addition should be made of the following words:"" Notwithstanding anything contained in the Customs Act 1001-1022, the value for duty of goods dealt with under this section shall be thc value as ascertained in accordance with that section, plus the penalty duty under this section."" 16. If this amendment is not made, the benefits of the British Preferential Tariff rate will tend that they would be entitled to the be insufficient to equalize the advantage that the, say, German goods will derive from paying duty only on the value for duty, as provided in the present law. It will be clear that the ordinary duty should be calculated on the value after it has been brought up to the British level. 17. Section II : Owing to an oversight, the word ""two,"" appearing in the second line of this section was not altered when section 9 was Inserted. It is necessary, therefore, to delete the word ""two,"" and in its place insert the word "" three"". ' IS. Section 12: This section reads as follows:"" The various duties imposed by this Act shall be separately charged, notwithstanding that more duties than one may apply to any particular goods; Provided that the duty payable on any particular goods under sections 4 to 7 inclusive of this Act shall not either severally or collectively exceed 15 per centum of the value for duty of the goods, as ascertained in accordance with Division2 of Part VIII . of the Customs Act 19011920."" 19. The Board very strongly urges that the proviso (i.e., the second paragraph) be deleted. 20. It has been repeatedly suggested that certain dumping is likely to take place, which should be dealt with under section 4 of the Act. In every instance it was shown that the 15 per cent, would he wholly insufficient to meet principal Act would do in j u r y to Austhe needs of local industries, and would be far below the difference between the fair market , value of the goods at the time of shipment and the export price. 21. The Board considers it only reasonable that, should deliberate dumping take place, the penalty should provide that Australian industries should be protected to the full extent of the value involved. It will bo readily understood that exporters desiring to defeat the provisions of section 4 will reduce their dumping difference to more than 15 per cent., when they will immediately have the local market at their mercy. 22. it i recommended that the following 3 proviso be added to section 12, in lieu of the paragraph deleted:"" Provided that, where duty has been imthere is no unjust competition? posed under section 8 or section 9 of. this Act upon any particular goods, duty shall not be imposed upon those goods under the other of those sections."" Although the wording of sections 8 and 9 might be considered at present to indicate that the two sections are not to be applied to the same goods, it is possible that section 12 .might sugMr Rodgers. gest the opposite intention. The proviso is, therefore, suggested to remove any possible doubt. Mr ""WATT -What would be the effect if that proviso were substituted for the existing one, seeing that no maximum would be provided? accumulated effect of the protection afforded in sections 8 and 9-that is to say, to the benefit of the Australian protection plus the British protection. But that was never intended, and the proposed amendment w ill make the position perfectly clear in that respect. I cannot expect the Committee to follow quite clearly the effect of the proposed amendments offhand, and as this is a busiuess measure, with definite business provisions, I think that I should afford honourable members an opportunity over the week-end of studying the main measure and the effect of the proposed amendments, and of perusing the Tariff Board's recommendations. have to be determined' by the Tariff Board be determined in respect of each particular line?

If the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, that goods produced or manufactured outside Australia have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry, the Minister may publish a notice in the Gazette specifying the goods as to which he is so satisfied. 2. Upon the publication of the notice, there shall be charged, collected, and paid to thc use of the King for the purposes of the Commonwealth, on those goods imported into Australia, a special duty (in this section referred to as ""the dumping below cost duty""). 3. The amount of the dumping below cost duty in each case shall be the sum which represents the difference between a reasonable price of the goods at the time of shipment. and the export price of the goods. 4. In this section, "" a reasonable price"" means such a price as represents the cost of production of the goods, plus five per centum, plus free on board charges. It is proposed to omit from sub-section 4 the words "" five per centum,"" and to substitute for them the words "" such addition, not exceeding twenty per centum, as is determined by the Tariff Board.""

Section6 is to be similarly amended. Then we come to section 8, which provides the main protection for Australian industry. That section reads1. If the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, that the exchange value of the currency of the country of origin or export of any goods has depreciated, and that by reason of such depreciation goods have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at prices whicli will be detrimental to an Australian industry, the Minister may publish a notice in the Gazette specifying the country as to the exchange value of the currency of which he is so satisfied, and the goods originated in or exported from that country to which, in his opinion, thc provisions of this section should apply. 2. Upon the publication of thc notice, there shall be charged, collected, and paid to the use of the King, for the purposes of the Commonwealth, on all goods specified in the notice, produced or manufactured in or exported from the country specified therein, a spejial duty, at a rate to be ascertained in accordance with thc schedule. The schedule provides a penalty duty in. the case of the mark up to 75 per cent, on a depreciation of 240 to the £ 1 . A t the time when that penalty was agreed to, the value of the mark was less than 240 to the £ 1 . On to-day's quotation, it stands at 7,025 to the £ 1 .

In his statement he showed that he had got into touch with the producing costs at the other side of the world; and naturally those who desire to do business will not take what might be called chance risks of the loss of money, but will, through their principals, ascertain all the facts in regard to the producing costs. gone further, and have sent men throughout the Continent on a special mission to find what they can buy. have told those concerned not to ask me to interpret what penalty willi be imposed, but to ascertain the economic conditions in the exporting country. That applies not only to one country, but to many with depreciated currencies. Nothing would delight the world better than to see a stabilizing of the world's exchanges. It would be preferable if Australia had not to introduce measures of this description, though I am afraid we are a long way from that happy state. Not many men have made endeavours in thi9 direction more than Lloyd George, and he presents a worthy spectacle in his negotiations to establish . a new working Honourable members basis in Central Europe for a "" down and out world."" Nothing would please me more than to see the stabilizing of exchanges, and, as I say, no necessity for measures of this kind. But we are faced by present conditions, and we should be recreant to our duty if we allowed the national policy of this country to be practically wiped out by economic conditions over which we have little control at this end. It is for that reason that the Tariff Board, with the experience gained up to date, say that important changes are stiU necessary. At present we have difficulty, not only with countries with depreciated currencies, but with countries with appreciated currencies. RecentlyI was requested by a body of primary producers to impose absolute prohibition against the entry into Australia of certain primary products from a country with an appreciated currency.

This is a flattering result of our national policy of Protection, inasmuch as itmeans bringing to our shores the brains, enterprise, capital, and skill of captains of industry. and industries will follow ! tect the industries that are now here, and there never was a time when we were more called upon to do so. I now come to paragraph 7 of the resolution. A t the present time the actual working effect of the Act is that the penalty duty is limited to 75 per cent, ad valorem on the goods imported. Under the proposed alteration, the siame principle or protection will be applied to Australian in thereby reduced. dustries as is applied in the parent Act to industries of the UnitedK in g d o m ; that is, the penalty duty is to equal the difference between the home consumption price in Germany and the home consumption price in Britain. The new proposal is that a similar penalty shall apply to Australia. It has been found. that 75 per cent., w i th a depreciated currency of 240 marks in the £ 1 , as provided in the main Act, is not effective protection when the mark has reached 7,025 in the £ 1 . We, principle I have indicated, not only to the mark, but to the currencies of all countries where the depreciation exceeds that set out in the schedule to the Act. Let me give an illustration, taking as a unit goods valued at £100. must be added f.ob. charges, freight, insurance and exchanges, ordinary duty, and estimated profit not to exceed 20 per cent. In such a case tbe penalty duty will be the difference between the total of those charges, and the Australian wholesale price. It is, of course, somewhat difficult for honourable members to follow figures of this description, and, therefore, I propose to put the case in another way, taking the same u n it of goods, valued at £100. We take the export selling price in the country of export at £ 1 0 0 , and to that we add the approximate charges of f.o.b., £ 5 ; freight £ 1 0 ; insurance, exchange, & c , £ 2 ; duty £ 5 0 ; and the trade profit^ of a maximum of 20 per cent., thus making a total of £187. W it h the Australian wholesale price for the same article at £200, the penalty duty w ill be the difference between £187 and £200, or £13. got to do with it ? depreciation of exchange must result in the importer paying fewer pounds sterling to meet the charge which is based on value in German marks. If depreciation is not a factor, it w ill not be present in the calculation. Unless there be an economic advantage by depreciation, it is clear that there w ill not be much to pay in dumping duty. As the German or any other depreciated currency improves and becomes normal, this measure becomes inoperative in regard to it-the Act is operative only so long as depreciation exists, and so long as export prices are Section9 of the principal Act is amended by the proposed addition of the following sub-sectionNotwithstanding anything contained in the Customs Act 1901-1920, the value for duty under that Act of goods dutiable under section 9 of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921 shall be the value ascertained in accordance with tbe Customs Act 1901-1920 plus the dumping preference duty imposed under section 9 of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921. This country has declared a policy of pretherefore, . propose to apply thc ference in regard to the good's of the United Kingdom, and, as the Act stands, there is a danger of the preference not being maintained if the penalty is i m posed only upon the difference between the current export price, say in the case To that of Germany, and the home consumption price in Britain. It is now proposed to add the amount of the dumping duty to the ordinary value for duty of the goods, and thus maintain a margin of preference to the United Kingdom. you start the price the goods are sold at in the country of origin ? wrong about that?",27,Customs Tabiff Industries Preservation Bill

Australian industry cannot live against such competition. means selling at a price less than cost. only covers what may be called dumping, but also seeks to protect us against depreciation and exchange. I shall, as promised, give honourable members an opportunity over the week-end to examine the report of the Tariff Board, and to study the terms of the motion which I have submitted. Section 11 is proposed to be amended formally. It has to do w it h evasion of duty, and the intention is that -its provisions shall cover the imposition of duty by any of the preceding three sections rather than of the "" last two preceding sections.""' It is proposed to omit the proviso to section 12, which has to do with the duties to be collected separately, and to insert a new proviso, as follows: Provided that, where duty has been imposed, under section 8 or section 9 of this Act, upon prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the any particular goods, duty shall not be imposed upon those goods under the other of those sections. I repeat that the view has been held that penalties might possibly be imposed cumulatively. Such, however, is not intended. A manufacturer must take advantage either of the protection afforded to British manufacturers or of that given to Australian manufacturers of similar goods; he may not avail himself of both. He cannot have them in their cumulative effect. The manufacturer's application will require to be in respect either of the British or of the Australian protection. Previously, these differed in principle; it is now proposed to make the principle uniform, where the depreciation of currency is greater than that set out in the principal if you then find Statute. The local manufacturer, and the importer also, will now know the basis upon which the provisions of the Act w ill be applied. I have already mentioned that the Government did not fear any great immediate inrush of goods to this country. That attitude has been borne out by experience. It would be very wrong, however, to expose manufacturers and business men generally to the possibility of a flood of foreign products setting in . Were we to take the risk of permittin g matters to stand as they are todav, there might be a sudden recovery of trade, some unexpected surge of business, the effect of which would be to wipe out certain of our industries at a time when Parliament was not in session. It becomes necessary, therefore, that the B ill should be passed into law forthwith. The Government will seek to amend the CustomsA c t so that the whole situation may be considerably strengthened by the provision of necessary legislative machinery should necessity arise for its operation.

117,"B I L L Presented By Mr Groom, And","This Bill proposes a few small alterations in the method by which elections can be conducted, but most of all it deals with a new method of electing the Senate, and it is to that principally I intend to address myself. There have been several alterations in the method of electing senators, and apparently each one has produced a result less satisfactory than its predecessor from thc point of view of the public. There is no doubt that if alterations are to be continually made, thc Senate will ultimately commit hari-kari, and the public will declare that, as the characteristics of the Chamber are not what the founders of Federation intended, as the Chamber has become merely a replica of the party character of the House of Representatives, as it has no power and is not performing any necessary function, it would be better to abolish it altoso that there may be ample time before gether. Other matters dealt with in the B ill include the deposit by candidates. I think that the deposit to be made by a senatorial candidate should be dealt with liberally. canvass the whole of a State must necessarily incur a great deal of expense, and the possibility of being mulct for not polling a certain proportion of the total number of votes cast deters many people from submitting their names to the electors. With regard to postal voting, the suggested amendment will restrict to some degree the present system. I would like some liberality to be shown, especially to aged people and those living far outback. Many of them are not able to avail themselves of even the present method of postal voting. with by the Bill is the secrecy of the ballot. I should like a little more definite information from the Minister as to how far the secrecy of the ballot will be secured by this new provision. that I propose to drop the. numbering clauses for the present. hear that. The main purpose of the Bill is to remodel the method of electing senators, and the alteration suggested is the adoption of the old American ticket system of grouping candidates according to the parties to which they belong. That involves a very radical departure from any previous system in operation in Australia. I do not think that the proper time for the consideration of an electoral alteration of that character is immediately before an election, when it is difficult, indeed, to give the amendment that impartial consideration which all matters affecting the electoral laws should have. On the last occasion when an alteration was made in connection with senatorial voting exactly the same procedure was followed. The Bill was brought down a short time before the House was dissolved, and without adequate consideration was rushed into law. l i we are to have continual alterations in the method of electing senators, changes which apparently will only unsettle the public mind and make it more difficult to procure an intelligent vote, the proper time to do so is in the middle of a Parliament, the elections for the alteration to sink into the minds of the electors, and for the various party organizations to get busy in instructing their supporters as to how tlie new machinery must be A candidate who intends to worked. At the last election there were in New South Wales alone 67,000 informal votes due largely to the fact that there was too little time in which to acquaint the public of the alteration in the .method of voting. That some alteration is necessary in connection with the election of the Senate everybody will, agree. That body is not performing the functions which it was intended to perform by the founders of Federation. Never at any time has it had the characteristics of a States House except in its form. It certainly has never acted as a The third matter dealt States House. It has become a party House, and the proposed system of grouping will intensify its party character to such an extent as to nullify uhe spirit of the Constitution. made more of a party House than it is at the present time. present time the Labour party has two representatives in the Senate, but the proposed system may mean the election of a Senate comprising thirty-six members of one party. The present condition of affairs is recognised by everybody throughout Australia to be ludicrous, but it is a good thing that it has been brought",29,Groom

A t theabout. yielded a Senate comprising thirty-one members of one party and five of another, was bad enough, but when the composition was altered to thirty-five of one party and one of another, and now thirtyfour and two respectively, a condition of affairs was created which does not commend itself to the public. In my opinion the object of this proposed legislation is to consolidate the position which has been created, and to insure that the oneparty character of the Senate should be perpetuated. Of course, if the pendulum should swing to the other extreme there would be just a reversal of the present party representation. These amendments, if carried, will entrench the party machine more firmly in the position it has already obtained. encourage the system of pre-selection whioh was recently decried by the National Federation of Victoria, and which a prominent Labour man in Sydney said was provocative of nearly all the trouble that arose in connection with elections. party is quite harmonious on the subject of elections. Wales, every man who is endorsed by the Country party may run as a candidate. We ran twelve men for one seat, and as many men as choose to offer themselves can contest any seat so long as they subscribe to the party's platform. That is one step towards a cleaning up of the party machine, and giving an opportunity to the public to say who should be returned to Parliament instead of their representatives being selected beforehand by cliques and coteries. system, proposed by the Government will not merely intensify the evils of the party system, but will practically insure that a block vote will be given for candidates. .That must have a deleterious effect upon the public life of the Commonwealth, and lower the calibre of the men returned to the Senate. Our object should be to return to Parliament men who have some claimto distinction or attainment. The -proposed system will merely accelerate the present vicious method by which any .men who are endorsed by a party, no matter how obscure or lacking in qualifications they may be, will be able to be returned to Parliament because they have The previous election, which a solid party vote behind them. The tendency of a party, too, will always be to look for men whose names begin with some letter of the alphabet before M "" in order to insure that its candidates are near the head of the ballot-paper, thus getting a better chance of securing the No. 1 votes. Anybody with a name such as I have will be relegated to the ranks of the independents. There will be a general rush on the part of prospective candidates to change their names to others commencing with A , B, or C. The Senate should not be a mere resting place for men elected in the way I have stated, and whose qualifications are only that they stand well with the party machine. As far as possible the Senate should be a non-party House and a House This grouping will tend to of review, and I think the public are getting thoroughly sick of the existing condition of affairs. In the United States of America, which has a Constitution similar to our own, the Senate, instead of having depreciated in importance, has gradually become probably the most important factor in American public life. directly representative of the States. the system of electing senators there differs from ours; but at the beginning the Senate itself started under handicaps similar to those in Australia, and until the year 1825 there was a constant fight, in which the Senate was sometimes the loser and sometimes the winner, between the two Houses as to which was to have the bigger say on certain matters of public policy. Since 1825 it has been universally admitted that the intellectual The leadership of the United States of America has passed into the hand of the Senate. That body is regarded as a place where intellectual experience is conserved, and the tendency is for men who spend, one or two terms in the House of Representatives to seek a senatorial place as the blue ribbon of Federal politics in America. Herei n -Australia, however, we find senators seeking, as the honourable -member for Parramatta ( Mr Pratten) has done, to leave the Senate and come -into, the hurly-burly of the House of Representatives. for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best), and",30,Groom

127,Mr Watt,"The honourable membersBoothby( Mr Story) and Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) were also formerly senators. . rently regard the securing of a seat in the House of Representatives as a step upwards, instead of downwards, and this is due in a very large degree to the method adopted in the past for selecting and electing candidates for the Senate. The block system under which the elector's choice is indicated by crosses, as was the case before the last election, or by numbers, under the bastard preferential system in use at the last election, has not tended to give the best results. posite system ? used is applicable so long as Mr Speaker does not object to it . A method by which better results could be obtained, and under which the Senate could be made more thoroughly representative of all classes of the people, and be given a better non-party complexion and flavour, would be to adopt the proportional system of voting for the election of candidates. That system could hardly be adopted while the Government are hanging hard and fast to the principle of grouping candidates; but it would be well for us to apply the machinery for proportional representation and leave the candidates absolutely free in the places they have occupied on the ballot-papers in the past. I suppose that, roughly, 50 per cent, of the people are not in any political party, We have found from our experience that the votes of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, of the electors sway any Senate election. As a matter of fact, the character of the Senate has been determined by 3 per cent, or 4 per cent., and, in some cases, even less than 1 per cent., of the total number of electors voting, and the effect of the action of a small number of individuals has been to deprive huge minorities of representation in the Senate. That was the case at the last Senate election. The first preference votes were cast for the New South Wales Senate candidates at bhe last election as follows: Cox Duncan Garling Falkiner Gardiner Grant McDougall £3,981. . Despite the fact that he secured about 46 per cent, of the total of first preference votes, it waa practically by a chance that Senator Gardiner was finally elected. that his name was mistaken for that of Senator Garling. surprising if that were the case, and that just by pure accident a proper result accrued. It would have been most ridiculous to have a Chamber of review in which the whole of the members were representatives of 'one party. ridiculous if the people were of that view t all of that view. I have shown that there were 46 per cent, the other way, and yet they might have had no say at all. It is bad for a country to have only one party represented in its legislative halls. The very essence of representative government is that all sections of the community should have their spokesmen in Parliament. The very fact that they are given that opportunity, although they are sometimes represented in fairly small minorities, makes the public of all British speaking countries accept defeats at the poll w it h good grace, and without any feeling of resentment, and enables parliamentary government to be carried on. But if we are to perpetuate the present system and make it more difficult to change, as will be the case if the new proposals of the Ministry be adopted, we shall be taking a retrograde step, and one which must ultimately lead to the abolition of bi-cameral government in this Parliament as we know it at this time. In order to allow honourable members to express an opinion on the point, I propose to submit amendments in Committee to delete clauses 10, 11, and 31, and insert new clauses' to provide for the adoption of the machinery of proportional representation designed on the lines which are regarded as the best in use at the present time.

There is no doubt some advantage in being in the first position on the ballot paper, and that applies not only to groups but to individuals. Then there is a disadvantage in the alphabetical arrangement, and it seems to me a great pity that some other device, something in the nature of a round-robin, could not be adopted. The whole of our political l if e seems to tend towards grouping, b u t when there are only three seats to be filled, we never find a party desiring to put forward four men. The Conservatives of Australia may be divided into the Country party and the National party, but we know that they are all one, and t h at if they are put into separate groups the destination of the second votes is inevitable.

And this is what it seems to me it does involve: It introduces in a more cohesive, definite, and tyrannical way the power of the party machine. I do not care much, in discussing this matter, whether the machine be that of the Labour party, the Country party, the Nationalists, or any other party. I believe that party organization has a f a i r and special use in the public life of a democratic community like this, but its exhibition and operation ought to have a very definite end and limitation. That is to say, a. party machine may be useful if worked without coercion on independent candidates or electors, but it may be the very reverse, and, in fact, dangerous or ruinous, if used beyond reasonable limits.

I am entirely in sympathy with the amendment of which the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) has given notice, in the direction of so shaping this Bill that the present system of electing senators may be replaced by a system of proportional representation.

With thei additional appropriation recommended by His Excellency the Deputy of the Governor General, the purpose which the Government have in view in order to meet the case put forward by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) will be effected by making the amendments which the Senate have requested. The object is to extend the period for the export of meat to Eastern ports, as prescribed by regulation. The amount of bounty payable will not be substantially increased, but the amendments will permit of the storage in Australia until the end of March next of meat intended for the East, to which, owing to the limited cold-store accommodation available, it is impossible to forward sufficient quantities to fulfil the very satisfactory contracts entered into by Australian exporters. Without this extension a refund would have to be made to the Commonwealth of the amount of the subsidy paid on any meat now placed in cool chambers, but not exported until after the 31st December next. Tho Government pay the subsidy to the cattle-owner or exporter, as the case may be, when the meat is placed in cold storage and is approved of as suitable for export; and under this B ill , as it left this House, ' if meat upon which subsidy has been paid is not exported beFore the end of December next, we rerequired a. refund of the amount of the subsidy as paid. The amendments now sought to be made extend the period in which the meat can be exported to the East, but not elsewhere. The purpose is to hold and extend the Australian meat export trade to the East. I have no objection io the proposed fore, I take this opportunity of 'saying amendments, but the explanation given that I am absolutely against the principle by the Minister( Mr Rodgers) puts the of paying this bounty. It is unnecessary position somewhat differently from what for me to go over the old grounds again, we understood it to be when the matter even if I were permitted to do so, but I was previously discussed in this Chamber. In answer to a question submitted by me, the Minister said that the extension of the period which was sought by the Jowett) would not increase the cost, but ing that the cost will not be substantially extended. I was under the impression that the meat had to be killed and stored, and that the exporters would be obliged to delay the shipment of it until it was required in the East, and that their difficulty was that if they did not export it before the end of December next they would be obliged to refund whatever they had got by way of subsidy on account of the meat remaining unshipped. rect. satisfied, but the Minister said that the effect of the amendments would not substantially increase the amount of sub : sidy. the amount of subsidy, but will decrease the amount that would have to be refunded. the amendments is to facilitate the efforts of those who have contracts with the East to get their beef away, I have nothing to say against the amendments; but as the beef must be killed before the end of October, I cannot see how the amount to be paid by the Government will be substantially increased. will benefit by the amendment is chat which is killed between the 15th April and the 31st October. have already decided to do. air.
